<p>“You can fill me in on all the details later. Write up a report about everything that happened over there and all the things you brought back.”</p>
<p>“O-of course. I’ll get started at once.”</p>
<p>“Also, there’s something you should know. As far as the situation with Number 666 goes…”</p>

<p class="space-break0">Akane wakes up in a white room.</p>
<p>She feels good. Really good. Her heart is calm, and she can’t remember the last time she woke up feeling so refreshed.</p>
<p>“Where am I…?”</p>
<p>She looks around the room.</p>
<p>At first, she thinks she’s in one of the university’s labs, but the equipment here is too primitive for that.</p>
<p>“I can’t…I can’t read anything.”</p>
<p>There’s something written on the wall, but she doesn’t even recognize what language it’s in.</p>
<p>“What happened to me back there…?”</p>
<p>Akane remembers everything.</p>
<p>She remembers her sins, she remembers accepting death, she remembers the gentle light and his voice enveloping her at the end—everything.</p>
<p>Her heart is calm enough now to accept things as they are.</p>
<p>“…I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>The apology is directed at those she wronged.</p>
<p>Dr. Yuuka, the people of Arcadia… All of them died by her hands.</p>
<p>Her brother might have been the one who started it all, but the way she sees it, it was her own weakness that exacerbated the damage.</p>
<p>She’s wanted to come to terms with the past for so long, but she’s never had the strength to do so.</p>
<p>Now, however, she does.</p>
<p>“That was you, Minoru…wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>His was the voice she heard. She’s sure of it.</p>
<p>“I know you survived. You never change, do you…?”</p>
<p>A single tear trickles down from the corner of her eye.</p>
<p>If he’s still alive, then she can be strong.</p>
<p>“Wait for me, Minoru. I…I killed a lot of people, but I’m going to save so many more. So please, just wait for me to finish atoning…”</p>
<p>And with that, golden particles begin drifting around her.</p>
