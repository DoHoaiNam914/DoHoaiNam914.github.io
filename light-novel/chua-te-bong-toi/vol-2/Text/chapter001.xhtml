<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter001">To Lindwurm, the Sacred Land!</a></h1>
<p class="noindent">It all started when Alpha sent me a letter that was only a sentence long.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Come to the Sacred Land if you’re bored.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">End of message.</p>
<p>Summer vacation had started early on account of the fire damage at the academy, which meant I didn’t have all that much going on. Based on experience, I’ve found that taking Alpha up on her invitations leads to all sorts of fun times. The day after I got the letter, I set out for the destination.</p>
<p>Lindwurm, the Sacred Land. I’ve actually been there once before. It’s one of the holy sites in Divine Teachings, the most popular religion in the world. Their shtick is that the Goddess Beatrix blessed the heroes with strength and that she’s the one true deity.</p>
<p>Anyway, it takes about four days to get from the academy to the Sacred Land by carriage. They’re both in Midgar, so it’s relatively close.</p>
<p>I hem and haw for a little while: Should I travel there by carriage like a background character or just sprint there? I eventually settle on dutifully playing my role and using a carriage. “One must always be conscious of these things,” I tell myself, putting on an affected air of superiority.</p>
<p>If only I could go back in time and punch myself.</p>
<p>I should’ve just run. If I had just dashed there during the night, I would’ve made it in no time.</p>
<p>But because I didn’t, I find myself sharing a carriage with our student council president, Rose Oriana.</p>
<p>The carriage is classy and spacious for just the two of us. After I made <a id="page-6"></a>my way to a rest stop in my cheap-ass carriage, I bumped into her by chance, at which point she invited me to join her.</p>
<p>I swiftly turned her down.</p>
<p>But I’m no match for royalty. When all was said and done, we ended up riding to the Sacred Land together.</p>
<p>According to Rose, there’s some event going on there called the Goddess’s Trial, and she’s been invited as a special guest.</p>
<p>As I listen to Rose’s explanation, I realize Alpha must have asked me to come so we could watch this thing together.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, though, I stop being able to make heads or tails of Rose’s monologue.</p>
<p>“It would have been a tragedy to lose a young man with as gallant a spirit as yours in that incident, Cid,” she says with a gentle smile.</p>
<p>I have a number of rebuttals to this statement: I’m just a nobody, so I’m certainly not gallant, and when exactly did she stop calling me by my full name? Well, at least this part still makes sense.</p>
<p>“When I found out you’d survived, I could sense it was destiny at work. We can only talk about this because the world has granted us its blessing.”</p>
<p>This is the part where it stops making sense. First of all, I don’t believe in “destiny,” and I have no idea what a “blessing” even is. If you ask me, I’d just as soon flip the world the bird.</p>
<p>“Our path together will no doubt be paved with thorns. Nobody will give us their blessing, and nobody will recognize us for who we are.”</p>
<p>You literally just said the world has given you its blessing.</p>
<p>“But it’s said that, after receiving the goddess’s power, the heroes of legend were granted wealth and renown from the people and went on to marry princesses of major kingdoms. So though the path may be harsh and trying, I believe a happy future is waiting at its end.”</p>
<p>Is this what they preach in the Holy Teachings or something? Bringing up the outliers of society—read: heroes—to push their agenda sounds super-churchy.</p>
<p>“Completing this Goddess’s Trial will mean taking one more step down that thorny road. Afterward, I’ll be able to regale my father with tales of a gallant young man.”</p>
<p>The young man who’s gonna clear the Goddess’s Trial sounds like a lucky guy.</p>
<p><a id="page-7"></a>“The two of us can travel down that treacherous path one step at a time. Each pace we advance will only serve to deepen our love.”</p>
<p>Oh, so like a three-legged race. The spirit of mutual cooperation, huh? That totally sounds like something the Holy Teachings would preach.</p>
<p>“We have to keep it to ourselves for now, but let’s try to make a happy future a reality.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>
<p>Rose offers me her hand, and I take it. I dunno much about religion or the teachings thereof, but if she says it’s to bring about a happy future, then I’m on board. Happiness is important, after all. My happiness is, at least.</p>
<p>As I feel Rose’s passionate gaze and slightly sweaty palms, I realize I should probably put some distance between the two of us. I certainly don’t plan on mocking her for her faith, but it’s the kind of thing where both people need to be on the same page. When all the zealots get together and go do their own thing, everyone ends up better off.</p>
<p>“Nice weather today, huh?” I say as I look out the carriage window toward the clear sky and pastoral plains.</p>
<p>When you want to steer a conversation away from a tiresome topic, talking about the weather is always a solid plan.</p>
<p>“Yes. The sun is out, and I imagine it’s quite warm outside,” replies Rose as she gazes out in kind.</p>
<p>Though the inside of the carriage is shaded, it’s still hot enough to make us sweat. The nape of Rose’s fair neck is already glistening, and her curled honey locks sway in the breeze as she narrows her pale eyes to keep out the sun.</p>
<p>For a little while, we shoot the shit, talking about stuff like school and the weather, occasionally lapsing into silence as we search for new topics to discuss.</p>
<p>There are several types of silences, which can broadly be classified into comfortable and uncomfortable ones.</p>
<p>Popular opinion has it that lulls in conversation are always unpleasant, but my take is they aren’t all that bad. After all, when you realize you’re both working in concert to continue to talk, it gives you kind of a warm tingle of satisfaction.</p>
<p>After all, there’s only two of us, and we’ve been in this carriage forever. It’s only natural for there to be pauses in the conversation. The fact that we’re working so hard to avoid that is exactly what makes it so rewarding.</p>
<p><a id="page-8"></a>After the nth pause, Rose breaks the ice.</p>
<p>The afternoon sun has almost sunk, and its light has begun taking on a vermilion hue.</p>
<p>“I suspect there were things going on behind the scenes in that incident back at the academy.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Rose turns to gaze at the distant sunset. “Those men in black calling themselves the Shadow Garden must have been in a different organization than that man named Shadow.”</p>
<p>“What makes you say that?”</p>
<p>“Their sword-fighting techniques are completely different. All the men in black were fighting with standard styles, but Shadow and the women obeying him were wielding their swords in an usual way. I’d never seen those techniques before. They must be new.”</p>
<p>“Huh.”</p>
<p>“I told all this to the Midgar Knight Order, but even though I insisted that Shadow and the group in black were fighting, the Knight Order’s public statement revealed they view the two parties as part of the same organization. None of their reasons were convincing. I’m certain there’s more going on than meets the eye.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you’re not just overthinking it?”</p>
<p>“I hope I am. If I’m not, though—if the Midgar Kingdom has the wrong enemy in mind…calamity could be on the horizon. The Oriana Kingdom has launched an investigation, but you can afford to be careful.”</p>
<p>I nod.</p>
<p>Rose smiles softly, nodding back.</p>
<p>“We should be reaching the resting town soon. I’ll have them prepare you the room next to mine.”</p>
<p>“Nah, don’t worry about it. I’ll just find some cheap place on my own.”</p>
<p>“You mustn’t. It’s dangerous out there. I’ll take care of the fee, of course, so please don’t worry about a thing.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, no, no. I couldn’t impose on you.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need for modesty.”</p>
<p>And that’s how I end up staying in a top-of-the-line room, the kind that costs three hundred thousand <em>zeni</em> a night. We go out for dinner at a classy restaurant, pick out chic outfits as we window-shop, then partake <a id="page-9"></a>in a little gambling at the casino before heading back to the inn. All of it’s fit for a king. The bed is fluffy, and the room is even a suite. It’s awesome.</p>
<p>Better yet, I don’t need to spend a single <em>zeni</em>. Maybe the ultimate kind of background character is one who leeches off their loaded friend. I guess there’s value to be found in overlooking a little bit of Bible-thumping.</p>

</div>
<p class="space-break0">We reach the Sacred Land, Lindwurm, around noon two days later.</p>
<p>Lindwurm is home to a massive church that looks like it’s been carved directly out of the mountain, and the townscape laid out below it has whitewashed buildings. The main street running through the town is swarming with tourists, and it ends in a long set of stairs leading directly to the church.</p>
<p>After eating lunch at one of our usual high-class establishments, we idly browse the street stalls as we walk down the main drag.</p>
<p>As we do, I spot a little trinket. It looks like the kind of metal key chain with a dragon wrapped around a sword that you’d find at tourist sites back in Japan. I guess some things are the same, even in other worlds. What piques my interest, though, is discovering that it’s not a dragon wrapped around the sword but some sort of sinister-looking left arm. I pick it up.</p>
<p>“Did that catch your eye?”</p>
<p>“Just a little. Why do they all have arms wrapped around them?”</p>
<p>Rose looks down at my hands. Excuse me, ma’am, but it’s a little hot for you to be pressing yourself up against my shoulder. The heat isn’t too bad at this altitude and all, but it is still summer, y’know.</p>
<p>“It’s the hero Olivier’s sword and the left arm of Diablos the demon. It’s said that the great hero cut off Diablos’s left arm and sealed it away on this very land. Up there,” says Rose, pointing up beyond the long stretch of stairs and the church at the apex. “At the top of that steep mountain are ruins called the Sanctuary, and that’s where Diablos’s left arm is sealed. Of course, it’s all just a fairy tale.” She smiles. “It’s a popular souvenir among men.”</p>
<p><a id="page-10"></a>“I’ll bet. Excuse me—could I get one of these?”</p>
<p>I buy one to take back as a gift for Skel. Three thousand <em>zeni</em> sets me back a little, but I do have the decency to pay for it myself.</p>
<p>As for Po, he gave me a list of junk he wants. It sounds like a pain, so I haven’t looked at it yet.</p>
<p>After I stuff the trinket in my pocket, we get back to wandering about. The hustle and bustle of the tourists and vendors all makes me feel kind of nostalgic.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Rose yanks on my hand.</p>
<p>“It looks like Natsume, the author, is autographing books. I’m the biggest fan!”</p>
<p>There’s a huge throng of people in front of us. It looks like they’re standing in front of a bookstore, but I don’t see a sign or anything.</p>
<p>“Would you mind if I joined the line? It might take a little while, but…” Rose looks up at me with puppy-dog eyes.</p>
<p>“Yeah, go for it. I’ll wait here.”</p>
<p>“Oh, thank you! Care to join me?”</p>
<p>“Nah, I’m good.”</p>
<p>Rose buys one of the books from the display, then goes and joins the line.</p>
<p>Left with nothing better to do, I grab one of the books and idly flip it open.</p>
<p><em>“I am a dragon. As yet, I have no name.”</em></p>
<p>Wait, this is bald-faced plagiarism.</p>
<p>No. Some literary genius must have miraculously had the exact same aesthetic sensibilities in this other world. I pull myself together and reach for another book.</p>
<p><em>Romeo and Julietta.</em></p>
<p>I take that back. Definitely theft. And it’s not the only one.</p>
<p><em>Asherella.</em></p>
<p><em>Little Crimson Riding Hood.</em></p>
<p>Some of the many books even have stories ripped from Hollywood movies, manga, and anime. At this point, it all finally clicks.</p>
<p>Someone else must have reincarnated here, too.</p>
<p>I buy a book, then get in line to get it signed by this so-called Natsume.</p>
<p>I just want to find out more about this author.</p>
<p><a id="page-11"></a>The line continues moving as I think about my approach, and before long, the author comes into view. It’s a little difficult to tell because of the hood covering her head, but it’s definitely a woman.</p>
<p>Her elegant silver hair comes down to her shoulders, framing her blue feline eyes and the beauty mark under one of them. Her blouse is open at the chest, letting her cleavage peek out.</p>
<p>“What the hell is she doing?”</p>
<p>It’s a face I know all too well. Massaging my temples, I shake my head and try to leave the line.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, sir. Where do you think you’re going?”</p>
<p>However, I’m unsuccessful. She must have seen me moments before I recognized her.</p>
<p>The line inches forward, and I eventually end up directly in front of Natsume. The fair, silver-haired elf and I face each other. Yeah, I know that elf, all right.</p>
<p>It’s Beta.</p>
<p>“The book, please?” Beta pretends not to know who I am, instead taking my copy with a broad grin on her face.</p>
<p>As I watch Beta sign it with clean, practiced movements, I can’t help but ask.</p>
<p>“So how’s business?” I quietly whisper.</p>
<p>“Could be better. But I’m gaining quite a reputation.”</p>
<p>Oh, I get it. We’ve got another one.</p>
<p>She’s making bank off my wisdom, too.</p>
<p>Back in the day, I used to tell Beta stories from my original world. Since she seemed to be into literature, I figured she could use tales from Earth as a foundation to come up with badass plots of her own, but I never imagined she’d be plagiarizing them wholesale and making a killing in the process.</p>
<p>Dearest Beta, I’m disappointed in you.</p>
<p>I look down on Beta with a frigid stare as she hands me the signed book.</p>
<p>“I was invited here as a special guest, so I’ve been able to get access to inside information. I wrote the specifics of the plans in the inscription,” she informs me as I stand up to leave, moving her mouth as little as possible.</p>
<p><a id="page-12"></a>We then part ways without so much as exchanging a glance. This is sweet. It feels like I’m in a spy movie.</p>
<p>Maybe I was too harsh on you, dear Beta.</p>
<p>Upon exiting the shop, I’m greeted by a strangely delighted Rose.</p>
<p>“I <em>knew</em> you were a fan of Natsume, too, Cid.”</p>
<p>“No, I…”</p>
<p>“I understand. It must be hard to bring yourself to admit it, since most of the fans are women. Nevertheless, even though almost everyone who comes to signings are women, Natsume has a fair share of male fans.”</p>
<p>“…Sure, I guess.”</p>
<p>“The stories are compelling because they’re so inventive! The plots are all so new, their worldview is so novel, and the characters have fresh and fascinating values.”</p>
<p>New, novel, and fresh? Yeah, I’ll bet.</p>
<p>“And Natsume is versed in so many genres: romance, mysteries, action, children’s stories, literary fiction… It’s almost like each story is being written by a different person. That diversity is precisely what’s allowed these pieces to capture the hearts of so many readers.”</p>
<p>That’s ’cause they <em>were</em> each written by different people.</p>
<p>“Oh, and look at this autograph. I even got Natsume to write my name,” says Rose gleefully as she opens up her book. Inside are Rose’s name and Natsume the Fraud’s signature.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, she mentioned something about having written the specifics of some plan or other in mine. I flip my book open.</p>
<p>“Are those…ancient letters?” asks Rose as she takes a peek.</p>
<p>“Looks like it. Yeah.”</p>
<p>And I can’t read a lick of it.</p>
<p>“Can you read ’em?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid not. I’ve had a difficult time learning how to read ancient texts. I can only make out a few symbols. And it seems it’s written in the modern equivalent of cursive, so I’m not sure I could make it out, even if I was fluent.”</p>
<p>“Ooh.”</p>
<p>Awesome, so it’s like a cipher or something. I gave up trying to learn how to read the ancient alphabet, so I’m super-fascinated by it.</p>
<p>“Why write in ancient letters?”</p>
<p><a id="page-13"></a>“’Cause it looks cool.”</p>
<p>“It looks cool?”</p>
<p>“Yup.”</p>
<p>“I guess that’s the kind of thing that appeals to men.”</p>
<p>Next, we go check into our super-ritzy hotel, but Rose has to say hi to some big shots or something, so we split up.</p>
<p>She says she can’t introduce me because we’re still just friends from school for now. I dunno what she meant by “for now.” Is she planning on trying to convert me or something?</p>
<p>Unfortunately for her, I have a policy of not getting involved in any religion. The only time I’d consider it is if I was founding one.</p>
<div class="decoration-rw">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break0">I’m the type of guy who doesn’t have many likes or dislikes…mainly because most of those things aren’t worth thinking about.</p>
<p>That’s not to say I don’t have any preferences. None of them are particularly important, and I could certainly make do without them, but I still like the stuff I like and dislike the stuff I dislike. Even when you try to separate those things out with logic, you can’t logic away your emotions.</p>
<p>I call stuff like that unimportant likes and unimportant dislikes.</p>
<p>Incidentally, one of those unimportant likes is hot springs.</p>
<p>Back in my previous life, I had a period when I didn’t bathe. At the time, I considered time spent soaking time wasted. Of course, I had my life as a faceless extra to consider, so I made sure to take a three-minute shower every day, but I eliminated all time in the tub so I could train instead.</p>
<p>This was around the point when I was pushing the limits of the human species, by the way. In other words, I had to make every minute count. I mean, this was during the period when I was seriously planning on repelling nukes with my right straight-hand punch.</p>
<p>When I finally realized I was losing my mind, I went back to bathing. The trigger for that was a hot spring. Hot water fosters composure in the soul, which has a direct effect on my training. That was the reason I could <a id="page-14"></a>do the mental gymnastics to realize I needed to find magic or vibrational auras.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m just trying to say I’m in a hot spring right now.</p>
<p>Lindwurm is famous for them, which is a fact I’d secretly been super-excited about.</p>
<p>It’s early in the morning. It happens to be my favorite time to soak in hot springs. I certainly wouldn’t decline taking one in the evening, but mornings are superior. After all, there usually aren’t as many people around. Sometimes, I even get the place all to myself.</p>
<p>I came today hoping that would happen, but unfortunately, it looks like someone else had the same idea. To make matters worse, that someone is Alexia.</p>
<p>Her platinum hair is all bundled up, and her red eyes go wide as they momentarily lock with mine. We both immediately avert our gazes.</p>
<p>Afterward, we tacitly agree on a policy of mutual nonintervention and go on pretending the other doesn’t exist. The spring is designed for nobility, which means few people use it, especially early in the day. That’s why all the dividers were cleared away, opening it up for mixed bathing. It’s spacious. Everything below eye level is covered by the steam, and the sun is starting to rise. It would have been perfect if I had this all to myself. I bask in the water and the morning sunlight.</p>
<p>Alexia and I are on opposite ends of the outdoor bath with the best view, watching the sun rise in uncomfortable silence.</p>
<p>From the corner of my eye, I see Alexia’s white skin move. Ripples spread out across the water’s surface.</p>
<p><em>Bummer</em>, I think. <em>Guess I’ll have to make this dip a quick one.</em> Just as the thought crosses my mind, though, Alexia breaks the silence.</p>
<p>“Have your injuries all healed?”</p>
<p>Her voice is quiet, by her standards.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m all better,” I respond, wondering what she’s talking about.</p>
<p>“I did fly off the handle when I sliced you up. I’m glad you survived.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, I guess.”</p>
<p>Ah. Those injuries.</p>
<p>I’ve spent enough time around her that I can tell this is her attempt at an apology. I’d originally doubted if anyone had actually taught her what an apology <em>was</em>, but I guess this is her version of one.</p>
<p><a id="page-15"></a>“While we’re apologizing for stuff, I’m sorry I suspected you of being a serial killer.”</p>
<p>Hot water splashes against the side of my face.</p>
<p>“Obviously not.”</p>
<p>“Yeah? So what are you doing in Lindwurm?”</p>
<p>“I’m a guest at the Goddess’s Trial. You?”</p>
<p>“A friend of mine told me something exciting was going on. My guess is she was talking about the Goddess’s Trial. Do you know what it is?”</p>
<p>I can hear Alexia sigh.</p>
<p>“You came here without knowing? The Goddess’s Trial is a battle that happens once a year when they open the door to the Sanctuary. Memories of ancient warriors are awoken from within, and challengers come to fight them. Any dark knight who applies in advance can participate, but there’s no guarantee an ancient warrior will answer their call. Several hundred dark knights enter each year, but only about ten end up actually getting to fight.”</p>
<p>Sounds interesting. I bet Alpha’s planning on entering.</p>
<p>“How are they selected?”</p>
<p>“Supposedly, it’s based on whether there’s an appropriate warrior for that challenger. Usually, the warrior is a little stronger than the challenger, which is why it’s called the Goddess’s Trial. Ten years ago, everyone was talking about how Venom the Wandering Swordsman managed to call forth the great hero Olivier.”</p>
<p>“Ooh, did he win?”</p>
<p>“He lost, or so I heard. That said, I didn’t see it for myself, so who knows? I can’t even be sure if it really was Olivier or not.”</p>
<p>“Huh.”</p>
<p>Would Alpha be able to call forth a hero of legend? If she did, I bet it’d be exciting.</p>
<p>“And you’re not participating?” I ask. “Word is you’ve gotten strong lately.”</p>
<p>“I can’t. I’m too busy this year. There are some unsavory rumors floating around about the archbishop here, so I’m supposed to investigate him.”</p>
<p>“Unsavory rumors?”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to repeat them. If you want to know, join the Crimson Order.”</p>
<p>“No thanks.”</p>
