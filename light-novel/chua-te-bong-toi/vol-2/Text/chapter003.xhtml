<p><a id="page-17"></a>“When you graduate, I’m ordering you to join.”</p>
<p>“No thanks.”</p>
<p>“I’ll submit the application on your behalf.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t do that.”</p>
<p>“You’re so stubborn.”</p>
<p>At this point, the conversation breaks off.</p>
<p>We sit there in silence for a little longer. This time, it isn’t nearly so unpleasant.</p>
<p>Then, I see Alexia move out of my periphery. Her long legs are floating on the surface, making more ripples in the warm water.</p>
<p>“I’d expected you to be ogling me up and down, but I suppose I was wrong.”</p>
<p>Alexia doesn’t mention what in particular she thought I’d be looking at.</p>
<p>“Someone’s confident.”</p>
<p>“When you’re unassailably beautiful like me, it’s annoying to constantly put up with lusty gazes.”</p>
<p>Big words coming from someone wearing nothing.</p>
<p>“I try to avoid looking at other people when I’m in hot springs. That way, we can all share it in peace.”</p>
<p>“How admirable.”</p>
<p>“And on that note, would you please stop trying to catch a glimpse of my Excalibur?”</p>
<p>“<em>Pfft</em>,” Alexia laughs. It’s like she’s looking down on me. “Excalibur, huh? Are you sure you didn’t mean Earthworm?”</p>
<p>“If that’s what you think, it’s no skin off my back. Earthworm, Excalibur, I’m fine with whatever, but let me give you a warning.”</p>
<p>I stand up, making waves across the pool.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t judge things based on appearances. Sometimes, an earthworm just hasn’t left its scabbard yet.”</p>
<p>And with my goods all out in the open, I turn around and get out of the pool.</p>
<p>“Wh-what do you mean…?” stammers Alexia. Her cheeks are flushed pink.</p>
<p>“When the holy sword is drawn from its scabbard, its ivory blade will be unleashed, sending you on a journey to the Garden of Chaos…”</p>
<p><a id="page-18"></a>With that suggestive line, I give my wet towel a strong snap, sending it up between my legs to clap loudly against my butt.</p>
<p>Old geezers do it all the time when they’re getting out of the bath, and I can’t get enough of it. There’s no rhyme or reason to it, but the hot springs experience just doesn’t feel complete unless I do it, too. After a second and third time, I head over to the dressing room.</p>
<p>As I finish changing, I can hear the sound of snapping coming from the hot spring.</p>

<p class="space-break0">The warm lamplight illuminating the majestic cathedral makes it appear more ethereal.</p>
<p>Only one person stands within it: a beautiful blond elf. She’s wearing a pitch-black dress, and her blue eyes are fixated on a statue of the great hero Olivier.</p>
<p>She could have been the moon shining radiantly against the dark of the night. Her name is Alpha.</p>
<p>“All we want is to know the truth,” she prays, almost as if she were talking to the statue. “Great hero, what did you do at the Sanctuary? Each time we pull back a layer of our dark history, we find more truths and lies interwoven together.”</p>
<p>Her high heels click as she begins walking, resounding throughout the cathedral as Alpha walks across its marble floor toward the red mass spread across it.</p>
<p>“Archbishop Drake, what were you hiding? If only you could talk. I really would have liked an answer.”</p>
<p>The red mass is composed of blood and chunks of flesh. The corpulent man breathing his last at its center has been brutally sliced to pieces.</p>
<p>The high heels come to a stop atop the pool of blood. White legs extend down from beneath Alpha’s knee-length dress.</p>
<p>“Who was it who killed you? Who was it who could easily dispose of a man with your status?”</p>
<p>The dying archbishop’s eyes are filled with the sublime light of the <a id="page-19"></a>grave. Dark rumors about him had reached as far as the royal capital, and he had been likely to come under investigation in the near future. Before that could happen, though, he had been made to disappear.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow, we shall wait for the door to the Sanctuary to be cast open.”</p>
<p>After shooting another glance at the statue of Olivier, Alpha turns around.</p>
<p>From the other side of the cathedral’s doors, the voices of people searching for the archbishop grow closer.</p>
<p>Paying them no heed, Alpha opens that same set of doors and leaves.</p>
<p>As the sound of high heels recedes into the distance, it’s replaced with a throng of the Church’s paladins surging into the cathedral.</p>
<p>Though they find the body of their archbishop, not one of them says a word about the blond elf. None of them even realizes she’s gone by…</p>
<p>…but the bloodstained stiletto marks continue down the marble hallway.</p>

<p class="space-break0">It’s the night before the big event, and I’m gazing down at Lindwurm from atop its clock tower.</p>
<p>The Goddess’s Trial is tomorrow, and everyone’s all abuzz. Stalls line the main street, and the lamps along the road make it look like a veritable river.</p>
<p>Rose is off at some party at the church. I wasn’t invited. Not that I would have gone.</p>
<p>I smile as my hair dances in the night wind.</p>
<p>I gotta say, I’m loving this whole series of episodes where I get to look down on people and places from on high. The fact that it’s nighttime and there’s an event going on below makes it even better.</p>
<p>“It begins…,” I mutter, getting swept up in the mood. “So… They’ve made their decision…”</p>
<p>I narrow my eyes.</p>
<p>“Then I shall do my part to stand against it.”</p>
<p>In a flash, I transform into my Shadow outfit.</p>
<p>“For that choice is something we cannot allow…”</p>
<p><a id="page-20"></a>With that, I leap into the night sky. My obsidian long coat flutters behind me as I make my landing.</p>
<p>My destination is a back alley removed from the celebrations. A masked man is standing before me.</p>
<p>He looks sketchy, so I’ve been tracking him with my gaze ever since he fled from the church. He’s probably a robber or something.</p>
<p>No, wait, I can smell blood on him.</p>
<p>A mugger maybe?</p>
<p>“Did you really think you could escape…?” I ask him.</p>
<p>The masked man shrinks back a step.</p>
<p>“At night, the world dims, transforming it into our domain…”</p>
<p>He draws his sword.</p>
<p>“…and none can escape it.”</p>
<p>The man squares off against me, his sword at the ready.</p>
<p>I leave my katana undrawn, waiting for the moment to come.</p>
<p>Then it happens. As soon as the masked man tries to swing his blade, his head goes flying through the air.</p>
<p>I watch in silence as I wait for the woman behind his corpse to approach me.</p>
<p>“It’s been some time, my lord.”</p>
<p>The woman kneeling before me is Epsilon, the fifth member of the Seven Shadows.</p>
<p>She uncovers her face from behind her bodysuit, then looks up at me. She’s an elf with hair the color of a clear lake, and her eyes are just a smidgen darker.</p>
<p>Beauty comes in many varieties, and hers is decidedly flashy. Her looks are accentuated by sharp facial features, and her figure is exaggerated, too. Her body sways with each step she takes. It’s enough to catch the eye of anyone, man or woman, whether they’re interested in her or not. I know her secret, though.</p>
<p>“A clean slash. Nice work.”</p>
<p>“I’m honored.” Epsilon’s cheeks flush a little when she smiles. Her crisp tone might come across as haughty to some, but I don’t think it sounds bad. It reminds me of a piano.</p>
<p>Of all the members of the Seven Shadows, she’s the best at controlling <a id="page-22"></a>her magic with precision. Magic can be super-hard to manipulate when it leaves your body, but she has no problems striking from a distance.</p>
