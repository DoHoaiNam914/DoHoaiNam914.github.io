<p><a id="page-199"></a>He could belong to a school lost to history but passed down from father to son. Or no, he could be from the Lawless City and just have faked his papers.</p>
<p>The Lawless City doesn’t belong to any country—it’s a hive of evil and greed. The Cult has yet to worm its way into the inner circles of any of its three warring rulers.</p>
<p>If he comes from the Lawless City, that means Mundane must be a member of the Blood Queen’s family. Given his strength, he has to at least be part of the leadership. Perv realizes he needs to run more background checks…</p>
<p>There’s also a chance that Mundane is affiliated with the Shadow Garden. Mundane is a man, though, and the Shadow Garden should have no motive to do anything conspicuous at the Bushin Festival. All in all, it seems unlikely.</p>
<p>One way or another, though, Perv can sense something unfathomable about him.</p>
<p>He’s probably a member of the underworld, just like Perv…</p>
<p>“What’s his secret…?”</p>
<p>Perv’s murmur is lost in the stadium’s clamor.</p>

<p class="space-break0">“Mundane, wait!!”</p>
<p>Upon waking up, Annerose rushes down the corridor after him.</p>
<p>He turns around, and she stops in front of him.</p>
<p>“You trounced me back there. I was completely powerless.” She looks up at him and smiles. “I left my homeland to become stronger, and I like to think I’ve done so. It seems I got a little conceited, too.”</p>
<p>She holds out her hand.</p>
<p>Mundane looks down at it, then slowly extends his.</p>
<p>“I learned a lot today. Thank you,” she says.</p>
<p>“This was the first time I’ve had to remove my shackles. You have nothing to be ashamed of.”</p>
<p>“…That makes me proud to hear.” Annerose smiles again and exchanges <a id="page-200"></a>a handshake. “Mundane, who exactly are you? How did you become so strong?”</p>
<p>He smiles sadly, then averts his gaze. He seems to be looking far off into the distance.</p>
<p>“I threw away everything… I’m just a fool who pursued strength and strength alone…”</p>
<p>“Mundane…”</p>
<p>Seeing his lonesome expression, Annerose feels her chest tighten. He must have had a tragic past that left him no other choice.</p>
<p>“You know…if you want, would you be interested in joining the military in Velgalta? I’m sure I could find a post worthy of you.”</p>
<p>Mundane just shakes his head.</p>
<p>“…I can’t walk a path that bright.”</p>
<p>He turns away and begins walking.</p>
<p>“Wait! I’m leaving to continue my journey tomorrow! If you change your mind before then, come find me!”</p>
<p>Mundane doesn’t stop.</p>
<p>Annerose watches him go, then turns around.</p>
<p>In this world, greatness is relative, and there’s always someone stronger. To her, fighting Mundane and watching his sword work in action was an irreplaceable experience.</p>
<p>His swordplay was polished almost to the point of being an art. To Annerose, it looked as though he’d put everything into it.</p>
<p>She’s certain he’ll win. Before long, the world will know his name.</p>
<p>He’ll climb to the height of heights.</p>
<p>Right now, all she can do is watch him rise, but she’s determined to become stronger. Mundane has shown her the path she needs to take.</p>
<p>Once she becomes stronger, they will meet again.</p>
<p>Until that happens, she pledges to keep fighting.</p>

<p class="space-break0">Ahhhhh, that went well.</p>
<p>Prettttty darn well.</p>
<p><a id="page-201"></a>I was able to focus on making my performance as elegant as possible. There was a time in my training to become a mastermind when I pursued a fancy brand of swordplay. It was a little bit too graceful, so I don’t use it these days as Shadow, but I’m glad the work I put in back then is finally paying off.</p>
<p>Thanks to Annerose, I’m able to check off about 70 percent of my goals for this Bushin Festival. All that’s left is figuring out how I’m gonna drop out. There are a bunch of choices, though, so I’m at an impasse.</p>
<p>The simplest route would be to just win the whole thing, but looking at the tournament holistically, this next match against Iris is the best place to stage the climax. One option is defeating Iris and then just vanishing. That one has a badass feel to it.</p>
<p>It’s the scene where the mastermind defeats someone widely acknowledged as strong, then disappears, leaving them with a simple <em>My work here is done…</em></p>
<p>I’m digging it.</p>
<p>Also, if I defeat Iris and vanish, my sister has a decent shot of winning the whole tournament.</p>
<p>But a scenario where I go evil is pretty appealing, too.</p>
<p>Halfway through my match with Iris, I can go, <em>I’m an assassin from the Assassins Guild…and now your life is mine!</em> and start ignoring the rules to go all out. That scenario gets bonus points for giving me an elegant reason to exit stage right.</p>
<p>Still, winning the whole thing really would give me the biggest sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other exciting options to pick from, too. I need to give this some good, hard thought.</p>
<p>As my various choices fill my mind, I make my way back to the deluxe suite. When I get there, I find some guy I don’t know sitting in my seat, so I decide to bail.</p>
<p>Claire’s match is over already, so whatever.</p>
<p>After heading back to the dorm, I start running through scenarios.</p>
