      <p><a id="page-144"></a>“Alpha… I’m—”</p>

      <p>“Don’t.” Right when Lilim was about to introduce herself, Alpha cut her off. “You’re going to be living under a new name from now on.”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>“We lurk in the darkness and hunt down shadows. For us, our public personas are only just that. Only in darkness do we truly exist. Even though that means we may never be able to return to the light.” Alpha held out a mask and fixed her beautifully clear blue eyes on Lilim. “If you have enough resolve to do the same, then take this and become the Shadow Garden’s sixth member, Zeta.”</p>

      <p>“Zeta,” Lilim murmured, reflecting on the name. “I’m…Zeta…”</p>

      <p>“Sounds like your resolve is firm. You have strong eyes. But…”</p>

      <p>“I want power.”</p>

      <p>“You have plenty of talent. You’ll become powerful in time. But someday, that hatred of yours will…”</p>

      <p>Alpha was about to say something, but she stopped herself. Her blue gaze lingered on Lilim for a good while longer.</p>

      <p>“No, it’s nothing,” she said sadly.</p>

      <p>Up above in the night sky, the white snow continued falling in silence.</p>

      <p class="noindent">“Hmm. That’s rough.”</p>

      <p>Once Zeta finishes her story, he offers a short comment as he looks out the window.</p>

      <p>His words are blunt.</p>

      <p>However, they encapsulate everything they need to. Zeta wasn’t looking for cheap sympathy.</p>

      <p>As such, she gives her reply just as bluntly. “Yeah. Rough.”</p>

      <p>She’s taken her hatred from that day and sealed it deep within her <a id="page-145"></a>heart. Unnecessary emotions will do nothing but get in the way of her plan.</p>

      <p>Before she even consciously noticed it, she began cutting down on her word use to avoid accidentally letting any of her feelings slip out.</p>

      <p>However, Zeta prefers it that way. Every time her feelings or body evolve, it makes her feel like she’s getting closer to her goal.</p>

      <p>“I’m a stray cat. Just a tiny kitten you took in. That’s why I’ve thought a lot about what kind of world you want. You wouldn’t tell me, so it’s been a bit hard.”</p>

      <p>“Has it?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. It has.”</p>

      <p>Her master lifts his wineglass.</p>

      <p>Zeta swiftly grabs the bottle and tops him off. Then she nestles up close to him.</p>

      <p>“You want eternal life. Now I understand what that means.”</p>

      <p>“I’m surprised you picked up on that.”</p>

      <p>“You’re looking at the distant future. So am I.”</p>

      <p>“I see…”</p>

      <p>He gazes into the deep darkness beyond the window. Zeta looks out at the deep darkness as well.</p>

      <p>“I’m going to revive Diablos,” she says.</p>

      <p>“I see.”</p>

      <p>“So you aren’t stopping me?”</p>

      <p>“I have no intention of rejecting your choice.”</p>

      <p>“You’re too kind, Master. Too kind to make that choice yourself.”</p>

      <p>“Is that so?”</p>

      <p>“Kindness can’t change the world. Your kindness is shackling you.”</p>

      <p>“…Is it, now?”</p>

      <p>“It is. But I’m not kind. I’ll revive the demon, even if it puts the world in danger.”</p>

      <p>“You’ll be reviled.”</p>

      <p>“Fine by me. The world needs this”—Zeta leans hesitantly against his shoulder—“so I’ll take their revulsion in your place. That’s my duty.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-146"></a>“I see…”</p>

      <p>Zeta steps away and turns her back on him. “If the time comes, cast me aside.”</p>

      <p>With those final words, she vanishes into the night.</p>

      <p class="noindent">Zeta stands on the nocturnal rooftop and looks down upon the academy. Her golden tail sways in the cold winter breeze.</p>

      <p>“It’s time,” she murmurs.</p>

      <p>“At long last?”</p>

      <p>“I see you’ve made your decision.”</p>

      <p>There are two figures standing behind her.</p>

      <p>One of them is Victoria. The other is a girl with her hood hung low.</p>

      <p>“I’m going to revive Diablos,” Zeta declares.</p>

      <p>“What did Master Shadow say?” Victoria asks.</p>

      <p>“We talked. That’s all.”</p>

      <p>“Did you get his permission, then?”</p>

      <p>“That was never my plan. But if he was going to stop me, I would have stopped.”</p>

      <p>Victoria smiles. “I take it that means he has to tell you to stop.”</p>

      <p>“Nope. From here on, I’m acting of my own accord.”</p>

      <p>“You know this means betraying the Shadow Garden.”</p>

      <p>“I don’t care. Alpha is too soft. She has no vision for after we crush the Cult. But I do.” Zeta narrows her icy-purple eyes. “I’ll revive Diablos and obtain eternal life. Then I’ll control the world forever.”</p>

      <p>Victoria’s cheeks flush with ecstasy. “And Master Shadow will become a god.”</p>

      <p>“You’ll be reviled,” says the hooded girl, who’d remained silent throughout the rest of the exchange.</p>

      <p>“Master wants eternal life. I’ll shoulder all the sin.”</p>

      <p>“Let’s do this, then, shall we? Long live Master Shadow.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-147"></a>“…The plan proceeds.”</p>

      <p>Victoria and the hooded girl vanish without a sound.</p>

      <p>Now Zeta is alone on the rooftop. She stares intently at the academy’s lights.</p>

      <p>“I’ll steal it all—eternal life and control of the world. Then…we’ll finally have a perfect world where mistakes never happen again.”</p>

      <p>The lights waver in the darkness of the night. They remind Zeta of the torches from that night so long ago.</p>

      <p>“This is my duty.”</p>

      <p>She squeezes herself tight to double-check.</p>

      <p>Good, her knees aren’t trembling.</p>

      <p>Her heart is still.</p>

      <p>Standing alone, she releases a long, foggy exhale into the night. Then she follows it with a few words.</p>

      <p>“Father… Master… I’m strong now.”</p>
