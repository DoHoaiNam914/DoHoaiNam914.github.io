      <h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="toc.xhtml#toc-chapter012">Morning Comes, and There’s an Impaler on the Loose!!</a></h1>

      <p class="noindent">I wake up feeling great, and I’ve got the sweet darkspider silk robe I picked up last night to thank for it. I take a moment to appreciate the way it glitters in the morning light, then head over to the academy a bit earlier than usual.</p>

      <p>It’s been a while since the last time I went to school solo.</p>

      <p>Skel and Po always like to get there at the last possible minute, but going to school early every now and then has its appeal, too. You get to see all sorts of new faces, and basking in the sunlight as you head through the gates feels great…</p>

      <p>“…This sucks.”</p>

      <p>“What are <em>you</em> doing here, Fido?”</p>

      <p>“What are <em>you</em> doing here, Alexia?”</p>

      <p>When I walk through the gates, I find Alexia standing there.</p>

      <p>“You should be a little happier getting to see me first thing in the morning.”</p>

      <p>“Gosh, gee, I’m so happy.”</p>

      <p>“Well, I should hope so.”</p>

      <p>“Anyways, later.”</p>

      <p>I powerwalk away, but Alexia quickly catches up. “Hold on, don’t you go running off on me.”</p>

      <p>“Why’d you follow me?”</p>

      <p>“When people run away from me, it makes me want to chase them.”</p>

      <p>“What are you, a beast of prey?”</p>

      <p>“Isn’t it an honor getting to walk to school with me?”</p>

      <p>“………”</p>

      <p><a id="page-078"></a>“Why’d you go quiet?”</p>

      <p>“I was just thinking about how happy-go-lucky you are.”</p>

      <p>“Not nearly as much as you.”</p>

      <p>We continue bantering as we walk, then we spot a crowd gathered in front of the school building.</p>

      <p>I can hear the students murmuring to each other.</p>

      <p>“H-he’s dead…!”</p>

      <p>“Who would do something so brutal?”</p>

      <p>“Hey, stay back! No one gets closer until the Knight Order gets here!”</p>

      <p>Alexia and I exchange a glance.</p>

      <p>“Sounds like they found a body!” I tell her.</p>

      <p>“We need to go see what’s going on.”</p>

      <p>We don’t tend to get much excitement at the academy, and it’s been forever since there was a cool surprise like this. It’s no wonder my heart begins pounding with anticipation. I push through the crowd, eyes glimmering. I wonder whose corpse it is.</p>

      <p>When I get to the front, my disappointment is immeasurable.</p>

      <p>“Oh, it’s this guy.”</p>

      <p>It’s the dude I kicked off the roof and left behind last night. I completely forgot about him.</p>

      <p>“That’s horrible…,” Alexia mutters. “What kind of person goes and impales someone on a statue’s sword? It’s like a public execution.”</p>

      <p>“It was probably just an accident.”</p>

      <p>“Obviously it wasn’t. When someone gets murdered like <em>that</em>, it means the killer did it for a reason.”</p>

      <p>“Uh, I guess…”</p>

      <p>Alexia stares earnestly at the corpse. “I wonder who he was. It doesn’t look like he’s affiliated with the school.”</p>

      <p>“I bet he was a burglar.”</p>

      <p>“He isn’t with the Knight Order, either. He must have been some sort of intruder.”</p>

      <p>“Pretty sure he’s a burglar.”</p>

      <p>“Could he be a member of the Cult? Either that, or…?”</p>

      <p>“I gotta say, he reeeeeally looks like a burglar.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-079"></a>“Be quiet, you. He’s obviously not a burglar.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

      <p>Eh, so it goes. The other students look like they’re enjoying themselves, and if I think about it, that was basically my goal all along.</p>

      <p>“That’s so scary… Did the you-know-who org kill him?”</p>

      <p>“They still haven’t found those missing students, right?”</p>

      <p>“And there was that thing with the magic yesterday, too. It feels like it’s all connected.”</p>

      <p><em>Aw, look at ’em. They’re having the time of their lives.</em></p>

      <p>All that really happened was a cat and a dog getting into a fight and a burglar falling to his death. As the instigator for all that, it warms my heart seeing the other students get so excited about it.</p>

      <p>Oh man, if I waited until night and dressed up as Shadow, that’d give them even more to talk about.</p>

      <p>“What’s with the creepy smile?” Alexia asks me.</p>

      <p>“Huh? Oh, it’s nothing.”</p>

      <p>Her red eyes peer at me with suspicion.</p>

      <p>Then someone comes over and starts talking to us. “Could I have a moment, you two?”</p>

      <p>It’s a hot dude with dark-green hair—Isaac.</p>

      <p>“Well, well, well, if it isn’t Isaac. How dare you miss class yesterday?”</p>

      <p>“You’re…Cid, right? I had some business I needed to attend to. Did something happen?”</p>

      <p>“We had a pop quiz.”</p>

      <p>“I see. And what else?”</p>

      <p>“Nah, that was about it.”</p>

      <p>“Then I’m not sure I see the problem. In any case, school has been canceled today.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, huh.”</p>

      <p>“This is a horrible tragedy. The academy and the Knight Order will be launching an investigation, so they’ve ordered everyone to stay away from the crime scene. The perpetrator behind this monstrous act might still be around, so be careful. Make sure you don’t leave your dorms.”</p>

      <p>“Uh-huh, uh-huh.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-080"></a>Alexia gives me a look. “That means you, Fido. It’s dangerous.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I got it—”</p>

      <p>All of a sudden, something snaps around my neck.</p>

      <p><em>Is this a collar?</em></p>

      <p>“There we go. I finally caught you.”</p>

      <p>I turn around and see Claire smiling from ear to ear.</p>

      <p>“H-hey there, Sis. Long time no see.”</p>

      <p>“It really has, hasn’t it? Since before winter break, as I recall.”</p>

      <p>“Th-that sounds about right.”</p>

      <p><em>Shit. I let my guard down.</em></p>

      <p>I knew running into my sister would be a headache, so I’ve been actively trying to avoid it.</p>

      <p>“U-um, Claire, that collar…,” Alexia starts.</p>

      <p>“What about it?” Claire replies.</p>

      <p>“That’s <em>your</em> collar?”</p>

      <p>“Yep. I left it in my room, but for some reason, the Knight Order had it. You have no idea how hard it was to get it back.”</p>

      <p>“I—I see. And what do you use it for?”</p>

      <p>“What do you mean? Isn’t it obvious?” Claire smiles as she gives it a rattly tug.</p>

      <p>“I, uh, I guess it is… I suppose dogs do need collars, don’t they?”</p>

      <p>“Exactly. See, you get it.”</p>

      <p>“Just for the record, I’m not a dog,” I interject.</p>

      <p>“Of course you are, Fido.”</p>

      <p>“I swear, Cid, you say the strangest things. Now, come along, Fido. Err, I mean, Cid.”</p>

      <p>Claire pulls the chain and begins dragging me off in front of a crowd of onlookers.</p>

      <p>When in the world did she and Alexia start hitting it off?</p>

      <p class="noindent"><a id="page-081"></a>“How dare you break your promise to me?”</p>

      <p>“Ah-ha-ha…”</p>

      <p>My sister’s dragged me to her room and is sitting mounted on top of me.</p>

      <p>“And you even lied to me, too.”</p>

      <p>“When you say ‘lied,’ which lie would that be?”</p>

      <p>“Excuse me? <em>Which</em> lie?”</p>

      <p>My neck lets out a loud <em>creeeeeeak</em> as she squeezes down on it.</p>

      <p>Looks like I just dug my own grave.</p>

      <p>The thing is, I can’t even count how many times I’ve lied to her, and I have no idea which promise she’s talking about.</p>

      <p>“Th-that hurts, Sis…”</p>

      <p>It doesn’t actually, though.</p>

      <p>“You’re not suggesting you lied to me about other things, too, are you?”</p>

      <p>“I didn’t, I promise.”</p>

      <p>I totally did.</p>

      <p>“For real?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, for real.”</p>

      <p>She brings her face in so close, our noses are nearly touching, and peers into my eyes. “You have clear eyes. That’s the sign of an honest heart. I guess you’re telling the truth.”</p>

      <p><em>You need to get your vision checked, Sis.</em></p>

      <p>“You should know that when you lie to me, I always figure you out. Why did you even tell it in the first place?”</p>

      <p>“Ah, right. <em>That</em> lie. The one about the you-know-what.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, the lie you told me about Nina.”</p>

      <p>“About Nina?”</p>

      <p>Huh?</p>

      <p>I don’t think I ever lied to her about Nina.</p>

      <p>“You haven’t forgotten, have you?”</p>

      <p>“Of course not. You’re talking about the thing with Nina. Look, it’s hard to explain in just a few words, but there were extenuating circumstances…”</p>

      <p><a id="page-082"></a>“<em>Sigh</em>… You probably said it without thinking because you wanted to impress me, didn’t you?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, that. Totally.”</p>

      <p>“I can see right through you, you know.”</p>

      <p>“I’m sorry I did it.”</p>

      <p>“Very well. I forgive you. But just this once.”</p>

      <p>With that, the conversation comes to an end.</p>

      <p>Or rather, it should, but Claire keeps on staring at me.</p>

      <p>“Sis, you’re kinda heavy. Were you planning on getting off me at some—? Hrk!”</p>

      <p><em>M-my neck…</em></p>

      <p>“I’m sorry, Cid, did you say something?”</p>

      <p>“I—I was just saying how light you are, Sis, and how you’re the prettiest person around!”</p>

      <p>“Well, that makes sense. It is true, after all.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, so true.”</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee. You keep getting older, but you’ll always just be Cid. I hope you never have to change. I…”</p>

      <p>Dunno why, but Claire starts getting serious all of a sudden.</p>

      <p>“Sis?”</p>

      <p>“I won’t back down from any enemy, no matter how strong they are. Not if fighting them will let you stay just the way you are.”</p>

      <p>“Uh…”</p>

      <p><em>Methinks a certain someone’s symptoms might be getting worse.</em></p>

      <p>“Look, Cid, I need you to listen close. Right now, the academy is in the wicked clutches of a powerful organization.”</p>

      <p>“Ah, so that’s the scenario we’re working with?”</p>

      <p>“Don’t. If I tell you any details, you’ll be in danger. Don’t look at me like that. I can’t say any more.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, okay.”</p>

      <p>“I’m going to solve the academy’s mysteries. I have a plan. It’s dangerous, but…I’m doing this for you, so I know I can be strong.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, good luck.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-083"></a>“Make sure you watch your back, Cid. You might get targeted for being my brother. But I’m going to do my best to take down the bad guys.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, go get ’em.”</p>

      <p>“I’m sorry for dumping all this on you. And I’m sorry for not being able to tell you any of the important bits. But I’m doing this to protect you. I know this is selfish of me, but I want you to understand that.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I get it.”</p>

      <p>“And also…if I don’t make it back… If I die—”</p>

      <p>Midway through her teary speech, she abruptly glares at a patch of empty air.</p>

      <p>“I’m sorry, Aurora, but this is kind of emotional, so would you mind being quiet? Huh, what? I’m embarrassing myself, so I should just drop it? How exactly am I embarrassing—?”</p>

      <p>I look up with a deadpan expression on my face, and our eyes meet.</p>

      <p>“Sis…”</p>

      <p>“O-oh, that was, um, um, um, nothing! Just talking to myself!”</p>

      <p>“Sis, I get it.”</p>

      <p>“Cid…you do? You get that there’s an important reason I’m doing all this?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, of course.”</p>

      <p><em>You’re a budding teenage edgelord.</em></p>

      <p>“Thank you, Cid. I don’t deserve a brother as good as you. And if…if I don’t make it—if I die…” Big tears go rolling down her cheeks.</p>

      <p>“You’ll be fine, Sis. You definitely won’t die.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, Cid!! I’ll definitely make it back!! I definitely, definitely will!!”</p>

      <p>“Sounds good.”</p>

      <p>She hugs me so tight, I’m afraid my spine will snap.</p>

      <p>I hope she grows out of this soon.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="noindent"><a id="page-084"></a>I wait and wait, and finally, nighttime arrives.</p>

      <p>I sneak out of my dorm and stand silently atop the school roof like usual.</p>

      <p>The campus is on high alert, the dorm’s exits are under tight surveillance, and the students are restless. Who knew that a little old night burglar would cause such a stir? It’s thrilling, how fresh this all feels.</p>

      <p>Back in my old world, I was the kind of guy who got super excited every time a typhoon rolled in. Wind and rain buffeting the classroom, the sky getting dark in the middle of the day—it doesn’t get better than that. It always felt like something big was about to happen. It never did, but still.</p>

      <p>After going through all that myself, I feel like I have a responsibility to make something big actually happen this time. The students are sick and tired of their ordinary lives. They’re desperate for something to shatter the monotony.</p>

      <p>“How do I want to play this…?”</p>

      <p>We’ve got four missing students, a cat-slash-dogfight, a burglar falling to his death from the roof… What would be a revolutionary way of tying it all together?</p>

      <p>“I could make a huge magic circle, chant some sort of invocation… Nah, too plain. Hmm?”</p>

      <p>At some point while I was busy brainstorming, my surroundings got covered in white fog.</p>

      <p>“Hey, this happened yesterday, too… This is some weird weather we’re having.”</p>

      <p>Eventually, my vision goes completely white, and I find myself in a white space that seems to go on forever.</p>

      <p>“Hmm? What’s going on?”</p>

      <p>This is some fantasy stuff. I’ve been teleported somewhere completely different. And if I remember correctly, the same thing happened back at the Sanctuary…</p>

      <p>“Who are you?” comes a voice.</p>

      <p>It’s a girl standing in the white space. She’s a little younger than me, and she’s wearing an all-white dress. Her eyes are a gorgeous shade of violet.</p>

      <p><a id="page-085"></a>“Hey there,” I reply. “Long time no see.”</p>

      <p>Her age has changed, but I’d recognize her anywhere. It’s Violet.</p>

      <p>“Who are you? A new researcher?” she asks.</p>

      <p>“Wait, do you not remember me?”</p>

      <p>“I—I don’t know you.”</p>

      <p>“Oh yeah, that’s right. You did mention something about your memories.”</p>

      <p>“Stay back…”</p>

      <p>The young Violet seems guarded.</p>

      <p>“Hey, there’s no need to be scared. I’m not exactly a good guy, but I’m definitely not some dastardly bad guy.”</p>

      <p>“Wh-what are you doing here?”</p>

      <p>“I dunno. One minute I wasn’t here, the next minute I was. What about you?”</p>

      <p>“I…I… Unghhhhh…” She clutches her head and groans.</p>

      <p>“Are you okay?”</p>

      <p>“I’m… Why…? AhhhhhHHHHHHHHHHHH!”</p>

      <p>She claws at her head and screams.</p>

      <p>It looks like she’s in pain.</p>

      <p>“You don’t have to make yourself remember if you don’t wanna. I forget stuff all the time. I wanna be able to focus on what really matters, so I go ahead and forget stuff that doesn’t in order to save memory space in my brain.”</p>

      <p>“I—I… No… Stop it, make it stop… NooooOOOOOOO!!”</p>

      <p>As she screams, she starts releasing tremendous amounts of magic.</p>

      <p>“Careful there. Like I said, you don’t gotta remember if you don’t want to.”</p>

      <p>I fend off Violet’s magical outbursts and walk toward her.</p>

      <p>“STAY AWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!”</p>

      <p>“What’s up with this magic?”</p>

      <p>I gotta say, I’m shocked. Adult Violet was incredible, too, but this is on a whole different level. Still, deflecting magic attacks this straightforward is a breeze. I walk forward, shifting their vectors before grabbing hold of her.</p>

      <p><a id="page-086"></a>“No, no, no, no, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!”</p>

      <p>“It’s gonna be okay.”</p>

      <p>I hold Violet tight and pour magic into her. It’s the same deal as when I’m healing the possession—the more surface area I’m covering, the more efficient it is.</p>

      <p>“Let go of me… Let go…of me…”</p>

      <p>“Just go ahead and forget all the stuff you don’t wanna remember.”</p>

      <p>I keep pouring magic into her, and eventually, her outbursts settle down. She relaxes and goes limp.</p>

      <p>“But…what about the things I can’t forget?” she asks quietly.</p>

      <p>“Dunno. But if you try real hard not to remember them, you’ll probably forget ’em eventually.”</p>

      <p>“…But I can’t.”</p>

      <p>“Well, that’s a bummer. You’ve calmed down now, though, yeah?”</p>

      <p>“Y…yeah.”</p>

      <p>I let go of Violet, and she hangs her head in embarrassment.</p>

      <p>“Cool. Now, how do I get out of here?”</p>

      <p>“…You’re leaving?” she says.</p>

      <p>When I walk off, Violet pitter-patters along after me.</p>

      <p>“Eventually, yeah. Right now, I’m trying to figure out how.”</p>

      <p>The white space seems to continue forever. There aren’t any obvious exits.</p>

      <p>“Everyone always leaves me,” Violet intones.</p>

      <p>“C’mon, I’m sure that’s not true.”</p>

      <p>“They all died.”</p>

      <p>“Ah. Well, that happens sometimes.”</p>

      <p>“Are you going to die, too?”</p>

      <p>“Nope.”</p>

      <p>I’ve got a good six hundred years left in me, and I’m still searching for a way to bring that number up.</p>

      <p>“Liar.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, maybe.”</p>

      <p>“Please don’t go.”</p>

      <p>“…You know that if I find an exit, you can just come with me, right? <a id="page-087"></a>It’d be easier if I could just blow the whole place up, but I’m sure I’ll figure out something.”</p>

      <p>Last time I tried that, Adult Violet ended up disappearing, too.</p>

      <p>“I can’t leave here.”</p>

      <p>“Ah, bummer.”</p>

      <p>“Please don’t go.”</p>

      <p>“…I’m sure we’ll meet again.”</p>

      <p>“Liar.”</p>

      <p>“That’s not a lie.”</p>

      <p>“Then…let me have that.” Violet points at my pocket.</p>

      <p>I reach in and pull out the red jewel.</p>

      <p>“I dunno. It is <em>mine</em>.”</p>

      <p>“It’s so warm. It makes me feel calmer.”</p>

      <p>“You know it’s just a jewel, right?”</p>

      <p>“It’s not. It’s something far more precious.”</p>

      <p>“It is?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah.”</p>

      <p>Then I hear the sound of a door closing.</p>

      <p>Violet’s whole body shudders.</p>

      <p>It’s weird, ’cause this place doesn’t have any doors, but I definitely just heard one.</p>

      <p><em>“What the hell? Where’d she go?!”</em></p>

      <p>I can hear a voice, too.</p>

      <p><em>“Are you hiding somewhere?! Number <img alt="image" class="mi2" src="../Images/Art_line2.jpg"/>!”</em></p>

      <p>“I—I have to go.”</p>

      <p>“Hey, hold on a sec.”</p>

      <p>Cracks begin splintering across the white space.</p>

      <p><em>“Cut the crap already!! Don’t make me hurt you again—”</em></p>

      <p>“Hold on, I was gonna give you—”</p>

      <p>I grab her hand, and the space shatters into a million tiny pieces.</p>

      <p>“—this.”</p>

      <p>The red jewel I try to hand her tumbles through the air.</p>

      <p>I’m back on the roof where I came from.</p>

      <p><a id="page-088"></a>The white fog, the white space, and the girl in the white dress are all gone.</p>

      <p>The jewel makes a small noise when it hits the ground, and I scoop it up and stow it back in my pocket.</p>

      <p>“I wonder if Violet’s somewhere nearby.”</p>

      <p>I cast out a wave of magic particles and probe for her presence. However, I don’t find her. But I do find something…</p>

      <p>“Are those presences Claire and Alexia?”</p>

      <p>I wonder what they’re doing down there.</p>

      <p class="noindent">“It’s open. Come on, this way.”</p>

      <p>By moonlight, a pair of shadowy figures creeps into the library through a window.</p>

      <p>It’s Alexia and Claire.</p>

      <p>Alexia goes in first and inexpertly surveys the scene.</p>

      <p>Then…</p>

      <p>“Hey, you’re in the way.”</p>

      <p>“Ow!”</p>

      <p>…Claire lands on her from above.</p>

      <p>“What do you think you’re doing? The whole plan was for me to make sure things were safe first,” Alexia quietly grumbles from beneath Claire’s feet.</p>

      <p>“Dawdling puts us in more danger of getting found out than anything. Moving with haste gives the plan a fast pace.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, forget it. Just get off me already.”</p>

      <p>After shoving Claire aside, Alexia stands back up.</p>

      <p>“Come on, Alexia, let’s get moving. We need to make this work, no matter what.”</p>

      <p>“Well, <em>someone’s</em> motivated.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-089"></a>“I’ve got a reason why I can’t afford to lose. I’ve got somewhere I need to return to now.” Claire squeezes her fists tight, eyes full of conviction.</p>

      <p>“…I don’t really follow, but it’s good to hear you’re motivated.”</p>

      <p>Alexia takes the lead, heading deeper into the library and unlocking a door over in the back.</p>

      <p>“Where did you get your hands on that key?” Claire asks her.</p>

      <p>“Being a princess has its perks.”</p>

      <p>“Nice. And this is the forbidden section?”</p>

      <p>Inside, the room is lined with tall bookshelves.</p>

      <p>“No, this is just a storeroom. The forbidden section is farther back.”</p>

      <p>Alexia walks over to one of the bookshelves.</p>

      <p>“That thing is massive,” Claire remarks. “Is that ancient script?”</p>

      <p>“This bookshelf is a magical artifact, and one of the stories my father read to me as a child had the incantation for it.”</p>

      <p>“The what?”</p>

      <p>Alexia takes a deep breath. “Bippity boppity, open sesame!”</p>

      <p>The ensuing silence is deafening.</p>

      <p>“Please stop screwing around.”</p>

      <p>“I-I’m not screwing around! I’m being serious here! The incantation is supposed to open it up!”</p>

      <p>“This is ridiculous.”</p>

      <p>“I might’ve gotten the chant wrong. Could it have been ‘schlongity dongity’—?”</p>

      <p>The moment the words leave her mouth, the bookshelf loudly rumbles open.</p>

      <p>“Wait…that actually worked?”</p>

      <p>“Looks like it was supposed to be <em>schlongity</em>!” Alexia says with a smug grin.</p>

      <p>“Surely it was the first one, and it just took a while ’cause it’s so old.”</p>

      <p>The two of them head through the open bookcase.</p>

      <p>““Whoa…””</p>

      <p>When they enter the forbidden section, they let out cries of amazement. <a id="page-090"></a>There’s a gorgeous chandelier lighting up the towering bookcases within, and while the books they house are old and weathered, that only serves to give them more character.</p>

      <p>“So how do we tell what book is about the academy’s history?” Claire asks.</p>

      <p>She traces her gaze across the seemingly endless array of book spines. If they have to go through them one by one, they’ll end up burning through the whole night.</p>

      <p>“We pray,” Alexia says.</p>

      <p>“This is no time to be messing with me.”</p>

      <p>“I’m not, I swear! We just have to do this…” Alexia begins waving her arms by the side of her head like a lunatic.</p>

      <p>“What in the world do you think you’re doing?”</p>

      <p>“Building the mood. Academy history book, academy history book, academy history book… Schlongity dongity!”</p>

      <p>“This is ridiculous.”</p>

      <p>The next moment, however, a ray of light shoots out, and a book comes soaring down. It comes to a stop in front of Alexia’s face, then opens to its first page all on its own.</p>

      <p>“You’ve got to be kidding me…”</p>

      <p>“See? I told you.”</p>

      <p>“What a stupid artifact. I have half a mind to just smash the thing.”</p>

      <p>“Please don’t. It’s so cute and so helpful.”</p>

      <p>Claire frowns in annoyance. “So what’s it say in the book?”</p>

      <p>“I dunno. I can’t read it.”</p>

      <p>“Let’s see here… Ah, ancient script again.”</p>

      <p>“I can read simple stuff, but this is a bit beyond me. What about you?”</p>

      <p>“I just know the basics, myself. It’s not a very popular subject. Pretty much only the science-track kids take it.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, figures.”</p>

      <p>“So what do we do?”</p>

      <p>“I think this calls for… Schlongity dongity, please translate for us!” Alexia cries out in a cutesy voice and makes a heart shape with her hands.</p>

      <p><a id="page-091"></a>“Ew, don’t be weird. There’s no way that’d ever work.”</p>

      <p>“We won’t know until we try. Who knows what sort of handy functions it has?”</p>

      <p>A creepy voice echoes out from the forbidden section. <em>“Y-y-you want a translation, do you? Hurr-hurr-hurr…”</em></p>

      <p>“Wait—it talks?!”</p>

      <p>“Who’s there?”</p>

      <p>Claire and Alexia look around, but they’re the only ones there.</p>

      <p><em>“I-I-I’m the spirit of the forbidden stacks. I—I can translate for you.”</em></p>

      <p>“Well, hey, that’s the academy’s prized artifact for you.”</p>

      <p>“Ugh… It sounds like a total fatso.”</p>

      <p>“C’mon, Claire, don’t be mean.”</p>

      <p><em>“ </em>Snff<em>… N-now I don’t feel like translating anymore…”</em></p>

      <p>“Look, it’s sulking.”</p>

      <p>“All right, all right! I’m sorry.”</p>

      <p>“Mr. Forbidden Stacks, would you pleeease translate for us?”</p>

      <p><em>“Hunf, hunf, hunf… I-I’ll do my best! Wh-what part do you want done?”</em></p>

      <p>“Well, we were hoping to figure out where Diablos’s right arm is sealed.”</p>

      <p><em>“O-o-oh, it’s beneath the school. Down in the underground ruins.”</em></p>

      <p>“Uh…okay, then. That was easy…”</p>

      <p>“I’m surprised at how competent it is.”</p>

      <p>The floating forbidden book’s pages turn, and the translated text glows in midair before it.</p>

      <p><em>“O-once upon a time, Diablos fought the heroes here. Its arm got cut off and sealed away here. A bunch of other stuff happened, and now the area is in ruins.”</em></p>

      <p>“What kind of other stuff?”</p>

      <p><em>“Apparently, people fought over the arm. The book doesn’t have many details, but it ended with the underground ruins getting hidden away.”</em></p>

      <p>“How do we get into the ruins?”</p>

      <p><em>“Th-there’s a sealed church somewhere on campus. All you have to do is go there.”</em></p>

      <p><a id="page-092"></a>“And where exactly is ‘somewhere’?”</p>

      <p><em>“Hunf, hunf, hunf… I—I can’t tell you anything that isn’t written in the book.”</em></p>

      <p>“Tch, you’re useless…,” Alexia snaps. “Well, at least now we know what the Cult is after. They’re trying to unseal the right arm.”</p>

      <p>“Then why are they kidnapping students?”</p>

      <p>“To undo the seal with, probably. It’s easier to unseal these things with magic that’s similar to the mana used to make the seal in the first place.”</p>

      <p>“So they’re hunting down students to try to find people with compatible magic. Should we look for the sealed church?”</p>

      <p>“…Before that, I need to talk to my sister.” There’s a clear note of resolve in Alexia’s voice.</p>

      <p>“Oh, that’s right, you’re part of the royal family. Why didn’t you just do that from the start?”</p>

      <p>“You seriously think I didn’t?”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>“I tell her about this stuff constantly. I told her about the incident at the school, about what happened at the Sanctuary, everything.”</p>

      <p>“Alexia…”</p>

      <p>“But this time… This time, I finally have proof, and Iris will finally believe me.”</p>

      <p><em>“I-I’m rooting for you, Alexia!”</em></p>

      <p>“Shut up, fatso.” Alexia glares with a look in her eyes that could kill.</p>

      <p><em>“E-eep…!”</em></p>

      <p>“Alexia…we should get out of here. If we stay too long, someone will find us.”</p>

      <p>“Good call. Before we do that, though, does this place have any books about the Cult of Diablos?”</p>

      <p>There’s a brief silence.</p>

      <p><em>“…Not here, no.”</em></p>

      <p>“Okay… Then I guess that’s that, then.”</p>

      <p>“Later.”</p>

      <p><em>“B-bye-bye… Take care, you two…”</em></p>

      <p><a id="page-093"></a>Claire and Alexia find their bodies enveloped in magic, and the next thing they know, they’re back in the original storeroom.</p>

      <p>“Once she sees this book, Iris will have no choice but to—,” Alexia says, clutching the contraband to her chest and stepping out of the room. As soon as she does…</p>

      <p>“And what do you think you’re doing, taking a forbidden book without permission?”</p>

      <p>“<img alt="image" class="mi2" src="../Images/Art_line2.jpg"/>?!”</p>

      <p>Alexia and Claire whirl around in unison.</p>

      <p>There’s a tall old man standing behind a bookcase. His face is long and narrow, and his eyes are sunken and practically goggle out of his head as he glares at them.</p>

      <p>“Y-you’re the head librarian…” Alexia hides the book behind her back, but it’s far too late for that.</p>

      <p>“Taking a forbidden book without permission is a heavy crime, Your Highness, even for one such as you. And that goes double for your non-royal accomplice.”</p>

      <p>Claire scowls when the man’s gaze lands on her.</p>

      <p>She’s going to get suspended, maybe even expelled. Her brother might even take some collateral damage.</p>

      <p>“Should we kill him…?” she asks quietly. There’s no hesitation in her eyes.</p>

      <p>Alexia hurriedly pushes her aside. “L-look, Mr. Librarian, we’ve got a really good reason for this! Would you at least hear us out?”</p>

      <p>“For you, Your Highness, how could I possibly refuse?”</p>

      <p>“Thank you. I really appreciate it.”</p>

      <p>“I know somewhere we can talk. Follow me.”</p>

      <p>With that, the head librarian leaves the library.</p>

      <p>As Alexia follows him, she shoots a hushed question back over her shoulder to Claire. “Okay, so what the hell was that about?”</p>

      <p>“If I get arrested, people will pick on Cid! They’ll bully him and say that his sister’s a criminal! He’s so delicate, he might even end up killing himself…”</p>

      <p>“He won’t. He really, really won’t.” Alexia lets out a sigh.</p>

      <p><a id="page-094"></a>“Do try to pick up the pace, Your Highness,” the head librarian urges.</p>

      <p>“Don’t worry, we’re coming.” Alexia pulls Claire along by the hand and jogs after the man.</p>

      <p class="noindent">“I’m sorry, but how far exactly are you taking us?” Alexia calls to the head librarian. She can see his tall figure proceeding down the darkened corridor.</p>

      <p>“We’re almost there,” he replies.</p>

      <p>“We could have just talked in one of the classrooms, you know.”</p>

      <p>“…Then let’s do it here, shall we?”</p>

      <p>With that, the librarian comes to a stop. He’s smack-dab in the middle of the hallway.</p>

      <p>“Here?” Alexia asks.</p>

      <p>“Why, yes. The preparations are complete.”</p>

      <p>He turns around wearing a faint smile.</p>

      <p>Alexia doesn’t like that smile one bit. She frowns.</p>

      <p>“Alexia…” Behind her, Claire taps her on the shoulder. “The fog…”</p>

      <p>“The what?” Alexia looks around and discovers that the entire hallway is enshrouded in white fog. “Why is there fog in here?”</p>

      <p>The fog rapidly grows denser, and a cracking noise echoes from just out of sight.</p>

      <p>“This is like what happened when I got attacked…”</p>

      <p>“It is?”</p>

      <p>Then the world fractures.</p>

      <p>The sound of glass shattering rings out as the scenery breaks into a million tiny pieces.</p>

      <p>“Wh-what’s going on?!”</p>

      <p>They were just in one of the academy’s hallways, yet their surroundings have completely changed.</p>

      <p>Now they’re in a world enveloped in white fog.</p>

      <p><a id="page-095"></a>A sweet smell drifts through the air.</p>

      <p>“Get your sword ready, Alexia,” Claire urges.</p>

      <p>Alexia does just that.</p>

      <p>“We’re surrounded.”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>Alexia searches for signs of people and discovers a group of them waiting in the fog. The group is slowly approaching while keeping a close eye on them, and it doesn’t look like they come in peace.</p>

      <p>“Good spotting, Claire.”</p>

      <p>“My spirit friend is good at stuff like that.”</p>

      <p>“Ah, got it.” Alexia then turns her sword toward the head librarian and lowers her voice menacingly. “Now, as for you, buddy.”</p>

      <p>The librarian stands in the fog with that same thin smile. “However can I help you, Your Highness?”</p>

      <p>“What exactly do you think you’re pulling here?”</p>

      <p>Alexia is no fool, and any trust she had for him has long since gone out the window.</p>

      <p>“Oh dear. You’re cleverer than I expected.” The librarian pulls out a pair of large machetes, one for each hand.</p>

      <p>“Well, those are grisly old things. Shouldn’t a librarian like you be fighting with pen and paper?”</p>

      <p>“Pens and paper are for depicting ideals. Reality is forged with the blade.”</p>

      <p>With that, he brandishes his twin machetes.</p>

      <p>“I’ll handle the librarian,” Alexia says. “Claire, you handle the others.”</p>

      <p>“Got it.”</p>

      <p>The two of them stand back-to-back with their swords at the ready, and the fight begins.</p>

      <p>A pair of machete strikes comes lashing out from the fog. Alexia dodges half a step back to avoid the first blow, then parries the follow-up strike with her sword.</p>

      <p>“Oh?”</p>

      <p>As the librarian’s eyes go wide, Alexia launches into a counteroffensive. Her form is fluid and unfaltering, and her sword lands a shallow wound on his face.</p>

      <p><a id="page-096"></a>“Well, isn’t this something?” The librarian retreats to where he started from and wipes away the blood running down his cheek. “I must say, I’m shocked. The Princess Alexia I know would never have been capable of such moves.”</p>

      <p>There’s nothing in his voice but genuine praise.</p>

      <p>“Call it a growth spurt,” Alexia replies.</p>

      <p>“Even so, that’s wonderful stuff. Swords carry with them the weight of their wielders’ lives. Before, all you were doing was imitating Princess Iris. Now, though, you’ve taken that instinct and sublimated it. No, perhaps it would be more accurate to say you’ve combined it with something else.”</p>

      <p>“You really think you have time to be psychoanalyzing me?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, absolutely.”</p>

      <p>“Even now?”</p>

      <p>That last comment comes from Claire.</p>

      <p>A number of figures lie crumpled on the ground around her. One by one, they shatter and vanish.</p>

      <p>The head librarian’s eyebrows furrow in surprise. “You took out all seven Seconds? Claire Kagenou… You won this year’s Bushin Festival. You weren’t nearly this strong back then, but now you’re using some sort of strange power.”</p>

      <p>“…You noticed?”</p>

      <p>“I saw you use those red tendrils, yes. How intriguing.”</p>

      <p>Even when he was battling Alexia, he still kept a close eye on Claire’s fight.</p>

      <p>Alexia and Claire square off against the head librarian.</p>

      <p>“Now it’s two-on-one.”</p>

      <p>“Looks like the shoe’s on the other foot.”</p>

      <p>The librarian seems oddly sure of himself. “Does it, now?”</p>

      <p>“You’re strong, but together, we can take you down.”</p>

      <p>“Ah, to be young.”</p>

      <p>“Well, someone’s sure confident.”</p>

      <p>“It’s because I’ve given up.”</p>

      <p>“What?”</p>

      <p>“I’ve given up on swordplay. Ours is a big world, and no matter how <a id="page-097"></a>good you get, there will always be someone better. That’s why I enjoy seeing talented swordplay such as yours. I’m sure the two of you will surpass me in no time.”</p>

      <p>“If you’ve given up, then hurry and surrender already. We’ll make you sing like a bird.”</p>

      <p>Alexia’s comment earns her a weak grin from her foe.</p>

      <p>“Ah, the folly of youth. If you’d just let go of your fixation on swordplay, you would realize that there are plenty of other ways to fight.”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>A sweet smell tickles her nose.</p>

      <p>Then, with a pair of overlapping clangs, Alexia’s and Claire’s swords clatter to the floor.</p>

      <p>“What…?”</p>

      <p>“M-my arms…”</p>

      <p>“That sweet smell is a drug that relaxes the muscles and stifles your magic.”</p>

      <p>The librarian looks down at the two of them as they fall to their knees, unable to resist the drug’s effect.</p>

      <p>“Damn you… I thought we were supposed to be fighting with swords.”</p>

      <p>“You two are bursting with talent, and your futures are bright. That’s why men like me come and steal it all away.”</p>

      <p>The librarian pulls out some rope and binds their arms.</p>

      <p>“Why…?” Alexia asks. “Why are you doing this…?”</p>

      <p>“That’s the question, isn’t it?” he replies.</p>

      <p>“You’re obviously strong, so why debase yourself like this?”</p>

      <p>“I told you, there’s always someone stronger. My sword broke long ago.”</p>

      <p>“It broke? What does that even mean?”</p>

      <p>The librarian gets a faraway look in his eyes. “There once was a dark knight by the name of Fenrir. Have you heard of him, perchance?”</p>

      <p>“Never.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, I suspect you have. There isn’t a person living in this country who hasn’t.”</p>

      <p>Alexia thinks through all the past Bushin Festival participants and <a id="page-098"></a>dark knights who made their name in other nations, but she comes up blank. “A dark knight named Fenrir… You’re not talking about the guy from the legend, are you?!”</p>

      <p>“The very same. He was once known the world over and hailed as the greatest dark knight alive.”</p>

      <p>“Okay, hold on! The dark knight Fenrir lived hundreds of years ago! Plus, people aren’t even sure if he was actually real.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, he was real, all right. And what’s more, he’s still alive today.”</p>

      <p>“But if he’s still alive… You mean he’s using the Beads of Diablos?!”</p>

      <p>Alexia thinks back to what she learned in the Sanctuary—about how there’s a group called the Rounds who use the Beads of Diablos to obtain eternal life.</p>

      <p>“You already know about the Beads? Well, now I <em>really</em> can’t let you live.”</p>

      <p>“What are you going to do to us?”</p>

      <p>“Offer you up as sacrifices. We were planning on leaving the two of you be, but we’ve barely managed to retrieve any possessed as of late.”</p>

      <p>The librarian withdraws a vial of liquid from his pocket and raises it to Alexia’s mouth. There’s a fiercely sweet aroma coming from it.</p>

      <p>“Head off to dreamland now. Off to a sleep you’ll never wake from.”</p>

      <p>“Rgh…”</p>

      <p>Alexia holds her breath and turns her head away, but even so, her consciousness slowly slips into darkness.</p>

      <p>“Alexia!”</p>

      <p>“Cl…aire…”</p>

      <p>That’s when it happens.</p>

      <p>There’s a noise like something being forcefully ripped. It feels as if a powerful pressure is tearing into the world itself.</p>

      <p>Then the ceiling shatters.</p>

      <p>“What is this? What’s going on?” The librarian sets down his vial and looks up.</p>

      <p>A dark figure descends from a crack in the ceiling. After landing with an oddly muted sound, the figure rises to its feet.</p>

      <p>“You…”</p>

      <p><a id="page-099"></a>“It’s you…”</p>

      <p>The man stands alone in the fog, dressed in a black longcoat.</p>

      <p>““Shadow!!””</p>

      <p>His longcoat flutters behind him as he casually draws his sword.</p>

      <p>The librarian readies his machetes with a harsh grimace. “Can’t say I was expecting <em>Shadow</em> to show up in person… Nobody even gave me a warning.”</p>

      <p>Shadow gives him a scathing look. “You’re revolting.”</p>

      <p>“And what about me is revolting, might I ask?”</p>

      <p>“Everything.”</p>

      <p>“…Well, you can say that again.” The librarian scowls, then lets out a laugh that echoes with self-contempt. “My life hasn’t gone the way I hoped. I got swept away in its current, and it broke me. Now I live in shame. If you find me revolting, I have nothing to offer in my defense,” he says calmly. “However, there was meaning to the shame.”</p>

      <p>“…Oh?”</p>

      <p>“There you are, Shadow, standing at my journey’s terminus. A fitting end for a sorry fool who had his sword broken and betrayed his nation.”</p>

      <p>“You’ve made your peace, then.”</p>

      <p>“On some level, I knew this would happen ever since Zenon bit the dust. Here at the end, though, I stand before you a swordsman—now, have at you.”</p>

      <p>He sweeps aside the fog with his oversize machetes and bears down on Shadow.</p>

      <p>The librarian’s words echo back in Alexia’s mind: <em>“Swords carry with them the weight of their wielders’ lives.”</em></p>

      <p>And how radiantly his slash shines.</p>

      <p>“Excellent stuff.”</p>

      <p>Shadow lays his sword in that radiance’s path.</p>

      <p>That’s all it takes.</p>

      <p>Transient and brittle, the huge machetes shatter into pieces.</p>

      <p>“They shattered, did they?”</p>

      <p>Nothing remains save their hilts, which let out a pair of sad clangs.</p>

      <p>Shadow swings his sword.</p>
