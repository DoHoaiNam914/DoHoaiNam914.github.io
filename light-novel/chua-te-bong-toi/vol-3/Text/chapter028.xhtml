<p class="noindent">Claire Kagenou just turned eight this year and has a brother two years younger than her named Cid Kagenou.</p>
<p>Claire herself is an outstanding young girl.</p>
<p>The Kagenou lineage has produced countless dark knights, and as such, expectations on her are especially high.</p>
<p>Her brother, Cid, on the other hand…is depressingly average.</p>
<p>He’s not stupid or anything, and it’s not like he hates exercising. But no matter what they make him do, it all comes out flat and uninspired.</p>
<p>If the two of them were a painting, Claire would be smack-dab in the middle, the focus of the work, and her brother would probably be mistaken for some bystander just passing along behind her.</p>
<p>—A mismatched pair of siblings.</p>
<p>For some reason, realizing that’s how people saw them upset Claire to no end.</p>

<p class="space-break0">In the Kagenou household, dark knight training begins when you’re six.</p>
<p>Claire is eight, so she started two years ago, and she’s already to the point where she’s won a youth tournament.</p>
<p>Her brother Cid just turned six, so he started training recently, too, but…</p>
<p>“Bluuuh… Sis, you’re so strong…”</p>
<p><a id="page-126"></a>Pathetic words tumble out of his mouth as he crawls along the ground.</p>
<p>“C’mon, that was only a light tap. Don’t go crying over something so weak!”</p>
<p>Claire looks down at Cid and prods him with her wooden practice sword.</p>
<p>“H-hey, cut it out…!” Cid squirms, clearly not enjoying himself.</p>
<p>“Look, you <em>can</em> still move. See? The only reason you go down so fast is because you don’t have any guts!”</p>
<p>“This is tyranny…”</p>
<p>“Good grief, you’re pathetic… All right, I just had a great idea.” Claire grabs Cid by the scruff of his neck and starts dragging him off.</p>
<p>Their father watches over their training in the mornings, but after that, he has work, so he leaves them to practice on their own.</p>
<p>They don’t have a choice in the matter, of course.</p>
<p>Cid looks up at Claire as he slides along the ground. “Wh-where are we going?”</p>
<p>“You’re too much of a wimp, so we’re gonna go do some special training to build up your character.”</p>
<p>“S-special training…?”</p>
<p>“Baldy told us, remember? The Scarface Gang is camped out in the forest nearby.”</p>
<p>“Baldy” refers to their father.</p>
<p>Their mother was the first to call him that, and Claire followed her example. Children do learn from their parents, after all.</p>
<p>“Uh-huh, and he told us not to go anywhere near it…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and that’s why we’re going!”</p>
<p>“Huh? That doesn’t make any sense!”</p>
<p>“If we do, you’ll be able to build up some guts!”</p>
<p>“Th-there’s no way! W-we shouldn’t…”</p>
<p>“See, you always wimp out so quickly! I won a tournament, remember? It’s fine, you don’t have anything to be worried about.”</p>
<p>“I-it was a <em>youth</em> tournament… Oh, geez…”</p>
<p>Claire continues dragging Cid along, and eventually they leave the grounds via a side path and make their way to the forest.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break0">The two of them have been walking through the forest for about two hours.</p>
<p>“C’mon, Claire, we should go home, this is dangerous…”</p>
<p>Claire yanks Cid by the hand as she plows forward. “What are you talking about? We just got here!”</p>
<p>“It’s almost noon. Mom’s gonna be worried about us.”</p>
<p>“T-true… If we don’t make it back for lunch, she will be mad.”</p>
<p>Their father might be a baldy, but their mother is a demon.</p>
<p>“Yeah, think of how mad Mom’ll be,” Cid agrees.</p>
<p>“…Fine. Today’s special training is now complete! You feel a little braver now, right?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.”</p>
<p>“I’m doing this all for you, so you should feel thankful!”</p>
<p>“Oh, I do, I do.”</p>
<p>“All righty, let’s head back!”</p>
<p>With that, Claire turns around to head back the way they came—and bumps into someone.</p>
<p>“Hey, no one said there’d be kids round these parts…”</p>
<p>As they hear the deep voice, seven men emerge from the thicket.</p>
<p>Their bodies are clearly trained and their swords are clearly used. These are no ordinary villagers.</p>
<p>“Wait, are you people the Scarface Gang?!”</p>
<p>“Hah, the girl’s heard of us! Sorry, kid…but you ain’t makin’ it home alive.”</p>
<p>They look down at Claire and sneer evilly.</p>
<p>“I—I should be the one saying that to you!” Claire draws her child-size sword.</p>
<p>However, her hands are stiff and shaking.</p>
<p>One of the bandits draws his weapon. “A dark knight to-be, huh? Maybe if we were normal bandits, you coulda pulled something off, but…”</p>
<p><a id="page-128"></a>“Wh-what’s that supposed to mean…?!”</p>
<p>“Bad news, kid, but we ain’t your run-of-the-mill thugs. Every member of the Scarface Gang is a dark knight. We go after all sorts of well-guarded noblemen and companies, and we’ve got an international bounty on our heads of over a hundred million <em>zeni</em>. Even a whole <em>group</em> of dark knights couldn’t take us down.”</p>
<p>Claire glances at her brother trembling beside her, then steps forward to protect him.</p>
<p>“S-so what?!”</p>
<p>“You’re pretty cute, kid, so you’ll probably sell for a decent chunk of change. The boy’s gotta die, though.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare touch a hair on Cid’s head!!”</p>
<p>Claire makes the first move.</p>
<p>She’s far faster than any eight-year-old has any right to be, and she slips in front of the man in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p><em>Clang</em>—a metallic noise rings out.</p>
<p>“Damn, you’re pretty fast.” The man blocks her attack with ease. The two of them lock swords.</p>
<p>“Rgh… Cid, run away!!”</p>
<p>Claire gathers strength in her arms, hoping to buy even a second more.</p>
<p>The moment she does, she suffers a tremendous blow.</p>
<p>“Urk—!”</p>
<p>It’s a kick.</p>
<p>In the middle of their sword-on-sword struggle, the man launches a casual kick her way.</p>
<p>That’s all it takes to smash Claire into a tree and send her crawling across the ground.</p>
<p>The difference between children and adults is despair-inducingly big.</p>
<p>“Gah…”</p>
<p>“Y’know, you weren’t half bad. For a kid, that is.”</p>
<p>“Cid… Run…”</p>
<p>All she wants is to let her brother escape, nothing more. But her wish goes ungranted.</p>
<p>“D-don’t bully my sister!”</p>
<p><a id="page-129"></a>Waving his wooden practice sword around, Cid charges into battle.</p>
<p>“Cid… You can’t…”</p>
<p>A tear drips from her eye.</p>
<p>“Oh, buzz off.”</p>
<p>The man’s sword cleaves toward the young Cid.</p>
<p>When she sees her brother fly into the air and crumple lifelessly to the ground, more and more tears flow from Claire’s eyes.</p>
<p>“No… Cid… Cid…!”</p>
<p>—A precious memory flashes across Claire’s mind.</p>
<p>She was only three at the time, so her ability to understand her surroundings was still developing.</p>
<p>Her parents had taken their eyes off her, and she accidentally knocked over a pot that had been on the fire.</p>
<p>Boiling water came gushing over her head.</p>
<p>She was only three, so there was nothing she could do.</p>
<p>Yet at the very last moment, someone yanked her back from behind. She fell on her back and avoided the water by a hairbreadth. She was saved.</p>
<p>And the one who’d pulled her backward was Cid, even though he was only one year old.</p>
<p>Claire’s memories from that far back were all hazy, but that wasn’t the only time Cid saved her.</p>
<p>Whenever she was about to fall out of a window, whenever a stray dog was about to bite her, whenever she got lost and started to cry, Cid was always there to protect her.</p>
<p>Even though nobody believed her, and even though the memories faded with time, he was always there for her.</p>
<p>That’s why she hated it when people thought of them as mismatched.</p>
<p>She wanted everyone to know just how amazing he really was.</p>
<p>But because of that, she put him in harm’s way.</p>
<p>“Cid… I’m sorry… I’m so sorry…”</p>
<p>As her consciousness begins to fade, Claire stretches her hand toward her brother’s still body.</p>
<p>She thinks she sees him casually stand up, but surely that’s just a trick of the eye.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break0">The dark-haired child stands up as though nothing ever happened.</p>
<p>“Aaand…scene for the side character who runs in like a dumbass to save his sister and gets one-hit KO’d. I pulled that one off pretty well, if I do say so myself.”</p>
<p>“W-wait, I’m sure my slash hit you…”</p>
<p>The bandits gawk at him in confusion.</p>
<p>“Nah, all it hit was some of the slime I’m testing out.”</p>
<p>A lump of slime shimmies down from under the boy’s shirt and flattens out on the ground.</p>
<p>“Huh, slime…?”</p>
<p>“Its durability isn’t exactly up to par. Guess I gotta go collect more.”</p>
<p>The boy sighs in exasperation.</p>
<p>He’s surrounded by bandits on all sides, yet he doesn’t seem afraid in the slightest. What an odd child.</p>
<p>“I was planning on coming and crushing you guys tonight, you know. But my sister does tend to be a bit of a wildcard.”</p>
<p>As he talks, the boy picks up his sister’s dropped sword.</p>
<p>“I ain’t got a clue what to make of this kid. But hey, whatever. This time, I’ll make sure I—”</p>
<p>The man’s voice suddenly cuts off.</p>
<p><em>“Cough</em>—<em>bluh!”</em></p>
<p>He clutches his throat and launches into a coughing fit, hacking up blood.</p>
<p>“Huh…? Why’re you guys so weak?”</p>
<p>Fresh blood drips from the child’s sword.</p>
<p>The man whose throat got sliced collapses.</p>
<p>“Wh-who the hell is this kid—?!”</p>
<p>The bandits, who watched it all play out, draw their swords in unison.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t see his slash! This ain’t no normal kid!”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, circle around him! He’s just a boy, we can surround him and crush—”</p>
<p>“—Exactly.”</p>
<p><a id="page-131"></a>The boy has already made his move.</p>
<p>“Wha—?!”</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, I’m still just a kid.”</p>
<p>The second head gets lopped off.</p>
<p>“B-behind us!!”</p>
<p>Surprised screams sound out.</p>
<p>“My body and magic are both still developing. If you guys surrounded me, that’d be it. I’d have no way to break free.”</p>
<p>The boy’s voice comes from between the trees as a third and fourth head go flying into the air.</p>
<p>“This ain’t real! H-how’s the kid so fas—?!”</p>
<p>“Nah, I’m not that fast. A kid’s body can’t take much more strain than this, see.”</p>
<p>Unable to make out Cid’s movements, the bandits have no way to fight back as he slices off their heads one after another.</p>
<p>Five. Six.</p>
<p>Now, only one bandit remains.</p>
<p>“—Ah, I getcha. You’re right. You ain’t that fast. You’re just makin’ it look like you are.”</p>
<p>A metallic noise rings out, and the slaughter comes to a halt.</p>
<p>The bandit with scars running all across his face is blocking the boy’s sword.</p>
<p>“Your body’s light, so you can accelerate and decelerate like crazy. But your top speed ain’t nothin’ much.”</p>
<p>The bandit leaps backward and puts some distance between them.</p>
<p>“To make up for your body’s shortcomings, you had to catch us by surprise, rattle us, and take us down one by one. Good thinkin’ for a kid your age.”</p>
<p>“Thanks kindly. By the way, does that mean you’re Scarface?”</p>
<p>“That’s me all right. Scarface, in the flesh.” He readies his large knife.</p>
<p>Then he vanishes.</p>
<p>“—Behind you.”</p>
<p>He’s facing the boy from behind. As Scarface brings his oversize knife down, the kid turns and swings his sword.</p>
<p><a id="page-132"></a>The two blades meet—and the boy goes flying.</p>
<p>“You’re light.”</p>
<p>The tiny body spins through the air. Then he makes a graceful, feline landing.</p>
<p>“’Cause I jumped backward. My hands are all tingly now, though.”</p>
<p>The boy shakes his hands like he’s trying to return sensation to them.</p>
<p>“You picked a bad fight, kid. My power, my magic, my speed—all of them are stronger than yours.”</p>
<p>“True enough.” The boy accepts the assertion.</p>
<p>“It’s a damn shame… I may be a washout now, but I once walked the path of the blade, too, so I can tell. If you had ten…no, five more years, you coulda been a dark knight known the world round.”</p>
<p>“Could be.”</p>
<p>“It’s a shame the world’s gotta miss out on that… But my revenge comes first.”</p>
<p>Scarface vanishes once more.</p>
<p>A moment later, his knife whistles through the air and slashes through the boy’s body.</p>
<p>It should have cut him right in half.</p>
<p>“What…?!”</p>
<p>The boy’s body offers no tactile resistance.</p>
<p>The moment Scarface thinks he’s cut the kid in two, the boy’s body disappears.</p>
<p>Then he hears a young voice behind him. “That was an afterimage.”</p>
<p>“Impossible—!” Scarface whirls around to see the boy standing behind him, unharmed.</p>
<p>“Kid’s bodies are fragile, so they hit their limits quickly. Which means all I gotta do—”</p>
<p>The child-issue sword comes slashing down.</p>
<p>“—is break those limits.”</p>
<p>It casts a beautiful silver arc through the air as it strikes at Scarface.</p>
<p>“So fast…!”</p>
<p>It’s a miracle he’s able to bring his knife up to block in time.</p>
<p>Scarface grimaces as the heavy impact makes his hand go numb.</p>
<p><a id="page-133"></a>Now they’re locked blade to blade.</p>
<p>Given Scarface’s strength, he should be able to send the kid flying with ease. However…</p>
<p>“Rgh, I can’t move! Why—?”</p>
<p>No matter how much strength he puts into it, he can’t make the knife move an inch.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the air trembles. The boy’s magic swells up to incredible levels.</p>
<p>“Wh-why’s your magic…?”</p>
<p>The boy’s eyes are glowing red.</p>
<p><em>“Overdrive.”</em></p>
<p>The knife cracks—then shatters into pieces.</p>
<p>The fragments sparkle as they shoot through the air.</p>
<p>Sliced in two, Scarface watches his own blood fly up as he topples to the ground. On his face, his eyes are frozen wide in shock.</p>
<p>The boy looks down and coughs up some blood.</p>
<p>“<em>Cough…</em> Guess that’s too big a burden for a kid’s body to bear.”</p>
<p>He wipes the blood off his lips.</p>
<p>He cleans the blood off the sword.</p>
<p>“I give that thirty out of a hundred. A real shadowbroker would never get pushed so far.”</p>
<p>He sighs.</p>

<p class="space-break0">“Sis, wake up!”</p>
<p>Hearing her brother’s voice, Claire immediately snaps awake.</p>
<p>“Cid—?!”</p>
<p>“Thank goodne—urk!”</p>
<p>Claire tearfully squeezes Cid as tight as she can.</p>
<p>“Oh, Cid, you’re okay! Thank goodness! Oh, thank goodness…”</p>
<p>Her chest is bursting with relief and regret.</p>
<p><a id="page-134"></a>“I’m sorry! I’m so sorry. You must have been so scared.”</p>
<p>“Urk… Grh… Can’t breathe…”</p>
<p>“Cid, Cid, Cid… Wait, what happened to the bandits?”</p>
<p>Claire’s wits return to her, and she glances around.</p>
<p>The bandits are nowhere to be seen. The only things around them are bloodstains.</p>
<p>“Some…some bounty hunters came, and they all ran away. Then the bounty hunters went after them…,” he replies as he struggles in her arms.</p>
<p>“I see… I guess that makes us lucky.”</p>
<p>“Need…air…”</p>
<p>“Thanks for trying to save me, Cid.”</p>
<p>“Uh, no problem. I did get sent flying, though…”</p>
<p>Claire shakes her head.</p>
<p>She’s remembered an important memory she’d been on the verge of forgetting.</p>
<p>“You’ve always been saving me, Cid. Since the very, very beginning…”</p>
<p>That’s what she loves about him.</p>
<p>“I’m going to become stronger. Then, once I’m strong, it’ll be <em>my</em> turn to save <em>you</em>.”</p>
<p>She squeezes him tight, determined never to lose him again.</p>
