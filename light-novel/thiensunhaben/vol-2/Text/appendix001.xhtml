<p class="noindent1">Thank you for picking up this book.</p>
<p>Since this is Volume 2, I imagine you’re probably reading it after Volume 1, so thanks for coming back again. I am the author, Saekisan.</p>
<p>Did you enjoy Volume 2 of <em>Angel Next Door</em>?</p>
<p class="space-break">For the second book, I wanted to write a heartwarming story focused on Mahiru’s feelings as she gradually comes to trust Amane. It’s touching, and frustrating, and sometimes serious.</p>
<p>She isn’t sure if she likes him, but she is certainly interested. Don’t you think a heroine who is self-aware that she’s starting to like someone and gets bashful about it is adorable? She really is (I say, as her doting creator).</p>
<p>Since I’m writing a story in which the two main characters gradually fall for each other, I plan to continue the frustration and anxiety and unintentional flirting. So look forward to that.</p>
<p>For the next volume, I’m (tentatively) considering having the sweet angel act a little devilish.</p>
<p class="space-break">This is a sudden change of subject, but starting from this volume, Hanekoto has taken over full responsibility for the illustrations. I am <a id="page-220"></a>truly grateful for Kazutake, who has been lending us his artistic talents until now.</p>
<p>This time, when I received Hanekoto’s illustrations, I just cackled… I was simply speechless. I don’t know whether I can request special favors, but I think an illustration of Mahiru borrowing one of Amane’s shirts would just be the greatest. Hooray for different body sizes! Of course, all the illustrations are wonderful.</p>
<p>The illustration of him carrying her in his arms was a particular delight to anyone interested in size differences. The contrast between the sizes of their hands was out of this world. Of course, if I listed everything I like about the illustrations, I would run out of space, so regretfully, I must bring that to a close.</p>
<p>I am so happy it hurts, knowing that such wonderful illustrations will adorn my books. Thank you very much, Hanekoto. (No one can tell, but I am bowing very, very deeply.)</p>
<p class="space-break">Well then, we’ve reached the end, but I’d like to give my thanks to everyone who has taken such good care of me.</p>
<p>To the head editors, who worked so hard to get this book published, and to everyone in the editing department at GA Novels, to the proofreader, to Hanekoto, to everyone at the printers’, and to everyone who picked up a copy of this book: Truly, thank you all very much.</p>
<p>Let’s meet again in the next volume! …There is a next volume, right?</p>
<p class="space-break">Thank you for reading to the very end!</p>
