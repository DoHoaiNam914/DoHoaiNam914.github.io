<p class="noindent1">It happened on a Friday, on one of the last days of January.</p>
<p>“…Hmm?”</p>
<p>Amane returned to the living room after cleaning up dinner, but when he looked at Mahiru, he noticed that her cheeks were unusually red.</p>
<p>At first, he thought that maybe the thermostat was set too high, but it was on the same temperature as always, and Mahiru wasn’t wearing particularly warm clothing, either. When he looked closely, he saw that her expression seemed distant and kind of unfocused. Her breathing was also shallower than usual. All signs pointed to her being sick.</p>
<p>When he took a moment to think about it, the weather had gotten much colder lately, and Mahiru, as an honors student, had been busy helping her teacher with some big project. On top of that, she was doing her usual housework and making dinner for the two of them. It wasn’t strange at all for her to fall ill with such a workload.</p>
<p>Amane admonished himself for not noticing her condition earlier. He regretted not paying more attention to her.</p>
<p>“Mahiru, your face is red. Do you think you have a fever?”</p>
<p><a id="page-92"></a>“Of course not.”</p>
<p>Mahiru decisively dismissed Amane’s concerns. Her expression was stiff, and she shook her head, but she couldn’t hide the redness in her cheeks.</p>
<p>Obviously, he couldn’t just take her word for it, so even though he knew that it was rude to touch her without her permission, Amane gently placed the palm of his hand on Mahiru’s forehead, which was usually hidden by her bangs.</p>
<p>As he had expected, her head was much hotter than his palm. Mahiru’s typical body temperature wasn’t that high compared to Amane’s, so it was pretty clear she had a fever.</p>
<p>“You’re hot as the sun.”</p>
<p>“…No, I’m not.”</p>
<p>“All right, how about we take your temperature and confirm it?”</p>
<p>“There’s no need. You’re worrying over nothing.”</p>
<p>Her voice was thin and lacked her usual energy.</p>
<p>“Oh, come on. I can tell by looking at you that you’re running a fever.”</p>
<p>“I’m just a bit flushed.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, then you’ll need to take your temperature and prove it.”</p>
<p>Amane stood up and retrieved a thermometer from the first aid box on the shelf in the living room. He brought it back to Mahiru, but she turned her face away.</p>
<p>She either didn’t want to acknowledge her fever, or she insisted on bluffing.</p>
<p>It was probably one or the other, but Amane couldn’t really proceed until she agreed to have her temperature taken. He stood right in front of the uncooperative Mahiru and placed the thermometer firmly in her hand.</p>
<p>“Mahiru, either I can loosen your clothes and stick the <a id="page-93"></a>thermometer in your armpit, or you can take your own temperature… Which do you prefer?”</p>
<p>Amane put on a very serious face when he made this threat.</p>
<p>Mahiru let out a startled groan and turned her body toward the back of the sofa. She seemed like she had resigned herself to it, and he heard the sound of the thermometer turning on, so just to be safe, Amane also turned his back to Mahiru and waited for her to finish.</p>
<p>Before long, he heard another electronic beep. Amane waited for Mahiru to put her clothes back in order. When he turned around, she was looking at him, expressionless, holding the thermometer in its case.</p>
<p>“…Thirty-seven point two degrees Celsius. A slight fever, all right?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>“It’s only a little higher than usual, and I still feel totally fine, so…”</p>
<p>Amane took the thermometer from Mahiru’s hand and removed it from the case again. The thermometer Amane had used was the type that recorded the previously measured temperature, and when he turned it on again—sure enough, it displayed a temperature more than one whole degree higher than Mahiru had reported.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah? I see thirty-eight point four here.”</p>
<p>She averted her eyes.</p>
<p>“Seriously, have you been running yourself ragged and letting me sit on my butt the whole time? You’re taking all day tomorrow and tomorrow night off. No buts.”</p>
<p>When Amane caught a cold, Mahiru had put him to bed and had him change into pajamas and brought him rice porridge, but he wondered how she would fare doing nothing when it was her turn.</p>
<p>Amane had a relatively sturdy constitution, so he’d simply gone to sleep and woken up feeling better, but if Mahiru didn’t rest and kept <a id="page-94"></a>running around, she would never recover, even from something relatively minor. Mahiru was sick, and that meant no straining herself.</p>
<p>However, Mahiru was still avoiding his gaze. She didn’t seem likely to agree to a strict regimen of bed rest.</p>
<p><em>…So stubborn… Well, I guess there’s no other way, then.</em></p>
<p>Amane extended a hand to Mahiru.</p>
<p>The fever was slowing her down, and it took her a moment to turn to him. Thinking that it would be just perfect if she didn’t resist, Amane put his arms around Mahiru’s back and under her knees and lifted her off the sofa.</p>
<p>Carrying her like a child, so that she had to cling tightly to him, Amane checked that he could hear the sound of jangling keys from Mahiru’s pocket and headed for the door.</p>
<p>“Uh, A-Amane…?”</p>
<p>Mahiru seemed to finally realize that she was being carried, and he heard her flustered voice coming from between his arms.</p>
<p>When Amane stopped for a moment and looked down at her, Mahiru’s cheeks were still red with fever, and she was peering up at him with confusion in her eyes.</p>
<p>“You’re definitely going to push yourself too hard, so I’m going to keep watch until you fall asleep.”</p>
<p>“Y-you’re going to barge into a girl’s bedroom?”</p>
<p>“If you don’t like that idea, you can sleep in my room.”</p>
<p>“…And the option for you to leave me alone…?”</p>
<p>“That ship sailed when you refused to rest.”</p>
<p>Even Amane knew that no matter how close of a friend he was, going into a girl’s apartment, and what’s more, into her bedroom, and standing guard until she fell asleep, would be a serious invasion of her privacy. It was definitely not something he would ever even consider under normal circumstances. But after seeing the way she was acting, he was seriously worried for her health. He just knew that Mahiru <a id="page-96"></a>would run herself into the ground if he didn’t do something. As far as he was concerned, there wasn’t any other option.</p>
