<p class="noindent1">The day before the start of the new semester, Amane was slovenly sprawled out on his sofa, lazily watching the news on television.</p>
<p>He was feeling carefree despite the upcoming school year, both because the weather had settled down into the perfect climate for napping, and because no matter what class he was assigned, he knew his social standing wouldn’t change.</p>
<p>Through eyes blurry from yawning, he stared at the TV, where a serious-looking announcer was reporting on the best times to see the cherry blossoms. The broadcast covered where the viewing was currently best, how many people were expected to go out to see the trees, and which regions were in full bloom. It all sounded very lively.</p>
<p>Apparently, the region he was living in was close to full bloom, too. According to the news report, the flowers had blossomed quite early this year. It was a surprise to see them out before the start of the new semester. It reminded Amane of his hometown, actually, where they usually bloomed this time of year.</p>
<p><em>Cherry blossoms, huh…?</em></p>
<p>Amane had never really cared about the changing of the seasons all that much, but he could understand why some people found it <a id="page-210"></a>charming. He did have some fondness for the cherry blossoms and liked to see the pale petals.</p>
<p><em>Come to think of it, there was a row of cherry trees not that far from here, near the river…</em></p>
<p>Amane slowly sat up.</p>
<p><em>I really loafed around over spring break, huh? I guess I shouldn’t be surprised…</em></p>
<p>Aside from a moderate amount of weight training and some light jogging, he hadn’t gone anywhere or done anything.</p>
<p>Amane had always preferred the indoors, but he’d basically spent the entire holiday sitting in his apartment with Mahiru, so he figured it would probably do him some good to go outside for a change.</p>
<p>He was annoyed that it had taken a news report to get him moving, but today was the last day of spring break, so if he didn’t seize this opportunity, he would have to wait a whole week. Really, he had no choice but to just go for it—no time like the present, after all.</p>
<p>Amane rolled off the sofa and changed into appropriate street clothes. He was going alone, so he didn’t bother getting into mystery man mode.</p>
<p>Since he was just one lone guy, getting ready was simple. After he changed, he grabbed his bag, stuck his phone and wallet inside, then prepared to leave.</p>
<p>Just as Amane opened the door, a ripple of golden hair filled his vision.</p>
<p>“Oh, Amane, where are you going?”</p>
<p>Mahiru was in her usual clothes, so she was probably actually just on her way over to his place. It would be pretty awkward to set off now.</p>
<p>“Mahiru? Oh, I thought I would go for a bit of a walk. It’s the last day of spring break, you know. Today’s it.”</p>
<p>“I see. You were kind of a hermit over the break, weren’t you?”</p>
<p><a id="page-211"></a>“Oh, hush… A-anyway, I won’t be back for a couple hours, so if you want to chill at my place, that’s fine. What are you up to?”</p>
<p>Amane thought that his apartment had more entertainment options, so she might appreciate that, but on the other hand, she would probably feel more comfortable in her own home, so…he decided to leave it up to her.</p>
<p>Mahiru was staring silently up at him. Her eyes suggested that she might have something to say.</p>
<p>Amane wasn’t sure what he was supposed to do. Nervously, he scratched his cheek. “Wh-what’s up? You look like you want to come with me or something.”</p>
<p>Amane had been about to play it off like a joke when Mahiru suddenly nodded.</p>
<p>“…I do.”</p>
<p>“Eh?!”</p>
<p>A shrill, strangled sound spilled out from Amane’s throat.</p>
<p>“But if you don’t want me to…,” Mahiru muttered, “that’s fine, too, I guess.”</p>
<p>“I-it’s not that I don’t you want to… It’s just… How can I put this? If someone sees us together, the rumors will start up again. Aren’t you worried?”</p>
<p>“Rumors are rumors. People are free to think whatever they want.”</p>
<p>“G-got it,” Amane replied, caught off guard by Mahiru’s sudden boldness. “Well, you probably want to go get ready, so how about we leave in an hour?”</p>
<p>Mahiru was wearing her normal, casual clothes. She looked great just like that, but Amane figured that, being a girl, she would probably want time to change. Plus, he decided he ought to go make himself look presentable if he was going to be walking beside her. Otherwise, he would end up causing her double the trouble.</p>
<p><a id="page-212"></a><em>I’d better do something about my hair</em>, he thought as he touched his bangs.</p>
<p>Mahiru frowned, maybe because she had realized the real reason he wanted to delay their departure. “Sorry to make you go through all that trouble for my sake…”</p>
<p>“Eh, don’t worry about it. Besides, it’ll be a good change of pace to take a walk. And I think the scenery will look nicer if you’re walking with me.”</p>
<p>It wouldn’t really take too much effort to clean himself up, and it was worth it to spend time with Mahiru. He thought that she would look even more lovely than the cherry blossoms. Having a beauty like that beside him would make it all worth it, so he didn’t begrudge her the extra effort.</p>
<p>“All right then, so I’ll see you in bit?”</p>
<p>“O-okay.”</p>
<p>Mahiru seemed quite reticent, but Amane just gave her a pat on the head and then ducked back into his apartment to change and work on his hairdo.</p>
<p class="space-break">Both of them were finished getting ready after about an hour, so Amane and Mahiru set off on a leisurely walk.</p>
<p>Mahiru was dressed for spring. Her white dress was adorned with lace, and she wore a light-pink cardigan on top. The dress came to just above her knees, which was a little short for Mahiru, but she had on stockings, so her legs were still covered. She had even gone to the trouble of braiding her hair into a half-up style. For such a simple outing, she had certainly taken the time to compose herself, and Amane couldn’t help but marvel at the beauty walking beside him.</p>
<p>“Is something the matter?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you just look very stylish today, as usual.”</p>
<p>“…Thank you.”</p>
<p><a id="page-213"></a>Mahiru’s cheeks flushed slightly, and she turned away, looking every bit the innocent young damsel.</p>
<p>Owing to her striking appearance, Amane could feel eyes on them as they walked down the road. Mahiru didn’t seem bothered by the attention, but when she looked up at him, he noticed that she was still slightly flustered. “S-so, did you have a destination in mind?”</p>
<p>“Well, I thought we might go down to the river and check out the cherry blossoms. I heard they’ve bloomed earlier than usual this year, and right now is the best time to see them.”</p>
<p>“…Oh really?”</p>
<p>“So I thought I’d go take a look. Does that sound okay?”</p>
<p>“O-of course. I’m following you.”</p>
<p>He felt sort of awkward, but when she gripped his sleeve tightly, all trivial thoughts vanished from his mind.</p>
<p>Her innocent gesture and endearing gaze made his heart leap suddenly in his chest and his breath catch in his throat.</p>
<p><em>…This is really a problem. She’s way too cute.</em></p>
<p>Obviously, Mahiru was quite beautiful, but since he’d gotten to know her, Amane had only grown more infatuated. And when she touched him like that, it only intensified his feelings.</p>
<p>Amane brushed her delicate hand off of his sleeve and clasped his own hand around it, struggling to keep his excitement in check.</p>
<p>“Come on, let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah.”</p>
<p>It was spring break, so there were a lot of people out. As they held hands so they wouldn’t lose each other, Mahiru lowered her gaze bashfully, and Amane squeezed tightly and tried to keep his cool.</p>
<p class="space-break">When they arrived at the riverside not far from their apartment complex, the place was crowded, just like they had expected. For students, it was the final day of spring break, and for adults, it was the perfect <a id="page-214"></a>time for a flower-viewing party. The area bustled with people sitting on tarps and blankets, enjoying the occasion.</p>
<p>The cherry blossoms were nearly in full bloom, and the pale petals danced before Amane’s eyes.</p>
<p>“…Incredible! It’s even better than I expected.”</p>
<p>Amane mumbled to himself as he watched the cherry petals flutter in the breeze. He wasn’t particularly interested in flowers, but he appreciated beauty when he saw it, and the delicate pink petals were undeniably beautiful.</p>
<p>He sighed and glanced over at Mahiru, who was staring wordlessly up at the cherry trees. The breathtaking colors were reflected in her wide eyes. Amane wondered what she was thinking.</p>
<p>“Mahiru?”</p>
<p>When he called out to her, she blinked rapidly, then turned to him in surprise. There was a strange air about her.</p>
<p>“What’s up? You looked like you were zoning out.”</p>
<p>“…N-nothing,” Mahiru answered. “I was just… I was thinking that these really are cherry trees.”</p>
<p>“That’s because they are…,” he said incredulously. “Did…did something happen? You looked sort of different, and… I dunno. I was worried.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s nothing important.” Mahiru frowned. “…I just don’t like…cherry blossoms…or spring very much, you know?”</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry, I didn’t realize. I guess I shouldn’t have invited you.”</p>
<p>Amane immediately regretted taking her, but Mahiru slowly shook her head side to side.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t mean that I hate the flowers themselves or anything… It’s just, when I look at the cherry blossoms, I’m reminded that I don’t have any happy memories of them.”</p>
<p>“No happy memories?”</p>
<p>“Yes, because I didn’t have anyone to make them with.”</p>
