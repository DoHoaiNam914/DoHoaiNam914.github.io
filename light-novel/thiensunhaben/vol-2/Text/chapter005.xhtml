<p class="noindent1"><em>“Can we visit your apartment tomorrow, Amane?”</em></p>
<p>Amane’s father, Shuuto, sent that message at ten o’clock in the evening on January 3—after dinner and after Mahiru had gone home.</p>
<p><em>“It’s all right that you didn’t come home for the holiday, but I do want to see you. Besides, I heard about her from your mother, but I think I’d better say hello to your neighbor myself.”</em></p>
<p>His father probably wanted to meet the person taking such good care of his son. And since Amane’s mother had already discovered his relationship with Mahiru, and was actually in regular contact with her, Amane didn’t see much point in refusing.</p>
<p>He no longer had anything to hide, and he didn’t want to turn his parents away after not visiting for the holidays. Plus, Amane figured that the presence of his father should help keep his mother in check and prevent her from making a big scene. If nothing else, Amane was counting on him to help him avoid a repeat of her last exhausting visit.</p>
<p>Besides, Amane had a feeling that even if he did refuse his parents, his mother would come over to see Mahiru anyway, so after <a id="page-30"></a>setting up a time with his father (who had been courteous enough to ask in advance) Amane sent Mahiru a heads-up message.</p>
<p class="space-break">“Um, well, is it all right for me to be there during your family time? Won’t I be intruding?”</p>
<p>The next day, Mahiru came over to Amane’s apartment early. She seemed nervous.</p>
<p>That was only to be expected, in a way. Mahiru had been taking care of him…though phrasing it that way sounded a bit misleading… In any case, Mahiru had been spending a lot of time with him, and now his parents wanted to meet her.</p>
<p>She was already used to talking with his mother, or at least being talked at by his mother, but Amane’s father would be joining this time. It was no surprise that she was nervous.</p>
<p>“Well, now that Dad is coming to say hello, and since Mom has taken such a liking to you, I’d appreciate it if you were here. Really, I need you here.”</p>
<p>“Y-you say that, but…”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you would rather avoid it, but it’d really mean a lot to me if you’d put up with it just for a little while.”</p>
<p>It was somewhat surreal to be introducing her to his parents, but they’d requested, and now there was no way around it.</p>
<p>He felt bad for taking up Mahiru’s time, but he knew that his father was the type of person who likely wouldn’t rest until he’d met her, so he hoped she wouldn’t mind it too much.</p>
<p>“…I wonder what Shihoko has told him about me.”</p>
<p>“Relax. I made sure to tell my dad that you are someone who helps me out a lot. Even if he gets the wrong idea, I’ve already told him that my mother’s crazy ideas about you are not at all true.”</p>
<p>Amane’s mother seemed to have already decided that Mahiru was his bride-to-be and her very own future daughter-in-law. Amane had <a id="page-31"></a>made sure to firmly deny everything coming out of her mouth. His father had laughed and said, “Shihoko has always had the bad habit of letting her imagination run wild.” So apparently, he understood the situation.</p>
<p>Mahiru seemed relieved to hear that, and Amane smiled wryly as they waited. “Sorry about this.”</p>
<p>Then, with perfect timing, the intercom rang.</p>
<p>His parents had already gotten past the lobby with their duplicate key, so he expected that they had come directly to his door.</p>
<p>At the sound of the chime, Mahiru shuddered in surprise, so Amane shot her a small smile to put her at ease and headed for the door. He took the chain off and unfastened the lock.</p>
<p>When he opened the door, there stood his parents, just as he remembered them.</p>
<p>“It’s been half a year, Amane.”</p>
<p>“Long time no see, Dad.”</p>
<p>Amane greeted Shuuto’s amicable smile with a slightly relieved grin of his own.</p>
<p>With his gentle demeanor, Shuuto was the type of person who somehow calmed things down just by being around. Amane relaxed a little simply seeing him there.</p>
<p>“You didn’t seem nearly as happy to see your mother…,” Shihoko said.</p>
<p>“That’s because my mother forced her way in without so much as a warning. If you’d ever give me any notice, I would react normally.”</p>
<p>The last time Shihoko had shown up, Mahiru had been at his place, and he’d tried to turn her away. If he’d been alone, he probably would have treated her a little nicer.</p>
<p>“Well anyway, come on in,” Amane added. “What’s with the package?”</p>
<p>“Oh, we brought you all sorts of things. But we can look at that later. Where’s Mahiru?”</p>
<p><a id="page-32"></a>“Inside,” Amane answered succinctly. After his parents had removed their shoes, he led them into the living room.</p>
<p>Mahiru seemed anxious as she looked over at them and blinked, wide-eyed, in understandable surprise.</p>
<p>Amane’s father looked remarkably young. He didn’t seem to be much past thirty, especially if you forgot that he had a teenage son, and had a youthful, handsome face. More than once, Amane had wished that he took more after his father, whose tender features made him seem like a well-mannered young man (though in actuality, he was middle-aged). When the two of them walked side by side, they looked more like distant brothers than father and son.</p>
<p>“Mahiru dear, it’s been too long,” Shihoko said.</p>
<p>“‘Too long’? It’s only been a month!” Amane remarked.</p>
<p>“I think that counts.” Shihoko approached Mahiru wearing a beaming smile.</p>
<p>Mahiru stood straighter and greeted her with a formal “How good to see you again,” wearing the faint smile that was an integral part of her public persona.</p>
<p>But her bewildered eyes were still straying toward Amane’s father, standing next to Shihoko. Shuuto smiled warmly when he noticed Mahiru looking.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you. I’m Amane’s father, Shuuto Fujimiya. I’ve heard about you from Shihoko, Miss Shiina. Thank you for taking such good care of our son.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you. I’m Mahiru Shiina. And I appreciate everything Amane does for me as well.”</p>
<p>Shuuto bowed politely, and Mahiru introduced herself courteously.</p>
<p>Mahiru had probably been worried that Amane’s father would be a lot like his mother, but Shuuto was a mild-mannered man with a <a id="page-33"></a>good head on his shoulders, and he was doing his best to put Mahiru at ease.</p>
<p>Shuuto was generally the one who reined in Shihoko’s wilder tendencies. Really, he was the only person she would listen to, which proved just how much she loved him.</p>
<p>“Goodness, you don’t have to be so modest!” Shihoko interrupted. “Amane is a slob, after all.”</p>
<p>“Geez, sorry I don’t meet your standards…,” Amane muttered.</p>
<p>“Come now, Shihoko, don’t say things like that,” his father said. “…And, Amane, this girl is taking care of you day in, day out, so I’m sure you’re showing her the appropriate gratitude and appreciation, right?”</p>
<p>“As best I can.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I like to hear.”</p>
<p>Shuuto, who had raised Amane to treasure women, had apparently been worried over whether his son was being considerate enough. Of course Amane would have found it unbearable to kick back while Mahiru did everything, so he did whatever he could for her.</p>
<p>Shuuto seemed reassured by Amane’s answer and turned his gaze toward Mahiru again.</p>
<p>“…Truly, I must offer you my thanks. I hear you’ve been fixing my son’s meals every day, and you were even kind enough to make <em>osechi</em> dishes for the holiday…”</p>
<p>“I’m always thanking her for that. I’ve been trying to show my appreciation every chance I get, too.”</p>
<p>“It’s true…” Mahiru nodded. “Amane’s surprisingly considerate.”</p>
<p>“Surprisingly?” Amane asked. “And what’s so surprising about it?”</p>
<p>“Th-that is, I—I mean…,” Mahiru stammered. “You seemed…a bit neglectful at first glance, but it turns out you actually pay rather close attention.”</p>
<p><a id="page-34"></a>Amane found himself at a loss for words, unable to refute anything she said.</p>
<p>“The most important thing is that the two of you are getting along well,” Shuuto said with a gentle smile. “Amane, make sure you’re not being too much of a bother to Miss Shiina.”</p>
<p>“…I know that.”</p>
<p>“And, Miss Shiina, I’d like you to speak up right away if Amane gives you any trouble. My son might not seem like it, but he’s really quite an earnest young man, so I believe he’ll do his best to smooth over any…rough patches.”</p>
<p>“Amane is a nice guy. I can’t think of anything rough about him…well, maybe just a tiny bit…”</p>
<p>“He’s not exactly the smoothest, eh?”</p>
<p>“No…he’s not really disagreeable…more like, he’s just a little hopeless.”</p>
<p>Mahiru was fidgeting as if she was having a hard time saying what was on her mind. It made Amane want to cross-examine her.</p>
<p><em>What exactly is so hopeless that you had to say it like that?</em></p>
<p>For some reason that Amane didn’t understand, Shihoko seemed to grasp what Mahiru getting at. She looked over at him with a broad grin. “Ah-haah!”</p>
<p>Amane couldn’t do much more than glare at his mother in irritation.</p>
<p class="space-break">“Here you are.”</p>
<p>Amane’s parents were guests in his apartment, so it was only natural to treat them as such. However, Mahiru had insisted on being the one to set out the tea, so Amane had left it in her capable hands.</p>
<p>Mahiru had brought her tea set over to his apartment so she could use it whenever she visited. Amane had never imagined it would be used for this, though.</p>
<p><a id="page-35"></a>Both of his parents were wearing warm smiles, seated on the sofa where Amane and Mahiru usually sat together.</p>
<p>“My goodness, thank you, Mahiru dear. You’re quite skilled at hosting visitors, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes.”</p>
<p>“Though, really, that should be Amane’s job, you know?”</p>
<p>Mahiru was doing it because when Amane tried brewing tea, it usually turned out much too bitter.</p>
<p>Still, Shihoko looked somewhat aghast.</p>
<p>“No, I wanted to do it, but…”</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose that’s fine, since Amane never gets the water temperature right.”</p>
<p>His mother was absolutely correct, but it made him a little irritated that she pointed it out so blatantly.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t deny the truth, so he stoically kept his mouth shut as Shihoko turned to him and smiled.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, Amane, you’ve finally started calling sweetie Mahiru by her first name, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>At this sudden observation, both Amane and Mahiru froze.</p>
<p>They had grown so comfortable talking to each other that they hadn’t noticed, but last time they had seen Amane’s mother, the two of them had still been addressing each other quite formally.</p>
<p>“…What’s it matter?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s great!” His mother beamed. “It’s nice that you’re getting more intimate.” Without pressing the issue any further, Shihoko just sat and beamed at them.</p>
<p>Amane could feel his cheek begin to twitch. He almost wished she would just make fun of him. It would have been easier than dealing with his mother’s wild assumptions and fabricated narratives.</p>
<p>“Shihoko dear, don’t tease Amane so much,” Amane’s father interjected. “It’s a bad habit of yours,” he added.</p>
<p><a id="page-36"></a>“All right, honey. You know I just can’t help myself.” Amane’s mother capitulated to his father without much resistance, a fact for which their long-suffering son was acutely grateful. “But it’s wonderful, isn’t it? To see our son getting on so well with a cute girl?”</p>
<p>“I’m more concerned about whether you might get carried away again, Shihoko darling.”</p>
<p>“When that happens, you’ll step in for me, won’t you, Shuuto darling?”</p>
<p>“On some level, I wish you’d work on it if you’re already aware it’s an issue…but that’s also part of what makes you the woman I fell in love with, so I suppose there’s no helping it.”</p>
<p>“Ho-ho…what a sly fox you are.”</p>
<p>Even though he was glad Shihoko had eased up on him, Amane couldn’t help but sigh as his parents drifted off into their own little world.</p>
<p>His father was fundamentally a sensible man, but he had the unfortunate habit of doting on his treasured wife, which sometimes made it a little awkward for anyone else stuck in the same room.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they only did this in front of family and didn’t act so embarrassingly in public. On the other hand, this was supposed to be Amane’s apartment, and he wished they would show a little more restraint. He was glad that his parents still had a strong relationship after so many years together, but they could have been more considerate about their public displays of affection.</p>
<p>Whenever they got like this, Amane didn’t like to force himself in between them, so he simply sat down in the chair he had brought over from the dining room and sighed deeply again in resignation.</p>
<p>Mahiru also took a seat in the chair he had set up next to his, and asked Amane quietly, “…Your parents get along very well, don’t they?”</p>
<p><a id="page-37"></a>“Sure do. I mean, they’re not like that outside, but that’s definitely how they are at home.”</p>
<p>“I see,” Mahiru answered with a peculiar smile, then looked over at Shihoko and Shuuto.</p>
<p>She didn’t seem uncomfortable at all—just the opposite, in fact. Mahiru looked like she was staring at something dazzling and priceless. Amane thought he saw a touch of envy in her gaze as she smiled so faintly that the word <em>fleeting</em> didn’t do it justice. Without thinking, Amane extended a hand toward hers—</p>
<p>“Oh, Amane, what is it?”</p>
<p>He immediately withdrew his hand as the sound of Shihoko’s voice pulled him back to his senses.</p>
<p>“Don’t ask me. You and Dad went off into your own world. The two of us could barely stand to look at you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, are you jealous?”</p>
<p>“Not a chance. I was just thinking that you should get a room. In the privacy of your own home, preferably.”</p>
<p>His mother didn’t seem to have noticed that he had been on the verge of grabbing Mahiru’s hand. Mahiru also seemed not to have noticed and forced a smile at Amane’s words.</p>
<p>He didn’t understand why he had instinctually reached out toward her. For some reason…he had felt like he couldn’t bear the thought of leaving Mahiru all alone.</p>
<p>She was already back to her usual self, so Amane felt slightly relieved and put on his usual surly expression so that no one would be any the wiser.</p>
<p>“So are you satisfied now, having seen your son’s face?” Amane demanded.</p>
<p>“I’m more satisfied seeing sweet Mahiru than you, Amane…” His mother leered.</p>
<p><a id="page-38"></a>“Hey…”</p>
<p>“I’m only joking. We still haven’t accomplished our real mission yet, you know.”</p>
<p>“Your real what now…?”</p>
<p>Amane had assumed that they had come over to simply exchange New Year’s greetings and meet Mahiru, but his mother seemed to have some other goal in mind.</p>
<p>“You and Mahiru haven’t been on your first shrine visit of the year yet, right?”</p>
<p>“We were planning to go after the crowds die down.”</p>
<p>“I knew it! And you haven’t been yet, either, right, Mahiru? I asked in my message.”</p>
<p>“Right.” Mahiru nodded.</p>
<p>“I thought that would be the case, so we brought kimonos!”</p>
<p>Apparently, his mother wanted to go on a shrine visit with Mahiru.</p>
<p>Shihoko was wearing a wide grin as Amane finally realized the reason why she had brought such a large bag with her. He sighed again. He’d lost count of how many times today.</p>
<p>Shihoko loved cute things, and she loved playing dress-up, so she’d probably been waiting for a chance like this.</p>
<p>Amane also recalled that his mother had a large number of kimonos at home. Apparently, she had brought some with her.</p>
<p>“I’ve always dreamed of putting a kimono on a daughter and going on a shrine visit together… Oh, I’m sure this one will suit you, Mahiru.”</p>
<p>“Mom, you just want a dress-up doll.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true! But I really do want to dress up Mahiru. Look, this one would suit her so well!” Shihoko was full of confidence, and her opinion was correct, insofar as there were hardly any clothes that wouldn’t suit Mahiru.</p>
<p><a id="page-39"></a>Amane had seen her in everything from boyish outfits to fancy getups on top of her usual girly outfits that featured plenty of frills and lace. As far as he could remember, each and every style seemed to suit Mahiru just fine. Apparently, beautiful people didn’t need to be choosy about what they wore. It was not hard to imagine that traditional Japanese clothes would really suit her as well.</p>
<p>Amane was an only child, so his mother was obviously not going to pass up this chance to dress up the daughter of her dreams.</p>
<p>“…Well, if Mahiru says it’s all right, how about you dress her up and go?”</p>
<p>“Why are you talking like you’re not coming, Amane?”</p>
<p>“I can’t; it’ll be trouble if I go out with Mahiru and people from school see us together.”</p>
<p>If it was only his parents and Mahiru, they would just look like any other family going on a shrine visit, so it wouldn’t rouse any suspicions, but if Amane joined them, and someone from their class spotted him at the shrine with Mahiru, well, he imagined that the start of the winter semester would turn into something out of a nightmare.</p>
<p>No shrine visit was worth that risk.</p>
<p>“So it’ll be all right as long as no one finds out?”</p>
<p>“I suppose, but I’m pretty sure it’d be really… Uh, wait. I don’t like where this is going, Mom…”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh! I came prepared for situations just like this!”</p>
<p>“What situations?!”</p>
<p>He had thought that she’d brought an awful lot of luggage for only kimonos and underclothes and accessories. Apparently, she had brought even more stuff so she could play dress-up with Amane as well.</p>
<p>“Your father is also very excited, you know.”</p>
<p>“Dad…”</p>
<p>“We don’t get to go out together very often,” Amane’s father <a id="page-40"></a>said, “and it is our family’s tradition, after all, so I’d like us to all go together.”</p>
<p>When he put it that way, it was difficult to refuse.</p>
<p>Amane’s father cared a great deal about family traditions. He would feel bad for refusing to go along after both his parents made it clear how much they wanted it.</p>
<p>“But look—”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, dear. You just let your mother take care of it. I’ll make you look like a stylish young man. I promise you won’t even resemble the old Amane!”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that basically the same as saying I’m not stylish now?”</p>
<p>“Of course, you’ve got good features because you take after your father, but your haircut and clothes are so unfashionable. I’d say you look gloomy.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t ask.”</p>
<p>Amane was painfully aware of his drab appearance, but he looked like this because he liked to, so he didn’t appreciate the criticism.</p>
<p>“You’d think that someone so handsome would have an easy time looking cool, but you’re a troublesome case, Amane…”</p>
<p>“That’s none of your business.”</p>
<p>“It’s such a waste…right, Mahiru dear? Wouldn’t you like to see Amane all tidied up?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>As the conversation suddenly shifted to her, Mahiru became visibly flustered.</p>
<p>Amane wished that his mother wouldn’t prod at Mahiru so aggressively, but she continued needling the poor girl.</p>
<p>“Once Amane is all dressed up, I think you’ll see him in a whole new light, too, Mahiru. He may not look it, but Amane’s got a fairly handsome face, you know? Personality-wise, he’s got some work to do, <a id="page-41"></a>but he does resemble Shuuto, and he knows how to be a gentleman, so if you train him well, I think he could turn out quite nice.”</p>
<p>“Ah, um…I…suppose so…?” Mahiru stammered.</p>
<p>“And don’t you want to go on the first shrine visit of the year together?”</p>
<p>“W-well I…um…I do want to go, but…”</p>
<p>“Hey, how could you double-cross me like that?” Amane whined.</p>
<p>He’d been counting on her to consider what might happen in the worst-case scenario and reject his parents’ proposal.</p>
<p>Mahiru glanced at the beleaguered Amane. “…If Amane doesn’t want to, it’s fine,” she said in a quiet, slightly discouraged voice, frowning.</p>
<p>Amane choked. She was trying to hide it, but he could tell that Mahiru was disappointed. It wasn’t anything dramatic; just a subtle change in her expression. Looking at her long eyelashes fluttering over her downcast eyes, Amane felt a powerful knot of guilt tighten in his chest.</p>
<p>His mother shot him a look of condemnation, as if to say <em>You made sweet Mahiru sad!</em> and his father wore an expression that said <em>It would be easier to fold here.</em></p>
<p>Amane groaned quietly and simply said, “…All right.”</p>
<p>When Mahiru made a face like that, there was nothing to do but give in.</p>
<p class="space-break">“Okay, you’re all set.”</p>
<p>Shihoko had been tinkering wildly with Amane’s hair and clothes, until he was quite exhausted by the time he was finally set free.</p>
<p>It had been pure agony for him, who wasn’t much interested in clothes, but when he checked himself in the mirror, he could see that his suffering had been worth it. Staring back at him was a handsome young man, completely unlike the usual Amane.</p>
<p><a id="page-42"></a>The outfit Shihoko had chosen for him was a dark-gray Chesterfield coat over a white turtleneck, paired with black slacks—clean and casual.</p>
<p>Since this was supposed to be an auspicious New Year’s event, she had apparently thought it was critical that he dress up a little. Amane usually didn’t like especially colorful clothing, so this subdued, monochrome arrangement pleased him.</p>
<p>He checked his hairstyle, too, and saw that his mother’s skill with a flat iron and some styling wax had really worked wonders with his long bangs. His eyes had emerged from their usual hiding spot behind his hair, and the impression he gave off was much brighter now that you could actually see his whole face. The extra volume in his hair plus the excellent styling made him look more dignified and refined as well.</p>
<p>The person in the mirror wasn’t the Amane who got teased by his mother and Itsuki for being gloomy, but a bright young man who Amane had never seen before.</p>
<p>“You can turn into such a good-looking young man with just a little work, so I wonder why you don’t do it?”</p>
<p>“Because I don’t want to.”</p>
<p>“You can really be such a grouch sometimes. Your face is usually dour, so unless you smile, you won’t look good, you know?”</p>
<p>Being called dour stung, but Amane couldn’t argue with the facts.</p>
<p>“All right, I’m going to go put the finishing touches on Mahiru, so you go wait in the living room.”</p>
<p>Amane had been busy in his room, so he didn’t have any idea how Mahiru was getting on. She had gone back to her apartment to dress herself, presumably to quite a high standard.</p>
<p>He watched his mother leave the room, then looked himself over in the mirror again.</p>
<p><a id="page-43"></a>He hadn’t gotten dressed up like this in a long time, so he didn’t resemble himself.</p>
<p>“…Well, I guess it’s not bad.”</p>
<p>He was sure he’d still look shabby standing next to Mahiru, but this was a big improvement.</p>
<p>Playing with his bangs a little, now that they weren’t hanging in front of his eyes, Amane muttered under his breath that sprucing himself up like this from time to time probably wouldn’t be a bad thing.</p>
<p class="space-break">After waiting in the living room with his father for the better part of an hour, Amane heard the front door open.</p>
<p>He had heard that women’s preparations could take quite a lot of time and effort, so he hadn’t been particularly unhappy with the wait itself, but he was still a bit worried about leaving Mahiru alone and whether his mother might have crossed any lines.</p>
<p><em>Finally</em>, thought Amane as he stood up from the sofa and looked toward the entryway, just as Mahiru quietly arrived in the living room.</p>
<p>The moment he laid eyes on her, he was stunned.</p>
<p>Mahiru didn’t normally wear traditional Japanese clothing, so he had never had the chance to see her in it.</p>
<p>He had thought for sure that a kimono would look good on her, but—he hadn’t expected this.</p>
<p>According to his mother, it would be difficult to move through a crowd in a long-sleeved kimono, so she had chosen something shorter. With its light-pink color and small, repeating pattern of plum blossoms, the kimono suited Mahiru so well that it was hard to believe it didn’t actually belong to her.</p>
<p>Mahiru didn’t normally wear much pink, but it gave her an air of refinement and femininity.</p>
<p><a id="page-44"></a>Her light-colored hair had been left out in long bangs on the sides, and the rest had been gathered into a bun and decorated with a <em>kanzashi</em> hair clip. Swaying across the pure-white nape of her neck, the accessory accentuated the girlishness of the ensemble and gave her a distinctly feminine allure.</p>
<p>The elegant outfit, coupled with makeup that had been judiciously applied to enhance her natural good looks, elevated Mahiru to the pinnacle of grace and beauty.</p>
<p>“So?” Amane’s mother beamed. “I think we made her look very cute. Sweet Mahiru is so lovely to begin with, and dolling her up really had quite the effect.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it certainly suits her, dear,” his father quickly agreed.</p>
<p>Mahiru had her eyes cast downward, looking rather embarrassed by all the praise. Even that movement had something alluring about it.</p>
<p><em>Beauty can really be terrifying.</em></p>
<p>“Come on, Amane, say something.”</p>
<p>“I think it looks good.”</p>
<p>There was obviously no way he could possibly say what he really thought, especially not right there in front of his parents, so Amane kept his praise safely subdued.</p>
<p>His mother looked extremely dissatisfied.</p>
<p>“…That won’t do at all!” she insisted.</p>
<p>“Oh, be quiet.” Amane turned away. He was not going to engage with his mother any further.</p>
<p>Shihoko gave an exasperated sigh at her son’s behavior, but perhaps because she knew him quite well, she seemed to agree to let it go.</p>
<p>“Good grief. Anyway, Mahiru darling, what do you think? Amane looks like a whole new person, right?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes. This is completely different…”</p>
<p><a id="page-45"></a>“And to think even though he would be so popular if he put in the effort to look like this all the time, he doesn’t ever bother. Really, he’s only harming himself.”</p>
<p>Amane thought this was none of her business, but his mother sighed heavily again, as if she truly regretted the loss of potential.</p>
<p>“I’m so disappointed in Amane—he has the good fortune to take after his father, and yet he doesn’t even try to put it to good use. What a waste!”</p>
<p>“Come now, Shihoko,” his father said gently. “Amane’s growing up in his own way.”</p>
<p>“If he’s growing up, then shouldn’t he want to be popular?”</p>
<p>“If I had to guess, I’d say Amane is the type who is perfectly fine spending time with just one other person rather than bothering with a crowd.”</p>
<p>“I guess.”</p>
<p>Amane’s father had tried to stall Shihoko, but that only fueled her wildest delusions.</p>
<p>It was true Amane preferred to hang out one-on-one rather than tag along in a big group… Apparently, that was something he had gotten from his father, and he really did think it was best, but if he said as much, especially now, it would sound like he was saying the person he preferred most was Mahiru…</p>
<p>His mother’s radiant smile turned into a grimace, and she turned away.</p>
<p>Amane wondered why he had to put up with her unfair cynicism, but as a practical matter, he was well aware that other people looked at him the same way.</p>
<p>At the very least, Amane could say that Mahiru was a special case. That was the truth, but—</p>
<p>He snuck a glance at Mahiru, quickly, so she wouldn’t notice, and sighed softly.</p>
<p><a id="page-46"></a><em>I guess I do like her, in a sense</em>, he thought. <em>I mean, what’s not to like about her?</em></p>
<p>However, that was quite a different matter than declaring feelings of love.</p>
<p>“Mom, there is absolutely nothing going on, I’m telling you. So how about you stop it with the crazy accusations and go get the car ready.”</p>
<p>“What an ungrateful child you are…really! Well, all right, I suppose. Shuuto, let’s go prepare the car, shall we?”</p>
<p>“Sounds like a plan.”</p>
<p>Amane had apparently succeeded in changing the subject, as both parents left to make ready for their departure.</p>
<p>He was leaving it up to his parents to decide which shrine they were going to, and he watched their backs as they left his apartment to head for the parking lot.</p>
<p>“…I’ve got the essentials in my bag, so I don’t need much getting ready. How about you, Mahiru?”</p>
<p>“Everything I need is in this handbag, so I’m ready, too.”</p>
<p>“Gotcha.”</p>
<p>They were suddenly alone again, so with a slightly anxious feeling, Amane locked up the windows and unplugged nonessential appliances from the walls.</p>
<p>Once he had turned off the living room lights, he looked at Mahiru again.</p>
<p>As always, it was immediately apparent she was a beauty. He doubted whether there was another girl in the world who looked as good in a kimono.</p>
<p>He hadn’t been comfortable praising her in front of his parents, but Amane was sure that anyone who saw her would agree that Mahiru was particularly beautiful in traditional Japanese dress.</p>
<p>“Is something the matter, Amane?”</p>
<p><a id="page-47"></a>“Oh, no, I was just thinking it really suits you. You look like an old-fashioned beauty from a painting or something. The outfit’s cute, and I think you’re really lovely.”</p>
<p>He had learned from his father that when a girl was smartly dressed, compliments were in order, so he knew he should have praised her look the moment he saw her, but he had been too embarrassed to do it in front of his parents.</p>
<p>Once Amane had voiced his honest appraisal, Mahiru dramatically blinked several times, then blushed and pursed her lips tightly.</p>
<p>Recalling the last time she had reacted like that, Amane smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>“Ah, you don’t like being complimented, right? Sorry.”</p>
<p>“Th-that’s not it, but… Amane, you’re fairly—”</p>
<p>“Fairly what?”</p>
<p>“…It’s nothing.”</p>
<p>She abruptly turned away.</p>
<p>Amane wondered what was going on with her, but she didn’t look like she was going to elaborate, so Amane quietly finished closing up the apartment and accompanied Mahiru to the door.</p>
<p>She seemed to have given some thought to the fact that they’d be walking around, because she was wearing boots instead of the traditional sandals. Her choice of footwear blended Japanese and western elements in her outfit, and she looked all the more adorable for it.</p>
<p>Mahiru somehow wiggled into her boots, as her hair accessory swung back and forth with a rustling sound, and Amane, who had gone out first to hold the door, found himself suddenly quite close to her.</p>
<p>Mahiru caught him by surprise when she stood up on her tiptoes and gingerly leaned even closer to him.</p>
<p>Thinking that maybe she wanted to tell him something, Amane <a id="page-48"></a>shut the door and locked it, then bent over to lend her his ear. Mahiru cupped her palms around her mouth and whispered into his ear.</p>
<p>“Amane—”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Um… You look good, too, you know?”</p>
<p>That was all she said before slipping past him and briskly heading for the elevator. Amane promptly banged his head against his front door.</p>
<p>“…That’s not fair.”</p>
<p>Amane’s heart was pounding like an alarm going off in his chest, his face was burning, and his forehead hurt. Mahiru had set him ablaze in a single breath. This was her revenge.</p>
<p>His parents looked at him suspiciously as he hustled to catch up to them in the parking lot.</p>
<p class="space-break">When they arrived at a famous shrine located in an area a little less than an hour away, there weren’t as many people as they had seen on television, but the crowds still seemed practically endless.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s thinned out quite a bit, but I’d say there are still plenty here, eh?” Amane’s mother remarked.</p>
<p>“There sure are…,” Amane agreed.</p>
<p>“Mahiru darling, careful not to stray. We’ll keep an eye on you, too, and we all have smartphones, so I think finding one another would be easy enough. But even so, I want us all to visit the shrine together, of course.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Dressed in a kimono, Mahiru had the hardest time moving out of all of them. The restrictive garment forced her to take small steps and walk slowly. At least she was wearing boots instead of sandals.</p>
<p>They didn’t necessarily have to push their way through the crowd, <a id="page-50"></a>but it was tight enough that it was easy to run into people, so they had to proceed with caution.</p>
