<p class="noindent1">“Good morning, Amane.”</p>
<p>Most people would start an outing by meeting up somewhere, but Mahiru met him at his apartment. Since she lived next door, they didn’t need to go to the trouble of arranging a meeting place. Instead, Mahiru came directly to his door.</p>
<p>She certainly did look different.</p>
<p>“Morning… Oh, you put your hair up today.”</p>
<p>“I thought it would get in the way if we’re going to be playing with cats. How do you like it?”</p>
<p>Mahiru usually wore her long hair down, but today it was braided and gathered up in a bun. It looked like a more complex version of what she did with it when she was cooking.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it looks good.”</p>
<p>“It’s nice of you to say so, but… W-well…if you’re going to laugh, just laugh, okay?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“…You think it looks silly, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Mahiru was squeezing her arms tightly over her chest. Her outfit showed a little bit more skin than usual.</p>
<p>Putting it that way might make it seem like she was wearing a very exposing outfit, but her top was a chiffon blouse with an open collar, and the pure-white skin of her neck was peeking out, which just gave the illusion of more exposure.</p>
<p>The blouse had a long lantern sleeve with slits in the sides and lace panels that ran along the length so her upper arms were partially hidden but still showed through. It was subtly enticing.</p>
<p>Of course, she had an undershirt on, so it wasn’t like he was at risk of seeing anything if he looked at her from above, but somehow he found the look both tidy and alluring in the way it enhanced her femininity.</p>
<p>On the bottom she was wearing skinny jeans, perhaps because she was preparing to play with cats at the café. The jeans fit tightly to her figure, hugging her slender legs.</p>
<p>On her wrist she wore the flower bracelet Amane had given her as a present. He remembered her saying she was going to wear it with care, and he felt a warmth in his chest.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you look silly. In fact, I think you look even prettier than usual.”</p>
<p>“Well, don’t you look the part today? Your parents must have raised you to be a proper gentleman.”</p>
<p>“Dad always told me that you ought to compliment a girl when she’s all dressed up… Of course, it’s not just flattery, you know.”</p>
<p>“…I’ll believe you.”</p>
<p>Mahiru’s face flushed slightly red, and she held her bag tight. Amane smiled wryly and almost patted her head, but he stopped himself. He expected she wouldn’t be pleased if he messed up her elaborate hairdo before they even started their outing.</p>
<p>Mahiru blinked like she’d been expecting it but seemed to understand he was being considerate of her hair, and so she smiled at him. She did give Amane’s hand a bit of a wary look, though.</p>
<p>“…Amane, recently you’ve been a little obsessed with patting my head, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>“If you don’t like it, I’ll stop. I know I shouldn’t touch you too excessively.”</p>
<p>“N-no, that’s not what I meant… I, um, I want to be able to play with your hair, too, when I want to.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine; I don’t mind, but you can’t do it now. I’ve got wax in it.”</p>
<p>Amane had donned his “mystery man” outfit to go out with Mahiru, taking the time to carefully arrange his hair. His outfit choice was relaxed, consisting of a denim jacket over a white V-neck shirt plus some slim black trousers. It was obviously not as much effort as Mahiru had gone to, but Amane was used to looking like a slob next to her, and this time he’d at least tried.</p>
<p>“…So I can touch your hair?”</p>
<p>“I don’t really mind, but for today, let’s make do with petting cats.”</p>
<p>“I—I didn’t mean I wanted to do it right now, you know. I can do it later, I guess…”</p>
<p>“I’ve been doing it to you, so it’s only natural that you should get a chance. Fair turnabout and all.”</p>
<p>He didn’t particularly dislike it when Mahiru touched his hair… If anything, it felt really nice, and if Mahiru enjoyed it, he was happy to let her continue. Mahiru had seemed flustered at first by Amane agreeing so easily, but now she was finally wearing a happy smile.</p>
<p>“…Okay, then we’re agreed: I’ll do it later. For now, let’s go pet lots of cats.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“Off we go, then?”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Thinking that setting out together from the same apartment felt a little embarrassing somehow, Amane left his place with Mahiru.</p>
<p>As they walked side by side, the thought occurred to Amane to extend his hand to her.</p>
<p>“Here, have a hand,” he said lightheartedly.</p>
<p>Mahiru flushed faintly and smiled as she squeezed his hand.</p>
<p class="space-break">He had done a degree of preliminary investigation, but when they actually entered the cat café, it was much more spacious than Amane had imagined.</p>
<p>After the two had signed in and used hand sanitizer, they stepped into the main café area. As expected, they could see cats everywhere, walking around or curled into balls or playing with other patrons.</p>
<p>“Wow… It’s pretty big. And clean.”</p>
<p>The café offered food and drinks, so perhaps it was to be expected, but the cleanliness of the place still surprised him. He could barely smell any of the scents characteristic of many places where animals made their home. In fact, it was nearly odorless.</p>
<p>He had looked at the reviews online, and this seemed to be a cat café that was prized for its hygiene and took good care of its cats. It was a popular place, but to keep the cats from getting stressed, it had only a few seats. There were also many hideouts for the cats, and in the end, the café seemed to be set up less for touching the cats than for sharing the space with them.</p>
<p>This café had a time-limit system, and the fees were high, but it was such a beautiful and calm space that he didn’t mind paying at all.</p>
<p>“Whoa…cats… Look, Amane, they’re all so cute!”</p>
<p>There were cats with the other customers, so Mahiru spoke in a quiet voice, but he could hear her eager excitement as she tugged on his sleeve. There were all sorts of cats around, and Mahiru’s eyes sparkled as she looked at them eagerly.</p>
<p>The topic of animals had never really come up, but apparently she really liked cats. She was so excited, Amane could feel his mouth curling into a smile.</p>
<p>“You’re right; they’re really cute.”</p>
<p>“So cute!” Mahiru didn’t seem to realize how cute she was being herself as she looked at the profile chart she had received from the receptionist, listing the cats’ names and breeds along with photos. She pointed to the Siamese cat beside her. “Ah, that one’s name is Silky!”</p>
<p>Only the fur on its tail and around its face was black, while the rest of the coat on its long, slender body was a dazzling white. It had characteristic blue eyes and exuded an air of nobility.</p>
<p>Mahiru was itching to pet it, but suddenly touching the cats was prohibited, so she kept an eye on it from the side as she slowly brought her fingers closer to its nose and let it sniff her.</p>
<p>The cat’s nose twitched.</p>
<p>She didn’t say it out loud, but Mahiru clearly thought even that was cute, so she definitely seemed to like cats a lot.</p>
<p>But after getting a full sniff of Mahiru’s scent, Silky abruptly and gracefully dashed away.</p>
<p>Mahiru was clearly disheartened.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t necessarily mean she hates you; I think she was just done saying hello.”</p>
<p>“R-right, I suppose that’s fair…”</p>
<p>“Come on, I think we should let the cats take their time and get used to us. Let’s go have a seat for now, okay?”</p>
<p>Mahiru stood back up, he took her hand, and they sat down on an open sofa. Once there, Amane finally took a slow look around the whole room and saw that there certainly were a lot of types of cats.</p>
<p>The cat from a moment ago had been a Siamese, but there were American shorthairs, Russian blues, munchkins, Bengals, and even more exotic breeds—cats with great individuality here, there, and everywhere.</p>
<p>At the next seat over, a short distance from them, an American shorthair was curled up on the table, and the girl sitting there was gently stroking it.</p>
<p>“So cute…”</p>
<p>Mahiru was looking at the other customers without bothering to disguise the envy in her eyes. Amane smiled wryly and looked over the menu.</p>
<p>The food and drink offerings at this café were supposed to be delicious.</p>
<p>The top recommendation seemed to be a latte with a cat design on top, formed out of the milk foam. Apparently, the staff was talented at making latte art, and many people had uploaded pictures.</p>
<p>Amane left Mahiru to her own devices for a moment, as she was staring at a cat loitering nearby, and he called the waiter over and ordered the signature latte art.</p>
<p>“I went ahead and ordered you the same thing as me, is that all right?” he asked when he had finished.</p>
<p>“Huh? Ah yes, that’s fine.”</p>
<p>As expected, Mahiru was so preoccupied with the cats that she hadn’t even noticed him ordering. Mahiru was the type who could drink coffee or tea, so since this was a special outing, he decided to keep the order a secret and give her a little surprise.</p>
<p>After a short while, their order was brought over. Slowly, so as not to destroy the latte art, their smiling waiter set the cups down on the table, bowed, and left. Mahiru couldn’t take her eyes off the latte art atop her cup.</p>
<p>“Is this okay?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes, it’s super cute…”</p>
<p>“I’m glad.”</p>
<p>On Mahiru’s drink, the milk foam had been poured with great care to form a cat that was curled up asleep, its coat pattern and expression drawn with cocoa powder. In Amane’s cup, they had drawn a cat leaning against the rim. The cute, dainty depictions of the cats made it easy to understand why the café had become so popular.</p>
<p>Perhaps to preserve the excitement, Mahiru was taking photos with her smartphone and looking quite pleased, but then for some reason her expression turned. “It’s so cute I can’t drink it…,” she muttered.</p>
<p>She sounded so serious. Amane couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
<p>“D-don’t laugh at me, please.”</p>
<p>“It’s just—you’re so troubled over something so adorable.”</p>
<p>“B-but…it would be such a waste to destroy it when there’s such a cute little cat…”</p>
<p>“But it would be even more of a waste not to drink it.”</p>
<p>“Oh no.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he didn’t understand Mahiru’s feelings, but the foam would collapse anyway even if she left it alone, and he presumed that the person who made the coffee would probably be happier if she drank it before it got cold.</p>
<p>After sufficiently appreciating his own latte cat, Amane raised his cup without hesitation. He almost laughed again when he heard a murmur of sadness from beside him, but somehow he contained it enough to slowly sip his caffe latte.</p>
<p>Mahiru looked so downhearted that he tried his best to drink without disturbing the cat too much. The latte itself was delicious. The combination of the deep coffee flavor and the rich milk was just perfect. And it wasn’t too sweet, so Amane, who drank his coffee black, didn’t mind it.</p>
<p>“Mm, it’s good.”</p>
<p>When he took a break from drinking and made this comment, Mahiru groaned slightly but brought her cup to her lips with some hesitation.</p>
<p>She looked funny and cute drinking her latte and carefully trying to <em>not</em> destroy the cat, and Amane’s lips must have curled into an unintentional smile.</p>
<p>“I—I feel like you’re laughing at me, but—”</p>
<p>“You’re imagining things. Is it good?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is, of course.”</p>
<p>When Amane looked at Mahiru once she had pulled her mouth away from the cup and set it back down, he couldn’t control himself, and his shoulders shook with laughter.</p>
<p>“Wh-why are you laughing?”</p>
<p>“Well, you have a white moustache.”</p>
<p>She must have failed to pay attention to the rest of the milk foam in her efforts to keep the cat intact, for Mahiru’s upper lip was now decorated with a white moustache reminiscent of Santa Claus.</p>
<p>She looked so extremely cute that he instinctively snapped a photo with his phone.</p>
<p>“Uh, d-did you just take a picture?!”</p>
<p>“Sorry. Do you want me to delete it?”</p>
<p>“W-were you planning on keeping a record of such a shameful face?”</p>
<p>“You looked cute, so I just took it.”</p>
<p>When he said that, Mahiru pressed her lips together tightly, and her face flushed red. In a quiet voice, she grumbled, “…You can have the one photo.”</p>
<p>She was still wearing the white moustache as she told him that, so Amane felt his chest growing warm as he held back a laugh and nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="space-break">“…Ah!”</p>
<p>Around the time they finished drinking their caffe lattes decorated with foam art, one of the cats jumped up on Amane’s lap.</p>
<p>It was the American shorthair that had been at the neighboring seat earlier.</p>
<p>After checking out the profile sheet, they saw that it said C<span class="small-caps">ACAO, FEMALE</span>.</p>
<p>Amane wasn’t sure whether she was friendly or just shameless, but she had suddenly gotten up on his lap, which he found perplexing. He was fully aware that cats did as they pleased, but he was slightly unsettled to be approached so suddenly.</p>
<p>The warmth in his lap was more profound than he had expected, as the cat confidently curled up and settled in as if to say this was her spot.</p>
<p>“This one is really friendly.”</p>
<p>He looked over at Mahiru as the cat sniffed at his fingers and thought she seemed incredibly jealous.</p>
<p>Once Cacao had finished sniffing to her heart’s content, she nuzzled her face into Amane’s palm, so he figured she was asking him to pet her and started scratching her under her chin like he had practiced on Mahiru.</p>
<p>He could tell from the vibration and the sound that she was purring.</p>
<p>Feeling relaxed by the presence of the cute cat, Amane ruffled the fur under her chin as he petted her, but he felt jealous eyes on him from Mahiru sitting next to him and chuckled to himself again.</p>
<p>“Mahiru, put out your hand.”</p>
<p>“Huh? R-right.”</p>
<p>She obediently stretched out her hand, so Amane removed his own hand from Cacao and, in its place, put Mahiru’s palm near Cacao’s face.</p>
<p><em>This cat is probably friendly and used to humans, so she ought to allow herself to be petted after a proper greeting.</em></p>
<p>Cacao sniffed at Mahiru’s hand, then let out a somewhat listless <em>meeeow</em> and rubbed her face against Mahiru’s palm. Mahiru’s eyes sparkled, overcome with emotion.</p>
