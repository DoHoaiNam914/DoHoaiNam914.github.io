<p class="noindent1">“I’m looking forward to working with you.”</p>
<p>Amane was normally never on the receiving end of Mahiru’s angelic smile, so when she turned it on him, it made him want to groan.</p>
<p>“…Same here,” he responded in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>As a rule, Amane never approached Mahiru at school, but he didn’t have much choice if she was the one who approached him. But this time, it wasn’t Mahiru’s fault; instead, it was simply because they had decided to team up, as friends.</p>
<p>Their home economics class was going to feature a cooking segment in several days, and the students had been given the freedom to form their own teams, as well as the right to choose what dishes they were going to prepare. However, they were required to put together a menu that applied their lessons about nutrition, and they would be graded on that menu, so they needed to take it seriously.</p>
<p>There were, of course, many potential suitors hoping to be on the same team as Mahiru, but she formed a pair with her good friend Chitose, and her partner Chitose pulled in her boyfriend, Itsuki. Amane, who thought he was paired up with Itsuki, naturally came along with him, so from the outside it looked like he was with Mahiru. They were getting even more stares now, and Amane could already feel a stomachache coming on.</p>
<p>Chitose, the main culprit in a sense, was grinning cheekily as she arranged some nearby desks for them. “Ah-ha-ha! You look like you swallowed a bug, Amane!” she cackled.</p>
<p>“And whose fault do you think that is?” Amane replied.</p>
<p>Once they had pushed four desks together and taken their seats, Mahiru smiled at him apologetically, letting her angelic expression slip just a bit. “I’m sorry for intruding,” she said gracefully.</p>
<p>“No, this isn’t your fault,” Amane insisted. “I’m just worried about whether I’m going to be stabbed by those daggers in everyone’s eyes.”</p>
<p>“It’s just like Amane not to appreciate his good fortune,” Chitose admonished.</p>
<p>“I just don’t wanna hog all the good luck, is all.”</p>
<p>It was probably just his imagination, but he thought he heard displeased voices quietly agreeing. All the other boys must have been clamoring for the chance to eat the angel’s handmade food, and he knew they were angry to see it go to a guy who didn’t even seem to want it that badly. He was being pierced by thorny gazes full of jealousy and envy.</p>
<p>“But you know I’ll have a hard time if you’re not with me, man,” Itsuki added. “Besides, all the other teams are groups of friends.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…” Amane couldn’t argue that point.</p>
<p>He wasn’t exactly an outcast or anything, but he certainly wasn’t popular or charming enough to insert himself into another group of friends and expect to get along well. It would have been difficult for Amane alone to leave his group now that they were assembled.</p>
<p>“Just give up and accept your fate!” Itsuki insisted. “If you’re gonna whine so much, maybe we never should have been friends in the first place!”</p>
<p>“…I don’t regret being your friend.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m getting all choked up!”</p>
<p>“Ugh, you know, maybe I’m starting to regret it after all,” Amane shot back.</p>
<p>Itsuki pressed his hands to his face. “A cruel double cross!” he moaned dramatically, and then he cackled with cheerful laughter.</p>
<p>Amane was not particularly impressed with his friend’s performance. He was just starting to think about pinching Itsuki’s cheeks when he heard a quiet laugh mixed with a sigh.</p>
<p>Mahiru was smiling in amusement.</p>
<p>“I’ve thought this before, but you two really are good friends, aren’t you? It’s enough to make me jealous.”</p>
<p>“…I guess.”</p>
<p>Even though she already knew they were good friends, Mahiru was acting as if it was the first time she had ever mentioned it. Amane felt uncomfortable not being able to respond.</p>
<p>He was grateful she was keeping up the act, but when Mahiru pretended they were strangers like this, it also made him feel both embarrassed and frustrated.</p>
<p>Chitose had been listening to their exchange, and with a grin, she patted Mahiru on the shoulder. “Join in if you like, Mahirun!” she said.</p>
<p>“Hey, stop that,” Amane scolded. “Don’t try to get Shiina involved in your wild antics. You’re bugging her.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not the case at all,” Mahiru insisted.</p>
<p>“See?”</p>
<p>“Don’t get carried away, Chitose.”</p>
<p>Chitose liked the idea of getting Amane and Mahiru together. Actually, she more than endorsed it—whenever she got the chance to steer the conversation, usually she made every attempt to push them together. That was fine when they were at Amane’s apartment, but they were currently in school, and he wanted to avoid doing anything that might draw attention.</p>
<p>“All right, enough with that stuff,” Amane declared. “We’ve got to choose our menu.”</p>
<p>They only had a limited time to decide on a menu before they would have to present their choice, so he insisted on making a quick decision in a bid to show the rest of the class he didn’t hold any particular feelings toward Mahiru.</p>
<p>Chitose looked somewhat dumbfounded. “You can’t cook, but you’re taking charge?”</p>
<p>“Rude,” Amane said, bristling. “I can make…omelets.”</p>
<p>“…You might call them omelets, but what you make is basically scrambled eggs,” Mahiru whispered quietly so only the three other people in her group could hear, causing Itsuki and Chitose to burst into a fit of giggles. Amane, still wary about being in public, shot Mahiru a slightly reproachful glance, but she wasn’t bothered by it at all.</p>
<p>Her expression was too much like her usual angelic smile, and Amane turned away sharply. Chitose and Itsuki grinned once more at his reaction, which was even more unbearable.</p>
<p>“How about you, Akazawa?” Mahiru asked. “How is your cooking?”</p>
<p>“Me? …Well, it’s good enough to keep me alive,” he replied.</p>
<p>“Itsuki can do pretty much anything around the house, you know,” Chitose added.</p>
<p>Itsuki, who could somehow manage to do most tasks if he put his mind to it, could also whip up a flawless meal. Naturally, it wasn’t as good as Mahiru’s cooking, but it was plenty good enough to survive.</p>
<p>“It’s ’cause my mom’s never at home, thanks to work. I even used to go over to Amane’s sometimes to make food for him. Don’t do that anymore, though, huh?”</p>
<p>Itsuki glanced over at Amane meaningfully, and Amane frowned, but Itsuki just smiled.</p>
<p>“I suppose that’s true.”</p>
<p>“…If you guys don’t shut up, everybody’s gonna find out what a loser I am.”</p>
<p>“Too late, bro.”</p>
<p>“Bit late, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“You guys are way too in sync.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh. Well, now you don’t have to worry about meals; isn’t that great?”</p>
<p>“…W-wait, I do make some effort!” Amane protested. “Sometimes I make something when I’m alone…”</p>
<p>He didn’t think it was good to leave everything up to Mahiru, so on the weekends or when Mahiru wasn’t around, he did take a stab at cooking. Of course, he stuck to simple recipes that could be made in the broiler or using the range.</p>
<p>Amane had gotten quite flustered, when for some reason Mahiru smiled at him affectionately and commended him. “How admirable.”</p>
<p>There was a painful amount of meaning hidden in those words. Amane’s cheek twitched.</p>
<p>She was probably teasing him because she was perfectly aware of how much Amane struggled when it came to cooking. Compared to Mahiru’s cooking, his feeble efforts were comparable to a child’s. She was probably amused by how terrible they were. But he was steadily making improvements—when he started, he couldn’t do anything for himself—and he needed it to be said.</p>
<p>“Well, how about we decide on a menu for now?” Mahiru suggested. “Our grades depend on it.”</p>
<p>Without making any overt reference to Amane’s distressed state, Mahiru, still with a gentle smile, tapped the menu worksheet they needed to turn in to complete the assignment.</p>
<p>Mahiru was the best cook among them, so the group had quietly agreed to put Mahiru in charge. Even though Amane had learned to make a few things, he was still an amateur, especially when it came to creating a nutritionally balanced menu. So it made sense to follow Mahiru’s lead. After all, she chose the menu for dinner practically every night.</p>
<p>After some discussion, the group decided on a <em>sanshoku soborodon</em>, a dish of minced meat, eggs, and vegetables served over rice, with miso soup and cellophane noodle salad on the side, plus almond jelly for dessert. Chitose was grinning from ear to ear at the menu.</p>
<p>Mahiru had casually included an egg dish, probably because she knew Amane liked them. That fact did not escape Chitose’s and Itsuki’s notice, and Amane hid behind his worksheet to avoid their taunting stares.</p>
<p class="space-break">And then, on the actual day of the cooking class, Amane let out an exhausted sigh.</p>
<p>He was supposedly working as Mahiru’s assistant, but really she was just babysitting him. He stood near Mahiru and watched her put on her apron, a sight he had grown accustomed to.</p>
<p>“I’m counting on you for support, okay, Fujimiya?” she said with a smile.</p>
<p>This wasn’t any scheme of Chitose’s. The group had simply decided that Amane was the least useful when it came to kitchen work. He even had a prior record—he’d cut his finger right in front of Mahiru—so they had thought it best not to let him handle anything too involved.</p>
<p>He could understand their reasoning, as all of them were equally intent on avoiding any bloodshed, and because they wanted to do their work quickly, since the students would be dismissed to lunch starting with the finished teams, so he didn’t argue. However, he did still take the time to insist, rather loudly, that he “…wasn’t exactly totally incapable.”</p>
<p>“…Are you sulking?” Mahiru asked him stealthily once she’d finished preparing the vegetables.</p>
<p>As he was measuring out the seasonings, without looking at her, Amane replied, “No, of course not. I just feel like I’m being unfairly judged.”</p>
<p>“No one’s judging you. It’s just, well…um, you can’t deny that the rest of us are more efficient.”</p>
<p>“I certainly can’t.”</p>
<p>It went without saying that Mahiru could cook, and Amane had eaten Itsuki’s cooking before, so he knew Itsuki could handle himself in the kitchen just fine, and as long as Chitose didn’t do anything crazy with the seasonings, she could be expected to perform reasonably well. Amane wasn’t entirely helpless, but he was objectively less capable than the three of them, so he couldn’t really shoot back if they teased him on that point.</p>
<p>“And so I think it’s best to get you to work in your area of strength. Also, Chitose’s liable to get carried away with the seasonings, so I think we’d better leave that up to you, Fujimiya… It’s an important job, you know.”</p>
<p>“That’s a serious responsibility…is what I thought at first, but I just have to follow the recipe, right?”</p>
<p>“Preventing a Chitose surprise before it happens is also a crucial job.”</p>
<p>Mahiru let a giggle slip out, and Amane glanced over at Chitose.</p>
<p>She was simmering rice in a pot while cleaning up after she and Itsuki had prepared the almond jelly and placed it in the refrigerator. There probably weren’t any pranks in the jelly.</p>
<p>Chitose didn’t have an unsophisticated palate, but she did strangely enjoy extreme flavors and surprises, so Itsuki had been tasked with supervising her to guard against any of that. Plus, this way she could work alongside her boyfriend.</p>
<p>Laughing quietly, Mahiru pulled out the bean sprouts and carrots that had finished simmering in their basket, so Amane pulled off two or three sheets of paper towel from the roll sitting on the counter.</p>
<p>“Fujimiya?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, got it.”</p>
<p>Mahiru handed him the boiled vegetables in their basket, so Amane chilled them slightly and used the paper towels to sponge off some of the moisture, then threw them into the bowl of seasonings he had prepared in advance, along with the rinsed cellophane noodles and julienned cucumber and ham.</p>
<p>Recalling Mahiru’s welcome words that cooking wasn’t such a difficult thing as long as you measured correctly and paid attention to the instructions, Amane performed his tasks according to the recipe. The chef had left him with the simplest jobs, so there wasn’t exactly a ton to be proud of, though.</p>
<p>“After I stir in the sesame seeds, I can put this in the refrigerator, right?” he asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right, and then…”</p>
<p>“Put the noodles in and take the minced meat out.”</p>
<p>The simmering rice was almost ready, so he figured she was planning to get the bowls out before too long.</p>
<p>Mahiru watched as he covered the bowl containing the noodle salad with plastic wrap and wrote their team number on it. Apparently, he’d done it right, as she started to ready the frying pan without making any corrections.</p>
<p>The vegetables for the miso soup were already done cooking, and they just needed to dissolve the miso paste. Chitose and Itsuki had put the almond jelly in the refrigerator to chill and congeal, so all that was left was to get the rice bowls ready.</p>
<p>Taking care not to bump anyone on the way, Amane exchanged minced meat for noodle salad in the fridge and returned to their station.</p>
<p>As he was walking back to his own group’s station, he took a sidelong glance at the other teams. Some were doing all right, while others were bickering. One of the teams made up of all boys was playing around and wasting ingredients, and the teacher who was overseeing this exercise in student autonomy was glaring sharply at them.</p>
<p><em>…Seeing that makes me glad I have Mahiru with me.</em></p>
<p>The fact that Amane’s team had been able to do their work more smoothly than other teams was thanks to Mahiru’s great familiarity with the cooking process and also because they’d chosen a menu that wasn’t too demanding.</p>
<p><em>“Rather than showing off with some complicated menu, it’ll be easier to make a meal that’s nutritious and doesn’t take too much time. Food is something you have to make every day, so you shouldn’t fixate on things that tire you out, right?”</em></p>
<p>Amane had asked her at home about her reasoning for the menu, and that’s how she had answered. He thought it was a rational way of thinking, typical of Mahiru, who made dinner for the two of them every night.</p>
<p>From Amane’s perspective, even this simple menu took plenty of work to get right, so this cooking class was bringing him a renewed appreciation of Mahiru’s worth.</p>
<p>Musing seriously to himself that the people in charge of the kitchens of the world must have a hard time making every meal, he returned to their counter, where Mahiru was giving Chitose instructions. Itsuki was nowhere to be seen, but Mahiru must have understood his unspoken question from the look in his eyes, because she promptly informed him, “I asked Akazawa to go fetch the dishes from the other room.” She continued, “All right then, I’m entrusting the meat to you.”</p>
<p>“Got it,” Amane replied. “Cook it until the juice dries up, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Thanks.”</p>
<p>Mahiru seemed to be working on the yellow and green portions of the tricolor rice bowl. She boiled water to parboil the spinach as she cracked and scrambled the eggs. Mahiru had finished preparing the frying pan for use, leaving Amane with only the simple task of heating the mixture of meat and seasonings.</p>
<p>As she used a cloth to dry the pot she had used and washed, Chitose watched him frying the meat with a strange look in her eye. “…I thought you couldn’t cook?”</p>
<p>“I keep telling you, I’m not completely helpless. I just look bad next to her; that’s all.”</p>
<p>The job he’d been assigned was to simmer the meat and seasonings, stirring the mixture with a wooden spatula until the moisture was evaporated. He was offended that she assumed he couldn’t even manage this much. It wasn’t like they were comic book characters cooking up dark matter here.</p>
<p>Amane figured that most recipes got messed up when the cook used too much heat, timed things poorly, or added too many ingredients. But they had Mahiru to guide them, so they practically could not fail.</p>
<p>“If you must know, I memorized the recipe so I wouldn’t get in the way.”</p>
<p>“How thoughtful of you, Amane.”</p>
<p>“Well, if I didn’t pull my weight, the other guys would kill me.”</p>
<p>He could feel them trying to stare daggers through him and could almost hear their thoughts <em>(…Is he gonna enjoy the angel’s hand-cooked meal without working for it…?)</em> So he was trying to do something, at least.</p>
<p>Amane was fully aware that he was not naturally gifted at cooking, so he had studied the recipe even more seriously than he would a textbook, but Mahiru had laughed at him. “<em>You don’t have to take it that seriously</em>,” she had said at home, but he knew he ought to be ready just in case.</p>
<p>Amane checked that the meat was browning and had started giving off a salty-sweet aroma, and he stirred it appropriately with the wooden spatula so it wouldn’t burn.</p>
<p>Beside him, Mahiru was using the other burner to cook scrambled eggs. Amane felt a little embarrassed that she was making more than the usual amount because she knew how much he loved eggs, but he was also happy she was thinking of him.</p>
<p>“Shiina, do I let this go a little longer?” he asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right,” Mahiru answered. “You should let it boil down a little bit more. But it’ll get dry if you simmer it too long, so please take it off the heat in about one minute.”</p>
<p>“Mm, got it.” He nodded.</p>
<p>Most of the moisture had already been cooked off, so he stirred the mixture with his spatula to keep it from burning while Mahiru went back to her own work without saying anything further.</p>
<p>Chitose was watching Amane and Mahiru from the side, and she shrugged, looking slightly amazed. “…You know, the two of you seem, well, what can I say…? It’s like you’re newlyw—”</p>
<p>“Chitose, please mind the miso soup.”</p>
<p>“Eeep, yes, ma’am!”</p>
<p>Chitose let out an idiotic shriek for some reason and went to take the miso soup out of the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Amane quickly looked over to Mahiru. “…Did something happen?”</p>
<p>“Nothing at all.”</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like nothing at all, but Mahiru didn’t seem likely to tell him more, so he gave up on getting any more information out of her and turned off the burner he had been using to fry the meat.</p>
<p class="space-break">By the time Mahiru had finished cooking the eggs and sliced and dressed the parboiled spinach with seasonings, Itsuki had returned with the dishes.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you a bit late?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sorry. Some folks from the other teams came to talk to me.”</p>
<p>Itsuki smiled flippantly, but his face didn’t really look like he was joking around. He wasn’t the type to skip out on something like this, so he probably had actually gotten held up talking to someone and couldn’t extract himself right away.</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear who he had spoken with or what they had talked about, but Amane got the sense that it had something to do with Mahiru. Without her nearby, their jealous classmates could speak freely, so they had probably directed their complaints at Itsuki in Amane’s stead. Of course, this was all conjecture; he didn’t really know.</p>
<p>“Well, at any rate, I did my job, so…” Itsuki pointed to a tray bearing the right number of plates and bowls.</p>
<p>Mahiru smiled gently at him. “Everything’s ready. Let’s arrange it and take a photo for our report, then help ourselves, shall we?”</p>
<p>“Hell yeah!” Itsuki cheered. “I’m starving.”</p>
<p>“That’s ’cause you skipped breakfast, isn’t it?” Chitose remarked.</p>
<p>“Not my fault; I overslept. Can I have an extra-big portion?”</p>
<p>“I don’t mind,” Mahiru replied. “I’m going to get the noodle salad now, so please arrange things in the meanwhile.”</p>
<p>Amane quickly spoke up. “I’ll go with you, then. We’ve got to put the almond jelly with everything else for the photo.”</p>
<p>Amane said he would help, figuring Mahiru wouldn’t have enough hands to carry the dessert as well, and she nodded at him with her calm smile.</p>
<p>A little too late, he realized he should have sent Chitose, mostly to get it done without inviting unnecessary speculation, but there was no going back now. Amane deliberately kept a little distance between them as they headed for the refrigerator in the rear of the kitchen classroom.</p>
<p>None of the other teams had Mahiru in their corner, so most of them weren’t finished yet. As usual, a few groups were only half-heartedly working through the exercise. Amane thought it looked like they were going to get awful grades as he walked past them indifferently.</p>
<p>There was even a team of boys who were chatting and fooling around instead of cooking. One of them held his frying pan in one hand and laughed as he leaned away from the table with an exaggerated movement—right into the path of a girl carrying a pot full of soup.</p>
<p>In that instant, Amane sensed impending disaster and pulled Mahiru out of the way.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, he heard a loud splash followed by the faint, permeating smell of milk as hot steam whirled around him.</p>
<p>The girl must have been making a cream soup, given the half a cup or so of thick white liquid that was currently spreading across the floor. He peeled his eyes away to confirm that none had splashed on Mahiru.</p>
<p>“Shiina, are you burned?”</p>
<p>“…Ah, no, it didn’t hit me, but…”</p>
<p>Mahiru looked frozen with surprise.</p>
<p>The girl who had spilled her soup looked apologetic, and the face of the boy with the frying pan who had bumped into her was ghastly pale.</p>
<p>“Did any of it hit you?” Amane asked the girl with the soup.</p>
<p>“Ah, n-no, I’m all right. S-sorry…!”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. None of it hit me or Shiina, either.”</p>
<p>Luckily, he had been quick to notice the danger, and neither Mahiru nor Amane was injured.</p>
<p>He was quick to wave his hand and reassure his female classmate, who had set the pot on a burner for the time being to apologize, while shooting a glance over at the boy who had collided with her.</p>
<p>As one would expect, the other boys who had been joking around with him kept their mouths shut, maybe because they felt guilty. They were looking practically everywhere except in Mahiru’s direction.</p>
<p>“…Look, guys, it’s fine to live it up a little, but you can’t mess around in a place with fire and knives and stuff,” Amane said. “If someone got hurt and it left a permanent mark, you’d never forgive yourselves. Thank goodness nothing happened this time, but what would you have done if you’d hurt one of the girls? Could you take responsibility for that?”</p>
<p>It would be no laughing matter if someone got burned—or cut with a knife—and came away from the incident with a scar. Amane wouldn’t mind if he got hurt a little bit, but it would be a serious problem if he injured another person, especially a girl.</p>
<p>Many girls, and even a lot of guys, would be pretty upset if they were left with a nasty injury. And if someone got seriously hurt in a stupid accident like this, it wouldn’t be strange if they held a grudge.</p>
<p>Whether the wounded party was Mahiru or the other girl didn’t matter. Someone acting irresponsibly in a way that could cause injury to another person made Amane angry, and he felt compelled to speak up.</p>
