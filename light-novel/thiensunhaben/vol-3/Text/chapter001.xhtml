<p class="noindent1">“Listen, I’m not a kid anymore, you know.” Amane’s exasperation was obvious from the way he answered his mother’s phone call. He was about to attend the school entrance ceremony that marked the start of his second year of high school, after all.</p>
<p>Amane couldn’t decide whether he was more impressed or irritated by her ability to time her call for the one free moment in his busy morning routine. <em>She worries too much</em>, he thought as he sank into the sofa.</p>
<p>His mother had gotten used to the idea of him living alone, but she was clearly still concerned that an old wound of his might have opened again, dredging up memories of something from his second year of middle school.</p>
<p>As far as Amane was concerned, though the scar ached sometimes, it never bothered him much. And more importantly, he didn’t want to worry his parents.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. Really—I’ll be all right on my own.”</p>
<p>“You come tell me anytime it gets tough, okay? Oh, even better, you can lean on sweet Mahiru!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah…”</p>
<p><em>Why is she so hung up on Mahiru and me?</em></p>
<p>His mother had taken a liking to Mahiru and clearly wanted them to spend more time together, but Amane felt like it was really none of her business. When it came to matters of romance, he didn’t ask for or want any parental meddling, even if she only meant well.</p>
<p>Most of all, Amane didn’t want his mother to figure out just how fond of Mahiru he really was, so he opted to kept quiet and didn’t engage.</p>
<p>“I bet Mahiru would be very receptive.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh…”</p>
<p>“At any rate, if you’re having a rough time, make sure to ask someone for help, okay? It can be anyone. I still think Mahiru would be just perfect, but—”</p>
<p>“Look, I’ve gotta go soon, so I’m hanging up. Thanks for worrying about me so early in the morning.”</p>
<p>Amane didn’t want his mother speculating about his relationship with Mahiru any further, so he quickly thanked her and ended the call. He could already imagine her on the other end of the line, probably pouting in displeasure.</p>
<p>She was concerned about him, but she was worrying way too much.</p>
<p>His scars did ache, but not so much that it would bring him to his knees.</p>
<p>Besides, it wouldn’t bother him if he just didn’t think about it.</p>
<p><em>…Better to not reach out if I don’t need to.</em></p>
<p><em>As long as the people I trust stay with me, everything’ll be fine.</em></p>
<p>Amane wasn’t worried about the class changes for the new semester. After all, there was nothing he could do, so he’d decided to do his best to accept whatever came.</p>
<p>Staring at his own gloomy, melancholic reflection in the darkened screen of his phone, Amane smiled bleakly.</p>
<p><em>If Chitose and Itsuki saw me like this, they’d slap me right on the back</em>, he thought as he stood up from the sofa and left for the first day of school.</p>
<p class="space-break">Walking to school after two weeks off felt a bit nostalgic. After arriving, Amane approached the central bulletin board, intending to check the rosters for each class posted there.</p>
<p>Although he had come a little earlier than usual, it was the start of the new semester, so plenty of other students were already there—and surprisingly, one of them was his friend Itsuki, who emerged from the crowd to greet him.</p>
<p>“Yo, what’s up, Amane. Looks like you just got here.”</p>
<p>“Morning. Is the sky falling or something? I can’t believe you got here before I did.”</p>
<p>“My dad chased me out of the house,” Itsuki replied with a small grin. “He said I should at least be early for the first day.” He shrugged, as if there was nothing interesting about it.</p>
<p>Itsuki was at odds with his father, as usual. Since meeting Chitose, he didn’t seem inclined to do anything his parents wanted. Itsuki’s father stubbornly refused to approve of his relationship with Chitose, and ever since then, the two of them never saw eye to eye. Of course, Itsuki’s father could be pretty stern, even before his son had started dating, Amane thought that he was overall an earnest and sensible man—and a decent parent.</p>
<p>That said, Itsuki’s current situation really made Amane appreciate his relationship with his own parents. They could be more than a little overbearing at times, but on the whole, they respected their son’s wishes, and Amane almost never argued with them. After all, they had gone to a lot of trouble to send him to school far away from his hometown. And they never gave him a hard time about who he associated with—if anything, they fully supported him on that front.</p>
<p>Amane hadn’t told his parents about his feelings toward Mahiru, but they were obviously quite taken with her—even openly mentioning that she’d make a wonderful daughter-in-law. If by some slim chance he did one day happen to find himself in that sort of relationship with Mahiru, Amane was sure his parents would approve.</p>
<p>Amane was well aware that he was blessed with a loving family.</p>
<p><em>…Considering Mahiru’s situation, I’ve seriously got it made, huh?</em></p>
<p>Amane fell into an uncomfortable silence as he recalled the chilling expression he’d seen Mahiru’s mother brandish, only for Itsuki to flash him a flippant grin. It seemed like he had already regained his usual cheer.</p>
<p>“Well, my dad’s not worth worrying about. Come on, let’s check out the class lists.”</p>
<p>“From the way you’re smiling, I can more or less guess what got posted.”</p>
<p>Amane shot Itsuki a weary look when he saw his friend’s ordinary smile had become a devious grin, then searched for his own name among the crowd of students who were doing the same.</p>
<p>It didn’t take him long to spot his name. As he started confirming who his classmates would be for the year, Itsuki’s impish smile began to make more sense.</p>
<p>There were many familiar names on the roll sheet.</p>
<p>Several belonged to students who had been in his class last year—namely, Itsuki and the boy who was often referred to as the prince, Yuuta Kadowaki.</p>
<p>Amane also spied Chitose’s name, which certainly explained Itsuki’s good mood.</p>
<p>And there was one more he recognized.</p>
<p>Mahiru Shiina—the name of his next-door neighbor who always looked after him, the secret object of his affections.</p>
<p><em>If I didn’t know any better, I’d swear somebody planned it all out.</em></p>
<p>Of course, class assignments were decided by the school administration, meaning Amane and his friends had no say where they ended up, but he never expected to be placed with so many familiar faces.</p>
<p>“We got real lucky, didn’t we, Amane?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what’s so great about it. I guess it’s a relief to have you with me.”</p>
<p>“What’s up, you getting embarrassed for once?”</p>
<p>“Shut it. And if anyone’s lucky, it’s gotta be you, right? Being in the same class as Chitose and all.”</p>
<p>“I really am, man. I was worried that they’d heartlessly tear us two lovers apart…”</p>
<p>“On second thought, maybe putting some distance between you two would’ve been better for everybody.”</p>
<p>With this excitable couple around, there wouldn’t be a single moment of boredom—or peace. And their constant displays of affection were almost guaranteed to bother all the single students.</p>
<p>Amane was happy to be in the same class as his friends Itsuki and Chitose, but on the other hand, he could already tell that this year was going to be turbulent and difficult.</p>
<p>“Why so harsh? Ah, don’t tell me—it’s because you’re single, right?”</p>
<p>“Try saying that to the other guys. If looks could kill, man.”</p>
<p>“I’m joking, I’m joking! But seriously, this turned out pretty great, yeah? You finally get to be in the same class as the girl you like.”</p>
<p>“…Shut up.” Amane turned sharply away from Itsuki’s teasing.</p>
<p>A cheerful voice interrupted their banter. “I could be wrong, but Fujimiya looks a little pissed, doesn’t he?” There was a quiet laugh. “He’ll start to hate you if you tease him too much, Itsuki.”</p>
<p>Amane felt himself frown as he looked up and saw Yuuta, the class prince, standing beside Itsuki with one hand resting on his shoulder.</p>
<p>It was impossible to miss the flickering glances gathering on him in the hallway. This level of attention must have been completely normal to him, because he didn’t seem bothered in the slightest. Yuuta was just showing Amane a friendly smile.</p>
<p>“Morning. We’re in the same class again this year. Looking forward to it.”</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like a very significant interaction. He had seen Itsuki and Amane conversing by the bulletin board and had come over to greet them. Yuuta got along okay with Itsuki, so that wasn’t strange, but it was unusual for him to be so friendly with Amane.</p>
<p>Amane felt a little uncomfortable talking with such a popular guy. There was nothing wrong with Yuuta as a person, but Amane disliked attracting too much attention.</p>
<p>Besides, making new friends like this at the beginning of the new semester threatened to remind him of the past. The pain welling up slowly but steadily from the deep crevices of his chest was nostalgic. It was a feeling he thought he had buried a long time ago.</p>
<p>“…Fujimiya?”</p>
<p>“Eh? Ah, sorry; I spaced out for a second. Hope we have a good year.”</p>
<p>Amane smiled back weakly at Yuuta, who was now frowning slightly, looking worried for a moment before finally letting his face soften into a relieved smile.</p>
<p><em>You should save a smile like that for your fangirls</em>, Amane thought briefly. But Yuuta looked genuinely happy, so Amane was also relieved.</p>
<p>At that point, a couple other boys came over, and Yuuta left to chat with them.</p>
<p>Itsuki, who had been silent until then, had his eyes fixed on Amane, as if he was forming some conjecture. “Is it just me, or are you on your guard around Yuuta?”</p>
<p>“…No, that’s not it. It’s just… I was thinking how weird it is for him to try to be friends with me.”</p>
<p>“Really, dude? You’re always way too hard on yourself. Look, it’s not like Yuuta has some ulterior motive for being friendly with you, ya know? Not everyone who acts nice is looking to gain some advantage. You’re one cagy guy, Amane.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure that’s true,” Amane replied, “but—” The moment he noticed Itsuki glaring at him with exasperation, he gulped back down the words he was going to say next. <em>—But there are people like that out there.</em></p>
<p>Not that he suspected Yuuta was one of them or anything.</p>
<p>They had only spent the past year as classmates in passing, but even so, Amane knew that Yuuta was a good guy. With his kind, honest, charming personality, it was hardly a mystery why the boy was popular, and no wonder he had lots of friends.</p>
<p>Still, this particular time of year brought back many unpleasant memories for Amane, and it made him extra suspicious, even when he knew there was no reason to be.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t really have anything to do with what kind of guy Kadowaki is. I’m just shy, so I get spooked when someone suddenly wants to talk to me.”</p>
<p>“Well, I guess that’s fair. You are the shy type. The first time we talked, you got all wound up like a nervous cat.”</p>
<p>“Who’re you calling a cat?”</p>
<p>“Tell me I’m wrong. Timid and quiet as could be as long as no one touched you, but the moment someone made contact, <em>bam</em>, your hackles would be up.”</p>
<p>Amane frowned at Itsuki’s analogy. As a cat lover, he didn’t appreciate his sulky attitude being lumped in with such adorable, free-spirited creatures.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I think you’d get along with Yuuta if you gave him a chance. Since middle school, we’ve been in the same class for three years, so I can vouch for him. He’s a good dude.”</p>
<p>“I can tell that just by watching him, but it’s my feelings that are the problem. Besides, I’ve never really talked with him…”</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure it won’t be long before he changes that himself.”</p>
<p>“Wait, why?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? It’s ’cause even Yuuta can tell you’re a good guy.”</p>
<p>Itsuki said that with another big grin, but Amane frowned reflexively. He simply didn’t understand.</p>
<p class="space-break">“Mooorniiing! Looks like we’re in the same class this year!”</p>
<p>After Amane entered his new classroom, found his assigned seat, and checked that there were no mistakes in his school paperwork, Chitose approached him, looking like she’d just gotten out of bed.</p>
<p>This year, both Chitose and Itsuki were in his class, so he knew this was only the first of many boisterous and heartburn-inducing days.</p>
<p>“Good morning. You didn’t come with Itsuki today, huh?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I overslept. Honestly, I totally forgot about the new semester, and my mom had to wake me up. Where’s Itsuki?”</p>
<p>“He went to the vending machines a minute ago.”</p>
<p>“Gotcha. Guess I’ll message him and ask for a milk tea. Ah, Mahirun, Mahirun! We’re in the same class this year! I can’t wait!”</p>
<p>Waving her hands excitedly, Chitose, who wasn’t bashful around anyone, bounded over to Mahiru, who had just entered the classroom. Mahiru, surrounded by a slew of boys and girls, blinked in surprise. Everyone around her stiffened when they heard Chitose address her so casually, but when Mahiru reacted normally and instantly donned her angelic smile, it was clear that Chitose was permitted to talk to her that way. That was when the crowd’s mood changed to one of jealousy.</p>
<p>Watching Chitose rush over to Mahiru with so much energy that early in the morning left Amane feeling equal parts frustration and admiration. When his gaze fell on Mahiru, their eyes met for a moment, and he thought he saw a flicker of change in her soft smile. But the next instant, she shifted her gaze back to Chitose with a tender look in her eyes.</p>
