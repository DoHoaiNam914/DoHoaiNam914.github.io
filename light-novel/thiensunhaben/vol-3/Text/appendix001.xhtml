<p class="noindent1">Thank you very much for picking up this book.</p>
<p>My name is Saekisan. I am the author. I trust you enjoyed Volume 3 of <em>The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten</em>.</p>
<p class="space-break">As I told you in the afterword to the previous volume, this book is the one where Mahiru changes it up and becomes a little bit devilish. In Volume 3, I tried to show her taking a more active role.</p>
<p>Apparently, she understood that if she didn’t make an effort to push, nothing would ever happen, so she really went all out to manipulate Amane, but Amane didn’t give in. She was really proactive, but in the end, it was no good. She couldn’t make it happen, oh no!</p>
<p>Even so, Amane has chosen to move forward in his own way and is doing his best, so if you would be so kind as to enjoy the two of them becoming tantalizingly closer, I would be most glad.</p>
<p>That’s because I’m planning to have Amane take a more proactive role in the next volume as well! Come on, Amane, show us your manliness!</p>
<p class="space-break">Besides that, we once again have some very cute illustrations by Hanekoto. What did you all think? Aren’t they just too cute? Our angel really is angelic; that much is clear.</p>
<p>All the illustrations are so cute I’m at a loss for words, but personally, I think the ones of Mahiru looking embarrassed are the cutest. Huh? She looks embarrassed in most of them…? Must be because of Amane, huh…?</p>
<p>In other words, they’re all adorable.</p>
<p>Take another look, everyone.</p>
<p>I’m really looking forward to the illustrations for the next volume… And I’ve got to believe there will be another one!</p>
<p class="space-break">Well then, we’ve come to the end, but I must thank everyone who has looked after me.</p>
<p>To those of you who have worked so hard to get this book published—the head editors, everyone in the GA Novels editing department, everyone in the sales department, the proofreaders, Hanekoto, everyone at the printers—and to all of you who picked up a copy of this book—sincerely, thank you all.</p>
<p>I shall lay down my pen here and pray we can meet again in the next volume.</p>
<p>Thank you for enjoying my book to the very end!</p>
