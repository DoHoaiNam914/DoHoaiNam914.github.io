<p class="noindent1">Golden Week, which had seemed both very long and painfully short, eventually came to a close, and school began again.</p>
<p><em>…Finally, I can get some distance from Mahiru.</em></p>
<p>Mahiru had spent nearly the entire Golden Week at Amane’s apartment. He’d said it was okay, was grateful she had made their delicious meals, and was happy to spend time with the girl he loved.</p>
<p>But ever since the day Amane had told Mahiru about his troubled past, his feelings for her had only grown, and now he found it almost impossible to calm his turbulent emotions.</p>
<p>Mahiru trusted Amane wholeheartedly. She spoiled him, certainly, but in a way she also took advantage of him, testing the limits of his emotional fortitude. And knowing he was the only one allowed to touch her sent his feelings into overdrive.</p>
<p><em>Really,</em> he thought, <em>I deserve some kind of award for self-control. If only I didn’t have to hold back, I bet I could ask her out. I might even get a good answer—</em></p>
<p>Mahiru had been so accepting of Amane, but he knew he didn’t have the guts to tell her how he felt. Just the thought of her rejection made him want to curl up and die. He knew he was a coward, too afraid to make a move. But perhaps he was even more afraid of what might happen if she didn’t reject him, if by some chance she felt the same way about him. He didn’t think he was good enough to be her boyfriend.</p>
<p><em>…I’ve got a lot of work to do.</em></p>
<p>There wasn’t anything he could do about his face, but he wanted to improve himself wherever he could—physically and mentally. At least enough so no one would talk behind their backs when he was with her—enough so Mahiru wouldn’t be ashamed of being with him.</p>
<p>And even if it turned out Mahiru didn’t like him that way, it didn’t hurt to try. He’d never get anywhere if he didn’t give it his best.</p>
<p>As he made up his mind to ask Yuuta, the lean, athletic track-and-field star, for some training recommendations, Amane passed through the school gates and reached the shoe lockers, where he caught sight of a familiar face.</p>
<p>“Mornin’…” Itsuki was groggily changing into his indoor slippers. He gave a puzzled frown when he saw Amane. “…What’s with that face?”</p>
<p>“That’s my line,” Amane said. “And anyway, what face?”</p>
<p>“Well, umm… How do I put this? You look like you’ve made a big decision. You finally decide to tell her how you feel?”</p>
<p>Amane gave Itsuki an incredulous look. “Hmph. Yeah, right!” But his friend hadn’t been that far off the mark.</p>
<p>Itsuki stared at him with genuine curiosity. “Huh, well then, what is it? I thought there would have been some kind of progress by now.”</p>
<p>“P-progress? All right, look—”</p>
<p>“I was sure you’d finally grown a pair and decided to approach her like a man for a change.”</p>
<p>“Damn, no need to be an ass! Anyway… I was just thinking about how I have a lot of work to do if I’m ever gonna get her to like me back.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. In other words, over the break, after we went to karaoke…something did happen! You’re really going for it, eh?!” Itsuki chuckled.</p>
<p>Amane couldn’t think of a clever comeback.</p>
<p>Itsuki slapped his friend on the back as he laughed. “Well, I know you hate me prying, so I’ll let you off the hook… But if there’s anything I can help you with, I will, okay?”</p>
<p>“Itsuki…”</p>
<p>“And we can think about double dates, okay?”</p>
<p>“Ah, so that’s what you’re really after,” Amane joked. He knew Itsuki was only trying to lighten the mood.</p>
<p>Itsuki cackled and smacked Amane’s back again. “Yeah, that’s the dream, huh…?” Humor was Itsuki’s way of cheering him up.</p>
<p>Amane smiled at his friend, feeling just a little bit more optimistic. “Whatever you say, man.”</p>
<p class="space-break">When Amane and Itsuki reached their classroom, there was some kind of clamor going on. The commotion wasn’t directed at the two of them, but the lively atmosphere was so different from normal that Amane couldn’t hide his bewilderment.</p>
<p>After a long break, it was normal for the classroom to be bustling with stories of vacation, but today it was filled with a different kind of noise—the bustle of people passing rumors. Amane strained his ears to listen in as he unloaded his bags at his seat—and it seemed they were all discussing Mahiru.</p>
<p>“I heard that Shiina went on a date the other day with a cool-looking guy!”</p>
<p>What he overheard made Amane’s cheek twitch violently.</p>
<p>They’d gone to crowded places, so there had always been a possibility that someone would see them. But Amane had never imagined it would literally become the talk of the classroom. He didn’t mind the part about looking cool, but the rest of it immediately set him on edge.</p>
<p>Itsuki had obviously overheard the same thing and was sitting there doing a very bad job of not smiling. Amane would have liked to give him a good punch in the arm.</p>
<p>As they whispered about the rumors, all the girls kept glancing over at Mahiru.</p>
<p>“I heard they were strolling around arm in arm, and she was wearing a smile no one’s ever seen at school before… It must have been the guy everyone was talking about at the start of the year.”</p>
<p>“She says she’s not dating anyone, but there’s no doubt now…”</p>
<p>Mahiru, who had come to school early, as always, was preparing for first period. She either didn’t realize the rumors were about her, or more likely, she did realize and was trying to ignore them.</p>
<p>She had to be used to the attention, thanks to her beauty and grace, but that day there were more than the usual number of eyes peering in her direction, filled with questions. And aside from the curious stares of the girls, she was getting looks of dead despair from the boys.</p>
<p>If it bothered Mahiru, she certainly didn’t show it. She stubbornly maintained her usual angelic demeanor.</p>
<p>Eventually, a few of the girls in the class couldn’t contain their curiosity any longer and gingerly approached her.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey, Shiina?” one of the girls asked timidly.</p>
<p>Mahiru slowly batted her eyes. “Yes, did you need something?” She was acting like she had no idea what the girls wanted.</p>
<p>“Well, the other day, I think I saw you walking through the shopping mall with a guy.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did walk through the mall,” Mahiru confirmed.</p>
<p>A wave of murmuring went through the class. Obviously, everyone had been wondering if the rumors were true. Amane, at the center of the scandal, felt sick to his stomach.</p>
<p>“Um, so that guy… What kind of relationship…?”</p>
<p>“What kind of relationship do we have?” Mahiru interrupted. “Well, if I had to say, I think calling us <em>friends</em> would describe it best.”</p>
<p>Amane was glad Mahiru had answered honestly, but his stomach still felt like it was tied in knots. His classmates continued to mutter among themselves. He wished they would all just mind their own business, but there was little he could do about it. Several of the other boys in class seemed very relieved by Mahiru’s answer, undoubtedly for different reasons than Amane.</p>
<p>“So it wasn’t a date or anything?”</p>
<p>“A date…?” Mahiru thought for a moment. “Well, when I consider the definition of a date, I think it counts.”</p>
<p>It was not the answer he had been expecting. In the strictest sense, a date was when two or more people picked a place and time to meet up, so she wasn’t exactly wrong… But it was pretty obvious that was not what the girls had meant.</p>
<p>The small crowd shrieked as their excitement peaked.</p>
<p>From Amane’s perspective, it seemed like since time immemorial, girls loved getting excited about other people’s love affairs. Normally he didn’t concern himself with that kind of chatter, figuring it was just what girls did. But this time, he couldn’t ignore their gossip—because he was at the center of it.</p>
<p>“S-so what are you saying…?”</p>
<p>The same girl who had asked the previous questions inquired again. Her voice trembled with a mix of curiosity and hope.</p>
<p>Mahiru glanced at Amane for a split second. That look, gentle but filled with hints of passion, left him momentarily breathless. By the time he got ahold of himself, Mahiru had already turned away.</p>
<p>Now Mahiru wore a gentle smile, full of warmth and affection, and clasped her hands in front of her breast, as if she were tightly holding on to something very precious. Her answer sent the class into chaos, and it shook Amane to his core.</p>
<p>“We’re not dating, but to me…he is the most important person on earth.”</p>
