<p class="noindent1">“Hey, Amane, can we have a Christmas party at your place?”</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>The proposal had been immediately shot down, and Chitose puffed out her cheeks to make her disappointment obvious.</p>
<p>Christmas Eve was fast approaching, but since Amane lived separately from his family and was a loner by nature, the holiday didn’t hold any real significance. Still, Chitose and Itsuki seemed keen on spending it with him and had come to ask him about holding a little celebration.</p>
<p>Chitose had gone out of her way to barge into Amane and Itsuki’s classroom at lunchtime with the idea, and now she had her cheeks puffed out because of Amane’s near-instant refusal.</p>
<p>“Come on, Amane,” Itsuki angled. “You’re alone anyway…ah, unless maybe there’s a girlfriend in the picture?”</p>
<p>“No, there isn’t.”</p>
<p>“Well then, it’s fine!” Chitose interjected. “Or could it be that you secretly hate us?”</p>
<p>“Well, if Amane hates us, then I guess we don’t need him, either,” Itsuki added.</p>
<p>In their own way, his friends were probably expressing their concern for him. There was also the possibility that they were hunting for a place where they could relax and flirt. Amane felt bad about refusing them, even when they made such exaggeratedly disappointed faces at him. He didn’t actually hate them.</p>
<p>That was not to say Amane had no concerns, however. First was the thought of how the two of them would act in a private setting. Amane could feel the embarrassment washing over him at the mere thought of Itsuki and Chitose’s shameless intimacy. Then there was the fact that he would have to explain things to Mahiru. She would have to steer clear until Amane’s friends left, and he would have to be very careful about covering up any evidence of her frequent visits.</p>
<p>“Fine. I get it, I get it. The twenty-fourth, right? I have a condition, though: You have to set me free before nightfall and go somewhere else together to get all your flirting done. I’ll remind you that excessive physical contact is prohibited in my apartment.” With Amane’s concession to the couple’s demands, Chitose’s face lit up with a smile.</p>
<p>“Guess there’s nothing we can do about that rule. I’m sure we can work something out,” she said.</p>
<p>“Who do you think you are to say such entitled things?” Amane quickly grabbed one of Chitose’s cheeks and pinched.</p>
<p>“Owwsh!” she slurred. “Itsukiii, Amane’s buwwyying me!”</p>
<p>“Come on, Amane, don’t be mean to Chi! I’m the only one who’s allowed to pinch her cheeks,” Itsuki said.</p>
<p>“Fine, fine; pinch her real good for me, then,” Amane replied.</p>
<p>“Leave it to me.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare!” Chitose cried.</p>
<p>Amane entrusted Itsuki to carry out the sentence, but as one might’ve expected, he and Chitose turned it into just another excuse to flirt. Within moments, the two of them started messing around, playfully pinching each other’s faces.</p>
<p>Now Chitose actually looked happy to be pinched.</p>
<p>Amane shrugged. “…Can I go?”</p>
<p>This was Amane’s classroom, but he wanted to get some distance from the lovey-dovey couple before they got any more insufferable.</p>
<p>“No way! We’ve got to make proper plans. We need to arrange for food and a cake!”</p>
<p>“I’m not making anything.”</p>
<p>There was no way Amane could fix a Christmas meal. Mahiru could handle it, no problem, but there was absolutely no way he could get her help this time. That’s why Amane quickly brushed off the idea, insisting that it would be impossible for him to cook. Chitose didn’t seem convinced, however, and was staring at him strangely.</p>
<p>“What?” Amane asked.</p>
<p>“I was just thinking you look awfully healthy for someone who can’t cook,” Chitose said.</p>
<p>“So? What’s the problem?”</p>
<p>“Well, you see, Chi, Amane’s got his own reasons for that,” Itsuki commented.</p>
<p>“Huh, well, don’t you want to know about them, too, Itsuki?”</p>
<p>“I’ll get him to spill later.”</p>
<p>“I’m not telling you a thing.”</p>
<p>Amane glared at Itsuki as if to tell him not to make promises he couldn’t keep, and he laughed out loud, in a forced way. Itsuki knew when to let things go, but he had a bad habit of dredging up old stuff at rather inopportune times.</p>
<p>“You guys are a real handful…,” Amane muttered. “Well, for dinner, can’t we get takeout or something? We’ll have to order the cake if we want one.” Attempting to move away from his own affairs that the couple seemed so eager to pry into, he made a pragmatic proposal.</p>
<p>There was no way he could make a cake or prepare a meal on his own, so arranging for ready-made food seemed to be the way to go.</p>
<p>“Ah, all right then, let’s have pizza! I’ll book a cake from my usual place; they’re still taking orders!” Chitose declared.</p>
<p>“You don’t want chicken?” asked her boyfriend.</p>
<p>“You like pizza better, too, don’t you, Itsuki?”</p>
<p>“True, true. That’s my Chi; you know me best.”</p>
<p>“Eh-heh-heh…”</p>
<p>While the two lovebirds had decided on what to get without discussing it at all with Amane, he was fine with pizza. Something like that made it feel more like a party anyway. Given the way things were going, they would probably pick up some takeaway pizzas from the shop that Amane and Itsuki often visited.</p>
<p>The moment Amane heard the word <em>pizza</em>, he thought of Mahiru—and when she’d nibbled her pizza like a small animal. Amane had found it strangely charming, probably because he usually saw her eating so elegantly. Come to think of it, he’d gotten Mahiru to eat cake the other day, too. Amane’s cheeks glowed warmly as he remembered that.</p>
<p><em>I won’t do anything like that again</em>, Amane vowed to himself.</p>
<p>It’d been so embarrassing to feed each other; there was no way Amane could endure a repeat of that. Mahiru and Amane weren’t some affectionate couple like Itsuki and Chitose, so the opportunity should never come up again anyway.</p>
<p>“…Hey, Amane, what’s up?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, nothing. All right, we’ll leave the cake order up to you.”</p>
<p>Amane had drifted back into some embarrassing memories for a moment, and Chitose had started staring at him with a concerned expression, puzzled. Panicking, Amane chased the flustering thoughts from his head and did his best to be casual.</p>
<p>“All right! Let’s get our pizza order in, too!” he said, a bit more worked up than usual.</p>
<p>With Chitose’s excitable voice still ringing in his ears, Amane returned home and decided to ask Mahiru about her Christmas plans.</p>
<p class="space-break">“Christmas plans? I don’t really have any,” Mahiru replied quickly from her place on the sofa. Amane had posed the question after finishing the dishes and joining her in the living room. He’d been confident Mahiru would be going to a girls’ party, but apparently, she didn’t have anything lined up. Maybe Amane’s surprise showed, because Mahiru made an annoyed face at him.</p>
<p>“Basically, all the girls I know and most of my female classmates have boyfriends to go out with. And I always turn down all the boys who invite me out, so my schedule is totally open,” she explained.</p>
<p>“Breaking all the hearts, huh?”</p>
<p>Whenever she was out in public, Mahiru kept her guard up, and any hopeful suitors were sure to end up drowning in their own tears when faced with the angel’s impregnable defenses.</p>
<p>Still, Amane had to respect anyone who had the guts to ask Mahiru out. No one would be able to do such a thing without a huge amount of self-confidence, and Amane admired those optimistic types.</p>
<p>“…I wonder why boys want to spend Christmas with me so badly anyway?” Mahiru wondered aloud.</p>
<p>“They’re probably hoping to get to know you better,” Amane explained.</p>
<p>“What for?”</p>
<p>“I mean, because they want to date you?”</p>
<p>“And why would they want to date me?”</p>
<p>“…Probably to do all the sorts of…<em>things</em> that dating people do.”</p>
<p>“How obscene.”</p>
<p>Amane offered a silent prayer for all the guys who’d just been ruthlessly discarded. “Well, I don’t think every one of them is like that, so don’t be too distrustful. I’m sure you understand that you’re the sort of girl who draws all their eyes.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. It’s unlikely that all of them are harboring lewd thoughts. After all, you aren’t like that, are you, Amane?”</p>
<p>“Have I ever treated you that way?” Amane had certainly thought Mahiru looked cute, or that he wanted to rub her head, but he’d never gone so far as to fantasize about being intimate with her. If such things ever did cross his mind, Amane was sure that Mahiru would likely notice and pull away from him.</p>
<p>It was only because Mahiru saw Amane as a harmless puppy that he could sit there next to her. Baring so much as a single fang could be enough to send her running away. The needs of Amane’s stomach ranked higher in his mind than other appetites, so he had no intention of jeopardizing his relationship with Mahiru.</p>
<p>“I suppose you’re right. You never seemed to have any interest in me from the beginning, Amane.”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I trust you.”</p>
<p>“Well, thanks for that.”</p>
<p>As a guy, Amane wasn’t sure how he felt about Mahiru’s reasons for trusting him, but for the time being, he decided he was okay with being the “safe guy.”</p>
<p>“…So, Amane, did you have something in mind when you asked me about my Christmas plans?” Mahiru inquired.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, on the afternoon of the twenty-fourth, Itsuki and Chitose are coming over, so I thought I would let you know that, uh, our usual dinner might have to start late.”</p>
<p>Having returned to the original topic of conversation, Amane carefully explained the situation while Mahiru nodded along.</p>
<p>“I understand. Please call me once your Christmas party is over, and I’ll make dinner then. I’ll try to take care of the prep work ahead of time,” Mahiru said.</p>
<p>“Sure; sorry about all that.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Have fun.”</p>
<p>“…You won’t be lonely?”</p>
<p>“I’m used to spending Christmas alone.”</p>
<p>Mahiru’s casual attitude about spending the holiday alone struck Amane as rather depressing. Perhaps thoughts of Christmas had reminded Mahiru of her parents, because a small, self-deprecating laugh slipped out.</p>
<p>“…Ah, um, this is really presumptuous of me to say, but…even if I can’t do Christmas Eve, how about we spend Christmas Day together?” Amane felt extremely awkward making this sort of suggestion. He didn’t have any particular ulterior motive, but two people getting together on the holiday usually did carry a certain implication.</p>
<p><em>There’s no special meaning to this</em>, Amane told himself. It was just that he hated when Mahiru looked so lonely; that was all.</p>
<p>Surprised, Mahiru blinked quickly at the suggestion. “Together? Doing what?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Huh? Ah, well, I didn’t really have anything in mind. Sorry.” Now that it was obvious he didn’t have a plan, Amane figured he should drop the issue. There was also the consideration that going out together meant there was a risk of being spotted by someone from school. That would be a huge problem for Amane and Mahiru both.</p>
<p>The best option would be spending time at home, but there was probably nothing in Amane’s apartment that would interest Mahiru. It would likely boil down to just sitting next to each other, doing nothing, which would probably be incredibly awkward.</p>
<p>If that’s all Amane could offer, he suspected it was probably better to just spend the day apart. As he prepared to withdraw his proposal, he noticed that Mahiru was staring at him quietly.</p>
<p>“…Okay. I’d like to try that,” It was unexpected, but Mahiru actually seemed interested.</p>
<p>Her slim finger was pointing at the television. To be more precise, she was pointing at the game console housed inside the TV stand.</p>
<p>Recently, Mahiru had been visiting in the evenings, so Amane hadn’t booted up the system much, but it seemed like Mahiru was curious about it.</p>
<p>“I’ve never used one of those things…,” she confessed in a small voice.</p>
<p>Amane didn’t have any concrete reason to refuse Mahiru if she wanted to try playing games, but the thought of a guy and girl who weren’t dating or anything spending Christmas day together playing video games was somewhat surreal. Even if he wasn’t hoping for anything romantic, it was only natural that the idea gave rise to a confusing mix of emotions.</p>
<p>“Oh, well, that’d be fine, but…is that okay? To spend the day gaming?” Amane asked.</p>
<p>“Is there anything wrong with that?” Mahiru replied with her own question.</p>
<p>“I guess not, but…”</p>
<p>“Well, then let’s go with that.”</p>
<p>“S-sure.”</p>
<p><em>Great, I guess that’s what we’re doing…</em></p>
<p>Since it was what Mahiru wanted, Amane resolved himself to do everything he could to make sure it happened. He wanted to at least give her this modest bit of enjoyment. Mahiru was always taking care of him, and she hardly ever asked for anything, so he would let her play anything she wanted, as long as he had it in his collection. It wasn’t like he had any plans on Christmas Day anyway, so this was a small price indeed for Mahiru’s fantastic cooking.</p>
<p>“All right, we can have a laid-back day that doesn’t have anything to do with Christmas or whatever,” Amane declared.</p>
<p>“Then it’s decided,” Mahiru answered.</p>
<p>Amane found it difficult to look directly at Mahiru’s smiling face, so instead he nodded and turned away while doing his best to look casual.</p>
<p class="space-break">“Merry Christmas!”</p>
<p>Christmas Eve arrived before too long.</p>
<p>School had already let out for winter break, and everyone was probably spending the day enjoying themselves. Itsuki and Chitose had shown up at Amane’s apartment, party supplies in hand, at around one in the afternoon.</p>
<p>On the table, the pizza and juice they had ordered for delivery were already laid out. The three had actually planned to meet up a bit earlier, but the Christmas crowds had slowed everything down and put them all behind schedule. Thankfully, it was only an hour past noon, and Amane hadn’t been waiting too long, so no one seemed all that bothered.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, Merry Christmas,” Amane replied.</p>
<p>“Amane, you don’t sound very excited! Try again,” Chitose instructed.</p>
<p>“Merry Christmas!”</p>
<p>“You’re saying the words just fine, but you’re not really in the spirit, are you?”</p>
<p>Amane didn’t like to be compared to Chitose, who was very excitable by nature.</p>
<p>Realizing that she was even more worked up than usual, Itsuki did his best to placate Chitose. He flashed a flippant, yet still-warm smile at his girlfriend.</p>
<p>“Come on, we don’t need to worry about that. Let’s get to the eating part and the having-a-good-time part and then the falling-asleep part,” said Itsuki.</p>
<p>“You can’t sleep here, idiot,” Amane snapped.</p>
<p>“I’m just kidding, geez. Besides, if I am gonna sleep, I’m going to Chi’s place.”</p>
<p>“You’ll have to do that when her parents aren’t around.”</p>
<p>“Huh, Amaneee! What kind of perverted things are you thinking?!” Chi cried. She was grinning, but Amane didn’t respond. Instead, he made for the kitchen to grab some cups and utensils. Pouting, Chitose looked briefly disappointed at this lack of reaction but then quickly followed after him, shouting that she would help.</p>
<p>The kitchen was, naturally, neat and tidy, with everything in order. Mahiru had made it her territory as of late, so all the various tools and seasonings were lined up for easy access.</p>
<p>“Whoa, this is way cleaner than I expected,” Chitose commented.</p>
<p>“Thanks a lot,” Amane responded idly. He took small plates for individual portions and some cups out of a kitchen cupboard. When he tried to hand half to Chitose, he found her staring fixedly at the cupboard.</p>
<p>“…What is it?” Amane asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing!” she answered hurriedly.</p>
<p>Amane felt something devious behind Chitose’s sly smile, and a shiver shot down his back. The best course of action for the time being was to ignore her entirely, however, so Amane did his best to act like nothing was wrong. He had a terrible feeling Chitose was brewing up some elaborate misconception, but since she hadn’t said anything, Amane wasn’t sure what it could be.</p>
<p>Grimacing, Amane and Chitose returned to the living room where Itsuki was waiting. It was becoming abundantly clear that Chitose was in an even better mood than when she’d first arrived.</p>
<p>“Seriously, though, your apartment is super clean. It’s so big and luxurious,” Chitose muttered. The three friends had mostly finished eating. They’d been listening to Christmas music through the speakers in the living room.</p>
<p>There was little Amane could say in response to Chitose’s comment. He was living in a nice apartment because his parents were paying for it, and the place was only this clean because Mahiru had helped him keep it that way. After considering that, all Amane could say was “Yeah, thanks.”</p>
<p>“It’s definitely impressive how much better the place looks now that it’s clean…,” Itsuki remarked.</p>
<p>“Shut up…,” Amane shot back.</p>
<p>“Yep, yep, I smell a girl!” Chitose added.</p>
<p>“How did you make that jump?” Amane had no idea how Chitose made the connection between his clean apartment and a feminine presence.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Call it a woman’s intuition. The way everything’s arranged is a little off for you, personality-wise. There’s something about the way the books are lined up and how the cords are all gathered to keep them from getting tangled or torn. Plus, there are all sorts of cooking implements in the kitchen that seem like they really don’t belong to you, Amane.”</p>
<p>“…They’re my mom’s,” Amane lied.</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Preemptively, Amane had shoved all of Mahiru’s things into the back of a cabinet, but Chitose must have caught sight of them when Amane had been getting the plates.</p>
<p>Amane’s tableware alone hadn’t been enough, so Mahiru had brought a few things over from her place, but Amane hadn’t expected Chitose to notice. For better or worse, she was not the kind of person who usually paid attention to such details.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not like we care that much, right, Itsuki?” Amane’s reply had been suspiciously slow. Sensing a deeper meaning in that, Chitose leaned over to Itsuki, grinning.</p>
<p>Casually, and without a hint of hesitation, Itsuki reached over and rested his hand between Chitose’s knees as he embraced her. It was getting extremely difficult to look directly at the couple.</p>
<p>“Hey, why don’t you get a room, you two?!” Amane shouted.</p>
<p>“Oh, you jealous, Amane?” Itsuki asked.</p>
<p>“Psh, yeah right.”</p>
<p>Rather than any sort of envy, Amane just wanted them out of his sight. He wished they would stop, but this sort of behavior was business as usual for the couple. Scolding them for it was a waste of energy at this point.</p>
<p>Looking very satisfied with herself as she clung to Itsuki, Chitose leaned against his chest and looked up at Itsuki’s face. “…I bet everyone’s flirting at their own parties right about now.”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t forget you’ve got a guy right here crying bitter tears of loneliness,” said Amane.</p>
<p><em>There’s no way</em> everyone <em>is acting like these two.</em></p>
<p>There had to be some people who were spending the holiday with family—and others who were spending it with friends. Surely there were even some spending the holiday completely alone. Amane felt like Chitose ought to choose her words more carefully. Not everyone was lucky enough to spend Christmas with other people.</p>
<p>“Do boys really want sweethearts that badly?” Chitose asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t think they do,” Amane answered flatly. “I certainly don’t.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but…,” Itsuki interjected, “you’re an outlier.”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>“Well, everyone gets restless right before Christmas, you know,” Chitose continued. “Especially single guys. The other day, I asked the angel about her Christmas plans and found out she’d ruthlessly rejected just about every boy in school. She left ’em all brokenhearted because she supposedly already made plans with someone else.”</p>
<p>“Huh,” Itsuki said.</p>
<p>Amane had a feeling that someone was him. The idea that he was little more than a diplomatic excuse to turn down other dates wasn’t a pleasant one, but he knew that it pained Mahiru to have to refuse anyone. If having plans with Amane helped ease Mahiru’s conscience, then he supposed he couldn’t object. After all, she wasn’t giving his name out, so there shouldn’t be any trouble.</p>
<p>“All those poor boys looked so crushed. It was rude, but I laughed,” Chitose recalled.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t laugh!” Itsuki scolded playfully.</p>
<p>“I mean, using a holiday as an excuse to try to score a date with a girl you barely know is total crap, isn’t it? They’re already off to a late start ’cause they haven’t built any kind of relationship, so they try to take a convenient little shortcut to get to where they really want to be. Plus, I bet those guys are the kind who’d say they were taking her to a party with a lot of people but then create some excuse to be alone with her. It’s a scary thing, for a girl.”</p>
<p>Chitose went on to add that the angel was certainly not the type to go along with those kinds of games anyway, then stuck out her tongue and clung to Itsuki even more, as if she’d touched on an unpleasant memory. Trendy and beautiful, Chitose had a different look than Mahiru. It wouldn’t have been surprising to learn that she’d had some bad experiences with guys in the past. Amane felt a little sorry for her. Popular girls certainly had it rough.</p>
<p>“It must be hard on Shiina, dealing with all those propositions,” Amane said suddenly.</p>
<p>“…You’re really not interested in the angel, are you, Amane?” Itsuki asked.</p>
<p>“Not really,” Amane replied flatly.</p>
<p>“You already have that angelic next-door neighbor of yours, huh?” Chitose needled.</p>
<p>“Don’t think I won’t kick you out of my apartment…”</p>
<p>“No, don’t! I’m sooo scaaared!” Chitose whined, clinging to Itsuki as she playfully glared at Amane. “So you’re not denying that your neighbor has been taking care of you, right?”</p>
<p>Amane’s words stuck in his throat, and Chitose grinned with smug satisfaction, though her expression quickly changed when she saw his face.</p>
<p>“Don’t glare at me like that! Sorry, geez…” Chitose apologized in a tone that held very little remorse. When Amane narrowed his eyes at her a second time, she gave a cutesy shriek and clung to Itsuki again. Then she happened to look through the window behind her boyfriend.</p>
<p>Something outside was surprising enough for her to stare, so Amane also followed her gaze and looked at the window, wondering what was going on. Little white flecks were wafting down from the blue sky.</p>
<p>“…Ah, Itsuki, look! Snow!” Chitose cried.</p>
<p>“Whoa, a white Christmas!”</p>
<p>Snow wasn’t that unusual at the end of December, but it was rare to see any on such a clear day, and it seemed to delight the lovebirds.</p>
<p>It was still daytime, and the temperature was only going to drop as the sun began to set. Christmas Eve was likely to be blanketed in snow this year. Couples all over town were likely rejoicing, and the couple in Amane’s apartment had already stepped out onto his balcony for a better view.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’re going to be making out over there for a while, so I’ll fix you some warm drinks,” Amane shouted as he watched Itsuki and Chitose head outside. As Amane was standing up, a hysterical shriek suddenly caught his ear.</p>
<p>“Huh?! Wh-why are you here?”</p>
<p>“Huh, what?”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>The last voice in the bunch was one Amane had only become accustomed to hearing relatively recently. It rang clear and sweet.</p>
<p>Amane felt his stomach sink.</p>
<p>Aware that Itsuki and Chitose were huddling together on his veranda, Amane dashed out in a panic and saw that Mahiru had also come out onto her own balcony to look at the snow. In doing so, she had been spotted by Amane’s friends the moment she’d leaned over the railing.</p>
<p class="space-break">Amane looked at Mahiru, who was now sitting beside him, and sighed.</p>
<p>Faced with the terrible disaster of everyone encountering each other on the balconies, Amane had been left with no other option but to invite Mahiru into his apartment.</p>
<p>No matter what Amane tried now, his two friends would definitely be suspicious. At this point, telling them the whole truth was probably the only way to avoid unnecessary speculations and misunderstandings. Things were bound to get worse if he couldn’t keep Itsuki and Chitose quiet about this, too.</p>
<p>“…Um, I really am sorry,” Mahiru said gently.</p>
<p>“You didn’t do anything wrong.”</p>
<p>It was a white Christmas and also the first snow of the year. Of course Mahiru had gone to her veranda to take a look. No one could’ve blamed her.</p>
<p>If Amane had heard the sound of her opening her glass door, he might have been able to do something, but there’d been music playing in the apartment, so he hadn’t noticed. Mahiru had likely been trying to stay quiet anyway.</p>
