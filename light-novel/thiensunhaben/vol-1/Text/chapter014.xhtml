<p class="noindent1">Mahiru was going to start cooking dinner at Amane’s apartment, and she presented him with a list of conditions:</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Amane would pay for half the cost of ingredients, plus an additional labor cost, plus the cost of any incidental expenses.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• The two of them would each contact the other no later than the day before if they had something to do and couldn’t eat together.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• They would divide the work of shopping and cleaning up afterward.</p>
<p>Regarding the extra labor cost, it had taken some work to get Mahiru to agree to it. Amane had insisted that he felt bad about all the time she was spending on him. It was to be expected, since she did all the work making the food. Aside from that, though, Amane and Mahiru had come to an agreement rather quickly.</p>
<p>And so, the day after their agreement had been ratified, Mahiru came over early holding supermarket bags in both hands and made preparations to start cooking.</p>
<p>“…It’s really all brand-new, like it’s hardly been used…,” Mahiru commented.</p>
<p>“Shut up,” Amane shot back.</p>
<p>A beautiful girl stood in his kitchen, and she was wearing an apron. This was like a fantasy come to life. Amane was sure he was going to lose it any second now. When Mahiru pointed out, yet again, that he had really never used his kitchen, he felt a deep shame.</p>
<p>“You’ve got an impressive collection of gadgets here, but they’re like pearls tossed before swine,” Mahiru observed.</p>
<p>“Well, if you use them, they won’t go to waste,” Amane reasoned.</p>
<p>“That’s a poor excuse, after the fact. Your precious cookware is practically dying from neglect.”</p>
<p>“All right then, bring it back to life with your amazing culinary talents. I sure as hell can’t.”</p>
<p>With gracious concession, Amane motioned for Mahiru to take over. She returned the gesture with an exasperated expression, but perhaps because she’d expected as much, she just sighed and didn’t complain further.</p>
<p>“All right, let’s get started. Do you have any spices?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do; are you making fun of me? They’re all properly stored—and none are expired, either.”</p>
<p>“Wow, I’m surprised.”</p>
<p>“It’s because they’ve never been opened.”</p>
<p>“That’s nothing to brag about. All right, if you don’t have what we need, I can bring things over from my place to use this once.”</p>
<p>“That would be helpful.”</p>
<p>“For now, if you have the basics, I think we can make do. Also, I decided on today’s dishes already; is that all right?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know much about cooking, so I’m happy with anything as long as I get to eat. I don’t have strong preferences.”</p>
<p>“Really? Then let’s hurry up and get started… Please show me where you keep everything.”</p>
<p>“In this basket.”</p>
<p>“They’re really unopened, huh…”</p>
<p>Mahiru raised her eyebrows in shock as she stared at the basket filled with untouched seasonings. Perhaps because she’d been warned before she’d seen the unused spices, she quickly reassumed her usual demeanor and began washing her hands at the sink.</p>
<p>“All right, I’m going to start making stuff, so you can go wait in the living room or in your bedroom,” Mahiru declared.</p>
<p>“Okay. I can’t help you with anything anyway,” Amane accepted.</p>
<p>“What a gentleman. I suppose you’d just get in the way if you hung around.”</p>
<p>“You’re awfully honest.”</p>
<p>“It’s just the truth. There’s no need to sugarcoat it.”</p>
<p>As Mahiru said, he would clearly just be in the way, so Amane obediently returned to the living room and watched her back as she worked.</p>
<p>When she had finished washing her hands, Mahiru quickly set to work. Amane didn’t know what she was making, but based on the ingredients she had readied, it was probably Japanese food.</p>
<p>Everything about this felt strange to Amane, like he was in a dream, but it was real. Mahiru was actually preparing the ingredients right there, her hair tied up in a gently swaying ponytail.</p>
<p><em>What’s with this situation? It’s like I’ve got a wife or something</em>, Amane thought.</p>
<p>Mahiru probably didn’t feel the same way, but their setup looked a little too much like they were a happy family, and Amane couldn’t help but imagine it. He didn’t have even the smallest desire to live with Mahiru, but the sight of a beautiful girl standing in his kitchen was in itself enough to send his mind to all sorts of places. Whether or not there was any affection between Amane and Mahiru, just having a lovely girl treat him to a home-cooked meal was enough to touch Amane’s heart.</p>
<p>“…Are you thinking weird things over there?”</p>
<p>“You can stop with the strange speculations.”</p>
<p>Amane had frozen when Mahiru called him out. She’d guessed what he was thinking without even turning around.</p>
<p><em>She sure is sharp…</em></p>
<p>Feeling amazed and anxious all at once, Amane stamped down on the not-quite-evil base instincts that had begun welling up inside him and returned to staring at Mahiru’s back.</p>
<p class="space-break">About an hour later, Mahiru began setting out completed dishes on the table.</p>
<p>She’d chosen to make Japanese food today, which was typical when one considered her penchant for healthy cooking.</p>
<p>“It turns out you have quite a few utensils and seasonings, so it looks like I won’t have to bring anything from my place. Starting tomorrow, I can try more elaborate dishes, too.”</p>
<p>“I mean, I’m just grateful you’re making anything for me,” Amane admitted.</p>
<p>Perhaps because Mahiru hadn’t known how many pieces of cookware and seasonings Amane had in his collection, she had made many simple dishes rather than anything more intricate, but the presentation was flawless nonetheless.</p>
<p>Lined up along the table was an array of Japanese-style dishes. From fish simmered in soy sauce to dressed greens. From rolled omelets to miso soup. Every last item was something Amane could never dream of making himself.</p>
