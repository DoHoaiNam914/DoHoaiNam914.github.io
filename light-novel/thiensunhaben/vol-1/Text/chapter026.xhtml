<p class="noindent1">When Mahiru arrived at Amane’s apartment the following day, she seemed a little restless. It would’ve been perfectly understandable to be nervous about visiting the home of a member of the opposite sex on a holiday, but that didn’t seem to be it.</p>
<p><em>Mahiru wants to play games. She’s probably just excited.</em></p>
<p>Apparently, this would be her first time ever playing a video game. In some ways, she was like a sheltered highborn young lady who knew little of the world at large.</p>
<p>“Before we play, I’ll make lunch, okay?” Mahiru confirmed.</p>
<p>“Mm. I’ll have mine well-done, please,” Amane answered casually.</p>
<p>“I know; I remember.”</p>
<p>Even dealing with such a demanding customer didn’t seem to dampen the girl’s mood. With a flutter of her apron, she headed for the kitchen and began preparations for lunch. From the way she was behaving, Mahiru seemed to be quite pleased.</p>
<p>Amane felt a little awkward and embarrassed about how much he had been looking forward to this.</p>
<p><em>It’s just because I’m looking forward to enjoying the games, that’s all</em>, he told himself. It certainly was not that he had been excited about spending time alone with the next-door angel. As he watched Mahiru’s ponytail swaying back and forth, Amane smiled wryly to himself.</p>
<p class="space-break">“…How are you supposed to hold it?”</p>
<p>After lunch, the two of them settled on the sofa in front of the TV. Both were now looking straight at the screen.</p>
<p>When Amane had asked her what game she wanted to play, it became apparent that Mahiru didn’t even know where to start, so he’d booted up a well-known 2D game and handed her a controller. Unfortunately, Mahiru immediately got flustered as it became apparent that she had no idea what to do with it.</p>
<p>“Uh, okay, so you move around with this joystick, and you jump with this button…”</p>
<p>Mahiru, usually so calm and collected, was looking back and forth between the controller and the TV as she manipulated her character on-screen. It was obvious that this was her first time. She charged straight at the enemies without dodging, dying over and over again. Amane began to wonder if perhaps there were things even an angel couldn’t do, though she did seem to be gradually improving, if ever so slowly.</p>
<p>“…I can’t win,” Mahiru professed.</p>
<p>“Never mind clearing the stage—you haven’t even defeated the first enemy,” Amane observed.</p>
<p>“Oh, shut up.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s just a matter of practice; you gotta keep trying. Get that muscle memory.”</p>
<p>Amane warned Mahiru that it would be a challenge, but she didn’t seem ready to give up. It was charming to watch the girl tackle the game with such a serious expression. Amane couldn’t help but smile.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mahiru was just too much of a beginner and kept on losing. Eventually, it was obvious that she was growing frustrated. As she shot a glance at Amane, he could have sworn he heard a gamelike sound effect accompany her sullen face.</p>
<p>“Ah, here, you need to do it like this…” Mahiru was sure to lose interest if she continued to metaphorically bash her head against a wall, so Amane put his hand on the controller she was holding and tried to physically show her what to do.</p>
<p>Amane had cleared this game on countless occasions, so he was able to help Mahiru get through tough spots. Surprisingly, Mahiru was actually worse than the average player. Most people wouldn’t have gotten stuck nearly as many times as she did, but Amane kept that thought private.</p>
<p>“Look, this enemy moves at a consistent speed in an irregular pattern, but if you watch here, he moves toward your character and speeds up as he approaches. Just watch your timing and jump.”</p>
<p>Amane put his hand over Mahiru’s smaller one and gripped the controller to manipulate the character on the TV, showing her how as he explained. On the screen, the game character moved as Amane had said it would, avoiding the oncoming enemy.</p>
<p>It wasn’t much of a move, but it was apparently enough to impress Mahiru, who let out a small gasp of astonishment. Her eyes, rimmed with long lashes, snapped wide open, and her expression brightened.</p>
<p>The two were sitting closer together than they ever had before, and Amane noticed for the first time that Mahiru’s lower lashes were fairly long, too. Smiling, he watched Mahiru happily play.</p>
<p>As Amane admired her beautiful profile, Mahiru turned toward him, possibly because she’d felt his eyes on her. He’d needed to get close in order to be able to reach the controller, so the two had ended up far nearer to each other than either had expected. Their arms and hands were even touching, and Amane could feel Mahiru’s breath lightly grazing his skin. Amane found himself surrounded by warmth and a faint, sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>“S-sorry…” Amane suddenly realized that his hands were almost completely covering Mahiru’s, and he pulled away in a panic, while Mahiru’s eyes darted around the room as if she had only just realized they were touching at all.</p>
<p>Blinking dramatically, Mahiru replied, “No…it’s fine. I’m the one who should apologize.”</p>
<p>The girl’s cheeks had flushed scarlet, and Amane was filled with regret over what he’d done.</p>
<p>Mahiru wasn’t a fan of physical contact. No matter how used to each other they had gotten, having someone touch her hands like that had probably been too much for her. Thankfully, while she looked fairly embarrassed, she didn’t appear upset or angry.</p>
<p>“Really, I’m sorry,” Amane said again.</p>
<p>“Um, I’m not that bothered by it…,” Mahiru said.</p>
<p>“Don’t you hate physical contact?”</p>
<p>“…I was surprised but not upset. It’s not like you’re a stranger.”</p>
<p>It seemed that today, the magnanimous angel had seen fit to forgive Amane’s transgression. Relieved at how easily Mahiru let it go, Amane restarted the game.</p>
<p>Fixing his eyes on the TV screen, Amane got ready to help Mahiru make some real progress in the game this time. Then he saw that her character had fallen off the stage—a rather predictable outcome. Amane was seriously beginning to wonder if he could do anything to help her get better.</p>
<p>In the end, Mahiru somehow managed to clear one level, whining all the while. The two of them agreed that was probably a good stopping place for the time being.</p>
<p>If Amane kept making a total beginner face death, it would have a considerable effect on her motivation. His plan for now was to get her to try another game and loosen up.</p>
<p>“Mahiru, you’re tilting.”</p>
<p>To that end, next Amane had suggested a racing game, since that had some grounding in the real world, but Mahiru was leaning with her entire body.</p>
<p>There was no gyroscopic control element to the game, so there was absolutely no need to physically move around. Amane wasn’t sure whether Mahiru even noticed what she was doing, but she swayed left and right with every turn she made in the game.</p>
<p>In contrast to the earlier game, this one was all about driving a car, and Amane had thought it’d be easier, since pretty much everyone understood the concept of driving to some degree. Playing through the tutorial also might’ve helped, because even though Mahiru’s driving was a bit clumsy, she was able to handle the actual gameplay.</p>
<p>She was trying her absolute hardest to perform well. Her body swayed this way and that while she maintained a very serious expression.</p>
<p><em>This is ridiculously cute</em>, Amane thought.</p>
<p>Mahiru was strangely adorable, rocking back and forth like a pendulum. Her intense focus and effort only made her look even cuter.</p>
<p>With every turn, Mahiru’s body automatically leaned way to the side. Eventually, she tumbled right onto Amane’s lap, and he was forced to choke down a laugh.</p>
<p>“…You really don’t need to tilt your whole body, you know?” he said.</p>
<p>“I-it wasn’t on purpose,” Mahiru replied sheepishly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know. But still, you were leaning pretty far.”</p>
<p>Mahiru sat back up, somehow keeping her trembling, pouty lips in check.</p>
