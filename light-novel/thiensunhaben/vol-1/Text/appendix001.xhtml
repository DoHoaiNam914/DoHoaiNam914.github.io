<p class="noindent1">Nice to meet you. My name is Saeki.</p>
<p class="space-break">I trust you enjoyed <em>The Angel Next Door</em>?</p>
<p>I set out to write this book as a heartwarming, slow-but-steady, fluffy little romantic comedy, and I’m pretty sure I managed to do just that.</p>
<p>Both characters started out rather distant and cold, but they gradually came to trust each other and found themselves charmed by the other before they knew what was happening. It was quite enjoyable to write those changes in their emotions and their relationship.</p>
<p>I think it’s good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I think slow and steady is just the best! That’s what I have to say.</p>
<p>This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and Mahiru aren’t quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins in Volume 2.</p>
<p>I’m still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having unrequited love is the best!</p>
<p class="space-break">I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more charming.</p>
<p>Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise when I heard the offer had been accepted!</p>
<p>I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I’d admired for so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations!</p>
<p>You can tell from looking at Kazutake’s incredibly charming illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly.</p>
<p>I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work!</p>
<p class="space-break">Well then, we’ve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to everyone who’s helped me along the way.</p>
<p>To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at the printing office, and to all of you who’ve picked up this book, I extend my humblest gratitude.</p>
<p>As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again in the next volume.</p>
<p class="space-break">Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!</p>
