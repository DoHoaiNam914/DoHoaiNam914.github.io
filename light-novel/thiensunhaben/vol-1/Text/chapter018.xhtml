<p class="noindent1">Asking Mahiru to pick up her portion of the fruit as soon as the package arrived turned out to be a big mistake. When Amane heard the sound of the intercom and the high-pitched, mischievous voice that called “Aaa-maaa-neee!” through it, he understood that he was in trouble.</p>
<p>Amane had been very grateful for Mahiru’s proposal to make lunch for him on Saturday. It had seemed a veritable blessing from heaven at the time. Truly, the carbonara she’d whipped up had been delicious. The thick-bodied sauce and the kick of black pepper were a perfect match, and it’d been tremendously tasty.</p>
<p>Mahiru hadn’t done anything wrong. Those at fault were Amane himself for failing to recognize in advance what his mother had meant by telling him to be home on Saturday for the delivery and that irksome, surprise-loving woman herself.</p>
<p>“…Um, Fujimiya? Is that the delivery…?” Mahiru asked.</p>
<p>“Nope. That would be my mother. She’s probably using her duplicate key to get through the front door and is heading up right now,” Amane explained. Thinking back on it, it had been his own mistake to take what his mother had said at face value. One way or another, she always created situations that allowed her to come by and check in on him. Amane’s mother could never resist employing a little misdirection.</p>
<p>“…Uh, your mother?”</p>
<p>“She probably came to see whether I’m getting along okay…and she didn’t tell me she was coming. Probably because she knew I would clean up in advance.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh…”</p>
<p>“I know it’s all a bit hard to swallow, but that doesn’t matter right now.”</p>
<p>Right now, the problem was what to do with Mahiru. If Amane’s mother had still been in the lobby downstairs, he could have sent Mahiru home, but that was out of the question now that she was approaching his door. At the same time, his mother was sure to get the wrong idea if he invited her into his apartment and she came across Mahiru. There was no doubting that Mahiru would hate that as much as Amane would.</p>
<p>The longer Amane puzzled over what to do, the closer his mother was getting to just barging right in.</p>
<p><em>I can’t believe this is happening…</em> Amane did have an idea, but he didn’t like it.</p>
<p>“…I’m sorry, Shiina, but could you please hide in my bedroom?”</p>
<p>“Huh, wh-what?”</p>
<p>“Take your stuff with you, and once I find some way to get my mom outside, you can go back home. I’m really sorry, but please?”</p>
<p>With no other viable option, Amane took the helm and steered Mahiru into concealing herself. Thankfully, they’d already finished cleaning up after lunch, so that wouldn’t be a giveaway. If he hid her shoes in the shoe closet, they wouldn’t be discovered, and Mahiru could just bring her personal effects into Amane’s room.</p>
<p>The plan was to let Amane’s mom to make a quick inspection of the apartment while Mahiru was hiding. Amane would mention to his mother that he really wanted to eat her home cooking, something that’d probably keep her too busy to push her way into his room.</p>
<p>Whatever it took, Amane had to keep his mother from breaching the bedroom.</p>
<p>He would purposely request that his mother cook something that used an ingredient he didn’t have in his refrigerator. If the two of them went out shopping together, that would provide Mahiru with a window to escape.</p>
<p>Amane hurriedly explained to Mahiru that such a scheme was the only option as he handed her his extra key and asked her to cooperate with the greatest sincerity he could muster.</p>
<p>“O-okay,” she said, nodding in bewilderment.</p>
<p>In truth, the storage room was also an option, but Amane didn’t want a girl to wait in there. It had no heating, which meant it was quite cold this time of year. Amane’s bedroom had a proper heater, as well as soft cushions. It wouldn’t do to have Mahiru sitting on a bare floor while she shivered from the cold.</p>
<p>“…All right, I’m counting on you. I have to deal with my mom, so…”</p>
<p>Even before meeting his mother, Amane looked dejected. He headed for the entrance while Mahiru quietly slipped into the bedroom. After making sure that the angel was hidden, Amane reluctantly opened the front door.</p>
<p>“My goodness Amane, that took you long enough. I’m glad to see you’re looking well. I was starting to wonder if you were asleep.”</p>
<p>There was Amane’s mother, standing just outside his apartment. He hadn’t seen her since summer break.</p>
<p>Although she was a parent, it would have been difficult to tell from her looks alone. It wasn’t just that her face looked young, she never acted her age, either. She wore the same sort of happy expression she often had back when Amane was still living at home.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, I’m perfectly fine, so how about heading home?”</p>
<p>“How can you say that to your own mother? It took me several hours to get here, you know? Don’t I even get a thank-you?”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much for traveling a great distance, now please go home.”</p>
<p>“Come now, don’t say such things. It’s not very endearing. You should act more like Shuuto, your father!”</p>
<p>“Men don’t need to be endearing, do we?” While Amane had spat his words acidly, his mother, Shihoko, didn’t seem bothered at all, instead breaking into a fit of laughter.</p>
<p>“You’ve really hit your rebellious phase!” she said. “I hope you’re not planning on having me stand outside all day. I’m coming in, okay?”</p>
<p>“Wait, nobody said you could—”</p>
<p>“Have you forgotten that your father and I pay the rent on this place?”</p>
<p>There was nothing Amane could do to argue or refuse his mother once she’d played that card. Reluctantly, he allowed her to enter.</p>
<p>To keep her from going into the bedroom, Amane casually guided his mother to walk past the bedroom door and into the living room.</p>
<p>“By the way, you really should tell me beforehand when you plan on visiting,” said Amane.</p>
<p>“Now, I wouldn’t be able to get a proper picture of my son’s living situation if I didn’t show up unannounced, would I?” Shihoko replied.</p>
<p>“Ugh… Look, there’s no problem, okay? I’m keeping the place clean.”</p>
<p>“You certainly are; I’m surprised. You never kept your room clean at home, but you’re doing better than I’d expected. I’m surprised.” Shihoko nodded seriously, looking genuinely astonished as she surveyed the living room.</p>
<p>The unspoken truth was that his place was only clean because Mahiru had helped Amane tidy up. Her advice and constant scolding was a big part of how his place had managed to stay clean, too. Really, Mahiru deserved most of the credit, but there was no way Amane was going to tell his mother that now.</p>
<p>“Your skin looks good, too; you must be eating well,” Shihoko observed.</p>
<p>“…Yeah,” Amane admitted, unable to meet his mother’s eyes. Even his improved health was something he owed to the angel.</p>
<p>“You’re even cooking properly, huh. Oh, but it looks like you’re cooking for two?”</p>
<p>Shihoko’s manicured finger was pointing at his dish rack. Two people had eaten lunch, so naturally there were two sets of dishes. Carelessly, Amane had forgotten to put them away. He should’ve remembered how perceptive his mother could be.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I had a friend over.” Amane’s answer was not quite a lie. He’d spoken as indifferently as he was able, doing his best to stop himself from shaking. It was fair to say that he and Mahiru had built up to something resembling a friendship, so it wasn’t exactly untrue. There was the small matter of hiding that the friend in question was a girl.</p>
<p>“Hmm,” Shihoko replied with a tone that suggested she didn’t really accept that explanation at face value. She scanned the living room again.</p>
<p>“I suppose you get a passing mark. You’re doing so well, I can hardly believe you’re a boy living on his own,” Amane’s mother finally conceded.</p>
<p>Somehow, Amane had been able to deceive her, though only just barely. Strangely, he felt a chill run down his spine, and he was sweating bullets. On the other hand, maybe he shouldn’t have been so surprised to have passed his mother’s inspection. Mahiru really had turned some things around for him, after all.</p>
<p>“See, there was nothing for you to worry about, Mom.”</p>
<p>“I suppose not; though I can hardly believe it. You could barely do anything for yourself at home. You’ve certainly grown up.”</p>
<p>“…I’m basically an adult,” Amane replied, though inwardly, he scoffed at himself for having the audacity to say such a thing.</p>
<p>“Good job,” Shihoko praised, smiling.</p>
<p>It made Amane a little uncomfortable to hear that, since of course he hadn’t done any of it on his own. There was no way he could risk telling his mother the truth, however, so he would have to leave things as they were and try to get her out of there.</p>
<p><em>She’s pretty much finished her evaluation, right? I wonder if I can get her to leave without saying anything about wanting to eat her cooking or whatever</em>, Amane thought.</p>
<p>“That just leaves the bedroom check, I suppose,” Shihoko mused nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Amane’s eyes went wide at the drop of that bomb. Mahiru was still in there. If his mother found a girl hiding in the bedroom, a far greater disaster would ensue than if Amane had just revealed Mahiru from the get-go.</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t joke around. Even if you’re my mom, I don’t want you digging around in my bedroom.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Something in there you’re feeling embarrassed about?” Shihoko prodded.</p>
<p>“There’s probably one or two embarrassing things in any high school guy’s room, if you think about it.”</p>
<p>“So you admit it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I admit it. Please don’t go in there.”</p>
<p>Even though it was shameful, there’d been no other choice. Amane had been forced to go along with his mother’s assumption to keep her from entering the bedroom. If she discovered Mahiru in Amane’s room, she would most assuredly get the wrong idea. For both his own sake and Mahiru’s, Amane needed to avoid that at all costs.</p>
<p>When Amane’s mother saw him blocking the door to his room, desperately trying to keep her from getting through, she could tell right away that he was hiding something. Closing in on her son, Shihoko said, “I suppose you are grown up, if you’re hiding those sorts of things from your parents.”</p>
<p>If it came down to it, Amane was prepared to keep his mom out by force if necessary, though he admittedly didn’t like that idea. He stood ready to stop her, but then…</p>
<p><em>Thump.</em> There came a noise from inside the bedroom.</p>
<p>“Amane…”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“What are you hiding?”</p>
<p>“…It has nothing to do with you, Mom.”</p>
<p>“So you say.” A wide grin spread across Shihoko’s face.</p>
<p>It was the kind of coercive smile that could not be denied. Amane became extremely uncomfortable every time she looked at him like this. It had a way of sapping his willpower to oppose her.</p>
<p>Amane groaned, and Shihoko saw an opening. She put her hand on the doorknob to his room, and by the time Amane noticed, it was far too late. Shihoko slipped past Amane, intent on discovering the source of the noise on the other side of the door.</p>
<p>What met her eyes beyond that barrier that Amane had failed to protect was the figure of a beautiful girl. She was leaning her back against the side of the bed while hugging a cushion to her chest. The girl’s eyes were closed, and her breaths were a gentle rhythm. Mahiru had dozed off by the time Shihoko discovered her.</p>
<p>A warm room with a heater running and a full stomach after lunch were the perfect conditions for an afternoon nap. Amane couldn’t help but wonder whether Mahiru often slept in boys’ rooms, but all this really confirmed was that she found Amane to be harmless enough to doze off in his bedroom.</p>
<p>He couldn’t exactly blame her for it. Sitting motionless so as not to make any noise had probably gotten real boring real fast.</p>
<p>The main problem was, obviously, Shihoko, who had arrived at just the wrong moment to witness a situation she was sure to misunderstand.</p>
<p>Had he been the third party, Amane would have gotten the wrong idea, too. He would have assumed they were so intimate that Mahiru had no problem drifting off for a nap in his room.</p>
<p>Grimacing all the while, Amane glanced over at his mother and saw that her eyes were sparkling. He could only imagine the commotion she was about to raise.</p>
<p>“Oh my, Amane, you’ve got such an adorable girlfriend!” Shihoko shrieked in her youthful voice. “This isn’t the kind of girl you can just hide away in a corner, you know!”</p>
<p>Amane felt a headache coming on.</p>
<p>She had immediately jumped to possibly the worst conclusion available, and to make matters worse, she was clearly very excited about the idea that her son was dating such a lovely girl. There was no doubt that even Amane’s mother was smitten with Mahiru’s beauty.</p>
<p>Mahiru looked so vulnerable when she was asleep. The practiced air of elegant refinement that she always wore like a mask had melted away, revealing the full captivating nature of her looks. Her cute face had never looked more peaceful—or more pretty.</p>
<p>Amane had grown somewhat accustomed to Mahiru’s appearance, but seeing her like this, he was once again struck by her incredible charm. Her cherubic face held such an innocent serenity. Once again, he felt the urge to reach out and touch her. Her sleeping figure, hugging Amane’s cushion tight, awakened many desires in him that were best kept private.</p>
