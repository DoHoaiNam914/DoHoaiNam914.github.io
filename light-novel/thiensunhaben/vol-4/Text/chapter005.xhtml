<p class="noindent1">“…I love you.”</p>
<p>A voice full of anticipation spoke these few, simple words.</p>
<p>Her voice was quiet as it left her soft, pink lips, and she approached him seductively.</p>
<p>Amane was propping himself up on the bed, and she lowered her hips onto his legs, pinning him in place.</p>
<p>Strangely, he didn’t feel any weight at all.</p>
<p>But the soft touch of her skin and her fragrant smell filled his senses.</p>
<p>Mahiru leaned coquettishly up against him and wrapped her arms around his back, closing the gap between them as she cast her eyes down shyly. Amane looked down and saw a fresh expanse of skin that normally never saw the light of day, peeking from the neckline of her white dress.</p>
<p>He tried to avert his gaze from the deep valley between her breasts, but Mahiru moved her hands from his back up to his neck and pulled his face closer, as if to tell him not to look away.</p>
<p>A sigh escaped her lips.</p>
<p>“…Touch me more?” she whispered.</p>
