<p class="noindent1">A new day had dawned since Mahiru’s shocking statement, but the excitement over the angel’s new relationship hadn’t settled down at all in class.</p>
<p>Her words had attracted considerable curiosity, since up to now, she hadn’t shown any interest in boys and had treated members of both sexes the same.</p>
<p>However, no matter what she was asked, Mahiru didn’t answer with any additional information. Her closest friend, Chitose, also insisted that she didn’t know anything, so whoever Mahiru had alluded to remained unknown.</p>
<p>As the boy in question, Amane was relieved by this, but at the same time, he was terrified, wondering when he would be exposed.</p>
<p>“Well, I think if someone got a reeeally good look at your face, they’d figure it out. But from a distance, just looking at your silhouette, I doubt anyone would recognize you,” Itsuki said, laughing at Amane’s concern as he looked over the merchandise for sale.</p>
<p>Amane had brought Itsuki and Yuuta along with him to the sports equipment store. He was there to buy some exercise gear, after deciding that he should start training and exercising to better complement <a id="page-8"></a>Mahiru, and so that she might fall for him. The impact of her statement had sparked the idea.</p>
<p>Club activities were suspended for the time being due to upcoming exams, so the track and field club ace had some free time and accompanied Amane to help him pick out running shoes.</p>
<p>“I mean, after all, you usually have a plain hairstyle and act all indifferent, so you come off as cold, and your expression doesn’t really change,” Itsuki said. “But when you’re with her, you make all sorts of faces, and you actually look up from the ground, so you seem sweet and gentle. I don’t think anyone would connect that guy with the Amane we see at school.”</p>
<p>“You’re pretty easy to read, Fujimiya; it’s surprising,” Yuuta added.</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>Amane was aware that he acted more gently toward Mahiru than other people, but it was still embarrassing to hear someone point it out like that.</p>
<p>It was all the more humiliating to know that even Yuuta, who he had just started hanging out with, could see it.</p>
<p>Amane frowned, trying to shake off the embarrassment. Itsuki looked at him with a foolish grin.</p>
<p>“Looks like my prediction was right, that you would change when you found a girl you liked.”</p>
<p>“…Shut up.”</p>
<p>“Oooh, you are sooo cute when you’re trying not to look embarrassed, Amane!”</p>
<p>“Don’t be a creep, Itsuki.”</p>
<p>“It is a little creepy, Itsuki.”</p>
<p>“Why are you on his side, Yuuta? You’re supposed to stick with me.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s…you know.”</p>
<p>“I’m gonna cry, guys.”</p>
<p><a id="page-9"></a>Itsuki did not seem like he was going to cry at all. After grinning and poking at Amane for a while, he shrugged. “Well, I guess she really does have all sorts of troubles of her own, huh? Including yesterday’s performance.”</p>
<p>“…Performance? She told me she did it to control the rumors as best she could without telling any lies, since she was under suspicion anyway.”</p>
<p>“Ah, is that how she explained it? Well, that’s all true, but I think it was also an attempt to repel other guys without inviting hostility from other girls. When you’re popular, you’re always the object of jealousy, more or less. By hinting that she’s got a special someone, and that she hasn’t got eyes for anyone else, she’s saying that even if she hangs around Yuuta and us once in a while, she’s not interested.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Plus, you know, to keep it all in check.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“…Ah, it’s nothing. Forget it. Setting all that aside, I can see in your eyes that she’s important to you, and I think she probably feels the same way. You can win her over if you push, or even better, push her down, heh? It’s important for a guy to take a little initiative, you know!”</p>
<p>The words “push her down” made Amane recall the situation that happened over Golden Week.</p>
<p><em>I didn’t mean to…</em></p>
<p>By accident, he had lost his balance and fallen on top of her. It wasn’t anything intentional. There was no way he would have done it on purpose, being fully aware that Mahiru would hate him if he did something as outrageous as that.</p>
<p>However, if Mahiru made the same expression next time, looking like she was waiting for him to make some sort of move—he wasn’t sure what he’d do then.</p>
<p><a id="page-10"></a>“…Hey, did something happen that I don’t know about? Did you get lucky or something?”</p>
<p>Itsuki made a grabbing motion with his hands, very interested now that Amane’s cheeks were gradually flushing with remembered shame.</p>
<p>“Just shut up for once!” Amane shouted.</p>
<p>“Itsuki, you’re the worst!” Yuuta added.</p>
<p>“Whose side are you on, anyway?! I thought you were hoping for progress, Yuuta!”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be on your side when you’re messing around like that. Though I do think that Fujimiya is being too passive.”</p>
<p>“As far as I can tell, you’re both against me.”</p>
<p>Amane had complex feelings about getting these evaluations from Yuuta and Itsuki. On the other hand, he knew he wasn’t particularly assertive, so he didn’t feel like he could make much of a rebuttal.</p>
<p>“Now, now, we just wanted to give you a little nudge,” Yuuta insisted. “I don’t know Mahiru that well, so I’m just speculating, but I doubt she has feelings for anyone other than you, Fujimiya. It seems like you’re the only one she really trusts. After all, she seems incredibly wary of most people. I’m telling you, the way that girl looks at you, and only you, is different.”</p>
<p>“…I know that she trusts me, and that she likes me as a person, but even so…”</p>
<p>“Why are you so negative? Have some confidence. You’re a good guy, and you seem like the kind of person who can put in some serious effort, so long as you have a goal. I mean, look, if you really don’t have any confidence, then start working out and get in shape. Physical fitness is linked to emotional well-being, you know. If your body gets fitter, your attitude should improve, and if your attitude improves, everything around you will look brighter. By getting physically stronger, you can make yourself more confident.”</p>
<p>“You sound awfully self-assured.”</p>
