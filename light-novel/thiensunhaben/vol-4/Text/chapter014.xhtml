<p class="noindent1">“Hey, Amane, don’t you think you tried <em>too</em> hard this time?” Itsuki grumbled, sounding somewhat astonished as he stared at the exam rankings that had been posted on the bulletin board in the hallway.</p>
<p>Even after their group study session, Amane had continued working diligently, preparing for the exams. He’d wanted to be proud of himself for a change. Also, the studying had helped distract him from certain coquettish words that had been whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>They were looking at the result of his efforts—and all the work he’d done to keep his mind off her suggestive expressions and the words that she had uttered—which had led him to rank sixth in their grade this time.</p>
<p>“Wow, it’s hard to believe I made it that far.”</p>
<p>“You really worked for it. Proud of yourself?”</p>
<p>“…Pretty proud, I guess. But there’s no guarantee that I’ll be able to do it again.”</p>
<p>“What a stoic guy…”</p>
<p>He didn’t want Mahiru to see him climb so high only to fall back down out of negligence. There would be no point to it unless he could consistently place in the upper ranks.</p>
<p><a id="page-96"></a>Considering that college entrance exams were also coming up, it would be absurd to be satisfied with this one success and give up trying.</p>
<p>Hasty preparations would not be enough for the entrance exams since students from other schools would also be vying for spots, so Amane vowed to keep studying hard so that he would be ready for what was to come as well.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Mahiru had placed far ahead of anyone else, in the top spot again. This was nothing if not expected, but Amane knew that it was because of how hard she worked, and that she never took it for granted.</p>
<p>“It looks like you took sixth place this time, Fujimiya.”</p>
<p>Mahiru, who had arrived to look at the bulletin board after Amane and Itsuki, smiled beautifully as she noticed Amane’s name.</p>
<p>She was in angel mode, and Amane smiled casually back at her, trying not to let any of his inner turmoil show on his face.</p>
<p>He felt the prickle of people’s eyes on him, but he was already getting used to talking with Mahiru in public. The stares still made him uncomfortable, but he was able to soldier through without too much distress.</p>
<p>“Looks that way.” Amane nodded. “Good for me, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh, he really worked hard, ya know,” Itsuki interjected. “Studying during breaks and everything.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, well—”</p>
<p>“If you worked that hard, shouldn’t you give yourself a reward?” Mahiru asked.</p>
<p>“I…guess so.”</p>
<p>Recalling the reward that Mahiru had promised him caused Amane to experience an indescribable surge of emotion.</p>
<p>She had promised to let him lie in her lap and to clean his ears. He had done so much to erase the thought from his mind that he had <a id="page-97"></a>genuinely forgotten about it, but she’d said she would do it if he made it into the top ten.</p>
<p>He could always decline, but…there was no way he could bring himself to reject such an opportunity, if the girl he liked wanted to pamper him like that.</p>
<p>“…Speaking of which, congratulations on the top spot. Shouldn’t you be the one treating yourself?”</p>
<p>“I suppose so. But it’s not good to pamper oneself too much.”</p>
<p>“But you’re already so strict with yourself that I think you could stand to be a little indulgent. Well, that’s not for me to say, though.”</p>
<p>Now that they were on the subject, Amane realized that he would be receiving something special from Mahiru, but he had nothing to give back, and he wondered what he should do.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he had no idea what he could offer her, so he would have to ask about it after they got home.</p>
<p>Looking at Mahiru wearing her angelic smile, Itsuki quietly whispered to Amane, “How about you reward her?”</p>
<p>Amane didn’t need to be told twice, and he made a mental note to ask her about it when they got home.</p>
<p class="space-break">“Huh? A reward for me?”</p>
<p>When Amane posed the question to Mahiru as she was preparing dinner at home with her apron on, she turned around with a puzzled expression on her face.</p>
<p>Amane hadn’t been able to settle down, remembering the devilish smile she’d put on the other day and thinking about the reward that was probably waiting for him after dinner. But Mahiru hadn’t seemed to notice, and now her expression showed that his question was entirely unexpected.</p>
<p>“There’s not really anything specific that I want, but…”</p>
<p>“Or something you want me to do…?”</p>
<p><a id="page-98"></a>“You do for me? Hmm, let me think. I guess I’d like you to cut that cucumber thinly with the slicer.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I mean… Well, if there isn’t anything, you don’t have to force yourself to answer, you know.”</p>
<p>Amane had a feeling she wasn’t taking his question seriously, but he didn’t want to push too hard, so he backed down easily.</p>
<p>If Mahiru really didn’t need anything, that was fine, but if there was something she’d like him to do, and it was within Amane’s capabilities, he intended to grant her request.</p>
<p>For the time being, she’d said she wanted him to feed the cucumber into the slicer, so he washed his hands and cut it thinly, but this was just helping her out rather than a reward.</p>
<p>“Rub some salt on that and set it aside.”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am… Is there really nothing more?”</p>
<p>“Not really. I’m content with how things are at the moment… And anyway, I think that I’ll be able to fulfill my one wish by myself.”</p>
<p>“The wish you really want granted?”</p>
<p>“What do you think that is?”</p>
<p>Amane looked up from the slicer and saw Mahiru smiling gently.</p>
<p>For a second, her expression looked like the devilish grin she had worn the other day, and he couldn’t bear to look directly at her, so he dropped his eyes back down to the countertop.</p>
<p>“…I d-don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. So don’t worry about it. I’m happy as is.”</p>
<p>Amane could sense the smile in her voice.</p>
<p>Mahiru went back to cooking, giving off an air like she wasn’t going to let Amane investigate any further. Amane didn’t know what to do, so he just kept on thinly slicing the cucumber.</p>
<p class="space-break">“All right, lie down, Amane.”</p>
<p>After dinner was over, the dreaded reward time arrived.</p>
<p><a id="page-99"></a>As if it was the most natural thing in the world, Mahiru sat down on one side of the sofa and smiled at him as she patted her knees. Amane was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Mahiru’s outfit for the day was shorts with black tights, so he would technically be lying in her clothed lap, but only an incredibly thin layer of fabric separated him from her skin.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, she had taken a bath after getting home today, and her whole body smelled wonderful.</p>
<p>It would be suicide for Amane to lie in her lap in such a risky situation.</p>
<p>“…No, um—”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to if you don’t want to, but isn’t this what you asked for?”</p>
<p>“I-it is what I wished for, but the thing is, now that it’s actually happening, I’m nervous, like…i-it’s embarrassing, you know?”</p>
<p>“Well then, why did you ask for it?”</p>
<p>“Th-that must have been male instincts or something.”</p>
<p>“Well, you can follow those male instincts, it’s fine, but…this is your reward for working so hard. You don’t need to be shy, okay? I’m going to spoil you a lot.”</p>
<p>Mahiru patted her lap again, and Amane gulped.</p>
<p>It had gotten quite warm lately, so her tights were thinner than before.</p>
<p>He could just barely see the color of her skin through the sheer material, and it stirred up some strong emotions.</p>
<p>Even if her thighs were covered by the tights, the smooth beauty of her slender legs was on display, luring Amane in.</p>
<p>It probably wasn’t Mahiru’s intention at all, but the way she was dressed that day was going to be the death of him.</p>
<p>Rightfully, he should have somehow found a way to decline her offer and devise a peaceful way out for his heart and soul, but under <a id="page-100"></a>the pretext of a reward, Amane’s “male instincts” had gotten him into this mess.</p>
<p>Gingerly, he sat down beside Mahiru and lowered his head onto her lap.</p>
<p>He had experienced this once before, and just as he remembered, her legs were very soft. Since the fabric separating him from her was even thinner than it had been last time, the texture and warmth of her skin came through clearly, and Amane felt his heart squeeze tightly.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure where to look, so he faced upward for the time being and saw Mahiru smiling down at him.</p>
<p>His view of her face, however, was partially obscured by something…or, rather, two somethings. It was only May, but the temperature had been rising, and the shirt that Mahiru was wearing was also quite thin. On top of that, the material followed the lines of her body closely, highlighting her shapely figure beneath the fine cloth.</p>
<p>Amane had to turn over. If he stayed like that, he was going to explode from shame.</p>
<p>“All right, I’m going to clean your ears now.”</p>
<p>Completely unaware of Amane’s inner distress, Mahiru announced this with a smile. She sounded somewhat excited. Mahiru reached for the ear pick and tissues that were sitting on the table, and something soft pressed down on the side of his head.</p>
<p><em>(?!)</em></p>
<p>Sirens blared in Amane’s mind, but Mahiru didn’t seem to notice. She quickly grabbed the ear pick and sat back up. Amane’s heart was pounding as he felt the weight of her soft body. Mentally, he was no longer prepared to handle an ear cleaning.</p>
<p>“Now, hold still,” Mahiru whispered in a soothing voice, and she gently fixed his head in place with one hand.</p>
<p>She reminded him not to move while she was cleaning his ears, but Amane found it very difficult to stay still, for several reasons.</p>
<p><a id="page-101"></a>Even so, there was no way that he was going to struggle against her, so he stayed obediently still and stared hard at the side of the table as something rigid was slowly inserted into his ear hole.</p>
<p>He got chills for a moment. He was more sensitive where his skin was thinner. Amane never felt ticklish when he cleaned his own ears, but when Mahiru was doing it, he got a strange feeling, probably because he wasn’t in control…and because it was exciting to know that it was the girl he loved who was doing it.</p>
<p>He knew that Mahiru was going to do a careful job because of her personality, but somehow having her oh-so-gently clean out his ear was kind of ticklish.</p>
<p>It was a little too tingly to really be pleasant, but at the same time, it had an unusual appeal that ignited certain desires.</p>
<p>At the very least, there was an indescribable niceness to it, pleasant enough that he was not going to resist having his ears cleaned like this.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t hurt, does it?” Mahiru asked.</p>
<p>“Mm…it doesn’t hurt. It feels good.”</p>
<p>“Oh really? I’m glad. I’ve heard that this is supposed to be romantic for guys, but…well, does this feel romantic for you?”</p>
<p>“…A little, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Well, you are a guy, after all.”</p>
<p>“Have I given you any reason to doubt it?”</p>
<p>If Amane wasn’t a guy, he wouldn’t be writhing in agony on the inside, and he wouldn’t be so excited by the softness of her skin. As it was, he couldn’t help getting flustered being held close and pampered by the person he loved.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh, it’s because you’re such a gentleman, Amane. I didn’t think you had much interest.”</p>
<p>“On the assumption that I am a gentleman, what I want and what I do are very different. You ought to be careful; there are men who will smile to your face, then attack you when you’re alone.”</p>
<p><a id="page-102"></a>“By that logic, you wouldn’t really be a man then, would you?”</p>
<p>Amane felt like he had just been called out and bit his lip unhappily. That said, it didn’t seem like Mahiru had meant it as an insult. She continued peacefully with her cleaning.</p>
<p>“Here, Amane, turn over. I want to do the other side.”</p>
<p>Even as he frowned harder, Amane turned and presented the opposite ear. Facing her belly, however, was a new kind of penance. If he looked down, he would see her shorts, and that wouldn’t be good, so he had no option but to stare docilely at her stomach.</p>
<p>Amane wasn’t sure if this was heaven or hell.</p>
<p>It would probably be heavenly if he could be honest about his desires, but as long as he was stuck between what he wanted and what he knew was right, it was like he was plunging one foot right into hell.</p>
<p>“…Amane, you’ve been kind of trembling since we started, but…”</p>
<p>“Please don’t pay any attention to that.”</p>
<p>There was no way he could even begin to tell her what he was feeling inside. After all, if he said any of it out loud, Mahiru would definitely pull away from him.</p>
<p>So there was nothing to be done but obediently accept the ear cleaning and hide his desires at all costs. This angel, pampering him innocently with no ulterior motives, was a frightening creature.</p>
<p>Mahiru seemed to have some questions about Amane’s behavior, but he was facing her and couldn’t make eye contact, so she gave up on investigating further and went back to cleaning his ear.</p>
<p>Feeling an inexpressible pleasantness and a ticklish sensation, Amane closed his eyes and waited for it to be over.</p>
<p>Whenever he opened his eyes, he felt slightly guilty about what was happening, so he kept them shut. But without his vision, his other senses seemed to become more acute. He inhaled her sweet <a id="page-103"></a>smell, as well as the scents of her shampoo and body wash, and he felt the softness of her thighs. He was beside himself.</p>
<p>He couldn’t stop thinking about how amazing it would be if he could have his fill of these sensations without holding back.</p>
<p>“Amane, when I’m done with your ears, can I play with your hair?”</p>
<p>“…If you want.”</p>
<p>If he escaped soon, he wouldn’t have to experience this conflict any longer. However, Amane was still a guy, and if a girl was going to let him continue lying in her lap, he wasn’t going to argue. Even as he felt conflicted over wanting her to stop and wanting her to do more, in the end, he gave in to his desires. It made him realize that in many ways, he was very weak willed.</p>
<p>Mahiru gave every indication of being pleased by Amane’s consent.</p>
<p>“I’m almost finished, okay?” she said as she carefully scraped out his ear.</p>
<p><em>Ah, over already?</em> Amane thought, feeling just a little bit disappointed, suffering lonely agony yet again.</p>
<p>But he didn’t let it show on his face or in his movements.</p>
<p>The slightly ticklish yet pleasant feeling came to an end as Mahiru pulled out the ear cleaning tool.</p>
<p>In its place came a different lovely sensation as Mahiru’s fingers slipped smoothly through his hair.</p>
<p>“All right, all done.”</p>
<p>Mahiru combed through his hair with gentle hands as if she was comforting a child, and Amane simultaneously felt embarrassed and like he wanted to surrender himself to her entirely.</p>
<p>He knew that if it came down to it, the latter feeling was stronger, and a silent groan threatened to escape his lips.</p>
<p><a id="page-104"></a>Mahiru’s intention had been to pamper him thoroughly as a reward, and he was definitely getting spoiled.</p>
<p>Part of him wanted to fight against Mahiru, who seemed to be enjoying her chance to indulge Amane just as she had promised. Though it felt so good that any willpower he had was uprooted entirely, leaving him utterly helpless to resist.</p>
<p><em>…I’m getting spoiled…</em></p>
<p>He was getting his head caressed by her tender hands while fully savoring her feminine scent and warmth. It didn’t sound like such a big deal when he put it into words, but it felt incredibly good and left him practically euphoric. Amane could imagine losing himself if he were allowed to enjoy these kinds of pleasures every day. The thought had a certain appeal to it.</p>
<p>When Amane let out a sigh and relaxed his muscles, he heard a quiet giggle.</p>
<p>“You’re like a pampered little boy, for once,” Mahiru softly teased.</p>
<p>“…Whose fault is that?”</p>
<p>“My fault.” Mahiru giggled sweetly and swept her fingers through his hair again. “I always want to dote on you, because I want an excuse to touch you. Your hair feels so nice to brush.”</p>
<p>“…Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s smooth and glossy. How do you get your hair to do that…?”</p>
<p>“…I just use the shampoo my mom recommended.”</p>
<p>Shihoko had been very insistent about making sure he didn’t neglect and damage his fine hair. Subsequently, Amane used shampoo and conditioner found in beauty salons, the kind that boasted about being good for your lustrous locks. He didn’t hate the scent of it, and he liked the feeling when he ran his fingers through his hair after it dried, so he kept using the product.</p>
<p>“You should talk, your hair is super smooth, Mahiru.”</p>
<p><a id="page-105"></a>He gathered a tuft of the flaxen strands into his hand, and it felt even softer and smoother than his.</p>
<p>Of course, the girl had silkier, glossier hair; Amane’s couldn’t compete. Mahiru’s had a texture that made him want to touch it forever, and it had a clean, soapy scent that wasn’t overly strong. It was irresistible.</p>
<p>“I think this every time I pat your head, but you must take a lot of care in looking after your hair.”</p>
<p>“…Well, I’ve never been negligent about it.”</p>
<p>“I can tell. By the way, I’ve been touching your head whenever I like, but…is that all right? They say that a woman’s hair is her life, and all that.”</p>
<p>“…I like it when you touch me, Amane.”</p>
<p>Amane was glad that she couldn’t see his face, because he was sure his expression contorted into something strange when Mahiru said those words.</p>
<p>Shame, delight, confusion, panic… If Mahiru had seen all those strong emotions written on his face, she probably would have started to distrust him.</p>
<p><em>I get carried away because she says things like that.</em></p>
<p>Unable to say anything out loud, Amane tried to return to his normal expression. He closed his eyes and sighed.</p>
<p class="space-break">When he opened his eyes, Mahiru’s shirt was right in front of him.</p>
<p>Apparently, he had fallen asleep again—his consciousness had drifted away on a cushion of comfort and joy. Though he had no idea how long he’d slept, and that made him anxious.</p>
<p>The hand combing his hair had stopped.</p>
<p>He sat up timidly and saw that Mahiru was leaning back against the sofa, breathing heavily in her sleep.</p>
<p>“Defenseless,” Amane mumbled at Mahiru, whose gentle breaths <a id="page-107"></a>were rhythmically rising and falling, then checked the clock and felt his cheek twitch.</p>
