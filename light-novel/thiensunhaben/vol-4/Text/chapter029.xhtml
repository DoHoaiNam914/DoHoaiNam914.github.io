<p class="noindent1">Early June—Amane’s school held their Sports Day during the time of year when the weather starts becoming more humid.</p>
<p>Unlike Field Day in elementary and middle school, high school Sports Day wasn’t much of a harmonious and happy event—if anything, it was more like an extension of their usual gym class. No parents or guardians came to cheer them on.</p>
<p>Even so, it was one of the few yearly events run by the school, and a certain part of the student body was always filled with excitement. Especially the underclassmen in the athletic clubs, as they always eagerly embraced the opportunity to show off their abilities to their upperclassmen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, most of the students who belonged to cultural clubs showed no interest at all.</p>
<p>Amane, a member of the so-called “go-home club,” fit best in the second group.</p>
<p>“What a pain.”</p>
<p>Amane smiled secretly to himself when he heard another student in the same tent with him grumble quietly.</p>
<p>Although similarly uninterested in the happenings, Amane <a id="page-200"></a>wasn’t so put off that he was going to let it show. Instead, he’d chosen to maintain a composed expression.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he had been assigned to the events he’d requested and wasn’t going to end up running around in circles or anything. The only running around he was going to be doing would be during the cavalry battle that all the boys were going to take part in.</p>
<p>Yuuta, who was on the same red team as Amane and who was sitting in the tent with him, gave Amane a look of surprise. “You don’t seem that unhappy, Fujimiya. I thought for sure you hated this stuff.”</p>
<p>“Well, I got the events I wanted, and I don’t have anything else to do now, so it’s not so bad. Though I do think that studying would be more fun.”</p>
<p>“I think that’s a pretty unusual opinion, I’d imagine…”</p>
<p>Kazuya had overheard them from nearby. “Seems like Fujimiya’s excellent grades are balanced out by not being so great at sports,” he said. “Guess that’s how it goes sometimes.”</p>
<p>Amane couldn’t deny that and smiled bitterly. It was the truth, but having someone else point it out gave him mixed feelings. He appreciated the compliment regarding his academic abilities, but he couldn’t help but long to excel in both school and sports.</p>
<p>“I’ve been good about following the training regimen that Kadowaki gave me, but I’ve been thinking maybe I should put together a slightly more demanding program,” Amane said.</p>
<p>“Hmm, well, the workout that we do is meant for athletes, so I think you should stick with your current program, if you’re just training for your health,” Yuuta replied. “If we lived a little closer together, I would go jogging and stuff with you, though.”</p>
<p>“There’s no way that I could match your speed and strength, Kadowaki.”</p>
<p>“He’s right,” Makoto said with a weary look on his face. “Don’t <a id="page-201"></a>you remember how I almost died when I went with you, Yuuta? You don’t go jogging, you go running.” He had accompanied Yuuta on runs before.</p>
<p>Makoto wasn’t one of the sports club types; he was actually a member of the astronomy club. He was slim, small enough to be described as dainty, and his skin was pale. He didn’t look like he was capable of much exertion.</p>
<p>That said, Amane knew that dainty and small Mahiru was capable of intense exercise, so the rule didn’t always hold.</p>
<p>“Nah, I think Fujimiya can do it,” Yuuta said. “Sounds like you didn’t get that tired when you used to run marathons and stuff.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been training recently, working hard so that I don’t get weak when I get older, but I’m no match for a real athlete!”</p>
<p>“You are the only one who’s already thinking about getting old…”</p>
<p>“You’re a strange guy, Fujimiya. No, maybe I should say you’re an interesting guy.”</p>
<p>“Was that supposed to be a compliment?”</p>
<p><em>Kazuya has an honest, sincere personality, and his way of speaking is straightforward. He’s direct and doesn’t hold back.</em></p>
<p>Amane had come to understand this since they started hanging out.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure that was supposed to be a compliment,” Yuuta answered for him.</p>
<p>“In that case, thanks.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it.”</p>
<p>“What are you all even talking about…?”</p>
<p>Makoto wasn’t trying to hide his exasperation, but there wasn’t any ridicule in his words either, just simple frustration, as well as a slight tinge of genuine amusement.</p>
<p>“Now, now. Kazuya has always been a bit of an airhead,” Yuuta said.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’m an airhead…”</p>
<p><a id="page-202"></a>“That’s ’cause the person in question is the only one who can’t tell. It’s fine, Kazuya, don’t worry about it. You’re perfect just the way you are.”</p>
<p>“Hmph. Really?”</p>
<p>Kazuya seemed happy to accept that answer and didn’t argue any further.</p>
<p>“You’re okay with that…?” Amane mumbled, and looked toward the sports grounds.</p>
<p>Out on the field, students had been running the short distance races.</p>
<p>Judging from the length of the track, they were doing the hundred-meter dash. The first heat seemed to have finished already, and the second one was starting to line up.</p>
<p>The next heat was a girls’ group, and there were a few fast girls on the red team, including a familiar face with reddish-brown hair.</p>
<p>“I thought Chitose quit the track and field club. Is she really that fast?” Amane asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Shirakawa is really fast,” Yuuta answered. “In middle school, she was a track club ace, you know.”</p>
<p>“Huh, really?”</p>
<p>“Mm. Though she didn’t join the club in high school. She said it was a pain in the butt always fighting with the upperclassmen.”</p>
<p>“I guess this is where I make a joke about what caused the fights?”</p>
<p>“Well, hmm, there’s kind of a story behind it…but I guess you could say she got discouraged or just tired of it.”</p>
<p>“…Tired?”</p>
<p>“There were issues when she started dating Itsuki. How should I explain it…? Well, there was an upperclassman on the track team who also liked Itsuki, see, and on top of that, Shirakawa’s times were faster than theirs… It created some tension, and one thing led to another, get it?”</p>
<p><a id="page-203"></a>“Ah, I see now.”</p>
<p>The two of them were well known in their grade as a couple, but Amane had heard from Itsuki that during middle school, before they’d started dating, he had pursued Chitose fervently.</p>
<p>Apparently, Chitose had had a much cooler personality back then, and it had taken Itsuki quite some time to convince her to go out with him.</p>
<p>It wasn’t difficult to imagine the upperclassman fighting with Chitose over Itsuki once she realized what was going on.</p>
<p>“She said that all the obligations of a club were annoying and decided not to join, I guess. But you know, she still likes running because I often spot her running on the weekends.”</p>
<p>Yuuta added that they lived in the same neighborhood, then smiled and looked over at Chitose, who had taken her stance for a crouching start.</p>
<p>From Amane’s perspective as a near beginner, Chitose’s stance seemed masterful, even beautiful.</p>
<p>Her expression, seen from a distance, was not her usual carefree joking smile but a sharp and serious look.</p>
<p>The sound of the start gun echoed across the grounds.</p>
<p>The moment it did, Chitose was off, sprinting faster than anyone else.</p>
<p>She ran like the wind, with a form that anyone would have agreed was lovely to watch, leaving even the current members of the track and field club behind.</p>
<p>Her hair streamed behind her in soft waves as her body moved intently forward. Her feet pounded the ground with surprising force as she headed for the goal, faster than any of the other runners.</p>
<p>Amane watched transfixed as Chitose cut through the goal tape before he even knew it.</p>
<p>Chitose, who had run the course the fastest, held up the first-place <a id="page-204"></a>flag and looked toward the red team…toward where Amane was, with a big grin.</p>
<p>Waving the flag in the air with satisfaction, she made even him feel happy to be part of the team.</p>
<p>Once the hundred-meter dash was over and Chitose came back to the tent, she had her chest puffed up with pride.</p>
<p>“I’m baaack! Did you see me?”</p>
<p>“We did, we did. You were fast!”</p>
<p>“Yay, thanks!”</p>
<p>“You sure were. It feels great to watch you run, Shirakawa.”</p>
<p>Chitose looked very pleased to receive compliments from two current members of the track and field club.</p>
<p>Even Amane offered some words of praise. “Good job, you were flying.”</p>
<p>She had been so much faster than he had expected that he could scarcely believe it. But Chitose didn’t seem all that excited about it. She smiled in a carefree manner. “Ahh, that was fun.”</p>
<p>She looked more like herself, without any air of tension about her. It was completely different than how she’d looked while she was running. Amane smiled in relief.</p>
<p>“But man, you’re as fast as ever, Shirakawa.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh, that’s because training is part of my daily routine. Though I’m not as fast as I was during my club days.”</p>
<p>It was a surprise to hear that she had been even faster during middle school. Somehow Amane had surrounded himself with people who had outstanding physical and mental capabilities; it made the average Amane feel very jealous.</p>
<p>Kazuya had also attended the same middle school as Yuuta and the others, but since he wasn’t a member of the track and field club, he had also been surprised to see her run so quickly.</p>
<p>“I’ve always wondered this, but how do you move so fast? I guess <a id="page-205"></a>you don’t have much surface area, so that must really reduce the air resistance?”</p>
<p>“Hey, Kazu, what exactly do you mean by ‘not much surface area’?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? I’m talking about your height.”</p>
<p>Kazuya looked at Chitose with innocent eyes, as if to ask what else he might possibly be referring to, and she frowned back at him.</p>
<p>Her expression was probably not one of anger but of embarrassment. Amane had no doubt she had thought he was talking about her chest.</p>
<p>While Chitose was not as petite as Mahiru, she wasn’t exactly tall, either. She was a bit taller than the average girl, but not quite as tall as the other runners. On top of that, she was undeniably slim, so Kazuya must have been surprised by how fast she was.</p>
<p>Amane didn’t detect any ulterior motive from the way Kazuya was behaving, so Chitose had just jumped to the wrong conclusion.</p>
<p>“You played yourself on that one, Shirakawa.”</p>
<p>“Shut up, Mako.”</p>
<p>Chitose’s cheeks suddenly flushed red, and she slapped Makoto playfully on the back as she sat down next to him. Amane smirked just a little, so that she wouldn’t spot him.</p>
<p class="space-break">Amane only needed to compete in the ball toss and scavenger hunt, which were both exhibition events, as well as the cavalry battle that all the boys participated in, so he had plenty of time to kill.</p>
<p>Other students who were overflowing with enthusiasm had requested more than two events, but Amane didn’t share their zeal. He had only picked two, plus the all-hands match.</p>
<p>The ball toss was already over.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an exciting game, just a matter of throwing balls into a basket that was placed up high.</p>
<p><a id="page-206"></a>There was usually a scramble to get to the balls to toss into the basket, but there were also usually plenty of balls to go around, so nobody took the event that seriously anyway. It had been a peaceful contest from beginning to end.</p>
<p>It was just a matter of picking up several balls, turning around and piling them up, then tossing them all in, and repeating. A simple task that didn’t attract any attention.</p>
<p>But either Amane’s aim was more precise, or he’d been more successful at collecting the balls, because he ended up with the most in his basket at the end.</p>
<p>“You really went for the bland events, didn’t you, Amane?” Chitose remarked.</p>
<p>“Oh, hush. It’s about time for your shift, isn’t it? Get going.”</p>
<p>“Oh, right. Executive committee members sure are busy…” she grumbled as she looked over her schedule, before heading for the management tent.</p>
<p>Amane wondered why she had volunteered in the first place, but it was too late to say anything.</p>
<p>As Chitose jogged away, Amane checked the agenda for the day, which was posted on one of the tent poles nearby.</p>
<p>The morning program would be over after a few more events. The scavenger hunt, the last event that Amane was participating in as an individual, was one of them.</p>
<p>Once those were finished, everyone would break for lunch before moving on to the afternoon program.</p>
<p>As far as he knew, after his event was over, he would have nothing to do until the cavalry battle in the afternoon.</p>
<p>“…So that means Chitose’s in charge during the scavenger hunt, I guess?”</p>
<p>Since she had gone to take her shift just then, that probably meant she would be directing the remaining events. It was a safe bet that she <a id="page-207"></a>would be judging that one as well… Amane had a feeling Chitose had set it up that way on purpose.</p>
<p>He didn’t know who had thought up the scavenger hunt items, but he had a hunch that they were most likely weird and started to feel a little nervous.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, he headed for the assembly spot for the event. When he arrived, Mahiru was already standing there quietly. She had also gotten her choice of events.</p>
<p>He didn’t have any particular reason to speak to her, so Amane didn’t approach her, but when he made eye contact with her, she smiled faintly and nodded in greeting.</p>
<p>In public, they treated each other as strangers, but Mahiru’s real smile revealed itself just a little bit through her placid expression, and Amane’s heart jumped in his chest.</p>
<p>He returned the greeting with a blank look on his face, but he couldn’t deny feeling somewhat uncomfortable.</p>
<p>As Chitose gathered the participants for the scavenger hunt and finished her duties as a Sports Day administrator, she kept peeking at Amane and Mahiru, looking very pleased.</p>
<p class="space-break">When it was time for the event to begin, the referee—in this case, that designation belonged to Chitose—entered the grounds.</p>
<p>The field was already scattered with several folded pieces of paper, and when the start signal was given, all the contestants had to do was to pick up one of those slips and go get the things that were written on them.</p>
<p>Unlike the other running events, the scavenger hunt was almost relaxing. The goal was to have fun borrowing the necessary items, so it wasn’t that serious of a race.</p>
<p>But depending on the objects, sometimes they were embarrassing to collect, and that was something to watch out for.</p>
<p><a id="page-208"></a>“All participants, please take your places at the starting line!”</p>
<p>Chitose smartly issued instructions through a microphone. She made a great master of ceremonies when she wasn’t messing around. She had a cheerful personality and could read the mood well. Plus, her voice was easy to hear, clear, and not too high-pitched, which was ideal for making announcements.</p>
<p>Surely she wasn’t going to prank them now, Amane thought, not with all the students and staff watching.</p>
<p>“On your marks!” she signaled.</p>
<p>The actual starting pistol was in the hands of another official, a boy—Chitose was just doing the countdown.</p>
<p>“Get set!” Chitose said, then after a pause, the sound of the gun echoed across the field.</p>
<p>No matter how many times he had heard it before, that sound nearly gave Amane a heart attack. Trying not to let it show, he jogged slowly over to the pile of papers.</p>
<p>The faster contestants had already opened up their papers and read what was written on them. Amane followed suit, picking up one of them and checking inside.</p>
<p>Written in meticulous handwriting were the words <em>Someone you find beautiful</em>.</p>
<p>Amane had predicted something like this, that they might be sent to retrieve people rather than objects.</p>
<p>He wanted to make a quip about who might have come up with the idea. Fortunately, even Amane would be able to clear this challenge, if only just barely.</p>
<p>He hadn’t drawn a paper that said <em>The person you like</em>, which would have given him serious trouble. Amane figured he could fulfill the challenge by finding anyone who was objectively attractive.</p>
<p>In other words, someone who anyone would recognize as a beauty… He could call out to Mahiru. Once Mahiru was done <a id="page-209"></a>collecting her item, they just had to go to the goal together and he could score his points as well.</p>
<p>He was sure to attract a lot of attention being with Mahiru, but he would only be following his instructions. He knew that once everyone heard the item he was supposed to retrieve, they would agree he made the appropriate choice.</p>
<p>With that thought in mind, Amane looked around for Mahiru, who had probably already set off to find her item, when…from beside him, someone grabbed his T-shirt. He felt a tug on his sleeve and turned around to see who it was.</p>
<p>His eyes fell on the person he had just been looking for, staring at him shyly.</p>
<p>“Fujimiya, you are my scavenger hunt item, so when you’re finished finding yours, I’d like to ask you to come with me.”</p>
<p>“Huh, me?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>He had never imagined they would be each other’s object.</p>
<p>In a way, it was convenient, but he had a feeling they were going to draw a lot of attention—but he was already talking with Mahiru in the very center of the athletic field, and they had people already watching them.</p>
<p>On the other side of the finish line, Chitose, the judge, was watching them with a grin.</p>
<p><em>I’ll remember that later.</em></p>
<p>The words on the scavenger hunt slips were in Chitose’s handwriting, so she had probably planted a certain number of them. Amane didn’t know what exactly Mahiru had drawn, but since she said she specifically needed him, he was sure she had gotten something nonnegotiable.</p>
<p>“Uhh…what’s your item, anyway?” Amane asked.</p>
<p>“It’s a secret,” she replied. Even though their papers were going to <a id="page-210"></a>be read aloud after they got to the goal, Mahiru wasn’t going to tell him what she was looking for.</p>
<p>So Amane sighed, and they headed toward the finish line.</p>
<p>“You’re my item, too, so let’s hurry.”</p>
<p>“…Then I should ask you, what is your item, Fujimiya?”</p>
<p>“It’s a secret.”</p>
<p>Mahiru smiled slightly when he answered in the same way.</p>
<p>“I see, then I’m looking forward to finding out after we reach the goal,” Mahiru whispered, and took Amane’s hand.</p>
<p>Seemingly unbothered by the noise all around them, Mahiru headed for the goal with Amane in tow.</p>
<p>Amane felt a stomachache coming on, but when he saw how cheerful Mahiru was, there was nothing he could do about it—he was but a coward who was madly in love.</p>
<p>A subtle sense that something was amiss washed over Amane as they ran across the field. When they got to the goal, the two of them were greeted by Chitose, who seemed to be in a good mood.</p>
<p>Amane couldn’t help but make a face when he saw her, but she didn’t seem to pay it any mind.</p>
<p>“What’s this, a teaming up?” she marveled. “And here I thought both of you were rivals in this scavenger hunt…”</p>
<p>“Chitose, you jerk, standing over here grinning like a fool. We’re both each other’s item!”</p>
<p>“Uh-huuuh! All right then, let me confirm your items. Who’s first?”</p>
<p>“Start with Fujimiya, please.”</p>
<p>Amane was surprised to hear Mahiru single him out, but Chitose seemed to understand why. She gestured to the paper Amane was holding, indicating that he should hand it over.</p>
<p>It wasn’t anything that he particularly needed to hide, so Amane readily showed her the item he was looking for.</p>
<p><a id="page-211"></a>Chitose made a slightly disappointed face when she saw what was written.</p>
<p>But she pulled herself back together and brought her mouth to the microphone with a smile. “I’m just confirming the item now. The first task for the red team was to find…‘<em>someone you find beautiful</em>’!”</p>
<p>An atmosphere of relief spread through the crowd when the item was read out.</p>
<p>Really, Mahiru had been a safe choice. As far as Amane knew, there was no one in school more beautiful than her—and of course, she was the cutest in his eyes. Setting aside Amane’s personal opinion, though, nobody would think twice about his choice.</p>
<p>Amane had felt some animosity directed at him when he’d crossed the goal with Mahiru, but it seemed to have subsided somewhat with the revelation of his object.</p>
<p>The problem lay with Mahiru’s item.</p>
<p>Amane didn’t know what was written on her slip of paper, but if it somehow specifically indicated him, he couldn’t help but feel whatever it was, it wouldn’t be good for his quiet student life.</p>
<p>Chitose took Mahiru’s paper, blinked several times, then looked at Mahiru again.</p>
<p>Amane couldn’t see the words from where he was standing, but he could see the apprehension on Chitose’s face. “It’s okay for me to say this, right?”</p>
<p><em>What on earth was the prompt?</em></p>
<p>After seeing Chitose’s reaction, it was even less clear to him now.</p>
<p>Mahiru was still wearing a gentle smile. In other words, she had no problem with Chitose reading it out loud.</p>
<p>After having confirmed again, Chitose donned her usual smug grin.</p>
<p>“Okay, moving right along, they got to the goal at the same time, but anyway, the first task for the white team was to find…‘<em>someone important to you</em>’!”</p>
<p><a id="page-212"></a>The moment that Chitose’s voice echoed across the grounds, a commotion erupted among the students.</p>
<p>Amane reflexively looked at Mahiru—she was staring right back at him, with her light-pink lips arched upward in a smile.</p>
<p>It was the smile of a child who’d just pulled off some grand prank, with a bit of bashfulness mixed in.</p>
<p>Amane was certain she was peering over to gauge his reaction when he learned what she was looking for.</p>
<p><em>That cheeky little devil…</em></p>
<p>Surely it would have been easy for prudent, thoughtful Mahiru to anticipate how their classmates would react to her prompt. Despite that, Mahiru had selected Amane as her object. She’d done it in order to bring about a change in their relationship.</p>
<p>From now on, they could never be strangers again.</p>
<p>She was looking at him with her true smile, the one she showed him at home, not the beautiful, angelic smile that she always had on at school.</p>
<p>Amane grumbled, “We’re definitely going to get bombarded with questions after this,” and ran his hand roughly through his hair.</p>
<p class="space-break">“What the hell was that, Fujimiya?”</p>
<p>Sure enough, once the morning events had ended and all the students had returned to their classrooms for lunch, every boy in Amane’s class crowded around his desk.</p>
<p>Mahiru, the unattainable girl they all adored, had selected Amane as her “important person” in front of the whole school. Amane understood why they were upset, but being suddenly pressed for answers was still quite vexing.</p>
<p>“Why were you with Shiina?! As her ‘important person’?”</p>
<p>“More importantly, since when?”</p>
