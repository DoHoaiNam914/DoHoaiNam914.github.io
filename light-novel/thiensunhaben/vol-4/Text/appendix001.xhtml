<p class="noindent1">It’s not over yet, okay?!</p>
<p>With that out of the way, I’d like to thank you for picking up this book. I am the author, Saekisan.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for reading all the way to the end of Volume 4. First, I’d like to say (for the second time) that I have not yet written all that I want to write.</p>
<p>In Volume 4, Mahiru continued to be proactive and really pressured Amane, even as he strengthened his resolve, until they at long last united. Frankly, it was starting to feel weird that they hadn’t gotten together yet. It made me realize once again that both of them are really late bloomers.</p>
<p>They certainly took their time getting together, but there’s still a long way to go, and from here, I plan to close the distance between them in a painstakingly slow fashion. It’s not like Amane’s feelings of worthlessness are going to disappear overnight, right? (evil grin)</p>
<p>Starting in Volume 5, the story will focus on what happens after they start dating. I haven’t told even half of the story that I plan to tell, so I’m going to continue writing. If possible, I’d like to see an <a id="page-236"></a>illustration of Mahiru in her wedding dress, and I hope I make it that far!</p>
<p class="space-break">As always, Hanekoto’s fantastic artwork just bursts with emotion. The cover, and the frontispieces, and everything else are all so cute… The domestic feeling and gentle eroticism given off by Mahiru as she ties her hair up are just indescribable. What a luxury, Amane, to have a girl like Mahiru in your house every day!</p>
<p>This time, there were a lot of illustrations with Amane in them, and I’m quite happy about that. The difference in his physique looks good. Amane, the version of you that Hanekoto draws is so cool; how are you still lacking confidence…? Your author is very confused. Isn’t Amane so cool?</p>
<p>I think we’ll get to see the two lovebirds do some wholesome flirting in the next volume, so I’m looking forward to it.</p>
<p class="space-break">That’s all I have to say, so now I’ll thank everyone who helped me along the way.</p>
<p>To the head editor who rendered their services for the publication of this book, to everyone in the editorial department at GA Books, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hanekoto, to everyone at the printing office—and to all of you who have picked this book up—truly, thank you very much.</p>
<p>I shall lay down my pen here and pray that we can meet again in the next volume.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading to the very end!</p>
