<p class="noindent1">“Amane, pass it here!”</p>
<p>“But you’ve got terrible control!”</p>
<p>The school Sports Day was coming up next month, and the students were leisurely enjoying gym class.</p>
<p>Remembering the previous Sports Day, Amane knew once the teams were announced sometime next week, the whole school would start preparing for it, but for now, they were still having regular gym classes.</p>
<p>Listening to the echo of the basketball club’s squeaking shoes, Amane glared at Itsuki, who had thrown the ball sloppily into the wall as a joke, and chased after the ball as it rolled away.</p>
<p>They were playing basketball that day, and soon it would be time to practice their shots. It sounded like they were going to have a game during the second half of class. Amane wasn’t particularly good at basketball, but he didn’t mind tossing the ball into the hoop a bit.</p>
<p>As Amane chased the old, brown basketball rolling slowly away from the wall, he shot a quick glance across the net dividing the gym in two. On the other side, the girls’ class was playing badminton. The girls were supposed to have been outside, but due to a sudden downpour, everyone was having gym inside the divided gymnasium.</p>
<p><a id="page-142"></a>The girls also seemed to be playing leisurely, and from time to time, Amane would catch sight of one of them lightly batting the shuttlecock with their racket. He grabbed the ball and jogged back.</p>
<p>He was careful not to even look in Mahiru’s direction. He wanted to avoid any chance of anybody noticing and accusing him of having a crush on the angel.</p>
<p>He did like her, but he knew it would be troubling for her to hear those sorts of rumors. He also didn’t want to let any unfamiliar classmates know about it, so he kept it a secret.</p>
<p>“Stop throwing the ball off in weird directions,” Amane said. “It’ll be awkward if I have to go get it from the girls’ side.”</p>
<p>Itsuki grinned foolishly. “Come on, don’t be so sensitive.”</p>
<p>Amane threw the ball with a little force at his friend’s stomach, and Itsuki, who wasn’t particularly bad at sports, caught it without breaking his grin. With a long sigh, Amane got a new ball from the ball hamper.</p>
<p>The members of the sports clubs were always in high spirits during these sorts of gym classes. This time, it was the basketball club that was in their element, and they were especially lively.</p>
<p>Amane didn’t really like basketball, but he was surprisingly fond of shooting practice, so he had been throwing the ball at the basket all class, to show the gym teacher that he was taking it seriously.</p>
<p>He threw another ball. It arced through the air, rebounded off the backboard, and fell through the center of the basket. Amane retrieved it with a slight feeling of satisfaction.</p>
<p>“You’re good at this kind of thing,” Itsuki observed. “Though whenever a game starts up, you lose all your motivation, and then you’re useless. You should try harder.”</p>
<p>“Be quiet. You can’t expect someone who’s a natural-born introverted member of the ‘go-home club’ to put in a ton of effort in a <a id="page-143"></a>basketball game. Obviously, the guys in the sports clubs are going to be the ones actually playing.”</p>
<p>“I guess so. Hey, I was just thinking, you ought to show that special someone how cool you can be from time to time.”</p>
<p>Amane knew exactly who Itsuki was referring to, but he wasn’t going to just nod obediently.</p>
<p>“I don’t need you to worry about that,” he said. “She already knows that I’m no good at sports and that I’m very uncool.”</p>
<p>“Why do you always have to turn it around like that?”</p>
<p>“You have to know by now that telling me to make an effort here is a losing proposition, right?”</p>
<p>Amane looked at Itsuki, who seemed disinterested in the outcome, with a sour expression, and was confronted with more cackling laughter.</p>
<p>“Come on now, this is your chance,” Itsuki urged.</p>
<p>“It is not. Why don’t you give it a try then, see how it goes?”</p>
<p>“Huh? No way, man. I’m not that good.”</p>
<p>“Well then, where do you get off telling me what to do?”</p>
<p>Amane grabbed Itsuki under the chin and squeezed his cheeks with his fingers, warning him not to casually demand things that he couldn’t do himself.</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry!” As he was laughing it off, Itsuki looked over to the other side of the net. “But she is looking over here, though.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Amane followed Itsuki’s gaze and saw Mahiru, waiting her turn to play badminton, looking in his direction. Staring, to be more accurate. She was definitely staring at Amane.</p>
<p>She was probably just killing time by looking around, but Amane suddenly started feeling uncomfortable, now that he knew he was being watched. He pursed his lips awkwardly.</p>
<p><a id="page-144"></a>Itsuki mumbled, “Better try your best,” like he was glad it wasn’t his problem, and pulled Amane along with him after the gym teacher’s whistle sounded.</p>
<p class="space-break">For the practice game in the second half, the class was divided into two teams, to play against two different teams from another class.</p>
<p>Amane and Itsuki were playing in the second round, so to avoid getting in the way of the rest of the players, they climbed up onto the stage at the end of the gym and took a seat.</p>
<p>The two of them were watching the imposing figure of Yuuta, who was on the team playing the first game. He was putting on a good show.</p>
<p>“How is Kadowaki keeping up against the actual basketball club…?”</p>
<p>Some of the players on the opposing team were in the basketball club, but Yuuta played well enough to put them on equal footing. Even though Yuuta was an experienced athlete, at the end of the day, he could not match them point for point. If it had just been a matter of speed, the track star might have had an advantage, but when it came to agility and handling, not to mention the coordination required to shoot the ball, the members of the basketball club were able to show off their specialized skills.</p>
<p>Amane had expected the basketball club would have an advantage and that his classmates would be entirely shut out, but Yuuta quickly disproved that prediction by continuing to score points.</p>
<p>“Well, Yuuta’s the product of an athletic family, after all,” Itsuki said. “He just chose the track club because he likes running, but he can play just about any sport at a high level.”</p>
<p>“How is he so strong?”</p>
<p>“Apparently, his mother was a sports trainer or something like that. I think he told me that his older sisters are going into related occupations, too.”</p>
<p><a id="page-145"></a>“So he’s the result of a gifted education.”</p>
<p>“Whoa! Watch Kadowaki, guys!”</p>
<p>“Block him, block him!”</p>
<p>“Don’t let him get anywhere!”</p>
<p>“Are we sure he doesn’t have some awful grudge against us?”</p>
<p>“If he finds a good opening, this is really gonna look bad for the basketball club!”</p>
<p>Amane was half-listening to the cries of the opposing team. He could also hear the girls cheering Yuuta on from across the partition.</p>
<p>They seemed to have started their own tournament of badminton on the other side of the gym, and the girls who weren’t actively playing had come up to the net to watch the game.</p>
<p>The other boys, as well, were understandably enthusiastic about Yuuta’s performance. Murmurs of admiration swept the crowd. For some reason, Itsuki slapped Amane on the back.</p>
<p>In the end, their class was victorious in the first game. Amane jumped down from the stage, marveling at his amazing friend.</p>
<p>Throwing on the team jersey he had been given, Amane stepped onto the court, not bothering to hide his expression of irritation, and accidentally made eye contact with Mahiru on the other side of the net.</p>
<p>She was wearing a faint smile, different from her usual gentle, angelic type. It was Mahiru’s real smile, the mellow one that she always showed him at home.</p>
<p>There was a tenderness to her gaze, as she waved her hand slightly and slowly mouthed “<em>Do your best!</em>” at him.</p>
<p>She didn’t say it out loud, but Amane imagined he could hear it, and it was too much for him. He couldn’t stand to look at her and turned away.</p>
<p>His mistake was turning to face Itsuki.</p>
<p>“Feeling fired up now?”</p>
