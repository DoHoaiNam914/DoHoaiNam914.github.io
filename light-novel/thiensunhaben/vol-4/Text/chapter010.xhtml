<p class="noindent1">The Sunday before the start of exams, Amane was studying quietly in his own room.</p>
<p>He wanted to get high marks, but there was also another reason he was studying—he was trying to drive thoughts of Mahiru out of his head.</p>
<p><em>“…I’m going to spoil you as much as I like, so just relax and enjoy it, okay?”</em></p>
<p>Mahiru had whispered those unbelievable words with a devilish smile, and now thoughts of her threatened to fill his head, leaving room for nothing else.</p>
<p>Amane didn’t know whether Mahiru’s recent suggestive behavior toward him was intentional, but it was certainly effective. He appreciated it, but at the same time, it made him nervous.</p>
<p>Until he was sure of Mahiru’s intentions, he couldn’t really make a move.</p>
<p>All sorts of questions troubled him, so to drive them all away, he’d been studying furiously since early morning. His efforts were at least somewhat successful, because he’d gotten so caught up in the work that by the time he realized, it was past two in the afternoon.</p>
<p><a id="page-74"></a>The fact that he had worked straight through without eating lunch was proof of how focused he had been, but now that he had noticed the time and checked the clock, his stomach immediately growled with hunger.</p>
<p>“…I guess I should at least eat lunch.”</p>
<p>Amane stretched out to relieve some of the stiffness that had built up after sitting in one place for so long. Then he stood up and left his room.</p>
<p>Mahiru had said she would be home alone studying for exams that day, and she hadn’t come over to Amane’s. That meant Amane would have to fix lunch on his own.</p>
<p>Thinking about how he’d been spoiled with good food since meeting Mahiru, he headed for the kitchen and opened the refrigerator.</p>
<p>He put a frozen portion of rice that had been set aside for quick use into the microwave, and while it was thawing, he took a bowl and scooped out several types of the preserved vegetables that Mahiru had prepared ahead of time, guaranteeing some color and nutrients for his meal.</p>
<p><em>All of this is Mahiru’s doing.</em></p>
<p>If it had been just Amane, he wouldn’t have prepared any vegetables. His lunch would’ve come from the convenience store.</p>
<p>Now he had a fair amount of food in the house, and he also knew how to make some things himself. They weren’t on the same level as Mahiru’s cooking, which was always delicious, lovely to look at, and nutritious to boot. Still, he had learned to make some edible dishes.</p>
<p>Using what he’d learned from Mahiru, Amane made a simple fried rice for lunch with just eggs and bacon. But the meal turned out to be plenty colorful thanks to the side dishes Mahiru had prepared.</p>
<p>With the addition of instant Chinese-style soup, it was a perfectly satisfactory menu for an easy lunch.</p>
<p><a id="page-75"></a>He loaded it all on a tray and carried it over to the dining table.</p>
<p>“Let’s eat.”</p>
<p>He smiled softly as he looked down at a weekend lunch that he previously would have had trouble imagining. Then he pressed his hands together in thanks and picked up his spoon.</p>
<p>The fried rice that he brought to his mouth had a somewhat strong flavor, different from Mahiru’s, but it wasn’t bad. It turned out to be well seasoned for something prepared by a high school boy.</p>
<p><em>It’s really different, huh?</em></p>
<p>Amane’s eating habits had completely changed, and so had various other things about him. In all sorts of ways, he had become completely spoiled.</p>
<p>He wondered if he was becoming a better person in his daily life. After experiencing life with Mahiru, Amane didn’t want to return to his previous existence—now that he knew life could be this good, he didn’t want to go back. He had become really spoiled, in the sense that he felt he would never be satisfied if Mahiru left.</p>
<p>He wasn’t only pampered in all practical aspects of life; he was spoiled emotionally as well.</p>
<p>Amane remembered something he had heard before from his father, Shuuto. Apparently, the Fujimiya men were the earnestly devoted type. The type who falls in love with only one person and then treasures them.</p>
<p>Amane did not have to think about whether he too had inherited those tendencies. Ever since he had become aware that he was in love with Mahiru, he paid even less attention to other girls. The most important thing was that he wanted to treasure Mahiru and make her happy.</p>
<p><em>…I won’t settle for anyone but Mahiru.</em></p>
<p>Whether he was the one to bring her joy or not, as long as Mahiru was happy, he decided he would back off right away if she fell for <a id="page-76"></a>someone else and chose that person instead. He told himself that seeing Mahiru smiling joyfully was enough.</p>
<p>However, he also had contradictory feelings. He really wanted to be the one to make her happy, and he definitely didn’t want to give her away. He didn’t want to be apart from Mahiru, and he liked being the only one who really knew her.</p>
<p>Some people would probably call what he was feeling an obsession—his heart was full of emotions that he could not explain to anyone else, like the feeling that he just couldn’t live without Mahiru.</p>
<p>She wasn’t just a pretty face; she had a pure heart as well. Amane had frankly been manipulated by the deep, strong feeling of love that was in his heart.</p>
<p>“…I wouldn’t have so much trouble if I was more assertive.”</p>
<p>Amane laughed a little. The words that he had muttered out loud naturally had a self-deprecating ring to them.</p>
<p>For the first time in his sixteen years of life, he was in love with someone, and he wanted to be the one by her side, but he had no idea how to make that happen.</p>
<p>Anyone else would probably have laughed, if they knew that he had made it to sixteen without experiencing his first love.</p>
<p>He was aware that he had a craven and cautious nature, and that he didn’t know the first thing about approaching girls. He believed that these qualities had helped earn Mahiru’s trust, and that they weren’t things that he could change easily. But he had always wished that he could be more assertive.</p>
<p>That was exactly why he was working so hard at his studies and making an effort to exercise. He was trying to gain some self-confidence.</p>
<p>With a quiet, bitter smile, Amane scarfed down the rest of the fried rice.</p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-77"></a>Amane took a short break after eating to limber up his stiff muscles with some more stretching, and while he was at it, he decided to do some light exercise to relax. He changed into running clothes in his room.</p>
<p>He had been sitting at his desk for a while, so he figured a bit of physical activity would be a good change of pace.</p>
<p>Still, he didn’t have that much stamina. He would need to reserve some energy for studying more later. He was sure that he would sleep like a log that night.</p>
<p>Reminding himself to be careful not to overdo it, Amane stepped through the door, and happened to meet Mahiru just as she was walking out of her own apartment.</p>
<p>“Ah, Amane… Going to exercise?”</p>
<p>She could clearly tell by his outfit. She gave him a charming smile, and he nodded in response. Mahiru was dressed like she was going out, so Amane figured he must have caught her just as she was leaving.</p>
<p>For a second, he remembered what had happened the day before and almost groaned out loud, but he had calmed down a little since then, so he didn’t get flustered from just seeing her.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I need a break,” he replied. “You too? Looks like you’re going shopping.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Speaking of which, I remember being low on eggs. I thought I’d make rolled omelets for dinner tonight. We’ve got exams tomorrow, and if I leave some for breakfast, they might help you do your best…”</p>
<p>“Seriously? Suddenly I feel a surge of energy!”</p>
<p>“I’m doing it for my sake, too, you know.” Mahiru put a hand over her mouth and giggled a little.</p>
<p><a id="page-78"></a>Amane answered, frowning slightly, “I can’t help myself; you make the best omelets.”</p>
<p>This brought the conversation to a pause, but both knew that Amane wasn’t actually upset. Through the gaps in Mahiru’s fingers, he could see her smile widen.</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s right, I used the last egg and also some bacon earlier. And I ate one of the frozen portions of rice.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you made your own lunch?” Mahiru remarked. “Impressive.”</p>
<p>“…I feel like you’re making fun of me. I believe I do cook occasionally even when you’re over.”</p>
<p>Naturally, Amane felt bad about leaving all the cooking to Mahiru, so he usually tried to help her with simple tasks, and on days when Mahiru seemed to be tired or feeling down, he would take over and make the meals.</p>
<p>There were limits to what he could make, so sometimes the menu deviated considerably from what they had planned on. Disregarding the presentation and accepting that the flavor would be inferior to Mahiru’s food, Amane was capable of cooking a passable meal.</p>
<p>So there was no reason for her to praise him like that just because he had made lunch.</p>
<p>“I know that, but you hardly ever do it when you’re home alone, right? You tend to choose instant meals when you’re by yourself, because cooking is a pain and you’re fine with something easy.”</p>
<p>“Uh—”</p>
<p>“Guessing from the ingredients and from your repertoire, I bet you made fried rice or something like that. It sounds like you did a good job, so that’s great.”</p>
<p>Amane was at a loss for words. She saw right through him. He thought he could feel his blood begin to boil.</p>
<p>Mahiru broke the tension when she laughed out loud and <a id="page-79"></a>extended a hand toward Amane. She gently combed her fingers through his hair, fluffing it up as she hit him with a charming smile.</p>
<p>Amane pursed his lips tightly. He didn’t hate the feeling; rather, it made him happy. He really had become spoiled.</p>
<p>“…Knock it off already, geez.”</p>
<p>“Aw, too bad. I wanted to do it more.”</p>
<p>As she said that, Mahiru readily pulled away and smiled gently.</p>
<p>It occurred to Amane that his serious expression was only making things worse, and he turned away from her.</p>
<p>“…Are eggs the only thing you’re buying?”</p>
<p>He changed the subject so that Mahiru couldn’t pet him anymore.</p>
<p>“Let’s see, there are other ingredients I need for dinner, like the eggs…and milk, but that should do it, I think. I was planning to make a quick trip, so I figured I’d just go to the closest grocery store.”</p>
<p>“Got it. I can pick all that up on my way back home.”</p>
<p>Amane wouldn’t have said anything if Mahiru had other errands or shopping to do besides for groceries, things he couldn’t do in her stead. But if she didn’t have anything else to go out for, there was no reason for her to spend the extra time and effort.</p>
<p>Amane was going outside anyway, so it would be better to have her stay home and do something else she wanted to do. She spent time every night making him dinner, so he figured he should at least do this much.</p>
<p>“Huh? But then you’ll have to carry it all.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, I’ll go shopping on my way back. And it’s not like the grocery store is that far.”</p>
<p>“Wh-what about money?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got my cash card with me. And I’ve already checked the balance. I can get a receipt from the supermarket, so there won’t be any problem with splitting the bill or anything.”</p>
