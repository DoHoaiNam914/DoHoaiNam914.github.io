<p><a id="page-233"></a>“No… How…? Why…?!!”</p>
<p>She clings to the gaunt body and weeps. Her foster father moves no more. Shadow watches her tears fall and wet the corpse’s face before turning away.</p>
<p>“It’s better you don’t know…”</p>
<p>And then he disappears into the madder-red flames, leaving her cries behind him.</p>

<p class="space-break">She hears that the boy with a major back injury is being protected at school.</p>
<p>When the news reaches Rose, she can’t help but hurry to the first aid tent at the school that burns in the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>Students and instructors with hands to spare assist with a bucket brigade.</p>
<p>The Knight Order makes moves to treat the injured and track down the Shadow Garden.</p>
<p>And Rose finally arrives at the tent after maneuvering through the flustered crowd.</p>
<p>The boy in treatment is a first-year dark knight with black hair, and he has the same features as the one for whom she’s searching.</p>
<p>But he should’ve died back there—though it wasn’t like she checked his vital signs. She hadn’t had the time or composure for that.</p>
<p>Which means maybe—just maybe—he could be alive. He could be the one inside that tent.</p>
<p>Rose can’t abandon that faint glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>Her mind negates the prospect while her heart hopes it’s true. Rose notices how weak this is making her.</p>
<p>Inside the tent reeks of blood and alcohol. The first aid team are in a rush, busily attending to patients. Rose makes her way through the tent, checking each face—until she finds the boy with black hair.</p>
<p>He’s lying facedown on a bed, being treated for his back wound.</p>
<p><a id="page-234"></a>The doctor is talking to him.</p>
<p>He’s conscious…maybe.</p>
<p>“U-ummm… Are you Cid Kagenou?” Rose sounds as if she wants to ask a favor.</p>
<p>“Yes…?” He twists around to look at her. It’s the face of that same heroic boy.</p>
<p>“I’m glad…so glad…”</p>
<p>“Wait…huh?!”</p>
<p>At some point, she’s embraced Cid, clinging to him tightly as his head squirms against her breast. Rose vows to never lose him again.</p>
<p>Something hot rises to her chest.</p>
<p>“Um… We’re in the middle of treatment…”</p>
<p>“Oh! Right.”</p>
<p>The timid voice of the doctor snaps Rose out of her daze, and she releases Cid.</p>
<p>“And how are his wounds?”</p>
<p>“The gash on his back is deep. It’s a miracle it didn’t damage his nerves or internal organs. It’s not fatal.”</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh! Really?!”</p>
<p>“Yes, really.”</p>
<p>“Wow! That’s great!” Her entire body quivers with joy.</p>
<p>“Um, yeah, so I think I unconsciously dodged a fatal attack. No, I was passed out, so I don’t really know, but that’s how I survived.” Cid sounds defensive for some unfathomable reason.</p>
<p>“You must have acted on reflex, thanks to your persistent training. Amazing.”</p>
<p>“Um, not exactly.”</p>
<p>Rose kneels before him and looks into his eyes. “No, that’s it. Your undying efforts and passion gave life to this miracle.”</p>
<p>She caresses Cid’s cheek as she gazes at him, standing close enough for him to almost feel her breath.</p>
<p>“Um…”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to say anything. I absolutely accept your feelings.” <a id="page-235"></a>Her eyes well up with tears as she peers at him, and her cheeks turn as red as a rose.</p>
<p>“That’s fine if you’re convinced I miraculously survived. But don’t go saying it was some strange anomaly afterward.”</p>
<p>“All right. For now, please get some rest.”</p>
<p>“Negotiation complete. Good night.”</p>
<p>Rose fondly watches him close his eyes and fall asleep. Her heart has never raced so fast in her life.</p>
<p><em>Bu-dump, bu-dump</em>, it throbs.</p>
<p>Up until this point, she’s only heard tell of this feeling, but now she’s finally experiencing it firsthand.</p>
<p>“Since you’ve saved my life…I shall give my heart to you…”</p>
<p>She strokes Cid’s hair and stays by his side until dawn.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Don’t you think they did a good job?” asks an alarmingly attractive blond elf, presenting a sheet of paper.</p>
<p>In an ebony dress that makes her look like darkness itself, she’s in the Mitsugoshi building late at night.</p>
<p>Gamma takes the paper from the beauty and mumbles, “Lady Alpha… Um, I don’t know what to say.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. It’s a tough question to answer.”</p>
<p>Alpha snickers to herself. The paper she handed over is a wanted poster containing a sketch of Shadow in his ebony coat.</p>
<p>“S<span class="small-caps">HADOW: ENEMY OF THE ROYAL KINGDOM</span>. W<span class="small-caps">ANTED FOR MASS MURDER, ARSON, THEFT, KIDNAPPING</span>… What a naughty man.”</p>
<p>“You’re also on the wanted poster for the Shadow Garden, Lady Alpha. Though it only mentions your name.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>Gamma takes out another paper for Alpha to read.</p>
<p><a id="page-236"></a>“The Shadow Garden… What a horrible organization.”</p>
<p>The glow of the fireplace lights up her profile, and her supernatural beauty radiates from the darkness.</p>
<p>“But it’s a shame. I can’t believe we rushed back here to find it almost over.”</p>
<p>Alpha tosses the wanted poster into the fire, muttering to herself as she watches the flames lap it up and black char creep onto the edges of the paper.</p>
<p>“Accuse us for the sins of the world. We’ll accept them as our own, but nothing will change. We’ll still do what we’re meant to do. How beautiful…”</p>
<p>Alpha watches the poster turn to ash.</p>
<p>“Deep down, I used to think I stood on the side of justice. But he wasn’t like that.”</p>
<p>The light and shadows across her alluring face shift with the swaying flames. At times, she has the looks of a goddess, and at others, a devil. The fire capriciously switches between the two.</p>
<p>“He’s prepared, and we must follow suit.”</p>
<p>Alpha turns back to Gamma, who nervously gulps upon seeing her face.</p>
<p>“Gather every available member of the Seven Shadows.”</p>
<p>“I will. Right away.” Gamma bows her head. Cold sweat trails down her neck and vanishes between her breasts.</p>
<p>After a chilly evening wind blows by her, Gamma lifts her head. There’s no one there.</p>
<p>All that’s left is the flames in the fireplace flickering violently.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Excuse me…!”</p>
<p>Hearing someone call out to him in front of the half-charred campus, the ordinary boy with black hair turns.</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry about that. I was totally spacing out. What’s up?”</p>
<p><a id="page-237"></a>“I heard I might be able to meet you if I waited here. There’s something I want to talk to you about…,” admits a girl with peach hair, gazing at him.</p>
<p>“Sure. It’ll be a while before the authorities question me anyway. Plus, classes are gonna be canceled for a while.”</p>
<p>“Um…thank you for the other day.” She lightly bows her head. “You really saved me, Cid.”</p>
<p>“It was nothing.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t have done it without you.”</p>
<p>“It’s all good. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>“Also, there’s something else I have to tell you. Um, I’ve decided to study abroad.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that explains all that luggage.”</p>
<p>There are heaps upon heaps of bags around her.</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ll be taking a carriage to Laugus.”</p>
<p>“So you’re going to the college town… Wow, that’s great.”</p>
<p>“There’s something I must do. I have to go because I can’t do it with the knowledge I have now.”</p>
<p>“All right. I wish you the best.”</p>
<p>“And because…there’s no longer a reason for me to be here.” She mournfully turns back to the school. “I wish we could’ve talked more, Cid…”</p>
<p>“Me too. But we’ll meet again someday.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I look forward to it.” She grins and walks past him.</p>
<p>“Oh, wait a sec.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” She halts at the sound of his voice and turns.</p>
<p>“Can I ask what it is you have to do?”</p>
<p>The girl smiles uneasily. “It’s a secret.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“But when it’s all over…will you listen to my story?”</p>
<p>“…Sure.”</p>
<p>The pair grin before walking away from each other.</p>
<p>As they part, the billowing clouds overhead block the summer sun, and the lukewarm breeze carries the scent of rain.</p>
<p><a id="page-238"></a>“I promise to…”</p>
<p>And the wind carries her whisper to his ears.</p>
<p>He seems to have heard the entire sentiment—a string of words unintended for his ears. He turns to look back at her as she gets smaller and smaller, farther and farther away from him.</p>
<p>Small raindrops drip down from the sky, moistening her light-pink hair, and he continues walking as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>And neither turns back again.</p>
