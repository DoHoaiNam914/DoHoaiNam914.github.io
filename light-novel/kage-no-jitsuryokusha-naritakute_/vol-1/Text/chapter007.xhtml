<p><em>I thought he was just a brat who knew nothing, but I was wrong.</em></p>
<p>His enemy had known everything and had still chosen to fight.</p>
<p><em>Powerless</em>, he thinks of himself. He’s been powerless for his entire life. He’s tried to succeed but returned empty-handed, while this whelp in black…</p>
<p>“Mi…llia…” Grease groans, reaching for a dagger encrusted with a blue jewel and closing his eyes.</p>
<p>As consciousness slips away from him, he sees the smiling face of his beloved daughter who passed long ago.</p>

<p class="space-break">Anyway, that’s how we ended our slaughter of some bandits—I mean, our little rescue mission.</p>
<p>I found my sister totally unconscious, so I undid her chains and left her there, which contributed to her crankiness when she returned home the next day. But she’s a real tough cookie—tough enough that the wound on her hand almost healed overnight.</p>
<p>After a hectic week or so of hospital treatments and follow-up investigations, my sister finally made her way to the capital—though she pestered me more than usual during that time for some annoying reason.</p>
<p>The girls in the Shadow Garden were busy, conducting their own research, taking care of the remaining bandits, and other stuff. Oh, right, we’re not calling them bandits. Whatever. The Cult. I mean, they’re all thieves in the end.</p>
<p>But that geezer with red eyes was outstanding. I mean, he inspired me to come up with “then we dive deeper,” which sounds like something a shadowbroker would say. I owe him my thanks. I would’ve loved to have him play a supporting role to my part as an eminence in shadow.</p>
<p><a id="page-047"></a>This was a must-see performance. My ability to improvise and portray a master puppeteer was off the rockers. It’s a real shame there wasn’t a live audience. But I only have to wait two more years—which is when I go to the capital. You know the one. It’s a world-famous metropolis and the only city in this country that houses one million people.</p>
<p>I bet protagonists are a dime a dozen, and there might be Final Bosses, too.</p>
<p>There’s bound to be conspiracies, rebellions, and incidents—none of which would ever happen in the boonies. And that’s when the mastermind bursts onto the scene… Huh. Now that I think about it, I guess I’m just a toad who feels cocky about beating some bandits. At this moment in time, my prologue hasn’t even been written.</p>
<p>And then one day, Alpha and the other girls gather before me, just as I’m yearning to get stronger for school, which is two years down the line. They want to share their reports on the Cult and lab findings on the curse and all that jazz.</p>
<p>It’s unusual to have all seven of them in a room at once, especially since it seems they’ve got their hands full as of late.</p>
<p><em>Geez, go easy on the research and investigations. I mean, it’s all pointless anyway</em>, I think as I listen to their reports.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Here’s a simple summary of their findings.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Their first claim is that the heroes who slayed Diablos the demon were all women, which is why they’re the ones who suffer exclusively from the curse.</p>
<p>How creative. But I hate to break it to you that all the heroes were men in the most common theory. Oh, wait, I bet they came up with that since the Shadow Garden is comprised of seven women apart from me.</p>
<p>Their next report was on how the curse was most common among elves, followed by hybrid beasts and then humans. According to their research, it has to do with the life spans of the respective species. With humans living short lives with weak traces of the heroic bloodline, they’re least susceptible to the curse. On the other hand, elves have long life <a id="page-048"></a>expectancies with potent concentrations of blood, which makes them the most prone to fall victim to the curse. The therianthropes, or hybrid beasts, are in the middle.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, I’m the only human in the Shadow Garden, and I’ve never been possessed. Besides me, we have two therianthropes and a posse of five elves—and all seven have been possessed. You know, they did a stellar job coming up with this backstory.</p>
<p>And then they proceed to report on a bunch of other things, which I pretend to absorb.</p>
<p>They move on to their reports about the Cult, which is supposedly a massive organization that operates on a global scale. Fascinating.</p>
<p>In terms of being the possessed or cursed or whatever, they tell me the Cult calls them “compatibles,” and their members are supposedly going the extra mile to locate, acquire, and wipe them from existence or some crap.</p>
<p>Anyway, they suggest that the Shadow Garden scatter across the world to prevent this from spreading. Their plan would leave me with one rotating subordinate, the rest of them scattering to every corner of the world to protect the possessed, investigate the Cult, and sabotage their activities.</p>
<p>When they suggest this new plan, it hits me all of a sudden: They must have realized that the Cult doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>They’re through with this stupid charade and demanding their freedom. What else could scattering across the world mean? I’m guessing they feel indebted to me for curing them, which is why they’re going to stick with me on a rotating basis. I just have to deal with it. I know that’s what they’re trying to tell me.</p>
<p>I’m bummed out. In my past life, the kids idolized the heroes as much as I adored masterminds—until we grew up, and they didn’t even notice that they’d forgotten all about their precious heroes. I was left alone. I guess the girls have grown up, too.</p>
<p>I’m feeling all soppy but agree to send them on their way. I never planned on having seven members to begin with. If they leave me with <a id="page-049"></a>one subordinate, that’s enough for me. I see them off, and we reluctantly exchange good-byes.</p>
<p>I make a vow to myself: I’ll never stop trying to become a mastermind, even if that means I have to face this world alone.</p>

<p class="space-break">She no longer fears killing others.</p>
<p>Beta whips her inky katana, splattering congealed blood off her blade and onto the ashen ground in a clean line. She stands cloaked in the darkness of night and surrounded by a group of soldiers lying facedown.</p>
<p>“End him,” orders Beta.</p>
<p>The girls in black bodysuits pierce their blades into the guard. One of their hands in particular shakes violently, but it doesn’t stop the girl from thrusting her sword into his pressure point.</p>
<p>“Guh… Gaaaah!” shrieks the soldier with his final breath, causing her blade to freeze in place.</p>
<p>It’s the type of cry that’ll haunt her in her sleep until she becomes accustomed to killing.</p>
<p>Beta envelops the girl’s hands on the helm with her own before giving the blade a sharp twist. Together, they feel the soldier’s life leaving his body.</p>
<p>“Ah, ahhh…!” gasps a voice.</p>
<p>This time, the cries are the girl’s.</p>
<p>Beta wraps her arm around her subordinate’s trembling shoulders and issues her next instructions. “Secure the target.”</p>
<p>The group makes its way to the carriage, boarding the loading deck. Following the shrill sounds of a chain snapping, the girls emerge from the wagon with a dark mound of rotting flesh.</p>
<p>It’s still breathing.</p>
<p>“Return to Lady Alpha—fast.”</p>
<p><a id="page-050"></a>They haul the mound, carrying it tenderly, and start to pick up speed, followed by the member of their order previously nestled in Beta’s bosom.</p>
<p>Beta squints slightly, watching them go.</p>
<p>She’s raising them well.</p>
<p>These girls used to know nothing about combat. They’d never held a sword, and it goes without saying that they’d never murdered anyone before meeting her.</p>
<p>Beta is reminded of her own past, and old memories begin to resurface.</p>
<p class="space-break1">She still remembers how it felt when she killed for the first time—her sword piercing their heart, their hand grabbing hers. Beta couldn’t believe the strength of their grip even as they suffered a fatal wound.</p>
<p>“There’s a short period of time when people can move after they’ve been stabbed through the heart. Don’t let your guard down. Hey, Beta, are you listening?”</p>
<p>Beta was listening to Alpha’s calm voice but couldn’t understand what she meant for the life of her.</p>
<p>She was paralyzed with fear—incapable of moving or thinking.</p>
<p>“You’re impossible.”</p>
<p>The head of her enemy soared through the air.</p>
<p>Alpha had beheaded him.</p>
<p>The corpse dropped to the floor, spurting blood that splatted Beta, and large teardrops fell from her eyes.</p>
<p>“Find a reason to fight.”</p>
<p>Those words sounded so cold.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Beta was a child who had trouble doing things on her own.</p>
<p>After joining the Shadow Garden, she always followed Alpha around. After all, they were old acquaintances, and she knew she would go down the right path if she stuck by Alpha’s side.</p>
<p>But Beta couldn’t find a reason to fight by following Alpha’s footsteps—or understand the importance of finding said motivation. As a result, she couldn’t get used to the idea of murder, vomiting violently <a id="page-051"></a>after killing someone on a mission and shaking in fear every night as she tried to fall asleep. It wasn’t unusual for her to wake up screaming in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>On one particular evening, Shadow approached the tormented girl.</p>
<p>“Do you seek wisdom…?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes?” Beta answered all jittery as she cocked her head to the side.</p>
<p>In her eyes, he was enigmatic and extremely powerful.</p>
<p>“If you seek wisdom…I shall give it to you.”</p>
<p><em>He might mean the knowledge of easing my emotional turmoil from murdering others</em>, she thought.</p>
<p>With great expectations, Beta nodded. “I—I want wisdom.” Her voice trembled.</p>
<p>“Then I shall give it to you…”</p>
<p>Shadow began telling a story. “Once upon a time, in a faraway place, there was an old man and an old woman…”</p>
<p>It was an ordinary fairy tale—no smidgen of wisdom or anything else.</p>
<p><em>What the heck?</em></p>
<p>She wasn’t sure how to respond—not that she was brave enough to oppose the one revered by Alpha—and shut her trap to listen to his story. It was more interesting than she’d initially imagined. In fact, she realized she’d been so absorbed in the tale that she’d forgotten the time.</p>
<p>That evening, Beta had a deep, peaceful night’s rest.</p>
<p>And ever since then, Shadow recited a bedside story to Beta before she went to sleep.</p>
<p>Beta had always been a bookworm, but she’d never heard any of his tales before. They were gripping and original to her ears. Time flew by as she listened to them, and she’d be fast asleep in no time—and stopped jolting awake in the middle of the night. Her favorites were “Cinderella” and “Snow White.”</p>
<p>This may have been around the time Beta began chasing Shadow with her eyes.</p>
<p>She noticed she was spending more and more time around him. At first, she observed him with a timid gaze. But after a year had passed, Beta was attached to him at the hip.</p>
<p><a id="page-052"></a>Shadow was indispensable to the Shadow Garden—absolute strength, knowledge, and wisdom. His unconditionality comforted Beta. Soon enough, she found he’d become a necessity to her, too.</p>
<p>She realized her doubts had disappeared somewhere along the way.</p>
<p>Without Shadow, Beta would have been killed for being possessed.</p>
<p>She’d been disowned by her family, chased out of her home country, and this series of tragedies made Beta slow in processing her new situation. She’d lost too much to notice her gains.</p>
<p>With her skepticism gone, Beta was able to realize something: Shadow had given her a new life and strength.</p>
<p>She could feel this truth swelling in her heart.</p>
<p>Beta had found a reason to fight.</p>
<p>She began keeping a journal to write about him every day—for her to keep in touch with her memories and feelings, for her to never doubt anything again.</p>
<p>Beta had found a reason to live.</p>
<p>At first, she’d jotted down words and adjectives, but she noticed it had turned into sentences, and that flourished into a story somewhere along the way.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The faint sound of movement brings Beta back to reality. She unsheathes her sword before approaching the loading deck and peers under the wagon.</p>
<p>“Eek!”</p>
<p>She locks eyes with a young soldier about her age.</p>
<p>He panics and drags himself out of the confines, trying desperately to escape.</p>
<p>He didn’t know a thing when he chose to guard the carriage hauling the possessed—and he will know nothing in death.</p>
<p>“S-stop…!”</p>
<p>Beta swings her sword down without hesitation, and blood squirts out of his neck as he sprints for his life.</p>
<p>He staggers a few more steps before collapsing to the ground. Swiping the blood spatter off her cheek, Beta gazes at the night sky, where a <a id="page-053"></a>full moon peeks out from between the clouds. Under the moonlight, she smiles innocently—as if she’s a lovely flower fraught with danger in the night.</p>
<p>Beta has no doubts.</p>
<p>If it would make him happy, she would even walk down the path of evil.</p>
