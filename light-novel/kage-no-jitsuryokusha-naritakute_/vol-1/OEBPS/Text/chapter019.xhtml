<p class="noindent"><a id="page-131"/>Summer’s almost here.</p>
<p>I swing my wooden sword on a day in late spring. I’m in the middle of my practical elective. Now that I’m free from Alexia’s clutches, I’ve transferred to be with Skel and Po. And because a bunch of students dropped out of the Royal Bushin elective after the Instructor Zenon scandal, all of us in section nine have been bumped up to section seven.</p>
<p>“Whatever happened with you and Princess Alexia?” Skel asks as he practices beside me.</p>
<p>“We haven’t talked since the breakup.”</p>
<p>Also, she tried to <em>kill</em> me.</p>
<p>“That’s a shame. And you never even kissed?” prompts Po.</p>
<p>“No, never.”</p>
<p>We’re having a dumb conversation as we wave our swords around as usual. This is what life in section seven is all about. Even though it’s a huge waste of time, this is the path I must take to maintain my status as a minor character.</p>
<p>“The Bushin Festival’s coming up. Did you guys sign up for the qualifying round?”</p>
<p>“Of course! If I do well enough in the tournament, I can easily go home with two or three lovely ladies,” boasts Skel. He’s a virgin, by the way.</p>
<p>“Oh-ho-ho, with three, I’d have my hands full,” comments Po, another big virgin.</p>
<p>“Cid, you didn’t sign up for the qualifying round, right?”</p>
<p>The Bushin Festival is a massive, semiannual tournament. Besides the local fighters, famed knights from around the world come to participate. <a id="page-132"/>There’s a special bracket for students, and there are going to be preliminaries for our tournament. But an ordinary side character would never stand on a stage in front of everyone. Not in a million years.</p>
<p>“I’m not go—…”</p>
<p>“But don’t worry! I went and signed you up! Show me your gratitu—… <em>Guhh!!</em>”</p>
<p>Skel suddenly clutches his stomach and crumples to the ground.</p>
<p>“H— Skel!! What’s happened to you?” Po cries.</p>
<p>It’s a frighteningly fast hit. I’m the only one who can see it.</p>
<p>“Hey. Hey, Skel. You should have seen yourself. It was like someone slammed you in the stomach with a right hook. What’s up with you?” I ask as I loosen my right fist.</p>
<p>“Th-that’s a really accurate description, Cid.”</p>
<p>“This is bad. He’s a goner. Gimme a hand to get him to the nurse’s office. Hey, do you know if we’re able to take back tournament applications?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I’m not sure. Oh, Skel, you’re foaming at the mouth.”</p>
<p>Our instructor gives us permission to carry Skel to the nurse’s office for his “sudden seizure” that knocked him out.</p>
<p>It’s on the way there that I notice something.</p>
<p>“Who’s that?” I ask about a solemn-looking group entering the school.</p>
<p>“It looks like…Princess Iris is with them.”</p>
<p>Alexia is there, too. Our eyes meet for a moment before she scornfully turns away.</p>
<p>I still haven’t told anyone she went all cuckoo on me and attempted to go on a wild killing spree. And I don’t plan on telling anyone about the incident on the roof if she keeps her distance. With our peace treaty, she can kill whomever she pleases. Her swordplay seems to have really improved, and I think it’s great that she’s trying to get stronger. Well, as long as she doesn’t try to kill me, that is.</p>
<p>“By the way, I heard Princess Iris is coming to campus to request some kind of investigation.”</p>
<p>Po doesn’t look it, but he’s always in the know.</p>
<p>The Midgar Academy for Dark Knights is a massive building that <a id="page-133"/>contains the Midgar Academy of Science. I hear they conduct research and do science-y stuff. I dunno.</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p><em>Wait, didn’t Alexia mention Iris is building a new army?</em></p>
<p>After Po and I watch the Knight Order enter the building, we drop Skel off in the nurse’s office and just skip class.</p>

<p class="space-break">There are a few people engaging in a discussion in a large reception room.</p>
<p>“We’d like to ask you, the most distinguished scholar in the kingdom, to interpret this artifact for us,” continues a beauty with scarlet locks, Iris, holding a large pendant-shaped object.</p>
<p>“But I’m just a student,” objects a lovely young girl with hair as pink as a peach upon taking one look at the artifact in question.</p>
<p>“Everyone in the world knows about your incredible work. You’re Sherry Barnett, the best researcher in your field. No one could do it better than you.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“It’s a good opportunity for you. You should give it a try,” interrupts a man in his early forties, encouraging Sherry.</p>
<p>“Assistant Principal Lutheran Barnett…”</p>
<p>“You can call me Father, you know,” Lutheran nudges gently, chuckling.</p>
<p>In return, Sherry smiles awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Sherry, it’s your time to go out into the world of professional research. Princess Iris’s request will bring you closer to the bright future that’s waiting for you.”</p>
<p>“But I’m not…”</p>
<p>“Don’t I say it all the time? Have confidence. I know you can do this. You’re the only one who can.” Lutheran places a hand on Sherry’s slender shoulder.</p>
<p><a id="page-134"/>“Fine, I’ll do it…”</p>
<p>Iris hands Sherry the artifact.</p>
<p>“An ancient alphabet? It’s written in a secret code,” Sherry observes.</p>
<p>“There is a religious group that calls themselves the Cult of Diablos. This artifact was in their facility. They seem to be doing research on ancient civilizations, but we don’t know the details. There must be a connection between the code and the ancient civilizations,” explains Iris.</p>
<p>“Well, you certainly came to the right person.” Sherry scrutinizes the object.</p>
<p>“I want a member of the Knight Order to guard it,” Iris adds.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by guard…?” asks Lutheran.</p>
<p>“In all truth, the Cult of Diablos—that religious group—is after that artifact.”</p>
<p>“That’s unsettling.” Lutheran sharpens his gaze.</p>
<p>“We originally obtained this from their facility. Of course, this isn’t the only item we’ve confiscated. We’ve been storing other classified documents and objects in our warehouse, but I’m embarrassed to admit that an unidentified person burned down our warehouse the other day. This artifact is all that remains.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’ve heard about the recent fire. Which reminds me, Princess Iris, you established the new Knight Order after that.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but it’s still quite small.”</p>
<p>“I believe it’s called the Crimson Order, correct? I see you’ve brought your Crimson Knights here today.”</p>
<p>“I have…”</p>
<p>“Are you that distrustful of the previous Order?”</p>
<p>Iris doesn’t reply to Lutheran’s razor-sharp question, looking back at him without changing her expression.</p>
<p>“Hmm. Fine by me. I’ll approve up to two guards,” concedes Lutheran.</p>
<p>“Two…? Well, I guess that won’t be a problem if I’m guarding the artifact.” Iris looks troubled.</p>
<p>“The work of the Knight Order will experience delays if Princess Iris is off-site.”</p>
<p>The speaker is a broad-shouldered knight sitting to Iris’s left. He’s <a id="page-135"/>muscular with a beard as bushy as a lion’s mane. A large scar runs across his cheek.</p>
<p>“Indeed… Glen, I leave the guarding to you.”</p>
<p>“Understood, Your Highness,” he says with a bow.</p>
<p>“Iris, I’ll help, too,” says Alexia from Iris’s right. “If you split up the guards, fewer knights will be available to respond to the Ebony Incident.”</p>
<p>Iris goes silent.</p>
<p>“The Crimson Order has its hands full, and I know who <em>he</em> is. I’m perfect for this role.”</p>
<p>“But, Alexia, you’re still…”</p>
<p>“A student. I’m a student, but age is irrelevant if you’ve got skill. You said it yourself.”</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t.”</p>
<p>“That’s what you’ve just told Miss Sherry.” Alexia grins confidently at her peeved older sister.</p>
<p>“And you used to be so cute…,” mumbles Iris.</p>
<p>“I heard that. Anyway, Iris, I want to know. I want to know why <em>they’re</em> doing this and…if they plan to oppose us.”</p>
<p>“But it’s going to be dangerous.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>The sisters silently exchange glances.</p>
<p>“Fine. I formally request that you accept low-risk missions only and to the degree that it doesn’t interfere with your schoolwork.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Alexia smiles and bows.</p>
<p>“I hope all goes well with the artifact,” Iris addresses Sherry after letting out a deep sigh.</p>

<p class="space-break">That evening, I try to cancel my application for the preliminaries after class.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p><a id="page-136"/>I bow and leave the student services office.</p>
<p>“Well, how’d it go?”</p>
<p>Skel and Po approach me outside the office. They were waiting for me.</p>
<p>“They said everyone’s been paired up, and it’s impossible to withdraw.” I sigh.</p>
<p>“Hey, look on the bright side. If you do well, you’re gonna be swimming in girls, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! They say tough times bring opportunity, if you know what I mean.”</p>
<p>I shake my head. “I don’t care if I win or lose. I just don’t want to do it.”</p>
<p>“Geez, you’re hopeless. C’mon, I’m gonna introduce you to this special shop. Try to lose the long face.”</p>
<p>“S-special shop?” stutters Po, taking ragged breaths through his nose.</p>
<p>“Oops, not that kind of special. I meant the Mitsugoshi that everyone’s talking about. I’ve heard they’ve got all sorts of new items, and one of ’em is a snack called chocolate. It’s supposedly sweet and hella delicious.”</p>
<p>“Treats? I’d love some.”</p>
<p>“You doofus! It’s not for you.” Skel slaps Po atop his head. “We’re gonna give the chocolate to girls. Y’know, women go gaga for you if you give ’em something sweet!”</p>
<p>“O-oh, I get it. Spoken like a true professional, Skel. You always teach me so much.”</p>
<p>“I know, right?” crows Skel, feeling full of himself.</p>
<p>“Come on, Cid. Let’s get going.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go, Cid.”</p>
<p>There’s a sparkle in their eyes.</p>
<p>“Fine, I’ll go,” I agree with a sigh.</p>
<p>I have to admit I’m a bit curious to see what the chocolate of this world is like.</p>

<p class="space-break"><a id="page-137"/>Skel takes us to the main street in the capital. The bustling evening streets are overflowing with people, and every store in this super-high-scale area seems packed to the brim. Mitsugoshi is more crowded than the rest of the shops by a long shot.</p>
<p>“Wow, it’s so friggin’ cool.”</p>
<p>A brand-new, swanky building stands tall in the sky—trendy to the point that it seems almost contemporary. I haven’t felt this out of my element since I walked into a high-end store in my past life.</p>
<p>There’s an enormous line snaking out from the entrance. All the people waiting for their turn seem to be members of noble families or their guests. One glance is all I need to know these are wealthy, special customers. At the very end of the line is a woman in uniform holding a sign. The wait time is approximately eighty minutes.</p>
<p>“It’s an eighty-minute wait,” I protest.</p>
<p>“I’m sure we’ll make it back before our dorm curfew,” argues Po.</p>
<p>“We’ve already gotten this far. Let’s go,” insists Skel.</p>
<p>“But I’ve heard there are slashers on the loose. I don’t want to stay out too late…”</p>
<p>“The three of us are friggin’ dark knights, you nitwit. We’ll slash ’em right back!” Skel pats the sword on his lower back.</p>
<p>“Y-you’re right.”</p>
<p>“Did you say slashers?” I ask, interrupting their conversation.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard there were recent killings in the capital, happening at night. And they’ve been carried out by expert fighters who’ve already taken down members of the Knight Order…,” whispers Po.</p>
<p>“Ooh, creepy. I wouldn’t be caught dead walking around at night.”</p>
<p><em>A slashing cutscene? Sounds fun. Sign me up.</em></p>
<p>“Chop-chop! If we don’t get in line, we won’t make it in time for curfew,” presses Skel.</p>
<p>Po and I trudge to the end of the line.</p>
<p>“Hi, m-m-ma’am. Y-you’re pretty. G-g-got any hobbies?” Skel attempts to pick up the employee with the sign as soon as we get there.</p>
<p>But she flashes him a battle-hardened smile and proceeds to ignore him before staring at me with a cheerful grin for reasons unknown.</p>
<p><a id="page-138"/>“Excuse me, sir. Could I have a moment of your time?”</p>
<p>She’s an exquisite woman whose face is calm and refined with dark-brown hair that matches the color of her eyes. Her work uniform is a short and simple navy-blue dress marked with the Mitsugoshi logo. It reminds me of the flight attendants I saw in my past life.</p>
<p>“Who? Me?” I ask, pointing to myself.</p>
<p>“Yes. Please participate in our short survey.”</p>
<p><em>A survey? That’s a rarity in this world.</em></p>
<p>“Sure, I guess…”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“I-I-I’ll take the survey, too!”</p>
<p>“S-so will I!”</p>
<p>Skel and Po make a last-ditch effort to charm her.</p>
<p>“One customer will suffice,” she replies, hooking her arm in mine.</p>
<p>Together, we cut the long line and make a beeline into the store. When I look behind me at the last second, I can see the disappointment in Skel’s and Po’s eyes.</p>
<p>I follow the woman into a boutique that seems excessively lavish. The interior isn’t outwardly garish, but I can tell every last detail of decor has been carefully selected, and it gives off a chill vibe. Even the untrained eye can tell it’s decorated in a modern and tasteful fashion.</p>
<p>She escorts me through the sales floor to a door labeled E<span class="small-caps">MPLOYEES</span> O<span class="small-caps">NLY</span>. I manage to sneak a few peeks around me, and every product that fills my vision is incredible.</p>
<p>Of course, I notice the rumored chocolate, but I also see coffee, makeup, and soap. It’s the first time I’ve seen any of these in this world. Plus, their clothes, accessories, shoes, and underwear are all designed with class and novelty in mind. Even I know these items will fly off the shelves in this world. It’s a no-brainer.</p>
<p>This place is unbelievable. It’ll take the world by storm. It’s only a matter of time, I’m certain.</p>
<p>We walk through the staff door and down a passage to a humongous stairway. I swear I’ve seen it in a certain movie about a luxury cruise ship. We ascend the stairs and continue walking through a bright and spacious <a id="page-139"/>hallway. At the very end of the hall is a large, sparkling door carved with exquisite engravings.</p>
<p>Two lovely ladies stand in front of the door. They bow to me and open it slowly.</p>
<p>What lies beyond is a space that looks like an enormous hall. There are tall pillars that resemble those in ancient Greek temples and marble floors that glisten under the light.</p>
<p>A red carpet has been unfurled, extending to the back of the room and flanked by two rows of attractive women.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>The moment I set foot in the room, they all kneel simultaneously.</p>
<p>“Um… So how about that survey…?”</p>
<p>An enormous chair has been positioned in the backmost part of the room. A crimson sunset pours down from the skylight and onto that delicate masterpiece.</p>
<p>The seat remains empty.</p>
<p>A lovely blue-haired elf stands next to it. She’s a refined woman with a model-esque figure covered by an entrancing black dress. I know that face.</p>
<p>“We’ve waited a long time for you, my lord.” Another woman stoops down to one knee with the elegance of an actress.</p>
<p>“Gamma…”</p>
<p>She’s the third original member after Alpha and Beta. Anyone can tell she’s a genius by taking one look at her clever face and sharp blue eyes. That’s Gamma, the brains of the Shadow Garden.</p>
<p>Gamma is clever, I give her that. But she has one major flaw.</p>
<p>Her nickname is Gamma the Weak.</p>
<p>Even though she’s one of the longest-serving members in the Seven Shadows, Gamma is the weakest by far. To backtrack, the Seven Shadows refers to the first seven members of the Shadow Garden. I chose that name because it’s badass. Obviously.</p>
<p>When it comes to fighting and physical activities, Gamma’s instincts are fatally poor. If Delta is the most talented fighter in the Seven Shadows, Gamma is the worst. I personally think the two of them are similar. If I <a id="page-141"/>said that out loud, I bet Gamma would blow her fuse and Delta would tremble with mirth, but I know for a fact they’re the same type of person.</p>
