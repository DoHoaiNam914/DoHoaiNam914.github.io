<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter013">My Official Beginning as a Mastermind in Action!</a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page-081"/>I was interrogated in a room comparable to a detention cell and released after five days. It’s evening now.</p>
<p>“Go on. Scram.”</p>
<p>They shove me out of the building and chuck my suitcase behind me. I’m in nothing but my underwear, and I rummage through my suitcase to change and shove my feet into my shoes. It takes me a while to get dressed. I’m guessing it has to do with the fact that all my fingernails were ripped off.</p>
<p>When I get everything on, I heave out a big sigh and start walking. I stand out among the people on the busy street since I’m beaten up and drenched in my own blood.</p>
<p>I sigh again. “Chill out, relax. There’s no point getting worked up over every little thing.”</p>
<p>I manage to stay calm by blocking the faces of the interrogating knights out of my mind.</p>
<p>“They were just doing their job.”</p>
<p>Their punches only left surface-level wounds on my body. If I felt like it, I could grow my missing fingernails back. But I don’t, because I’m fully immersed in acting out my role as a nobody.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m always cool and collected.”</p>
<p><em>Right. Calm.</em></p>
<p>I let out another long exhale, and my field of vision clears. I pay attention to my surroundings and sense strange shadows lurking behind me.</p>
<p>“Two of them are tailing me.”</p>
<p><a id="page-082"/>The kidnapper hasn’t been caught. Which obviously means that the state of Alexia’s well-being is up in the air.</p>
<p>Just because I’ve been released doesn’t mean it’s all sunshine and roses. They just don’t have enough evidence to convict me, and my name hasn’t been cleared yet.</p>
<p>I trudge back to my dorm room, pretending to hang my head from exhaustion.</p>
<p>“Later…,” whispers a quiet voice.</p>
<p>It reaches my ears, accompanied with the faint scent of a familiar perfume.</p>
<p>“Alpha…?”</p>
<p>But I can’t find her anywhere among the city folk scurrying past one another on the main road after sunset.</p>

<p class="space-break">When I flick the lights on in my dorm room, the silhouette of a girl emerges from the darkness.</p>
<p>“You must be hungry.”</p>
<p>Her black suit fits her perfectly, accentuating her feminine curves. She’s holding out a sandwich with a thick slab of tuna in her hand from Tuna King, the famous restaurant in the capital.</p>
<p>“Thanks. It’s been a while, Alpha. Where’s Beta?”</p>
<p>I’m famished after not eating a proper meal in five days, and I devour the sandwich. Beta is the one who’s supposed to be on rotation to assist me.</p>
<p>“She contacted me. What a mess.” Alpha sits cross-legged on the bed.</p>
<p>There’s a nostalgic quality to her shiny golden locks that trail down her back and those blue eyes the shape of almonds. She’s grown up since last time.</p>
<p>“Yep.” I stuff the last piece of sandwich into my mouth.</p>
<p><a id="page-083"/>“There’s water in there.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.” I chug it from a large glass. “Ahhh! I’m alive again.”</p>
<p>I strip off my jacket and shoes and dive into bed.</p>
<p>“Hey, at least change out of your clothes.”</p>
<p>“Can’t. Gonna go to bed now.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you know the position you’re in?”</p>
<p>“I’ll leave the preparations to you.”</p>
<p>Alpha is brilliant. She’ll prepare the best stage for our performance if I just let her do her thing. Until then, I’m gonna sleep… I mean, save up my energy.</p>
<p>Alpha lets out a frustrated sigh. “I’m sure you already know this, but they’re going to think you’re the culprit if you don’t do something.”</p>
<p>“True that.”</p>
<p>If the real culprit is never found, I can almost guarantee the next suspect in line will be punished. Especially since this involves the kidnapping of a royal. Someone has to die or else the case will never be closed.</p>
<p>Ya gotta love the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>“Wake up. I’ve got more sandwiches.”</p>
<p>“I’m awake.”</p>
<p>Alpha hands them over. “Someone is trying to escalate the situation and frame you as the culprit.”</p>
<p>“Huh. Like, I’m gonna be convicted even if they don’t do anything?”</p>
<p>“I’m guessing they want to settle this matter quickly, and an unassuming student from a poor noble family is the perfect target.”</p>
<p>“Agreed. I would do the same thing.”</p>
<p>“We can’t trust the Knight Order.”</p>
<p>“Has the Cult infiltrated them?”</p>
<p>“Yes, without a doubt. The abductor is a member of the Cult. Their goal is to obtain high concentrations of the blood of the heroes.”</p>
<p>The girls are still pretending that there’s a Cult—for me. What a great bunch.</p>
<p>“Is she still alive?”</p>
<p><a id="page-084"/>“If she dies, they won’t be able to extract any more of her blood.”</p>
<p>“True.”</p>
<p>“Though I’m not sure why you decided to woo the princess.” Alpha glares at me.</p>
<p>“That’s not how it happened.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you have your reasons—reasons you can’t tell us.”</p>
<p>I don’t let out another peep and avert my eyes to avoid her gaze. I have no real reason, of course.</p>
<p>“I understand. I know you’re struggling with something deep down in your heart.”</p>
<p>How do I respond when that’s totally not the case?</p>
<p>“But I hope you can trust us even a little bit more. If you told us about this earlier, it wouldn’t have gotten out of hand. Don’t you agree?”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. Our job is to make sure you’re covered,” she adds with a smile. “Once we solve this case, you’re treating me to Tuna King. That last sandwich was supposed to be mine.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Sorry for stealing your sandwich, Alpha.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it,” she insists, standing up and heading to the window.</p>
<p>Once she gets it open, she hooks one foot out of the room, wiggling her tiny hips.</p>
<p>“I’ll be leaving now. Lay low for a while.”</p>
<p>“Got it. What’s our strategy?”</p>
<p>“We’ll assemble an army. There aren’t enough members in the capital. And I believe we should summon Delta.”</p>
<p>“You’re sending for Delta?”</p>
<p>“She wants to see you.”</p>
<p>Gunshot Delta. Otherwise known as Suicide Weapon Delta. Put simply, she’s a blockhead who’s spent all her experience points on her battle skills.</p>
<p>A little reunion would be nice, I guess. I’m begging that all of them turned out all right.</p>
<p><a id="page-085"/>“I’ll let you know the details when the preparations are complete. See you soon.”</p>
<p>Alpha flashes me a final smile before yanking on her bodysuit to hide her face and slipping out the window into the night.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Is that the end of your report?” asks a redheaded beauty.</p>
<p>Her fiery, straight hair reaches to the small of her back, illuminated under the flickering lights of a candle, and her wine-red eyes are set on the investigation papers on her desk. The reporting knight blushes in the presence of her poise and allure.</p>
<p>“Y-yes, Princess Iris. We’ll continue our search to the best of our abilities.”</p>
<p>Iris nods, cuing him to take his leave.</p>
<p>When the door clicks closed behind him, Iris is left alone with a handsome man with blond hair.</p>
<p>“Marquess Zenon. Thank you for your cooperation.”</p>
<p>“The incident took place on school grounds. I was responsible for keeping her safe, and more importantly, I’m worried about her well-being…”</p>
<p>He lowers his eyes and bites his lower lip in frustration.</p>
<p>“You had to attend to your duties as an expert swordsman. No one blames you. And we don’t have time to point fingers right now. We need to focus on getting Alexia back safe and sound.”</p>
<p>“I suppose you’re right…”</p>
<p>“Another thing.” Iris stops speaking for a moment and snaps the report closed. “Is it true that this Cid Kagenou is most likely the perpetrator?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to believe one of our students could be the culprit, but based on the circumstances, I have to say I find him suspicious…though I don’t think he’s strong enough to overpower Alexia in a duel.” Mr. Zenon tacks on the last bit, carefully choosing his words.</p>
