<p><a id="page-178"/>“Foster Father!”</p>
<p>The assistant principal merrily chuckles and continues to speak. “I wasn’t always able to laugh like this, you know. Sherry and I have been through a lot. I hope you two can get along. It’s all a father could wish for.”</p>
<p>Lutheran’s face is stern as Sherry stands beside him with an uncomfortable smile.</p>
<p>I only befriend side characters…but there’s no way I can say that.</p>
<p>“…Sounds great.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll leave the rest up to you youngsters.” The assistant principal pats my shoulder and leaves.</p>
<p>“Um, it’s nice to officially meet you.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, too.”</p>
<p>“So what do you want to do?” She tilts her head. “Oh, right. We have to get you to a doctor before anything else. I’m sorry for getting carried away.”</p>
<p>She smiles uneasily.</p>
<p>“No, don’t worry about me. I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“That may be true, but…”</p>
<p>“I don’t need to see a doctor. I’ll go later. Seriously, I will. Okay? Yeah, so let’s go out for tea or something.”</p>
<p>“Um, are you sure you’re okay?”</p>
<p>“Positive.”</p>
<p>“Dark knights are incredible.”</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>This stunner flashes me a smile. She’s the furthest thing imaginable from a background character.</p>
<p>After that, the two of us eat her cookies and talk over tea. We go our separate ways when we finish. Though a perfectly average girl in conversation, she seems to be flooded with requests from the Knight Order, currently conducting research on a sacred artifact. I went the extra mile and told her I was impressed. Oh, by the way, her cookies were simple but downright delicious. She can never be a normie’s friend. <a id="page-179"/>But she goes to the Academy of Science, so we probably won’t meet again anyway.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The next day, I notify the school that I’ll be taking five days off for medical treatment to ease their suspicions.</p>
<p>My classmates are a little nicer to me when I finally come back.</p>

<p class="space-break">Ever since Sherry befriended Cid, she feels like she’s floating on air.</p>
<p>Cid has been absent from school due to the injuries he sustained at the preliminaries.</p>
<p>He said he felt fine after the tournament and even joined her for tea, but he seems to have overdone it after all. She’s worried about his condition.</p>
<p>She thinks about visiting him but doesn’t want to be a bother. But something is gnawing at her, and she needs to talk.</p>
<p>“Whew…” Sherry stops analyzing the artifact and lets out a sigh.</p>
<p>She can’t focus on her work. Her head is too far in the clouds.</p>
<p>The afternoon sunlight flows into the study room.</p>
<p>No matter what she does, he’s all she can think about.</p>
<p>She thinks back to the moment he gave her the chocolate, about his unrelenting stance during preliminaries, about their conversation over tea—over and over again.</p>
<p>She thinks about him during class and as she conducts her research, right until she goes to bed.</p>
<p>“I wonder what’s wrong with me…?”</p>
<p>She retrieves the empty box of chocolate from a drawer in her desk.</p>
<p>Even though she had already eaten the contents, she could not find it in herself to throw away the beautifully decorated box.</p>
<p>The sweet aroma of chocolate still clings to it.</p>
<p><a id="page-180"/>Sherry is also curious about a certain rumor.</p>
<p>From what she’s heard, Cid and Princess Alexia are in love.</p>
<p>She doesn’t know the specifics, but she imagines the rumor holds up for it to make its way from the Academy for Dark Knights to the Academy of Science.</p>
<p>“Mm!” Sherry stretches as she watches the curtain billow with the wind.</p>
<p>“Okay. I’ll do it.”</p>
<p>She can’t concentrate on anything.</p>
<p>Sherry decides she has to talk it out in person.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>Knock, knock.</em></p>
<p>Sherry gives a few quick raps on a door in the dormitory for girls. That’s where the student in question is supposedly under house arrest.</p>
<p>“It’s me, Sherry Barnett, the second-year student at the Academy of Science.” She introduces herself through the door and waits for a response.</p>
<p>“Hello,” replies a voice at the same time the door swings open. “Is there anything I can do for you, Sherry?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Apologies for the sudden visit.”</p>
<p>“Come on in,” suggests the room’s resident, Alexia.</p>
<p>Her place is spacious and serene, much larger than the average dorm lodgings. Sherry is told to make herself at home and perches on the couch.</p>
<p>“Would you like black tea? I’ve also got coffee. Seems to be really popular recently.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t need anything.”</p>
<p>“It’s no trouble.”</p>
<p>“O-okay. I’ll take a coffee.”</p>
<p>“All right.” Alexia begins gracefully brewing a pot.</p>
<p>Sherry starts getting nervous. <em>I’m in my second year, and she’s only in her first. No need to get worked up</em>, she reassures herself with nonsensical logic, thinking it’s all good because she’s Alexia’s senior. But on second thought, Alexia <em>is</em> royalty.</p>
<p><a id="page-181"/>Maybe this isn’t such a good idea.</p>
<p>No, no—she’s the upperclassman here. She has to be confident.</p>
<p>“I can guess why you’re here, Sherry.”</p>
<p>Sherry jolts at those words. “U-umm…”</p>
<p>“This is about the artifact, right?”</p>
<p>“Well, not exactly.”</p>
<p>There’s the <em>clink</em> of a coffee cup. Alexia places it on the table in the midst of an awkward lull in the conversation.</p>
<p>“Here you go.”</p>
<p>“Th-thank you very much.”</p>
<p>Alexia takes a seat opposite Sherry.</p>
<p>“Whoa, that’s bitter…,” Sherry whispers after taking a sip.</p>
<p>“It’s easier to drink if you add milk and sugar.”</p>
<p>“O-okay.”</p>
<p>Sherry didn’t mean for Alexia to hear that comment, but it looks like she did. Sherry’s automatic reflex is to add tons of milk and sugar and chug it.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s so good.”</p>
<p>“G-great… Those are the finest coffee beans from Mitsugoshi. I’m glad you like it.”</p>
<p>“Mitsugoshi… Oh, the place that sells chocolate. You know, that place really is something. This coffee is so sweet and creamy.”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah, it sure is…,” Alexia comments, looking as if she wants to say, <em>Because you’re basically drinking sugar and milk</em>.</p>
<p>“So what can I do for you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, right. Yes.” Sherry puts down her cup, looking slightly pained as she mumbles, “Actually, I’d like to ask you something.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Um, like…if you’ve had a boyfriend recently and stuff.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry…?”</p>
<p>“A-and if you went out with Cid Kagenou and whether you’re still together and stuff.”</p>
<p>“U-um…” Alexia scrutinizes her face to find out if she’s being serious.</p>
<p><a id="page-182"/>Sherry’s eyes are darting around the room, and there’s obvious tension in her shoulders.</p>
<p>Alexia guesses she may not be good at conversation in general. She’s picked up that Sherry is nervous, but Alexia can’t figure out the reason behind her question.</p>
<p>“We broke up.” Alexia speaks as calmly as possible.</p>
<p>“Really? Phew…” Sherry sounds elated, as if she feels relieved from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p>Alexia’s cup clinks as she sets it down.</p>
<p>“Oh, but…but does that mean you actually dated…?” Her tone changes drastically and sounds uneasy.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a real relationship. There were some circumstances that required us to pretend.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see. That’s great.” Sherry giggles cheerfully.</p>
<p>Alexia’s cup clangs.</p>
<p>“I just befriended Cid the other day.”</p>
<p>“What? Y-you don’t say…”</p>
<p>“Yes. I couldn’t stop thinking about your relationship.”</p>
<p>“Um, was that the only reason for your visit?”</p>
<p>“Yep! It distracted me so much, I couldn’t focus on my research. I’m just so happy to know you two aren’t dating!”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah, great.”</p>
<p>Alexia brings the cup to her mouth with a trembling hand. It’s empty.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much! Oh, and thanks for the coffee!” Sherry takes her leave with a bright smile—the exact opposite of the expression she wore when she came in.</p>
<p>The moment she steps out of the room, there’s a sound of something breaking, but Sherry is too ecstatic to hear it.</p>
