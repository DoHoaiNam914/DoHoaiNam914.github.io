<p>That’s why I think of it as a conversation.</p>
<p>With stronger communication skills, you can anticipate further ahead, allowing you to respond appropriately, which they can guess before you can follow through and react, and so on and so forth, in an endless exchange.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your conversational skills are lacking, or if there’s too big a difference between you and the other guy, you won’t be able to get a dialogue started in the first place.</p>
<p>One side, or sometimes even both, will act on impulse until the fight ends.</p>
<p>That’s no conversation. It’s not even a process. Just a result. In my opinion, if you aren’t planning on having a discussion, you might as well just go ahead and decide your fight with a good old game of rock-paper-scissors. Delta, I’m talking to you here. Her rules let rock beat the living shit out of paper and scissors.</p>
<p>That said, I’m hardly in any position to talk. It’s been forever since I’ve had anything even resembling a conversation.</p>
<p>Unlike Delta, though, I do at least go in <em>trying</em> to communicate… It just always ends with me playing rock and smashing in their face.</p>
<p>That’s why this chick is getting me more excited than I’ve been in a while. She’s watching me. The tip of my sword, my gaze, my footwork… While she pretends to smile nonchalantly, she’s watching every meaningful move I make.</p>
<p>I think I’ll call her Violet. My dear, beloved Violet.</p>
<p>For the first few moments, our conversation consists of merely staring at each other.</p>
<p>Bit by bit, we’re learning. She’s the type who likes to keep her distance, and I’m fundamentally the kind of guy who likes to match my opponent’s rhythm. I’m definitely not the type who likes smashing people with my rock.</p>
<p>And because of that, I begin our conversation by ceding the initiative.</p>
<p><em>After you</em>, I imply.</p>
<p>The very next moment, I yank back my front leg.</p>
<p><a id="page-40"/>As I do, something like a red spear explodes from the ground where my foot was.</p>
<p>I retreat half a step. Gotta say I wasn’t expecting her first move to come from below me.</p>
<p>The red spear splits into two, rushing at me from both sides.</p>
<p>The first step is to observe.</p>
<p>I want to judge its speed, mobility, and destructive capacity.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I dodge the spear on my left, then block the one on my right with my katana. The impact has weight to it. It’s definitely enough to kill me.</p>
<p>The dodged spear proceeds to split again. There are probably a thousand red wires now, and they all look sharp as needles.</p>
<p>Then, they converge on my position.</p>
<p>I gather magic in my blade and sweep the lot of them away, obliterating the red spear completely.</p>
<p>“A swarm of mosquitoes can never take down a lion,” I tell her.</p>
<p>Violet beams with grace. We go back to staring at each other for a bit.</p>
<p>With stronger communication skills, it takes less time to gauge the other party, including their condition for the most part.</p>
<p>I know how this battle will end. Violet probably does, too.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the silence is broken when a series of spears as thick as logs burst out of the ground.</p>
<p>There are nine of them in total.</p>
<p>I’m able to dodge the wide ones, but they can change their shape like tentacles and keep coming—trying to stab at me with spears, wrap around me with string, chomp at me like jaws.</p>
<p>That’s the way she likes to fight: a lethal, one-sided game with those shape-shifting tentacles.</p>
<p>I continue observing. As I watch how the feelers operate, I refine my movements.</p>
<p>By doing so, I’m able to remove any unnecessary motion when I dodge. Full steps turn to half steps. Two moves turn to one.</p>
<p>Even if I avoid them forever, I can’t win, but evasion is a necessary first step to counterattacking.</p>
<p>The less I have to move to dodge, the faster my subsequent counterattack can come.</p>
<p><a id="page-41"/>Eventually, my evasion and my counterattack will coincide.</p>
<p>With a single step, I bring myself directly in front of Violet.</p>
<p>At some point, a scythe appears in her hands. It cleaves toward me.</p>
<p>As I repel the blow with my katana, I kick her in the leg.</p>
<p>A slime sword extends from the tip of my foot and impales her. As of late, I’ve mostly been using it as a prop for when I want to get theatrical, but it’s invaluable against strong enemies as a way to throw them off-balance.</p>
<p>For a beat, she stops moving, and a moment is all I need.</p>
<p>Violet smiles, accepting the outcome.</p>
<p>“I wanted to fight you at your full strength.”</p>
<p>As fresh blood sprays through the air, I whisper in a low voice only Violet can hear.</p>

<p class="space-break0">“Like I said, Shadow doesn’t have a leg to stand on,” says Nelson proudly. Alexia ignores him.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the battle, Aurora has been pushing Shadow back nonstop. Alexia gazes in astonishment at the terrifying speed of the red tendrils.</p>
<p>Those things are unlike any weapon she’s ever seen. They change their form so freely, it’s like they’re an extension of Aurora’s own body. She could probably even extend them out even farther and run an entire group through at once.</p>
<p>Anyone insisting on fighting her with a sword would be doomed from the get-go.</p>
<p>So this is the power of ancient battle techniques. Alexia is forced to admit she would be no match for Aurora.</p>
<p>“He’s more persistent than I expected, but the difference in skill is clear.”</p>
<p><em>You’re wrong.</em> Alexia silently rejects Nelson’s observation.</p>
<p>Although it may look like Shadow is being pushed back by Aurora’s onslaught, he hasn’t actually tried to attack yet. He’s just observing, taking stock of this unfamiliar attack.</p>
<p><a id="page-42"/>Aurora is strong, make no mistake. She’s powerful enough to give Shadow a decent fight, after all.</p>
<p>But those red spears haven’t so much as touched him yet.</p>
<p>“A swarm of mosquitoes can never take down a lion.”</p>
<p>As Shadow speaks, he blasts away over a thousand slender spikes in a single blow.</p>
<p>The red spears regroup into thick poles and rush at Shadow from all directions.</p>
<p>They hum through the air as they rain down on him with enough force to kill a lion, splitting apart and gnashing at him like fangs.</p>
<p>But they just can’t connect.</p>
<p>Much to the contrary—with each pass, Shadow’s evasions get smoother.</p>
<p>Each time it seems they can’t possibly get any more efficient, they do.</p>
<p>Each moment, Alexia thinks the battle has reached its apex, only for it to be overwritten with an even loftier summit the next.</p>
<p>“Amazing…”</p>
<p>“As always…”</p>
<p>Alexia and Natsume whisper in unison.</p>
<p>The truly strong are able to drive their opponents into a deadlock with defense alone. Alexia’s instructor taught her that once.</p>
<p>This fight is a prime example.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, you stupid witch? Finish him off already!” Nelson screams in a tone tinged with irritation.</p>
<p class="space-break1">But the moment has passed.</p>
<p>Aurora is no longer capable of stopping Shadow.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The fight was decided in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Alexia was only able to make out a fraction of the exchange.</p>
<p>Shadow stepped in, Aurora swung her scythe, and before Alexia knew it, there was blood everywhere.</p>
<p>And the one who’d gone down…was Aurora.</p>
<p>The result was quick and unsatisfying. It was like watching a lion snap a lamb’s neck.</p>
<p>Nobody could tell what Shadow had done or what happened in that final exchange.</p>
<p><a id="page-43"/>That was why it was so disappointing.</p>
<p>The stadium is dead silent, as if that fierce fight never happened.</p>
<p>“Did she…just lose? That’s impossible! She was on the attack!” yelps Nelson.</p>
<p>He probably thought Aurora was the favorite up until the very last moment.</p>
<p>When the tables turn in the space of a single instant, it takes a minute for people to process the situation. Nelson isn’t alone in that. Most of the spectators still aren’t sure they haven’t mistaken the defeated for the victor.</p>
<p>“What just happened? There’s no way Aurora could lose! She’s…!”</p>
<p>Shadow’s ebony long coat flutters behind him as he leaps into the night sky.</p>
<p>“S-stop there! After him! Don’t let him get away!” cries Nelson after returning to his senses.</p>
<p>The confused paladins rouse themselves into motion and scramble after Shadow.</p>
<p>Alexia suddenly realizes she’s been holding her breath. As she exhales, she tries to memorize Shadow’s sword work so as not to forget it.</p>
<p>“His tricks are as astounding as always…” Rose’s voice escapes her like a sigh.</p>
<p>Just as Alexia is about to concur, a blinding light pours into the arena.</p>
