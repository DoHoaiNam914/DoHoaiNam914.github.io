<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter007">Fun Times at the Goddess’s Trial!</a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page-27"/><em>How disagreeable</em>, Alexia silently mutters to herself.</p>
<p>She’s sitting in one of the seats for the special guests, waiting for the opening ceremony of the Goddess’s Trial to begin. The seats in question are occupied by Natsume, Alexia, and Rose. There are a number of other guests behind them, but they’re the main attractions. It’s painfully obvious they’re being used to draw an audience as de facto booth babes, but she can overlook that.</p>
<p>There are two things Alexia finds disagreeable.</p>
<p>The first is Nelson. The acting archbishop is busy pompously greeting everyone in the center of the grounds. When she talked with him earlier about the archbishop’s murder the day before, he obstinately refused to let her look into the incident.</p>
<p>It all started when Nelson spouted some nonsense about the inspection being called off because the subject was dead. Alexia had replied that made the investigation all the more necessary, dumbass, though she’d obviously used more diplomatic language. Nelson insisted she needed to get her request reapproved if she wanted to conduct an inspection.</p>
<p>Even if she hurried, it would take her three days to get back to the capital, at least a week to get approval, and another three days to return to Lindwurm. Who knows how long it would take Nelson to accept her permit once she actually brought it to him? Depending on his mood, he could easily end up making her wait an additional week. It went without saying that after all that time passed, crucial evidence could be lost forever.</p>
<p>That said, Alexia knew she was acting as a representative of her country, so she couldn’t exactly force his hand. Holy Teachings wasn’t just practiced in the kingdom of Midgar but in all the nearby nations, too. If she tried to push the issue, she was liable to receive backlash from their <a id="page-28"/>neighbors, not to mention lose the support of the populace. Religion made for a handy ally, but as a foe, it was an absolute nuisance.</p>
<p>She glares at Acting Archbishop Nelson as he jovially continues giving his address. <em>At least grieve a little, baldy</em>, she silently mutters to herself. The archbishop’s death hasn’t been reported to the public, but still. Oh, and by the way, Nelson is bald.</p>
<p>Alexia sighs, then glances at the woman in her periphery, Natsume or whatever, sitting to her left.</p>
<p>Natsume is the other thing that irks Alexia.</p>
<p>Natsume sits politely beside her, responding to the crowd’s cheers with a broad smile. Her elegant silver hair frames her blue feline eyes and accompanying mole, and her features only serve to enhance her likability.</p>
<p>Thanks to her pearly smile and queenly wave, her lovely appearance, and her graceful conduct, she’s wildly popular.</p>
<p>As Alexia looks at her, she becomes more and more certain there’s something fishy about her.</p>
<p>Maybe Natsume is the kind of genius author who comes around once in a millennium and maybe she isn’t, but the fact of the matter is that Alexia hadn’t so much as heard of her prior to that day. True, Alexia doesn’t have a shred of interest in literature, but as a princess, she does put some effort into knowing who’s who. In other words, Natsume must have only just risen to prominence recently.</p>
<p>For a rookie to have such presence, to conduct herself so well, and to be so popular? <em>That</em> is fishy.</p>
<p>She isn’t jealous! If anything, it’s the kind of hate that arises from being cut from the same cloth.</p>
<p>Alexia knows how to conduct herself flawlessly in front of the public. She lives her life repressing her true self and playing the part of a perfect princess. Most people in positions of power are playing a role in some capacity, but it’s hard to come by someone willing to sacrifice themselves to perform the part to perfection. It’s a safe bet to say that the more an actor sacrifices to pull off the ultimate performance, the darker their underside.</p>
<p>“Thank you all,” Natsume calls out to the crowd. Alexia clicks her tongue.</p>
<p>She finds that soft, ingratiating voice of Natsume’s grating. Her exposed <a id="page-29"/>chest is too calculated as she stoops over to show off her cleavage… <em>Well, aren’t</em> you <em>just the cutest?</em></p>
<p>As she internally bad-mouths Natsume, Alexia waves at the gathered masses with an unchanging smile.</p>
<p>However, the crowd clearly reacted to Natsume better. For a moment, Alexia’s cheek twitches, and she crosses her arms. As she uses them to push up her breasts, she hunches over. Just a little.</p>
<p>The crowd’s cheers grow ever so slightly louder.</p>
<p>Emphasis on ever so slightly.</p>
<p><em>W-well, my neckline isn’t very low, so it’s hardly my fault</em>, Alexia silently reassures herself as she returns to her seat.</p>
<p>She casts a fleeting glance to her right, where Rose is smiling happily. She’s been like that all morning.</p>
<p>Then, just in case, the princess glances to her left.</p>
<p>In that moment, she sees something: the corners of Natsume’s lips curled up in a mocking smirk.</p>
<p>Something inside Alexia snaps.</p>

<p class="space-break0"><em>How disagreeable</em>, Beta silently mutters to herself as she plays the role of Natsume the novelist.</p>
<p>There is just one thing she finds annoying, and it’s sitting to her right: Alexia Midgar. She’s the vermin who used her position as a princess and a friend to get close to Beta’s beloved master.</p>
<p>Everything is fishy about that woman, behaving like a model princess by cajoling the crowd with her sickeningly soft, ingratiating voice and waving at them with that questionable smile. When it comes to women who pretend to be perfect as a matter of habit, it’s generally a safe bet they have a dark underside. There isn’t a doubt in Beta’s mind that her master would never fall for such a wench, but even a one-in-a-million chance is still a chance.</p>
<p>And even if that didn’t end up being a problem, the woman was still a nuisance, one whose presence was most unwelcome in the pages of Beta’s <em>The Chronicles of Master Shadow</em>.</p>
<p><a id="page-30"/>When Beta heard Shadow saved that woman during <em>The Case of the Kidnapped Princess</em>, her blood boiled. It filled her with rage that she hadn’t been the one who’d…er, wait, uh…at the fact that girl had caused so much trouble for her master. Right. It wasn’t jealousy, obviously!</p>
<p>In order to contain her fury, Beta rewrote that section, replacing the role of the victim saved by Shadow with an adorable silver-haired, blue-eyed elf with a beauty mark. She stayed up late at night reading and rereading that section over and over.</p>
<p>But now, the harlot was threatening to barge in on <em>The Chronicles of Master Shadow</em> again. Beta was more powerful, more beautiful, and more devoted to her master, so what did that woman think she was doing butting in? I-it was ridiculous!</p>
<p>As Beta internally spews vitriol at that vulgar princess, she responds to the crowd’s cheers on autopilot.</p>
<p>When she snatches a glance to the side, she sees, of all things, that tawdry princess trying to push up her shoddy chest to curry favor with the masses.</p>
<p>How sickening.</p>
<p>And besides, those things don’t come close to hers in terms of volume. They’re totally average.</p>
<p>Thoroughly pleased at herself for emerging victorious yet again, Beta glances down at her voluminous cleavage and lets out a little snort.</p>
<p>Oops. Did Alexia hear that?</p>
<p>Beta turns away to play dumb, which is exactly when a sharp pain shoots through her right foot.</p>
<p>“Ah…?!” She stifles her yelp and looks down to discover Alexia’s heel being driven into her foot.</p>
<p>As she strains to keep herself from snapping, Beta calmly addresses her.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Princess Alexia, but would you please move your foot?”</p>
<p>Alexia stares fixedly at Beta as she removes her heel, feigning that she only just realized what she was doing. Then, without so much as an apology, she even has the nerve to let out a little laugh.</p>
<p><em>You absolute piece of shiiiit!!</em> Beta is about to scream out loud, but between her devotion to her master and her loyalty to the Shadow Garden, she manages to rein herself in.</p>
<p><a id="page-31"/>Only barely.</p>
<p>A drop of blood trickles from Beta’s lip.</p>
<p>Rose just keeps on happily smiling.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break0">I gaze out vacantly over the Goddess’s Trial from the stands.</p>
<p>It’s the middle of the day, so things have only just gotten started. They’re still giving speeches, introducing the guests, and marching in the parade. The main event, the actual Trial, isn’t slated to start until after sundown.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m just in the bleachers as another face in the crowd. I let out a sigh, looking at the three girls all getting along in the guest box.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I wanna <em>do</em> something.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Specifically, something shadowbrokery. Resigning myself to the role of a normal spectator during an awesome event is killing me.</p>
<p>Like, I should be partaking in that standard trope where I participate in the Trial myself while keeping my identity hidden or something.</p>
<p>You know, the bit where I make some huge display of my powers, and everyone goes, <em>Who</em> is <em>that guy?!</em></p>
<p>If this were a tournament, that would be sweet. Unfortunately, though, everyone only gets one round here, and after some research, I found out it’d be pretty hard to nab a slot while keeping my identity under wraps. I consider barging in by force, but I figure I’d rather save that for something more important.</p>
<p>As I wrestle with one nonstarter of an idea after another, the event gradually proceeds.</p>
<p>Sometimes that’s just how it goes. I couldn’t think of a decent plan yesterday, and it’s not like I was expecting some convenient stroke of genius to strike me on the spot. And even though it sorta feels like I’m giving up, I’ll still be able to enjoy myself in the normie way. This world is <a id="page-32"/>short on big events, so I find myself able to have a surprisingly good time. I even manage to gamble my way into a little pocket money.</p>
<p>Eventually, the sun makes its way down, and the main attraction finally starts. A brilliant light fills the grounds, and ancient letters rise up from the ground in the arena.</p>
<p>Then the letters release a dome of white light. The crowd goes wild.</p>
<p>Once the challenger goes into the dome, the Sanctuary picks out an appropriate opponent, and the battle starts. That’s it. No one in the wings is able to interfere until one side or the other is unable to continue. Apparently, people have even died.</p>
<p>The whole bit about being forced to fight until one party literally can’t anymore makes me reevaluate the merits of playing a background character through this event. There is a real risk that my true strength could be discovered if I enter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the first challenger steps into the dome after the introductions. He’s some sort of tough guy from the Knight Order.</p>
<p>But the dome offers no response.</p>
<p>The man curses as he leaves the arena.</p>
<p>You can’t blame the guy: The entrance fee is one hundred thousand <em>zeni</em>, after all. And apparently, there are over 150 participants this year.</p>
<p>It makes sense in a way. Passing the Goddess’s Trial is supposedly a great honor. You get a commemorative medal, and I hear everyone falls all over themselves going, <em>You beat the Goddess’s Trial? Wow! Here’s a job!</em> to the victor.</p>
<p>As I watch the challengers go up one by one, I find myself wondering just how long it’s gonna be until Alpha’s turn.</p>
<p>The first ancient warrior who shows up to fight is for lucky challenger number fourteen.</p>
<p>Annerose is a traveler from Velgalta, a country that prizes swordplay, and when she enters the dome, the ancient script reacts and begins glowing. The light coalesces into a humanoid shape—a translucent warrior. According to the commentators, he’s Borg, a warrior from ancient times.</p>
<p>The two of them have a fairly ordinary battle, and Annerose secures a fairly ordinary victory. I was pretty pumped up to see what the ancient warriors could do, so I’m bummed at how mundane the fight turns out. Fingers crossed that the next ones will be stronger.</p>
<p><a id="page-33"/>As the event goes on, it dawns on me that I had it wrong. Annerose herself is strong. Eight warriors have been summoned at this point, but she’s the only challenger who’s won so far. When I think about it like that, I realize Borg must’ve been a tough nut, too.</p>
<p>The night wears on, and the pool of remaining challengers is reduced to a mere few.</p>
<p>As I feel the event starting to wind down to its conclusion, I hear the name of the next contestant get called out.</p>
<p>“Our next challenger is from the Midgar Academy for Dark Knights: Cid Kagenou!”</p>
<p>Cid Kagenou? Who’s that? Wait… That’s me!</p>
<p>I’m definitely the only Cid Kagenou who goes to the Midgar Academy for Dark Knights, but…I definitely don’t remember signing up.</p>
<p>“Let’s give our brave contender a warm welcome!”</p>
<p>No! Stop! Pause!</p>
<p>A wave of applause washes over me. Someone even whistles, and excited cheers fill the stadium.</p>
<p>I’m not liking the vibe here. My cheek twitches as I rack my brain.</p>
<p>Given the situation, I have three options.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Option one: I can give up and go fight. If nothing happens, my position as a nobody is safe, but if some superpowerful warrior appears, I’m at risk of having my powers discovered.</p>
<p>Option two: I can make a run for it. I’m just some rando from the Academy for Dark Knights, after all. Nobody knows what I look like, so it would be a breeze. Unfortunately, I’d piss off the Church. If they complain to my school, I might even get expelled.</p>
<p>Option three: I can cause a shitstorm. Looks like this is my only choice.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I erase my presence, dashing at top speed to find a hiding place. Once I’ve made sure I’m alone, I transform into my Shadow guise and leap out into the air.</p>
<p>I’m a fervent believer in the philosophy that there’s no problem you can’t get rid of with an explosion.</p>
<p class="space-break1">And on that note…</p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-34"/><em>Commence Operation: A Mysterious Badass Causes a Shitstorm!</em></p>
<p>As I land atop the domed platform, my long coat flutters behind me.</p>
<p>“My name is Shadow. I lurk in the darkness and hunt down shadows…”</p>
<p>The crowd stirs.</p>
<p>“Ancient memories slumber within the Sanctuary…”</p>
<p>The ancient script reacts and begins forming a humanoid shape.</p>
<p>“And tonight, we shall release them…”</p>
<p>I draw my ebony katana and slice through the night sky.</p>
<p>Over in the guest seats, Beta’s mouth is open impressively wide.</p>
<div class="decoration-rw">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break0">“Shadow!!”</p>
<p>“Shadow?!”</p>
<p>“Mas—?!”</p>
<p>Realizing she’s about to call him Master Shadow, Beta frantically stops herself mid-sentence.</p>
<p>Fortunately for her, everyone else in the guest box has their eyes glued to Shadow, so nobody hears her. Alexia, Rose, and even Acting Archbishop Nelson are visibly shaken at the appearance of a sudden intruder.</p>
<p>As she closes her gaping mouth, Beta begins thinking. This wasn’t part of the plan.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, she realizes something. She knows her beloved master would never take such measures without good cause. There must be some key reason for his actions, and it’s her job as his backup to figure out what it is.</p>
<p>A moment later, Beta is calm and collected again.</p>
<p class="space-break1">What should she do?</p>
<p>What’s the best course?</p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-35"/>“I see. So that’s Shadow,” murmurs Nelson. “I don’t know what he’s trying to do, but the Church’s paladins are stationed all around the arena. You’ve overestimated yourself, fool. We won’t let you escape.”</p>
<p>Nelson gives the order for the paladins to assemble.</p>
<p>These are knights chosen from baptism to protect the Church. Normal knights can’t even begin to compare to their strength. Back when she was a kid, Beta found herself struggling to take one down in the process of saving a “Compatible.” Nowadays, of course, she would never let something so unseemly happen.</p>
<p>“Why is Shadow here…?” mutters Alexia.</p>
<p>“Is <em>he</em> okay? I hope he doesn’t get needlessly caught up in all this…,” says Rose. Keeping one eye on Shadow, she restlessly surveys the area.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the arena is flooded in white.</p>
<p>The ancient letters flash, then coalesce into the shape of a warrior.</p>
<p>Beta puts together the minute description listed in the ancient letters and reads it aloud.</p>
<p>“Aurora the Calamity Witch…”</p>
<p>“Aurora? Impossible…”</p>
<p>Beta’s and Nelson’s voices overlap.</p>
<p>When the light dies down, a woman stands in its place. Her hair is long and black, and her eyes are a vivid shade of violet. She wears a thin black robe, and her dark-purple dress and pale skin are almost translucent. She has an artistic beauty to her, as though she were a sculpture come to life.</p>
<p>“Aurora? Who’s that?” Alexia asks Nelson, deliberately ignoring Beta.</p>
<p>“She’s the Calamity Witch. Long ago, she rained chaos and destruction down on our world.”</p>
<p>“The Calamity Witch… I’ve never heard of her.”</p>
<p>“Neither have I. Miss Natsume, you suggested that you had?” asks Rose.</p>
<p>“Yes, but little more than her name alone,” replies Beta.</p>
<p>Which was the truth.</p>
<p>Aurora the Calamity Witch. Each time Beta finds out more about ancient history, Aurora’s name invariably shows up. Even so, she still has <a id="page-36"/>no idea what kind of chaos Aurora sowed or the destruction she wrought. Other than the mysteries surrounding Diablos, her history is the one the Shadow Garden is putting the most effort into researching.</p>
<p>And now, she’s here in person. This is a massive breakthrough. Beta withdraws her notepad from the gap in her cleavage, then jots down a hasty sketch of Aurora. Then she sketches Shadow squaring off against her. She spends considerably more time on the latter.</p>
<p>“Gathering ideas for your novels?” Rose comments.</p>
<p>“…Something along those lines.”</p>
<p>After scribbling “<em>Master Shadow was just as sublime as always</em>,” Beta snaps her notepad closed.</p>
<p>“If you wouldn’t mind, could you tell me a little more about Aurora?” asks Beta flirtatiously.</p>
<p>Nelson swells with pride. “I can hardly blame you two for your ignorance. In fact, I’m more surprised that Miss Natsume <em>had</em> heard about her. Only a small fraction of people are familiar with Aurora, even among the Church,” he says with a smile. His gaze never leaves the cleavage peeking out from Beta’s blouse. “Still, it looks like we won’t need those paladins after all. Shadow’s luck appears to have run out.”</p>
<p>“Is Aurora really that strong?” asks Rose.</p>
<p>“She’s the most powerful woman in recorded history. She could crush someone like him with one hand tied behind her back. Sadly, though, that’s as much as I can tell you.”</p>
<p>Nelson goes quiet, as if to say <em>See for yourselves</em>.</p>
<p>Beta becomes indignant—there’s no doubt in her mind her lord will emerge victorious, but that’s not to say she’s completely free of worry.</p>
<p>Aurora the Calamity Witch was resilient enough to etch her name in the annals of history. If the battle against this foe tires her master out, the paladins might take advantage of that opportunity and…</p>
<p>It’s unthinkable…but not impossible.</p>
<p>Plus, enough time has passed for Beta to get a dim idea of Shadow’s plan. He mentioned something about releasing ancient memories slumbering in the Sanctuary. He’d taken action to call forth Aurora. There must be some sort of merit in doing so.</p>
<p>If her master has judged Aurora to be the key to all this, then Beta intends to follow his lead.</p>
<p><a id="page-37"/>Beta gently touches the beauty mark on her cheek. That’s the signal that indicates a change in plans. Lurking somewhere in the area, Epsilon has probably picked up on her cue. Even if she hasn’t, Beta is confident Epsilon will act appropriately.</p>
<p>“It’s about to begin.”</p>
<p>Prompted by Nelson, Beta turns her gaze toward the arena. There, she sees Shadow with his ebony katana in hand and Aurora with arms crossed and a relaxed smile. It makes her seem so alive and beautiful, it’s hard to believe Aurora is composed of nothing but distant memories.</p>
<p>“I find it hard to believe Shadow would go down so easily…,” whispers Alexia. Her expression is serious, and she’s watching Shadow closely.</p>
<p>Beta finds herself ever so slightly impressed. At least Alexia isn’t totally blind.</p>
<p>The air in the stadium is tense. The silence is stifling.</p>
<p>Shadow. Aurora. They continue standing there, staring at each other.</p>
<p>Maybe this moment is critical for them. Maybe they’re each trying to get a read on the other.</p>
<p>Finally, with an air of seeming reluctance, the battle begins.</p>

</div>
<p class="space-break0">I haven’t felt this way in a really long time.</p>
<p>As I stand facing the woman with violet eyes, I grin beneath my mask.</p>
<p>She’s smiling, too.</p>
<p class="space-break1">There’s no doubt in my mind that she feels the same as I do.</p>
<p class="space-break1">In my opinion, each battle is a conversation.</p>
<p>A tremor in their sword’s tip, a shift in their gaze, the position of the feet… There’s meaning to be found in all those tiny things, and seeking those meanings and figuring out how best to deal with them are what fights are all about.</p>
<p>It’s no exaggeration to say that the most skilled in combat hold the <a id="page-39"/>power to perceive purpose in the smallest of actions and prepare a superior response.</p>
