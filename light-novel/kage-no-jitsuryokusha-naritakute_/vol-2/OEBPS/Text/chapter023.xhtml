<p class="noindent"><a id="page-151"/>“That Goldy Gilded guy wasn’t no pushover…”</p>
<p>That’s the first thing to leave Quinton’s mouth post-match.</p>
<p>After hearing Annerose’s description of the man, Quinton’s opinion of him had been low.</p>
<p>He hadn’t expected Goldy to be capable of materializing his magic to that extent.</p>
<p>That final attack of Goldy’s had enough power that it wouldn’t have been surprising if he’d advanced to the finals.</p>
<p>“He was definitely more powerful than I thought. If he’d been aiming for the top and actually took on stronger opponents, he could’ve made an outstanding dark knight.”</p>
<p>“So what’d Mundane do at the end there?”</p>
<p>Annerose crosses her arms, sighing. “If I’m not mistaken…he sneezed.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The Golden Dragon must not have been too bright. When he sneezed, he brought his sword down, and Goldy ran right into it.”</p>
<p>“No, that doesn’t make any sense. You’re saying a sneeze beat a dragon?”</p>
<p>“It certainly seems that way. Goldy said Mundane missed a golden opportunity, but maybe Mundane didn’t see it as one. He could have taken Goldy down whenever he wanted. In other words, he didn’t need to seize every opening… Or maybe to Mundane, Goldy was never <em>not</em> defenseless…?”</p>
<p>Just considering this sends shivers down Annerose’s spine.</p>
<p><em>It’s impossible.</em></p>
<p>At the end of the day, it is only a theory… She assumes she must simply be wildly overthinking things.</p>
<p>“This is nonsense.” Quinton scoffs, then aggressively abandons his seat. “But hey, it was my bad for taking you seriously. I ain’t never gonna believe in that kid. Even if he keeps winning, he’s gonna run into me in the prelim finals. I’ll show everyone what a poser he really is.”</p>
<p>Quinton casts one last glare at the Mundane-free arena, then leaves.</p>
<p><a id="page-152"/>Annerose, on the other hand, stays seated and recalls Mundane’s movements.</p>
<p>“Would I be able to pull off the same moves…?”</p>
<p>Still sitting, she cracks her neck and sneezes.</p>
<p>She tries it again and again, each time faster and with fewer wasted movements.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>Crack, achoo, crack-achoo-crack!</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">“A-achoo…”</p>
<p>Then, conscious of the strange looks she’s getting from the people around her, she goes bright red and flees.</p>

<p class="space-break0">The Unbeaten Legend has finally been broken.</p>
<p>News of his defeat spreads among the tournament fanatics like wildfire.</p>
<p>Even though it’s still just the prelims, Goldy the Unbeaten Legend is a dark knight to whom people pay attention. They are astonished to hear he’s lost to some nobody named Mundane, but their shock dwindles when they are told how the fight went down.</p>
<p><em>Oh, sounds like he just won by some fluke.</em></p>
<p>That is more or less how most of the fanatics see it.</p>
<p>However, a few of them—along with some of the people who have actually been watching the match—have doubts about how Mundane is being assessed.</p>
<p>Because of that, they decide to attend Mundane’s matches and judge his strength firsthand.</p>
<p>“What’s this?! Quinton is down!! And he’s not getting back up!! Mundane wins another match with a single blow!!”</p>
<p>The B-Block finals for the preliminary rounds end with Mundane’s victory.</p>
<p><a id="page-153"/>Another one-hit win.</p>
<p>The fanatics can’t figure out what to make of him. That day’s victory qualifies him for the primary rounds, but nobody is quite sure how he’s actually done it.</p>
<p>There’s no way he could have won so many times off pure luck, so he has to have at least some skill.</p>
<p>In fact, his opponent in the prelim finals, Quinton, was a dark knight held in high estimation by the enthusiastic crowd. The fact that Quinton lost to Mundane without being able to put up a fight leaves the fanatics with little choice but to acknowledge Mundane’s strength.</p>
<p>However, because they can’t figure out <em>how</em> he won, they can’t really pin down his true strength.</p>
<p>He’s probably stronger than Quinton, but is he really fit to stand atop the main stage?</p>
<p>He might be strong, but can he really stack up against the historic winners of the Bushin Festival?</p>
<p>Arguments on the topic are heated.</p>
<p>In the end, most people decide he’s probably on the weaker end among the combatants scheduled to appear in the primaries.</p>
<p>Considering his lack of history, that’s to be expected.</p>
<p>Everyone else has earned his or her reputation in tournaments or on the battlefield, but Mundane has no notches in his belt to compare against theirs.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, Mundane has nothing that proves his worth.</p>
<p>So, of course, expectations for him are low.</p>
<p>Still, a couple of the fanatics think he’s a dark horse.</p>
<p>Given the list of contestants this time around, it’s pretty much a guarantee that Iris is going to take the Bushin Festival this year, but if anyone can upset her…it’s probably the miracle boy whose strength is yet unknown.</p>
<p>Such are the expectations being foisted upon Mundane as he leaves the arena.</p>
<p>The primaries start the following week.</p>
<p>Round one is Mundane Mann versus Annerose.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of people expect Annerose to take the match.</p>

<p class="space-break0">As I leave the stage, I think how the older guy I fought today seemed oddly feisty. His name was Qui…something or other. I could literally feel the hostility emanating from him. It was kinda invigorating.</p>
<p>Now I’ve qualified for the primary rounds that start next week.</p>
<p>The crowd’s been pretty unimpressed with me so far, but next week is when I’m gonna show off my true strength, so I need to run through some scenarios in the interim.</p>
<p>As I walk down the long hallway to the players’ entrance and think about my regimen for the coming week, a woman with pale-blue hair steps in front of me. I’m pretty sure she’s named Annerose.</p>
<p>“Can I help you…?”</p>
<p>“I never imagined you’d make it to the primaries. Good work.”</p>
<p>Her firm gaze bores into me.</p>
<p>“It was a foregone conclusion.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh. I see I misjudged your strength, but that’s it. I have one warning for you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…?”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen through your movements. Don’t expect to be able to beat me the same way.” A confident smile crosses Annerose’s face.</p>
<p>“Heh…”</p>
<p>The corner of my mouth curls upward, and I pass by her indifferently, as though to say <em>There’s nothing more to discuss</em>.</p>
<p>I scream internally. <em>Please call after me!</em></p>
<p>“What’s so funny?” Annerose glares at me.</p>
<p><em>You’re the best!</em></p>
<p>I look back over my shoulder and cast a glance at her. “I’ve got a warning for you, too…”</p>
<p>With that, I take off the wristband I’ve been wearing in the hopes that something like this would happen. I toss it at Annerose’s feet.</p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p>The band makes a hefty noise as it crashes to the floor.</p>
<p><a id="page-155"/>“Th-those are… No way. You mean you had all these weights on you when you were fighting…?!”</p>
<p>“These were the chains holding me back… But now, playtime is over…”</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>Thud. Thud. Thud.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">I remove the weights from my other wrist and both ankles, then start walking off again.</p>
<p>“Wh—…? W-wait!”</p>
<p>This time, I don’t stop.</p>
<p>“Wait, I said!”</p>
<p>Annerose frantically rushes in front of me.</p>
<p>“Don’t think this means you’ve won. See, look…”</p>
<p>She cracks her neck.</p>
<p>And for whatever reason, she does it super-fast.</p>
<p>“I can do this, too, you know…”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>Not at all following, I pass by Annerose and her triumphant expression.</p>
<p>I wonder what she was trying to do just now.</p>
