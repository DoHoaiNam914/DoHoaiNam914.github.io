<p>Minnalis did the same, and similar information appeared on hers.</p>
<p>“Also, here is the plate signifying your adventurer rank. Since you are currently F rank, the plate is purple. If you show this at a checkpoint, any entry fees will be waived, so don’t forget to take it with you whenever you leave the city on your quests.”</p>
<p>“Do we need to wear it somewhere visible?”</p>
<p>“No, you simply have to present it when entering and exiting. Since it acts as a status symbol of sorts for experienced adventurers, some people prefer to wear it at all times.”</p>
<p>I could see the sense in that. Speaking as a mild-mannered earthling, I knew there wasn’t a single place in this world you couldn’t expect to get into some sort of brawl. Wearing something to show you could handle yourself was a smart idea. At the very least, it would keep all but the most foolhardy from trying to pick a fight with you.</p>
<p>All the while, the pointless argument beside me was still going. At some point, Zuily’s two friends had come over to back her up. Hansel, finding himself outnumbered three-to-one, was looking in our direction, as if asking for help.</p>
<p>We were about his age and newbie adventurers just like him. Maybe he thought he could buddy up with us. In fact, he definitely thought that.</p>
<p>So when we turned to leave without a single word, he called out to us.</p>
<p>“Hey! You guys agree with me, right?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Uh… About what?”</p>
<p>Inwardly, I was smirking my largest smirk. As always, his stupidity had saved us. Now it wouldn’t be the least bit suspicious if I were to get involved.</p>
<p>“That it’s cheap hacks like these who are bringing down the reputation of the adventuring profession, getting drunk in the wee hours of the morning just because they happened upon a rare monster that’s not even very strong!”</p>
<p>“Huh?! You think I’m gonna let you get away with that, punk?”</p>
<p>“C’mon, Zuily, just let it go…”</p>
<p>Dot moved to restrain his partner, and Terry pointed with his eyes to one of the reception desks. There, a gruff old man watched the fight closely, his eyes half open as he sat in his chair. His muscles weren’t just for show. It was usually retired veterans who took this job.</p>
<p>“Okay, well, I heard a bit of what you were saying earlier. How about this? We were just about to head out on a monster-slaying quest. Why don’t we settle it by seeing who can hunt the most beasts?” I suggested.</p>
<p>That seemed to get their attention.</p>
<p>“You’re never going to settle anything by shouting at each other, so instead of going outside and beating each other up, why not have a true test of an adventurer’s mettle? Whoever wins gets the reward money from all of them. There’s no problem with that, is there?”</p>
<p>I addressed this last part to the receptionist, who answered, “N-no. Private exchange of cash between adventurers is not allowed, but this sort of thing would not technically be against the rules.”</p>
<p><em>Private exchange of cash between adventurers was not allowed.</em> This was a rule put in place to prevent innocent young novices from getting ripped off in precisely this kind of scenario. It wasn’t a crime, but the guild imposed heavy sanctions.</p>
<p>In other words, if they tried to settle things themselves, neither of them would come out on top. It would only sate their own egos.</p>
<p>“<em>Tsk.</em> Well, whatever, we could do with a distraction.”</p>
<p>Zuily glanced over at Hansel before replying. She seemed to have sobered up a little. Even without her partners, there was no way she would lose to this pip-squeak. As she eyed the young mage, it was clear she grasped just how much stronger she was than him.</p>
<p>Still, magic was a powerful art, and even a glancing blow could sometimes be fatal. She would have to be stupid to want to get into a physical altercation with him.</p>
<p>“I have no objections, myself,” replied the boy. “In fact, I welcome the challenge. What shall be our game?”</p>
<p>“Ha, as if F-rank losers get the luxury of choice,” spat Zuily as she tore a flyer off the request board. “Here, this is all they’ve got for the likes of you.”</p>
<p>It was a request to slay goblins. Fifty-four of them, with an additional bonus paid for each one after that.</p>
<p>“You want more, you’re gonna have to raise your rank a bit, ain’t ya?” she said, waving the flyer in his direction.</p>
<p>“<em>Harrumph</em>. I may only be F rank, but I warn you: I’m a talented mage. I’ve mastered the Fire Lance spell. In terms of raw talent, I’m ten times the adventurer you’ll ever be!!”</p>
<p>Zuily’s eyes narrowed a little in suspicion. Fire Lance was quite a difficult incantation to master. It had high power and an MP consumption rate to match, and it was almost impossible to control. Being able to cast it would give him more than enough reason to strut around like he was God’s gift to wizardkind.</p>
<p>…Well, if he could cast it by himself, that is.</p>
<p>I shifted my gaze to the staff in his hand, and I identified it as providing “Fire Magic Support.” It was a good-quality item, too. Its price was probably measured in gold coins.</p>
<p>Apparently Zuily noticed it, too, for her eyes suddenly became filled with greed as deep as a swamp.</p>
<p>I touched the Eight-Eyed Sword of Clarity hanging at my waist and looked at Zuily’s status screen.</p>
<p>“…My, my, what’s this?”</p>
<p>“I see, Master. That explains it.”</p>
<p>Minnalis and I softly conferred while the others were distracted with their own conversation. My partner in crime could see what I could see. And there, in the field for intrinsic abilities, there were the words…</p>
<p><em>…“Nose for Gold”</em></p>
<p>“Well, this should make things interesting.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. So it shall.”</p>
<p>I looked once more at the four, who had somehow started another argument.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Zuily. Dot. Terry. Hansel.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I don’t know how you four became associates and came to stand before me that day. I don’t know, but it no longer matters. And I know it wasn’t only you there, and you were just the leaders of a larger band, but that no longer matters, either.</p>
<p>You weren’t the first people to attack me, and you were far from the last. I don’t remember every single time I got into a scrape, and I didn’t have the luxury of learning the names of every last delinquent who came after me.</p>
<p class="space-break1">So I suppose you all are simply unlucky.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Out of all the people in the crowd that day, you were the four I happened to remember.</p>
<p>Out of all the people in town this morning, you were the four I happened to run into.</p>
<p>Out of all the people in this world, you four happened to cross me.</p>
<p>I know your pain. After all…</p>
<p>Out of all 7.3 billion people on Earth, I happened to be the one summoned to this world.</p>
<p class="space-break1">So I’m afraid that’s all there is to it.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Tough luck.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Ahhh, I can’t wait.” I chuckled, taking no pains to conceal my voice.</p>
<p>This time, the second time, the story you four would go on to weave shall be cut tragically short.</p>
<p>“I can’t wait.”</p>
<p>The only thoughts in my head were about how I was going to make them suffer.</p>
<p class="space-break2">In the end, we agreed upon a nearby forest as the location for the hunt, which would begin the next day, with the winner being whoever could hunt the most goblins by sunset. The one flaw in my brilliant plan was that while I had intended to remain a neutral mediator for this debate, I seemed to have ended up dragged onto Hansel’s side. It was all because he had complained that three against one would be unfair. His opponents, too, agreed they didn’t want to develop a reputation as the team that had to gang up to defeat a helpless newbie. And so, whether I liked it or not, I would be joining the fray.</p>
<p>I had tried suggesting they settle it one-on-one instead, but Hansel had insisted that the other two might still try to help her out. Perhaps I could have continued to argue the point, but by that time, the place was getting a little lively. I didn’t want to attract any more attention than I already had, so I left it at that.</p>
<p>I also didn’t want to make it seem like I had any grudge with the other team. To that end, I stipulated that Minnalis and I be left out of the wager, though our kills would still count toward victory. In other words, should Zuily’s team win, they would only get the reward money for the goblins Hansel killed. Conversely, should our team win, Hansel would get the other party’s entire bounty to himself. That way, Minnalis and I technically had no stake in the outcome. Dot and Terry were a little hesitant that this unfairly favored the boy, but they shut their mouths when I pointed out we were the ones getting wrapped up in their mess. After all, we were a couple of newbie adventurers who supposedly had never even met before today. Our opponents, meanwhile, were an experienced party who had been working together for many years.</p>
<p>In return, we agreed Hansel should pay up for all three of us, regardless of how much work he actually did. That way, if Zuily’s team won, we wouldn’t be able to cheat them out of their money by claiming it was all Minnalis and me.</p>
<p>While all this was going on, Zuily herself was not really contributing to the conversation, her eyes flitting instead to Hansel’s staff and Minnalis.</p>
<p>They were the muddy eyes of greed, no doubt. She was not a hard woman to read. She was probably thinking about what sort of price Minnalis would fetch as a slave. I usually didn’t like when people subjected Minnalis to their degrading gaze, but Zuily’s greed was so pure and obvious I almost couldn’t help laughing.</p>
<p>After that, we had parted ways and arranged to meet up at the guild the next day. Zuily’s party simply turned in the Oral Rabbit and left. They seemed not to have the slightest interest in what we got up to in the meantime, saying they were probably going to go get drunk someplace else.</p>
<p>“Well, we should probably get going, too,” I announced. “We’ve got a lot to mull over before tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master.”</p>
<p>“Ah, hold on, could I speak to you for one second?”</p>
<p>Just as we were about to leave, Hansel stopped us. To be honest, I just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. The contest was tomorrow, and for the moment, my involvement was still an <em>accident</em>. I couldn’t allow this opportunity to pass me by. There was precious little time, and I still had a lot of thinking to do if I was going to come up with the best way of killing them.</p>
<p>“I wanted to apologize for getting you two mixed up in all that. But I knew I could count on you. After all, we’re the same, you and I. I was hoping we might talk things over before tomorrow, perhaps over breakfast? My treat.”</p>
<p>It was difficult to hide the emotions welling up inside me. He disgusted me. He was getting on my nerves, even though it was clear he didn’t mean it. I sensed no ill will from him, and yet I wondered if he was hiding something. What did he mean, we’re the same?</p>
<p>Then I realized. He probably thought I was a noble just like him.</p>
<p><em>Then he feels like he has an affinity with us. Or rather, with me.</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t as if it were rare for adventurers to own slaves, but for a greenhorn like myself? There weren’t many other possibilities. Besides an adventurer, who else but a noble was rich enough to buy slaves? The son of a wealthy merchant, perhaps, but that was about it.</p>
<p>I smiled and shrugged my shoulders. “Sorry, we’ve already eaten. And don’t worry about it. People like us should stick together.”</p>
<p>There was a limit to how well I could keep up appearances, and I was already falling apart.</p>
<p>“I see. Well, in that case, should we emerge victorious tomorrow, supper shall be on me,” he offered, before returning to the reception desk to finish his registration. We watched him speak to the receptionist lady, then turned and left the building.</p>
<p>After leaving, I took a deep sigh to cool myself off. Then I brought up a subject totally unrelated to the matter of torturing and killing at hand.</p>
<p>“I never realized people would assume I was a noble just because I’m a beginner adventurer with a slave, but I suppose it makes sense,” I theorized.</p>
<p>I had intentionally not taken pains to hide Minnalis’s Slave Brand, hoping to mitigate the inevitable wave of suitors who would otherwise approach her. It appeared there was a side effect in doing so that I had not completely anticipated.</p>
<p>“Shall we obscure it, Master? I think most people have already seen it by now, though…”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think we have to do that. It’s not the most inconvenient thing in the world if people think I’m a noble. In fact, it’d be more annoying if we tried to hide it and people found out.”</p>
<p>I pondered the issue for a while, and then continued.</p>
<p>“If people think you’re not a slave, we’ll have to deal with the riffraff flocking to you. Adventurers in particular. They won’t care about how you’re a beastfolk or a demihuman or whatnot. And with how pretty you are, they’ll come in droves.”</p>
<p>“…There you go, exaggerating again, Master. I’m not that pretty.”</p>
<p>Minnalis remained expressionless, apparently unconvinced. Perhaps she was blushing on the inside? It was hard to tell if she was using that skill of hers or not. On the off chance she really didn’t realize how beautiful she was and the effect she could have on others, I decided to make it clear.</p>
<p>“No, you are that gorgeous, without a doubt. As far as I’m concerned, you’re the sweetest thing on this Earth. Ask any man off the street and they’ll agree.”</p>
<p>“…Huh.”</p>
<p>Even that didn’t seem to induce the slightest bit of emotion.</p>
<p>Though I had only meant it as a simple statement of fact, I still felt a little flustered at having said that out loud and quickly got back to the point.</p>
<p>“I’m just saying I don’t want to have to deal with every random guy who figures they might have a chance with you. I’m not going to go around killing them all, either. Besides…”</p>
<p>“…Yes?”</p>
<p>“Any piece of shit who tries to steal you away knowing you’re my slave will make for a fine guinea pig to test our torture methods on. After all, those goblins couldn’t talk back, so how could we know how effective it was?”</p>
<p>I had decided not to get any innocent bystanders involved in my vengeance. I had many reasons, but mainly I didn’t think my heart could take it. And I didn’t think I could ever face Leticia again if I did. It would be like throwing everything she had given me into the trash.</p>
<p>So I avoided killing people unrelated to my revenge.</p>
<p>…But that presupposes that they were, in fact, a person.</p>
<p>Someone who disregards all dignity and acts only on base impulses isn’t worthy of being considered a person. They’re a monster.</p>
<p>Someone to not only be slaughtered but made into useful materials.</p>
<p>“…Haah, so we ended up going there after all.”</p>
<p>My train of thought somehow returned to the issue of getting the most effective and satisfying vengeance. Was it all I could think about?</p>
<p>Well, that’s okay. Even if it is…that’s all I am now. A being of revenge.</p>

<p class="space-break">“All right.”</p>
<p>After stocking up on medicines and poisons, we grabbed some lunch in town and headed back to the inn. Once in our room, we placed them all inside our bag and began our discussion in preparation for the next day. Taking the Eight-Eyed Sword of Clarity from my hip, I channeled a little mana into it to review all the data I’d collected in my travels.</p>
<p>There I found the status screens of Zuily and her party.</p>
