<p>“Can we eat together, Soriy?”</p>
<p>“I must decline, Miss. I am but a simple maid, and it would not befit my position to dine with the mistress’s younger sister,” she said, bowing her head.</p>
<p>Soriy was Eumis’s retainer, and she had a lot of other work to do while looking after me. She had also grown up with my sister, and the two were old friends. I admit I was a little envious of the dashing figure she struck with her deep purple hair tied up at the back, her strikingly sharp features, and the womanly charm she seemed to exude from every one of her pores. As for me, my ancestral elven blood seemed to run strong, and though I was already fourteen years of age, my body was barely more developed than a child’s. I would have liked to at least have a little of her bust. And height.</p>
<p>“The chef has adjusted the seasoning. Is it to your liking, Miss?”</p>
<p>“It’s very nice. So much so, I feel guilty eating it alone.”</p>
<p>“I see. I will pass on your compliments to the chef.”</p>
<p>After I had finished my dessert and put the somewhat formal meal behind me, I called Soriy back to my room to take away my empty plates.</p>
<p>“Um… Do you have the…?”</p>
<p>“Ah, your new stuffed toy. Wait here just a second.”</p>
<p>Soriy left the room and came back with a large doll of a bear monster.</p>
<p>“I hope I bought the right one.”</p>
<p>“…Thank you.”</p>
<p>It had patchwork fur of yellow and red, a zipper mouth, and two brown buttons for eyes. It was very cute. I took the bear and cuddled it in my arms. The expensive cloth and cotton felt so soft against my skin.</p>
<p>“We shall wait outside. If you have need of anything, simply call.” Then, as always, she added, “Now, excuse me, Miss Shuria,” and left the room as neatly as a ballerina.</p>
<p>I stroked and nuzzled the new toy and rolled around with it on the bed to my heart’s content. Then I placed it alongside all the others.</p>
<p>“I’ll put you here. You’re my new favorite,” I cooed, placing the bear by the pillow of my enormous bed.</p>
<p>“…Now, time to begin,” I said aloud, clenching my fists. It was time for my daily workout routine.</p>
<p>I was just a simple village girl, unsuited to the life of an aristocrat. Particularly the extravagant meals. If I wasn’t careful, I was sure I would swell up like a balloon in no time at all. Even more so because I had to stay in this room all the time. Physical activity also helped me combat the stress and lack of exercise caused by staying indoors. However, for some reason, I didn’t seem to put on a single ounce of muscle. Was this due to my elf blood, too? Not that I would wish for a six-pack or anything.</p>
<p>After my morning sweat, I hopped into my en suite shower to freshen up. There were no such luxuries in the village; instead, we bathed in the river during the day while the water was still warm. I was going to be spoiled rotten here. I was never going to be able to go back. But it felt so good…</p>
<p>“…Ahhh, that was nice.”</p>
<p>“My, Shuria, you’re indecent.”</p>
<p>“E-Eumis?!”</p>
<p>When I got out of the bath, my sister was sitting in my favorite seat by the window. A smile passed across her noble features, and her dark green hair, like fresh leaves, glittered in the sun filtering in through the window. I, on the other hand, was dressed only in a bath towel.</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry,” I squealed, pulling on my clothes.</p>
<p>“Oh, you don’t need to rush on my account. I must have come at the wrong time, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“Th-that’s not true, Eumis, I know you’re always so busy…”</p>
<p>I made myself decent and sat down across from her.</p>
<p>“I bought some delicious cakes today, and I thought we might share them. Also, I brought you your letter.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much!”</p>
<p>I took the letter and its attached voice playback device with care, and I placed them on my desk. As much as I wanted to listen to it right away, Eumis deserved my full attention while she was here.</p>
<p>“This will be the final letter,” she said. “Very soon the ritual will be complete, and you will be able to talk to your family directly.”</p>
<p>“These letters have been a blessing. Thank you so much!”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it. You must have been lonely these past three years. Besides, it was my grandmother who invented the voice playback device. Using a few a month for personal matters is no big deal.”</p>
<p>She gave another charming smile. No matter how many times I saw it, it always fascinated me.</p>
<p>“Well then, shall we dive in? The tea will get cold.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please!”</p>
<p>I had a relaxing drink with Eumis. My sister was always busy, so we didn’t spend much time together, but she occasionally came to visit me in my room when she could.</p>
<p>It had only been three years since we met, but already my sister meant the world to me. She was kind and gentle, and I respected her very much.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Three years ago, I learned that Eumis was my big sister. I was born and raised in a village surrounded by trees at the foot of a mountain northeast of Elmia. There, it was just the three of us: my mother, my little sister, and me. We had no father, and mother never once spoke of him. Still, we never went hungry, due to the magic granted to me by my elven blood.</p>
<p>My mother told me she was descended from elves, and perhaps this explained my golden hair, my pale skin, my slow growth, and my pointy ears. I also possessed an intrinsic ability, “Scarlet Eyes,” that allowed me to see raw mana. It came in very handy when casting spells.</p>
<p>My village was founded by old adventurers, and there was no discrimination against demihumans there. We weren’t rich, but we lived in harmony, and I was able to make a little money by working as an adventurer.</p>
<p>We didn’t have much, but we were happy.</p>
<p>But those times didn’t last forever.</p>
<p>My sister Shelmie fell ill. It wasn’t fatal, but it left her in great pain, and we could not afford the cure. I worked hard so I could save up the money to buy it, but the price was still far out of our reach. I was even thinking about selling myself off, when Eumis came to our village.</p>
<p>She told me my mother had once been a maid at the Elmia mansion and that I was born of the master’s affair. It was when she was pregnant with Shelmie that the master’s wife found out, and he was forced to pay my mother off and send her away. With a young me in tow, she eventually ended up in this village.</p>
<p>That made Eumis our half sister. She came to our village because of the magic power I possessed. Using a special technique, she could transfer my magical ability to herself. I would lose the ability to cast magic, but in return, we were offered enough money to afford the cure for Shelmie and live the rest of our lives without hardship.</p>
<p>I jumped at the offer without a second thought. It was a little sad I couldn’t use magic anymore, but it was a small price to pay to allow the three of us to live happily together once more. I watched my sister drink the potion and be cured, and then I was taken to the Elmia estate.</p>
<p>I was told the ritual had a lot of rules. I had to be confined to a single room of the mansion and was told I could not make contact with any other blood relatives besides Eumis, which meant I was unable to see my family.</p>
<p>I was lonely, but Eumis looked after me. She allowed them to send me letters using her voice playback device, since neither my mother nor sister could write, and she even spent time with me and brought me fancy cakes like today. She helped me learn to read and asked Soriy to bring me my favorite toys and novels to help combat the boredom.</p>
<p>She was always kept busy acting in the master’s place and researching magic items at the academy. Despite that, she made sure to visit me whenever she could. It wasn’t long before I began to think of her as my real elder sister.</p>
<p>Once the ritual was complete, my mother and Shelmie would be brought to live in the city with me. As for the master, he was currently living with his wife in the capital, leaving Eumis to take over his duties, so it was safe for us to live here, and I would be allowed to visit the mansion whenever I liked.</p>
<p>Her gentle smile always put my heart at ease, and I was eternally grateful for all she had done for me.</p>
<p>Very soon, I would be able to meet my family again. There were things I couldn’t tell by voice alone. How much had Shelmie grown? Unlike me, the elf blood was not very prominent in her. She might even be taller than me now. I couldn’t wait to try my mother’s freshly baked ricolle pies again. I’m sure Eumis would love them, too. The four of us could enjoy tea and cakes together.</p>
<p>Ahhh, I’m the luckiest girl in the world.</p>
<p>My life was happy. Every day was the same, but they were filled with joy.</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden, a strange ghost appeared in the room.</p>
<p>No, not a ghost…a spirit.</p>

<p class="space-break">“<em>Phew.</em> The grand chamberlain sure likes to work us to the bone.”</p>
<p>“That he does.”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t let her catch you saying that or we’ll all be in trouble!”</p>
<p>““We knooow!””</p>
<p>The three maids chatted as they tossed their bags of household waste into the large container outside.</p>
<p><em>I’ll be letting myself in, if you don’t mind.</em></p>
<p>While they were distracted, I entered the mansion through the back door. Normally, I could pass through walls while in this ghostly state, but the walls of the Elmia mansion were fortified with powerful wards that blocked me. The Mystic Blade of Soulfire transformed me into a being of pure mana, so that physical defenses were pretty much… No, scratch that, they were entirely useless, but there was very little I could do against magical defenses, so this was the easiest way for me to enter the mansion.</p>
<p>When I did, I detected Eumis’s special intruder-detecting wards. If I triggered them, Eumis would know I was here immediately, and it would summon half a dozen golems to capture and restrain me.</p>
<p>However, I already knew about her wards and how they worked from the first time, and so I knew that in this form, I had nothing to worry about from even the greatest of the mansion’s security measures. The only things that could possibly detect me while I was invisible and incorporeal were the extremely advanced skill “Mind’s Eye” and the intrinsic ability Scarlet Eyes.</p>
<p>But I knew she didn’t have Mind’s Eye yet, because I was the one who’d taught her it.</p>
<p><em>Come to think of it, this is the first time I’ve actually been here.</em></p>
<p>Expensive furnishings lined the corridors, and the carpets beneath my ghostly feet looked soft, even though I couldn’t feel them in this form.</p>
<p><em>Now, where should I begin?</em></p>
<p>I was here to find out the best way to make Eumis suffer. I already knew she wanted to invent a new magic item that would secure a place for her name on the stone monument of Elmia. In fact, she was obsessed with the idea. Her eyes, filled with madness when she thought about that dream, were now seared into my memory.</p>
<p>However, I never understood why it was so important to her. It had been a dream of hers since she was very young, sure. But on that day, I saw in her eyes something more. There was a practical reason behind her wish, I was sure of it. My primary goal here was to find out what that was, and if I could uncover a weakness or two of hers while I was at it, so much the better.</p>
<p>If all I wanted was to tear her limb from limb, I could do that whenever I liked.</p>
<p><em>I guess I’ll look for a study or something.</em></p>
<p>If Eumis’s secrets were anywhere, they would be there. If I could find an old diary or something similar, I might learn something about her unfathomable desire.</p>
<p>It was normal for such rooms to be on the upper floors, near the center of the building, so that’s where I headed. The mansion was enormous, hardly surprising considering it was the home of a lord’s daughter.</p>
<p>As I passed a maid on the staircase, she suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>“Hmm? What was that…?”</p>
<p>She turned back in my direction, her body tense. She seemed to be in her twenties, her deep violet hair tied up in a ponytail, and she peered back in my direction, confused.</p>
<p><em>Grh…did she notice me?!</em></p>
