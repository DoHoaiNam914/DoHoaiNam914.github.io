<p>She lay down once more, and I began straightening out her disheveled hair. I didn’t want to let the feeling of a single strand slip through my fingers, even if it meant I had to heighten my senses to combat level. Even I realized how oddly I was acting. It was totally uncharacteristic of me, and I knew I’d only look back in shame afterward. When did I become like this?</p>
<p>“Mmm… Whaa… Kaitooo…”</p>
<p>But all those thoughts faded away when Leticia called my name.</p>
<p>“Leticia.”</p>
<p>“Mm… Mmrh? Wh-what are you doing?!”</p>
<p>Before I could stop myself, I had kissed her hair. Once she realized what I had just done, her face flushed, and she became giddy with happiness.</p>
<p><em>…Why the heck is she so darn cute?</em></p>
<p>“It’s not fair! You’re too adorable!” I claimed.</p>
<p>“Hey, no! Uuu!”</p>
<p>I could hold myself back no longer, and I hugged her with all my might.</p>
<p>We were happy. I wanted to stay like this forever. For the first time ever since coming to this world, I wanted this moment to last.</p>
<p>“Kaito, you oaf! You complete and utter fool!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m a fool, all right. You’re the one who said I should be nice to you.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe how content I was. I never thought being in love would make me this way.</p>
<p>“Mrh… That’s <em>too</em> nice,” said Leticia. “If you keep this up, you might forget how to hold back when we’re in public.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… That would be bad.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it would! I can’t have you acting like this when I go to your world and meet your parents! It would be too embarrassing!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and Mai would say something like ‘You animal, Kaito!’ …Oh god, I don’t think I would ever live it down…”</p>
<p>I could just see my sister fuming at me.</p>
<p>Actually, it’s been two years since then. Perhaps she’s changed. I have no idea what happened after I left. I guess they most likely assumed I’d run away from home. I really wish I could say sorry to them. To Mom and Dad, and to Mai, too.</p>
<p>“…Someone loves his sister a little too much!”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha, jealous?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>We glared into each other’s eyes. Then after a short while, neither of us could stand it any longer, and we fell about laughing.</p>
<p>I wanted to go back home; I always did. But today, for once, I felt glad I was summoned here.</p>
<p>And anyway, it would still be some time before I could figure out how to take her with me.</p>
<p>I was a different man now. I had grown strong as a hero.</p>
<p><em>So it doesn’t matter. In this world or in mine. We’ll always be…</em></p>
<p>“Leticia…”</p>
<p>“Mm…”</p>
<p>I found myself drawn toward her and planted my lips on hers.</p>
<p><em>“Raorl!”</em></p>
<p>““Wh-wha?! Ah!””</p>
<p>A sudden bark made us fly apart in shock. A single garm was looking at us. It was about puppy-size—though if it were fully grown it would be much larger than a dog—and it had a distinctive crescent-shaped white marking on the fur of its neck.</p>
<p>“Hey, why do you do this every time…?”</p>
<p><em>“G-grrrrr…”</em></p>
<p>Leticia and I both wore the same flabbergasted, red-faced expression, though it was hard to say whether it was embarrassment at being seen or anger at being interrupted.</p>
<p><em>“Hawoo?”</em> The garm pup gave a confused howl and, as usual, I found myself unable to say any more.</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ. Here, this is what you’re after, isn’t it?”</p>
<p><em>“Rawr! <img alt="image" class="inline2" src="../Images/music.jpg"/>”</em></p>
<p>I took some monster meat from my sack and tossed it over. The garm pup began chewing at it happily.</p>
<p>“I don’t know when you got so used to shaking us down all the time.”</p>
<p>This was all because I decided on a whim to give it some of our spare food that one time. It was just so shaky. It looked starved. Now, every time we’re here, it comes back for more.</p>
<p>“There, there. Hungry boy. Make sure you eat it all and grow up big and strong,” cooed Leticia, petting the garm on the head.</p>
<p>“I thought you were supposed to be sulking.”</p>
<p>“What’s this? Jealous much?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, so take care of me, too.”</p>
<p>“My, what a hopeless fool you are. Mn.”</p>
<p>We kissed again.</p>
<p>Those days were like a dream. Those days where all we did was repeat tired old phrases to each other. They were the best days of my life.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“…Ghah… Hah…”</p>
<p>Shoot. I only meant to rest a while beneath this tree, but I fell asleep. The remains of my sweet escape from reality drifted around me, making the world before me taste all the more bitter in comparison.</p>
<p>How did it all end up like this? I hugged my own injured body tightly and pressed on into the dark woods.</p>
<p>After my fight with Leticia, I had returned only to be ambushed by my allies. I barely escaped with my life. And it wasn’t just my friends who were after me. All the soldiers and adventurers I had brought with me for the final battle had turned on me as well. Some mad demon of war must have taken control of them all, exploiting our exhaustion in the conflict’s aftermath. It was the only explanation.</p>
<p>“Grr… Dammit!”</p>
<p>With the wounds on my heart and my skin still fresh, I advanced unsteadily into the black depths of the forest. Eventually I came upon the ruined remains of that church, and the field where I went with Leticia all that time ago.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha… I said I would rescue her, but I killed her, with my own hands. I’m such an irredeemable bastard.”</p>
<p>I never wanted to fight her. I knew there was no other way. But knowing that and accepting it were two different things.</p>
<p>And so I lingered in the scent of days gone by. Even though I knew there was no going back. Even though I still had a promise to fulfill.</p>
<p>Oh, how wretched and pitiable I must have seemed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I sensed an approaching monster.</p>
<p>“Heh. How did it get so close before I noticed? I must really be losing it.”</p>
<p>I turned to spot a small garm standing in the bushes.</p>
<p>“That neck marking… You’re the one from back then…”</p>
<p><em>“Ruff!”</em></p>
<p>Some time had passed, and the pup had grown up. Now it was even larger than a regular garm.</p>
<p>“…Your leg’s hurt. Guess the guys chasing me must have gotten hold of you.”</p>
<p>The wound had clearly been made by a blade. This was no turf war with another monster.</p>
<p>“Let’s find shelter, and I’ll patch you up.”</p>
<p>The garm looked in pain, so I scooped it up and took it inside the ruined church. It wasn’t exactly pleasant, but it was better than staying out in the freezing rain.</p>
<p>“Sorry about this. Usually, it wouldn’t take me so long to heal one wound…”</p>
<p>I had lost my pack during the battle, and with it, all my expensive items. All I had left now were basic potions.</p>
<p><em>“Haoo…”</em></p>
<p>I grabbed one at random, poured it onto the wounds, and made some bandages by cutting up my underclothes with a knife. Monsters were tough. It wouldn’t succumb to an injury like this.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha, you’re all beat up. Just like me…”</p>
<p><em>“Gwar.”</em></p>
<p>I softly stroked the garm’s head, and it offered no resistance.</p>
<p>“Now, you rest here for the night. I’ll bet that wound will be gone by morning.”</p>
<p>Once I left the forest, my friends would follow me and leave this place alone. The pup seemed quite tired, and as I gently stroked its head, it soon began to breathe softly.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I wanted nothing more than to lay my head down and rest, too, but one of the soul blades I had used in the battle made it so I couldn’t sleep for another two days.</p>
<p>I would leave this place for now. Perhaps one day, I could return and sit down once more beneath that tree where Leticia and I had kissed.</p>
<p>The moon peeked through the clouds. The rain had stopped, and I was bathed in moonlight.</p>
<p>Though I was still terribly injured, I felt like the memory of those days had eased my pain a little, but the smell of the flowers and the colors of their petals were the same as they ever were, and a single tear rolled down my cheek.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>“Flame Multilance!”</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">“Wh-what?!”</p>
<p>In a second, <em>it all went up in flames.</em> A hail of fiery spears flew in and laid waste to that peaceful place. The inferno engulfed the field, licking at the beautiful flowers like the tongues of a million red snakes. All I could hear was a crackle. All I could smell was the scent of burning plants, and all I could see was a world of crimson and orange death.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?! I told you to kill him in one hit!!”</p>
<p>“We’re up against that monster; I’m taking no chances!”</p>
<p>An army of adventurers stepped out of the forest. There were four of them at the head of the group.</p>
<p>Their names were Zuily, Dot, Terry, and Hansel.</p>
<p>“Well, we have little choice now. Surround him and kill him!” shouted the leader, Zuily.</p>
<p>“Where do you think you’re going? You may seem like a monster, but you’re a human just like us! If we just keep pounding you with spells, you’ll die soon enough!”</p>
<p>“Kh?!”</p>
<p>Normally I could shrug off magic like this even if I was buck naked, but the fight with Leticia had worn me down, and bit by bit, their incantations were damaging me.</p>
<p>Their fire magic was just as I had taught them. Total coverage, leaving no escape.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be hard for me to fight back, but I might end up killing them, or at the very least, leave them with wounds from which they’d never recover.</p>
<p>Once more, a wave of flames washed across the field.</p>
<p>“Stop! Come back to your senses!”</p>
<p>This was the place was where I’d made so many memories!</p>
<p>It was the symbol of my happiness!</p>
<p>“Don’t burn it… Please… Leave this place alone!”</p>
<p>But my words, too, were engulfed by the blaze.</p>
<p>“Hey, no slacking. Keep the fires going.”</p>
<p>“I get it, I get it, Zuily. I <em>am</em> a former noble, you know. I’ve no objections to defeating an evil hero who’s turned against humanity. Spears of flame, heed my call. <em>Fire Lance</em>!”</p>
<p>With a roar, the magic spears flew across the land, reducing all those beautiful flowers to ash.</p>
<p>Fire. It was everywhere. It was all burning.</p>
<p>The one thing Leticia left for me. The only treasure I had remaining. It was being taken from me.</p>
<p>Why? Why was this happening?</p>
<p>“Ghr! Stop! Stop it!!” I begged and pleaded too many times to count.</p>
<p>“Dot, Terry, don’t let up on the oil! If we can take down the evil hero, we’ll be famous!”</p>
<p>“Roger, boss!”</p>
<p>“Hmph. Leave it to me.”</p>
<p>The helpless flowers were trampled underfoot. Just like my memories of that day.</p>
<p>“You lot, too! We’ll be rich if we can pull this job off! Put your backs into it!”</p>
<p>“““Yeah!!”””</p>
<p>At Zuily’s order, the magical artillery ramped up their assault.</p>
<p>One stray fireball descended upon the ruined church.</p>
<p>“No… No!!”</p>
<p><em>That’s where the garm pup is sleeping…!!</em></p>
<p>I leaped into the air to shield the building from the reckless spell. If it collapsed, the garm would have no time to escape before it was crushed to death.</p>
<p>But my action only made things worse.</p>
<p>“Now! <em>Flame Bullet!</em>”</p>
<p>Spotting his chance, Hansel took aim and unleashed a fast-moving spell. However, in his haste, he neglected to aim properly, and the fireball rushed toward the church.</p>
<p>I was still off-balance from blocking the first. There was no way I could stop a second.</p>
<p>I could do nothing but watch as the projectile flew uninterrupted into the stone building, blasting it to rubble.</p>
<p>“Ahhh… Aahhh… Aaaahhh…”</p>
<p>The fiery fragments fell to earth before my eyes, and what remained of the ruined church crumbled to the ground.</p>
<p>That was all I was looking at.</p>
<p><em>It hurts. It hurts.</em> My heart screamed, and strength left me.</p>
<p>I couldn’t even raise my arms to protect my face as hundreds of spells tore into me from all angles. The inferno razed that place to the ground along with my happy memories.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The flowers we laughed among were burning.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The tree we sat against as we played with the garm was ablaze.</p>
<p class="space-break1">And now, before my eyes, that garm was crushed beneath the church, our special place.</p>
<p>“Looking good. Now let’s finish him o—”</p>
<p class="space-break1">“RrraaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAARRRGGHH!!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">Before I could even register what I was doing, I had flattened everyone who stood near me.</p>
<p>“Hrrh…hrrh…hrrh…hrrh…”</p>
<p>Soon nothing remained but the scorched earth, littered with fallen adventurers, and the smoldering rubble that was once a church.</p>
<p>“Haah…gh…haah…haah…”</p>
<p>I dragged my body over to the pile of stones and frantically began pulling them aside. I knew what I was going to find, but I didn’t stop digging. I couldn’t.</p>
<p>“Haah…aahhh…aaagh…gh…grh…rgh… I’m sorry… I’m so sorry…”</p>
<p>And just as I knew I would, I dug up the poor thing’s <em>remains</em>.</p>
<p>I cradled its body in my arms. It was cold, so cold that the hot tears falling down my cheeks felt like lies.</p>
<p>“…Argh. Goddammit, you bastards… I knew it…”</p>
<p>That’s right. That was, this is, a dream of the past. My mind was replaying over and over all the pain I’d suffered. Taunting me with this nightmare that was reality.</p>
<p>“Dammit… I get it… I get it already…”</p>
<p>That’s right. This was my truth. Not a dream. My memories of those days. Just as those happy days were like sweet nectar to me, so too was I constantly reminded of life’s bitter taste, like needles in my mouth.</p>
<p>“Life is a cruel joke. That’s all it’s ever been…”</p>
<p>A little later, I found out my friends weren’t being controlled after all.</p>
<p>What’s done is done. You can’t undo it any more than you can unbreak an egg or unspill water.</p>
<p>Even if the world was rewound, things could never go back to the way they were.</p>
