<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>rgh, dammit, how did things turn out like this? Today was finally going to be the day I showed those good-for-nothing adventurers my true power, too.</p>
<p>“Haah…haah… Dammit! Why’d we run into Redcaps <em>here</em>?!”</p>
<p>“Crap, they keep moving around! Can’t land a good hit!”</p>
<p>“Huh. It has been a while since an enemy last dodged my arrows.”</p>
<p><em>…Huh, these guys are stronger than I imagined</em>, I thought as I fended off the Redcaps.</p>
<p>The Adventurers Guild had forced me to join Zuily’s party for three months as punishment for starting that fight. They didn’t give us much choice in the matter. If I refused to work with them, the guild would reject my application, and Zuily’s party faced even greater penalties.</p>
<p>If they didn’t accept me onto their team and treat me fairly and justly, they would face heavy fines and instant demotion, plus a block on ranking up again for a fixed period. The same if I died or became seriously injured through no fault of my own, though in that case there would be no fine.</p>
<p>I was also prohibited from leaving Zuily’s party and taking on requests by myself, and if I fled the town, I’d be banned from the guild for six months.</p>
<p>I was supposed to take the adventuring world by storm! Instead I ended up with a ball and chain around my leg.</p>
<p>And so I had no choice but to get myself comfortable with my new provisional teammates. To start ourselves off, we picked up a quest to slay goblins, something every new adventurer goes through, yet somewhere we ended up in this monster-infested forest, fighting enemies that were never supposed to show up here.</p>
<p>“Daaaaagh?!”</p>
<p>“Keh-keh!!”</p>
<p>Lost in thought, I allowed one of the monsters to get the drop on me. The Redcap’s machete only barely scratched my arm, but the cut burned with intense pain. However, I didn’t have time to worry about that.</p>
<p>“Grrr, stay back!!” I growled, swinging my staff.</p>
<p>““Keh-keh-keh!””</p>
<p>The two Redcaps slowly drew toward me.</p>
<p>“Keh-keh!!”</p>
<p>“Wha—?!”</p>
<p><em>I wasn’t looking behind me!</em></p>
<p>Distracted by the two in front, I didn’t notice the one sneaking up behind until it was too late.</p>
<p><em>Is this it? No, I can’t die. I don’t want to die. Somebody, save me!</em></p>
<p>“What the hell are you doin’?”</p>
<p>“Gaaaahh!!”</p>
<p>Just before the Redcap’s blade reached me, Zuily appeared and sliced the monster in half.</p>
<p>“Haah…haah…haah…”</p>
<p>“Calm down. We can’t have you dyin’ on us.”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah…”</p>
<p>…She saved me. A mongrel of lesser blood saved me. And yet, it was relief I felt, not shame. But I didn’t have time to wallow in that feeling, for next Terry hobbled one of the Redcaps with an arrow.</p>
<p>“Geh-geh?!”</p>
<p>“Now!!” he cried.</p>
<p>“Got it,” I replied, turning to the spell I had cast so many times before. “O ball of raging flame: <em>Fireball!</em>”</p>
<p>“Plergh!!”</p>
<p>The ball of fire leaped from the tip of my staff and engulfed the Redcap in fire.</p>
<p>“<em>Phew.</em> Hey, you’re pretty good, kid,” remarked Dot. “Even takin’ that staff o’ yours into account. And here I thought it was the one doing all the work.”</p>
<p>“An’ I thought you’d flub your lines trying to cast that spell,” admitted Zuily. “Guess you’re not as much of a fraidy-cat as you look.”</p>
<p>“H-hmph! Obviously! Don’t you know who I am?”</p>
<p>“Enough messing about! They’re not all dead yet!”</p>
<p>“Got it!!”</p>
<p>The fight went on. It felt nothing like training alone at home. I felt alive.</p>
<p><em>Hmph. Well, at least they won’t be dragging me down for the next three months.</em></p>
<p>It didn’t take us long to finish off the rest of the Redcaps.</p>
<p class="space-break2">At the beginning, I saw it as a chore. I wished I’d had the sense to cut that argument off before the guild saw fit to intervene.</p>
<p><em>“Why do we have to babysit? How are we supposed to steal that staff now?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Well, ain’t no goin’ against the guild. What’s done is done.”</em></p>
<p><em>“We just have to wait a few months. Besides, he could be useful if he drops the attitude. We don’t have a magic-user in our party, after all.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Heh. Doubt a posh twat like him has the guts to keep up with us, anyway.”</em></p>
<p>That conversation was only yesterday.</p>
<p>We’d gone to slay goblins as a warm-up, but I didn’t expect to be ambushed by Redcaps.</p>
<p>“Haah…haah… Dammit! Why’d we run into Redcaps <em>here</em>?!”</p>
<p>My words were filled with frustration. Sure enough, the kid was useless. Just swinging his staff helplessly. But if he died, there’s no way we could patch things over with the guild. We’d be penalized for sure.</p>
<p>That’s the only reason I jumped in to save him when I saw the Redcap creeping up behind him.</p>
<p><em>Rrrgh. This sucks. I hate brats who are all talk.</em></p>
<p>Or so I thought until that moment. Even though he had been on the verge of death, he weaved together his spell perfectly and burned the next Redcap to death.</p>
<p>I was actually impressed, a little. Most people would mess up in a situation like that. And even with his staff helping, he wasn’t just barely getting the spell out. He was confident and in control of the magic. In the fight after that, I got to see a little more of his talent.</p>
<p><em>…I guess I should at least ask his name once the battle is over</em>, I thought, and I continued fighting until all the Redcaps were dead.</p>

<p class="space-break">After the three months were over, I ended up staying on as a member of Zuily’s party. They taught me many things: how to fight monsters, how to avoid danger, how to manipulate people to your advantage, how to force the girl you like to screw you, things of that nature.</p>
<p>They may not have been cut from the same cloth as I, but perhaps when I became a lord, well, maybe I could take them on as my retainers.</p>
<p>I continued journeying with them, and before I knew it, two years had passed. We had dealt with countless requests, and we were now a B-rank party—considered among the best in our field.</p>
<p>We were in the closing moves of the war against the demons: tracking down the demon who called himself the hero. According to our intel, after the hero slew the demon lord, he was tempted by her power and turned over to the side of darkness. With the armies of the world exhausted in battle against the demon lord, the nations put out a collective bounty on the hero’s head.</p>
<p><em>Well, the turning to the dark side thing is probably just a front. I imagine he’s simply outlived his usefulness. Still, we can hardly pass this opportunity up.</em></p>
<p>The ignorant masses probably believed the words of the nations, but I was different. In any case, whether it was true or not hardly mattered. If I could be the one to slay the hero, they’d make me a lord for sure. Perhaps the kingdom would even grant me the hand of the Beauty of Orollea, Princess Alicia. It would just be for show, sure, but it’s all the same to me.</p>
<p>While those thoughts preoccupied my mind, I was almost taken by surprise as a garm leaped out of the bushes toward me.</p>
<p>“Grrrrrrrr!! Ruff!”</p>
<p>“Whoops, that was close. <em>Wind Cutter!</em>”</p>
<p>A single garm was no match for me now. I sidestepped its claws and let loose a blade of air.</p>
<p>“Gyau…?! Grrr… Ruf…”</p>
<p>“<em>Tsk.</em> Got away. It’s just a garm, but it’s in a demon’s territory…”</p>
<p>I definitely hit it, but the garm still scurried away into the trees. I had no time to chase after it.</p>
<p>“Hansel! We’ve figured out where the hero is hiding! Prepare to begin our assault!”</p>
<p>“Hmm! Got it!”</p>
<p>I tried to still my racing heart. I was finally here. The praise and recognition I was promised was waiting for me just ahead. All I had to do was slay the evil hero. He would be very weak by now.</p>
<p>“I wonder what I should do when I become king…,” I pondered aloud, smiling as I made my way alone through the forest.</p>
