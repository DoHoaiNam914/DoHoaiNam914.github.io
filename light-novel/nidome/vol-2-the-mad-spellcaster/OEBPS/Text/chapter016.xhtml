<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you lived your life until the very end, blissfully unaware you were being deceived until the moment you died, would that not be a happy existence?</p>
<p class="space-break1">It sounds lovely to me. A fairy-tale ending. Because dead people know not what the future brings.</p>
<p>So… So?</p>
<p class="space-break1">Is that really what I want?</p>
<p class="space-break1">Because I feel content, even though I can’t have that anymore. I’m glad I know I was betrayed. Even if it means I had to fall through the cracks in the earth and drink of the black mires of hell.</p>
<p class="space-break1">…Ahhh, I suppose there’s simply no rhyme or reason to it. It’s just the way it is.</p>
<p class="space-break1">To be human or monster. To be sane or insane.</p>
<p>Even now, the fragments of my broken heart still urge me on.</p>
<p class="space-break1">My happiness was lost, my life was unfair, my dignity was robbed, and I was thrust into the pits of despair.</p>
<p class="space-break1">But I still have time. Time to laugh at the world, holding my mishmash of a heart in my hands.</p>
<p class="space-break3">…Even if that is the path of evil.</p>
<p class="space-break3">It was ten days after we exacted revenge upon Zuily’s party. In the first week, we stopped at Golet, and as usual, we spent the time sitting around, eating Minnalis’s cooking, discussing torture methods, and honing our skill proficiencies.</p>
<p>I was worried we might arouse suspicion leaving town immediately after Zuily’s party failed to show up. The guild shared information between its branches using magic items, so in order to appear natural, I had dropped in on the guild as normal and informed them I was leaving for Elmia.</p>
<p>Now we were in the large forest that stretched between our target city and the town of Golet. The distance between the two locations was not far, and we were already past the halfway point. We were camped only a day or two from our destination when it happened.</p>
<p>“Master, wake up.”</p>
<p>“Hmrh…? Are we being attacked?”</p>
<p>My eyes shot open, and adrenaline surged through my body when I heard her words. It was a little before dawn, and the sky was just starting to brighten. It would not be long before the sun made its first appearance on the horizon.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so, but I can hear the sounds of combat not far from here. They might make their way here soon; we should at least hide.”</p>
<p>She must have been channeling magic into her ears to use the “Enhanced Hearing” skill. Her rabbit ears were pricked up and twitching. As a human, I wasn’t able to learn Enhanced Hearing, but I could still make out the faint sound of metal clashing against metal far off in the distance.</p>
<p>“It’s coming from farther up the road.” I sighed. “Usually we’d just be able to ignore it.”</p>
<p>I wanted to avoid getting involved in unrelated quarrels and stirring up the wrath of God as much as possible, but unfortunately, this time I couldn’t. It wasn’t clear how far away the fighting was, but it was undoubtably in front of us, toward the city of Elmia. In order to determine whether we should ignore it or intervene, first we would have to see what the situation was. I’d already learned the hard way that going in without enough information could be fatal.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master.”</p>
<p>Packing up the campsite into our sack as quickly as we could, we made our way carefully toward the source of the sound, with me getting ready to draw my soul blades at any moment. Minnalis, too, placed her hand on the sword at her belt and recast her illusion.</p>
<p>Incidentally, she was on her eighth sword of the mass-produced ones we had bought at the capital. The seventh had taken us through the dungeon, but it only lasted a few more monsters after that before it needed to be laid to rest.</p>
<p>“…Adventurers and…bandits, I think?”</p>
<p>It appeared to be a fight between two groups of people. A bunch of shabbily dressed men were surrounding a horse and carriage. Defending it was a group of adventurers.</p>
<p>Adventurers on an escort mission being ambushed by bandits. Not much else to say about it, really.</p>
<p>“Hmm, looks like the hired hands are going to lose.”</p>
<p>They were holding out well so far against a force twice their size, but it was clear their luck would soon run out.</p>
<p>“That settles it,” I announced.</p>
<p>“Indeed, Master.”</p>
<p>We nodded at each other and disappeared into the right-hand side of the forest before being spotted. We could have just as easily walked straight through, but who knew what that might lead to? As for stepping in and supporting either side, well, that was entirely out of the question. I couldn’t care less if the adventurers or the bandits won. I would gain nothing by helping either of them. So we circled around through the forest, forging a path through the gaps in the trees. I was still feeling a little irritated that my sleep had been disturbed.</p>
<p>Then something happened that made me wish I’d gone left instead.</p>
<p><em>“Brooouuuuaaaaahhhhh!”</em></p>
<p>“J-just my luck…!”</p>
<p>“Well, if we were lucky, we wouldn’t be here, Master.”</p>
<p>What appeared was a monster resembling a large, bipedal pig. Orcs were far taller than their goblin brethren, standing about as tall as a human, but with physical strength far superior to any man.</p>
<p>However, this one was clearly not your everyday orc, for it was almost twice that height, with dark reddish-black skin that could shrug off all but the hardiest physical blows.</p>
<p>…It was a variant orc known as a Black Orc, or Big Orc, to give its common name.</p>
<p><em>“Bruuuooah!”</em></p>
