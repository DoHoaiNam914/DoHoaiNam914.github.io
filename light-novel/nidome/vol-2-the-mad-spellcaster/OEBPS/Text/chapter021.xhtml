<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">“M</span>iss Shuria, I’ve brought your breakfast.”</p>
<p>“…Thank you.”</p>
<p>At the knock and voice at the door, I placed a bookmark in my novel and closed it. The sun outside signaled that it was long past time for breakfast, but I’d been too engrossed by this story to put it down.</p>
<p>The volume I had just started reading was a romance novel, a passionate tale of forbidden love between a fey-blood earl and his slave girl, and of overcoming all the obstacles that stood between them. It seemed to be quite popular among the women of the city, and already I couldn’t wait to see how it ended.</p>
<p>The, um…suggestive scenes were a bit too much, though, so I only skimmed over them…</p>
<p>“Breakfast is muroux steak, potota potage, and salad made with narna greens. For dessert, I have prepared frozen kolin, which I will bring to you later.”</p>
<p>I got up from my chair in the corner of the room and sat at the dining table. Soriy was a maid working at the mansion, and she’d been looking after me over the last three years since I came to this city.</p>
<p>She rarely spoke more than necessary and never overstepped her boundaries as a maid. She was always inscrutable, courteous, and kind.</p>
