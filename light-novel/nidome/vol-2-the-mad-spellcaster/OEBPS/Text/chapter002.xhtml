<p>But it wasn’t just a dream. It was also a memory. A memory of a demon lord and of her hero.</p>

<p class="space-break">I could hear the sounds of calling birds. The sun’s light rained down on me, as if trying to make me forget this violent world, instead blanketing me in its warmth.</p>
<p>“Hey. Shouldn’t our places be swapped?” I asked.</p>
<p>A sudden breeze filled my nostrils with the soft aroma of flowers and sent lightly colored petals scattering through the air. Somewhere mixed in alongside them was the sweet smell of her hair.</p>
<p>We were in a beautiful field beside an abandoned church hidden deep within the forest. Verdant ivy bursting with life scaled the crumbling walls, shocking in their vigor. I was resting beneath a single tree, my legs extended before me, with Leticia’s head on my lap.</p>
<p>“Hmm? What? I won today, so you have to be nice to me. That means you have to do everything I say!”</p>
<p>Her voice was like the soothing sound of a small bell.</p>
<p>“But aren’t I also nice to you when I win? Oh well, fine by me either way.”</p>
<p>“I don’t recall asking you to stop stroking! Gently! Put some love into it, for crying out loud!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah.”</p>
<p>“Mhm! Hm-hm-hm!”</p>
<p>As I pretended to be fed up, I gently stroked her soft, silky hair. She didn’t need to tell me to be gentle. It all came naturally. With a smile on her face, she nuzzled her head against my lap.</p>
<p>“Coochie-coo!”</p>
<p>“Hey, cut that out! It tickles! What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee… Just wanted to see how you’d react. Think nothing of it. Coochie-coo!”</p>
<p>Oh god. She’d turned into an idiot.</p>
<p>And yet I couldn’t find it within myself to be annoyed. I could only think of how cute she was. How precious she was to me.</p>
<p>“I’ll get you back for that!” I warned.</p>
<p>“Hey! Wh-whoooah! K-Kaito! Didn’t I say you have to be nice to me? I’ll not stand for this insubordination!”</p>
<p>I squeezed her in my arms, giving her a noogie. She kicked and flailed, but she seemed to enjoy it.</p>
<p>“Hnyah!”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>The noise she made was so cute, I wondered if I might have been too rough. Wriggling herself free and sitting up straight, Leticia started pounding on me with her fists.</p>
<p>“You’re messing up my hair!” she cried.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha, sorry. Come on, lie back down.”</p>
<p>“Hmmrh… Okay, but you’d better be gentle this time.”</p>
<p>“Gotcha. I’ll be as gentle as a mouse.”</p>
