<p>Eumis Elmia.</p>
<p>As evidenced by her name, she was the daughter of the lord of the city of Elmia. She was an aristocrat, a magical researcher, and a proficient user in her own right. She had been a valuable member of the team on our quest to vanquish the demon lord.</p>
<p>“I just thought you might have trouble against the Black Orc because you two are sword-users and not mages…,” she said. “Oh, I’m simply making excuses. It’s my fault for not making sure I understood the situation.”</p>
<p>“Ah, no worries,” I replied. “There were some aspects of the situation that were out of our control, too.”</p>
<p>What I wanted to shout was, “<em>You’re damn right! How dare you snatch our kill, you piece of shit!</em>” but I resisted and swallowed my anger behind a fake smile.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the time for revenge yet. Unlike with the princess, I knew exactly what was going on here. There was no need to rush.</p>
<p>“Pardon me for asking,” she began, “but how on earth did you do all this to a Black Orc without magic? I mean…”</p>
<p>Minnalis and I were dressed in the beginner adventurers’ gear we’d bought in the capital, covered in black robes. I’d bought them because I thought we might stand out otherwise; two lone adventurers traveling together without even hiring a carriage, dressed in clothes the townsfolk might wear. However, it was obvious at a glance that they were nothing impressive. Certainly not capable of allowing us to fell the Black Orc.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, well…”</p>
<p>“Is it perhaps something to do with that strange sword you wield?” she asked. “Oh, where are my manners? It isn’t proper to ask an adventurer about their abilities.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, it may look strange, but this is just a normal sword. The Black Orc had already been weakened when we encountered it. We were finding it hard to deal any damage, so we were hoping to tire it out.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see… I do not know who would chase a Black Orc all the way here. Seeing as its attacker is no longer around, perhaps the monster got the better of them…?”</p>
<p>Eumis made a thinking gesture, a slightly sad expression on her face, before shaking her head.</p>
<p>“In any case, it doesn’t change the fact that I stole your target. I’ll let you have all its materials. In fact, I have a favor to ask… Could you let me have the monster’s body?”</p>
<p>“You want its body?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll pay you for it. How does five gold pieces sound? I have a class 2 magic bag, too, so I’ll take care of transporting it.”</p>
<p>Magic bags were specially designed for holding magic items. Depending on their strength, they were given a ranking. The very best were special class, below that were first class, and it went all the way to class 10. A class 2 magic bag had a capacity about the size of a studio apartment and could be shrunk down to a twentieth that size.</p>
<p>No magic bag could hold an unlimited number of items like the Squirrel’s Blade of Holding could, but in return, they didn’t use MP. Unlike the Squirrel’s Blade, though, the magic could only reduce the weight and size instead of eliminating it entirely. This meant it would still get heavier the more items you put in it. The opening grew to allow you to put large items inside, but cramming them in was still pretty inconvenient, since unlike our bag, it wouldn’t automatically suck the items in once it got near them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the more random stuff you accumulated, the harder it was to pick out the one you needed when you wanted it. And finally, of course, they could get quite expensive if you wanted a high-class one.</p>
<p>Most veteran adventurers carried them around, but the best an intermediate adventurer could hope to buy if they wanted to splurge for something that would last them their whole life was a class 5 bag.</p>
<p>With my riches, I could have easily picked up a class 4 bag for Minnalis and me while we were in the capital, but even taking the 5 percent MP cap reduction into account, our method of storage was clearly superior. I could grab throwing knives simply by sticking my hand in the opening and wishing for them, without having to waste precious time rummaging around inside; no matter how much I put in it, its weight never changed; and there was no limit on the number of things I could store. I didn’t feel the need to spend upward of ten gold pieces on a magic bag that was inferior in almost every way.</p>
<p>“Wow, a class 2 magic bag. That’s impressive. Oh, and don’t worry about the price at all. It just kind of fell into our laps, and we don’t have any way of transporting it ourselves. I have no idea what a Black Orc is worth, either. I’m just happy to sell it to a pretty lady like you,” I joked, in a way that, even if it was obviously an act, didn’t seem unnatural. However, I immediately regretted it.</p>
<p>Even if I didn’t mean them, those words of flattery tasted like rotten fruit in my mouth, a concoction of bitterness and acidity that made me want to throw up. I was suddenly gripped by an overwhelming urge to smash my face into that of the Black Orc before my expression faltered, but that would definitely give cause for alarm, so I refrained.</p>
<p>“Tee-hee, it’s a little above market price that I’m offering. You may confirm later in town if you so wish.”</p>
<p>If she were really trying to scam us, she would at least show a hint of emotion while doing it, but as always, she showed not the slightest amount of interest in other people.</p>
<p>“You may call me Eumis. Perhaps our paths shall cross again, should you call upon the Halls of Learning at Elmia.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps they shall.”</p>
<p>“Well, then. I shall now take my leave. I was on my way to collect pipewort. Assemble forthwith: <em>Create Golem</em>.”</p>
<p>Eumis cast her incantation, whereupon sand, rocks, and boulders rose out of the ground and took form, resulting in two tough-looking stone figures. Eumis handed them the bag, and they started loading the still-smoking carcass of the Black Orc inside.</p>
<p>“One, two… Here you go: five gold pieces.”</p>
<p>Eumis counted out five coins and placed them in my hand. Then she bowed, and set off down the road, leaving the golems to finish their work. We headed in the opposite direction, toward the city. Once she was out of sight, Minnalis relaxed her Iron Mask skill.</p>
<p>“Well, that was a surprise,” she said. “I didn’t think we’d be meeting her so soon.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I really wasn’t prepared for that,” I replied.</p>
<p>“Perhaps you should have been practicing Iron Mask. I don’t think she realized anything, but I didn’t like the shade your face turned when you flattered that woman… Like when you called her pretty.”</p>
<p>I didn’t quite catch what Minnalis muttered at the end, but seeing the unpleasant expression on her face, I thought it wise not to make her repeat herself.</p>
<p>“I don’t need that skill. It’ll only make us <em>more</em> suspicious if both of us are completely stone-faced whenever we meet anyone new. I may not be able to find it in myself to be overly cordial, but about this level, I can handle.”</p>
<p>“If you say so, Master. If that’s the case, shall I try to force a grin next time as well? It might well ruin my entire day, though.”</p>
<p>“Join the club. Maybe we can go out somewhere as a reward. Or we could just both go to bed and sulk if you prefer.”</p>
<p>“Both go to bed and sulk…? That sounds quite nice, actually.”</p>
<p>“Oh? You into that sort of thing, Minnalis?”</p>
<p>I had thought her quite the productive type. She didn’t seem like one for lazing around in bed doing nothing.</p>
<p>“Well… I mean…if that’s what you want to do, Master…”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Whatever, let’s go for the first option today. We’ll treat ourselves to a nice inn in town. That’s not too strange considering we’ve just been on a long journey, and we can go out for food instead of making you cook.”</p>
<p>“Actually, I’d prefer to prepare our meal myself. It helps me clear my mind.”</p>
<p>“Mmm…but I’m always making you do that, Minnalis. I think you should take a break. We can probably borrow a kitchen, but I think we might as well let others handle the grub while we’re in town.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay; I love to cook. Besides, I don’t like my cooking to be compared to that of others. Or are you saying you’re not satisfied with the food I make?”</p>
<p>“…Minnalis, you can be very cunning sometimes.”</p>
<p>“Oh, were you not aware, Master? Women are made of such tricks.” She smiled, exuding a little of the erotic charm she usually only displayed while drunk.</p>
<p>“Well, there’s a fine line between being cunning and being dishonest,” I said. “Make sure it doesn’t get to your head. You don’t want to turn into someone like that.”</p>
<p>Minnalis’s face fell, and her eyes smoldered with black, hate-filled flames. She was thinking about Lucia, one of her sworn enemies. I had seen her myself when the Holy Sword of Retribution had forced me to view her memories.</p>
<p>“Well, in any case, no. I’m very satisfied with your food, Minnalis. It’s delicious.”</p>
<p>“Ah…when you say it like that, it’s a little embarrassing,” she replied, her face suddenly losing all emotion.</p>
<p>“Do you really have to use your Iron Mask skill?” I asked. “Look, it’s just, I don’t know, maybe you could learn something. I just think it’s worth eating out once in a while when all you do is cook all the time.”</p>
<p>“I…suppose that’s true. I <em>have</em> been finding my repertoire somewhat lacking as of late. If I steal all the things you like, then <em>I</em> can be the one to make them from now on.”</p>
<p>“R-right, yeah. That sounds…good?”</p>
<p>I seemed to have stoked the fires of her culinary heart rather more than I’d anticipated. As we continued on toward Elmia, I swore I felt something unfathomable lurking behind that expressionless mask of hers.</p>
<p>Then I realized something.</p>
<p>“You know, we haven’t even eaten yet.”</p>
<p>“So we haven’t. I’m also feeling a little worn out from that fight. How about we stop for breakfast?”</p>
<p>Minnalis’s breakfast that morning was rather more extravagant than usual, and we broke out the expensive eggs.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Haah…haah…haah…”</p>
<p>I ran through the dark forest, between thick trunks and through overgrown bushes. My HP was fine, but getting out of that trap had cost me nearly all of my MP.</p>
<p>“Grh!!”</p>
<p>I felt a powerful spell. My magical detection field alerted me to the incoming attack, and I launched myself sideways. Not a second later, a green lightning bolt struck the ground where I had stood. There was a loud, dull sound, like something heavy being dropped from a very high place, and the poor tree the lightning struck exploded into blackened wooden shards.</p>
<p>Such power. It had to be her. It was restrained so that given my current Resistance stat, it wouldn’t kill me, but instead leave me immobile and barely alive. She always was the best at tuning her spells.</p>
<p>“Dammit!!”</p>
<p>With my MP as low as it was, there was no way I could activate the perfect defense of the Aegis Blade of Shielding. There were still spells I could cast, but not while I was running around trying to dodge.</p>
<p>“There’s only one thing for it…”</p>
<p>Just as I made up my mind, I entered a healthy-looking clearing. I paused to get my soul blades in order.</p>
<p>“Oh dear, are we already finished playing tag?” came a voice.</p>
<p>“Eumis…”</p>
<p>There she was, Eumis Elmia. Wearing the same gentle smile and the same green robe. My old friend. And now, my enemy.</p>
<p>“Surrender now, and I will make your death painless. We’ve always gotten on well, and unlike the princess, I harbor no particular disdain for you. Don’t worry, I’m quite adept at ending a specimen’s life without causing harm.”</p>
<p>Her usual smile was now devoid of all traces of the affection it had once held. An innocent light, almost like madness, filled her eyes. It was plain to see she wouldn’t feel a shred of guilt over killing me.</p>
<p>A battle was unavoidable. Somewhere in my heart, I hoped we might still be able to talk things out, but the look in her eyes crushed those dreams. She wasn’t staring at a person. To her, I was merely a thing, materials to be harvested.</p>
<p>“Why?! Why are you trying to kill me?!”</p>
<p>It was hardly worth asking the question. I already knew she didn’t see me as human. They were empty words I just had to ask. Even now, I still didn’t want to believe it.</p>
<p>“Why? I’ve already told you, many times. You are possessed of great power, enough now to defeat a Dungeon Guardian by yourself, and even hold your own against the demon lord. With you as an ingredient, I could create the ultimate magic item, my life’s crowning work! At last, my name will be engraved into the statue at Elmia… No, the honor bestowed upon me will be even greater! This will take my fame within Elmia to new heights!”</p>
<p>Her eyes were wide and starry.</p>
<p>“But you’re already famous! Why do you need more notoriety?”</p>
<p>“It’s not enough. From traveling with you, I’ve developed a reputation as a spellcaster, that’s true. But only artificers who create powerful magical items have their names carved on the monument. It’s been my dream since I was a little girl, but I cannot do it as I am now.”</p>
<p>Eumis looked dejected, before she suddenly perked up with hope and looked at me.</p>
<p>“That’s why you have to let me kill you! Oh, I’m looking forward to it so much!”</p>
<p>Her eyes glittered. Her long-held dream was finally within reach. That I had to die to achieve it didn’t weigh on her mind at all.</p>
<p>“You…you would betray me for <em>that</em>?!”</p>
<p>“It may not seem like much to you, but I could wish for nothing greater. It’s like how, to us, the demon lord was a blight upon the land, but to you, she wasn’t. See?”</p>
<p>She adopted the tone one might use when dealing with an uncooperative child. There was no doubt in her mind that her actions were justified. She went on, spewing words that sounded plain evil.</p>
<p>“It’s all over for you, anyway. The kingdom is no longer your ally, and so any hope of returning to your world is gone. Why don’t you just give up?”</p>
<p>“Shut up, I’ll find a way back, if it’s the last thing I do.”</p>
<p>“You sure are a stubborn man. There is no such way.”</p>
<p>She smiled another innocent smile, tinged with venom.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Your dream is <em>broken</em>. There is nothing left for you but to become the ingredient to mine.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Rgh…! Eumiiiiiis!!”</p>
<p>I could bear it no longer. Whatever part of me still hoped we could be friends shattered. There was no more room for negotiation. I couldn’t even allow her to go on living. She was my enemy, pure and simple. Somehow, I always knew it would end like this.</p>
<p><em>“Wind Slice: Cross Slash!”</em></p>
<p>I drew the Weasel’s Blade of Wind, a green katana streaked with red, and delivered a pair of cross-shaped slices. Invisible blades of wind rushed toward Eumis, but it was child’s play for her to avoid such an obvious attack.</p>
<p><em>“Phlogiston Blast!”</em></p>
<p>Eumis cast her spell without even reciting the full chant, and a tremendous explosion obliterated those blades before they even got close. Her spell used water magic to generate water, wind magic to electrolyze it into hydrogen and oxygen, and fire magic to detonate it. It was I who taught her the theory, and we had worked on the spell together. Clouds of dust filled my vision. I knew Eumis would rely on a method like this to consume the least amount of mana possible.</p>
<p>“Darkness, take form: <em>Illusory Figure!</em>”</p>
<p>Speaking the magic words, I drew my other soul blade, the Husk Blade of Shadows. Five figures who looked exactly like me leaped out of the dust, cloaked in mana. They were so perfect, even Eumis couldn’t tell them apart at a glance.</p>
<p>“Gr… <em>Pincushion!!</em>”</p>
<p>Three of the figures rushed toward Eumis, who unleashed a cone-shaped blast of tiny stone spears. One near the back managed to block the spears with his sword, but the other two were not so lucky. One was skewered through the chest, the other in the elbow, before both reverted to shadows and disappeared.</p>
<p>“So they disappear when I hit anywhere except the sword? You must really be running out of MP if these are the best illusions you can produce.”</p>
<p>Eumis fired another lightning bolt, and a searing green light burned my eyes. I jumped aside, but she was aiming for the tree behind me. I was unable to avoid the explosion of wooden shards, and my final clone vanished, leaving only the true form standing some distance away.</p>
<p><em>“Lava Prison.”</em></p>
<p>“Grh!!”</p>
<p>A magic circle appeared around me, and magma burst up out of the ground, surrounding me in a cage-like lattice of stone.</p>
<p>“Now, the game of hide-and-seek is over.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, it is.”</p>
<p>“That cage will burn you to death. I wouldn’t want you to sustain too much damage, so could you hold still while I finish you off? It’ll be a far more pleasant death than the alternative.” She grinned. Now I had no choice but to accept it. This was Eumis’s true nature. She didn’t change after we defeated Leticia. She was always like this, deep down. Why hadn’t I realized it sooner? I had spent over two years by her side.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just her. The princess and all my other party members were the same. Why did I never get to know them? Every day since I killed Leticia, I asked myself the same questions.</p>
<p>How had I missed it?</p>
<p>If only I had noticed earlier.</p>
<p>How many times had those thoughts run through my mind? Too many to count.</p>
<p>“Any last words? I can grant you a final request,” offered Eumis. I was standing solemn, silent, and still, the face of resignation.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing more I have to say to the likes of you,” I replied. “But… There is one thing… I suppose I have to apologize to her one more time. After all she’s done for me, here she is saving me again.”</p>
<p>“What are— Wh-what?! What’s that light?! <em>Lightn—</em>”</p>
<p>“See you, psycho.”</p>
<p>With those parting words, I activated my teleportation stone and disappeared without a trace.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break">The location I teleported to was beyond a vast mountain range. The rain was pouring, soaking my clothes and chilling my body. With no time to waste, I found a nearby cave and, after checking it was free of monsters, dispelled the illusions I had cast on myself.</p>
<p>“Ugh, oh god…”</p>
<p>I looked down at myself. The illusions had done a good job of hiding the damage. Deep wounds covered my body, and my equipment was smeared with blood. There were gashes all across my skin, and in some places, the cuts had bitten deeply into the flesh.</p>
<p>“It’s a good thing I didn’t call her an idiot, because if <em>she’s</em> an idiot then I don’t want to know what that makes me…” A wry smile crossed my lips.</p>
<p>It was thought that once you ran out of MP, you could no longer cast magic, but that wasn’t quite true. If you could withstand the massive pain that ensued, it could certainly be done.</p>
<p>The price had to be paid somehow. If you had no MP, then the cost came out of your HP instead, and consequently you incurred intense pain and grievous injuries.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>“I was a prodigy, you know. As a child, the power of my magic was beyond compare, but I always used too much MP and ended up hurting myself.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Ha-ha-ha, yeah, I can see that. You’re such a scatterbrain, Leticia.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Hrm…? Why do you find that so funny, Kaito?”</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">“Even after she’s gone, I’m still racking up debts with her.”</p>
<p>If we had never played that game of cards, wagering embarrassing stories from our childhoods, I might not have been able to escape this time.</p>
<p>I took an HP and MP potion from my pack. I sprinkled the HP potion over my wounds, while the MP potion I downed in a single gulp. With the small amount of MP the potion restored, I used my soul blade to light a fire with some fuel stones from my pack. They were smokeless and burned longer than wood. As I sat by the fire, I sought to escape my weary thoughts.</p>
<p>“I wonder how many times I have to apologize for calling her a scatterbrain.”</p>
<p>I imagined her sulking face, and a gentle smile rose to my lips.</p>
<p>“…I wish I could see you again. It’s rough being alone, Leticia.”</p>
<p>There was a time I thought my dreams could come true. That I’d return to my world with Leticia by my side. My family would be so surprised. I didn’t know what they thought of me now, but I knew they would lose their shit when they saw her. How would Mai react when she heard I’d gotten into a relationship? We’d always been such close siblings; if I suddenly disappeared and returned with a girlfriend, I bet she wouldn’t speak to me for months.</p>
<p>Suehiko and Kenta would weep bitter tears at the sight of me with such a pretty girl. Yuuto was always flirting with his girlfriend, so he wouldn’t. Those two lovebirds were definitely still together, and he’d probably congratulate me for ending up like him.</p>
<p>It would be a lot of work, for sure. But with Leticia and her beautiful smile, anything was possible.</p>
<p>If only this were the dream, and the dream were reality instead. Just as Eumis said, it was all impossible now.</p>
<p>As I surrounded myself in those feeble thoughts, the sky outside gradually darkened, and as my eyes closed, I realized I was dreaming of my old memories again, and soon I would wake.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Good morning, Master, it’s time to get up.”</p>
<p>“…Urgh… Five more minutes, please…,” I moaned, the exact same thing I had said in the town of Golet.</p>
<p>I had just had the worst dream ever. It must have been because I ran into her yesterday. I demanded a redo.</p>
<p>It was only the second time around that I learned the importance of beds. Duvets stuffed with the warmest monster down, pillows of magical cotton, sheets woven from the magic silkworm’s silk, and mattresses made from a fantastical plant known as the springytree.</p>
<p>I never knew happiness could be found in nothing more than a comfortable sleep. I had always been vigilant, and never rested in inns when I could avoid it. My bedding was always the hard roots of trees, my pillow the cold ground, with little more than a filthy rag for cover. My magical barrier was always alerting me to intruders, too, and I could never enjoy a proper, deep sleep. Of course, we still keep our guards up while sleeping, but at least we have comfy beds, and the threat I face isn’t anywhere near as dangerous as it was before.</p>
<p>The beds in Golet were a lucky find, but these ones were a level above. Which was why I was so annoyed such a terrible dream had to spoil my first night in them.</p>
<p>“Please, just a little more…”</p>
<p>“No, Master. Get up, unless you want me to tear away your blanket again.”</p>
<p>“Wah, Minnalis, you meanie…,” I wailed, reluctantly getting out of bed.</p>
<p>“I’ve already borrowed the kitchen to make breakfast, so let’s head downstairs.”</p>
<p>“Haah… Fine. Damn, this is just another thing to get revenge on her for.”</p>
<p><em>…I’m not going to be having these dreams every night, am I?</em></p>
<p>“No way.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Master?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. Haah…”</p>
<p>I yawned, as if expelling all those negative thoughts, and I rubbed the sleep from my eyes.</p>

<p class="space-break">Elmia, the City of Learning.</p>
<p>It was a city in the Orollea Kingdom that specialized in, obviously, schools and academies. All countries had cities with educational and research facilities of their own, but of them all, Elmia was famed for its creation of magic items, and the marquis was from a strong bloodline with powerful magical ability. The location was once a crossroads where many trade routes met, but over time, knowledge accumulated due to the rare artifacts that would pass through the area. Furthermore, many different alchemical catalysts could be found nearby, from monster materials to herbs, and so it was inevitable that research institutions would eventually start cropping up. The town that had started as a trade hub garnered a reputation for creating magic items, and this led to more and more adventurers flocking to the area to find the ingredients. The population rose, and the city flourished, as even more people moved into town seeking magic items and the theories behind their creation. Now, it was a city rivaling the capital itself. Eventually, the king officially recognized its influence in the pursuit of magical knowledge, and dubbed it “Elmia,” which in the old tongue of Orollea meant “seeker of wisdom.”</p>
<p>This was the city in which we had finally arrived only a few days ago.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
<p class="space-break">“All right, here’s your reward! Congratulations, you and your party have been promoted to E rank!”</p>
<p>“That’s wonderful, thank you.”</p>
<p>It was ten days after we arrived in Elmia, and I was by myself. I had spent the time slaying monsters and completing requests in order to raise our adventurer rank at Master’s behest. I had just returned from hunting a rather fuzzy monster called the Lesser Ape.</p>
<p>“By the way, how is your partner doing? Kaito? I heard he got injured and was resting at the inn…”</p>
<p>“He’s doing fine. His recovery is going well,” I said with a smile. This receptionist was another beastfolk: a Vulpid, as evidenced by the fox ears atop her head, and recently I had gotten to know her quite well. Her boyfriend was an adventurer and she had picked up quite a few useful tips from him, so I often enjoyed coming to speak with her whenever I had a spare moment. Of course, what I was most interested in was information that would aid us in our revenge.</p>
<p>I accepted my reward and left the guild, before heading to the marketplace to pick up some ingredients for dinner. In many ways, I was far more discerning on this battlefield than I was hunting monsters. This was going in Master’s tummy, so it simply had to be up to snuff. As much as I hated to waste money, it was worth choosing the highest-quality ingredients I could find, within reason.</p>
<p>“Hello there, Minnalis. Picking up some food for your master?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right, ma’am. I’ll take this and that… Oh, and that please, too. And could we maybe knock five copper pieces off the price?”</p>
<p>Of course, I was still going to get them as cheaply as possible. Why wouldn’t I do that?</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re a difficult one. Well, you did come by yesterday, too, so you can have a three-coin discount.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much. Here’s the money.”</p>
<p>I took a drawstring purse from my pack and handed over the coins.</p>
<p><em>These vegetables are of exceptional quality. The things you can find in a big city, I suppose.</em></p>
<p>I placed the produce in my bag, bowed to the greengrocer, and left. I’d long since forgotten how to put on a bright smile, but I’d keep that to myself if it helped me get revenge.</p>
<p>After that, I made my way back to the inn and headed up the stairs to our room. There, Master was lying on the bed, silent, his eyes closed. He had no wounds, in fact, he hadn’t a single scratch. Reporting him as such to the guild was his idea, to allow him to focus on this: his particular method of gathering information.</p>
<p>I ran my fingers through his soft, silky, black hair. I was tempted by all the things I wanted to do to his beautiful sleeping face, but I restrained myself. Right now, he would be able to feel me <em>on the other side</em>.</p>
<p>“Looks like you’re not back yet, so I’ll go make supper.”</p>
<p>Somewhat reluctantly, I went downstairs and headed to the kitchen as always. Tonight’s supper would be vegetable soup with bread. It had to be perfect.</p>
<p>Ever since we left the capital, Master had been giving me these things called “lessons,” teaching me to swing a sword and the like. The most important thing, he always said, was gathering information and acting on it. So I decided to put those lessons to use and had been observing him for some time, trying to work out what kinds of food he liked without him noticing. That said, it was rather obvious when he liked something.</p>
<p>When talking about his favorite foods, the muscles in his face relaxed, and his voice became ever so slightly higher in pitch. When eating, he only filled his spoon with four fifths the usual amount, so as to savor the taste for longer. However, he still couldn’t resist his favorites, so his chewing speed tended to increase, and the time between mouthfuls went down… <em>Oh, gosh, the subtle changes in his excitement are so cute, I can’t stand it! It’s some kind of trap, it must be! Why else would he be so innocent, so helpless, so vulnerable, while I’m trying my hardest to hold myself back?!</em></p>
<p>“…Ahem. My thoughts got a little out of hand there.”</p>
<p>I finished cutting up the fattybird I bought and moved on to the vegetables.</p>
<p>While striving to improve my cooking, I had also given some thought on how to perfect the spoon that would be going in Master’s mouth. The size, the depth, the angles of the curves, the thickness of the handle… There was a lot more to it than I’d thought. After many overhauls, I was currently on model twenty-nine. As for the first twenty-eight models, I was keeping them for posterity. My favorite three were the very first, of course, model seventeen, as it was used for the longest before upgrading, and the freshest, model twenty-eight.</p>
<p>I yearned to add Master’s bedding to my collection as well, but I knew it was wrong to steal from the inn. It was causing me a great deal of conflict. I had let it go in Golet, albeit not without tears, but this time I wondered if there wasn’t some way it could be done…</p>
<p>Perhaps I could get away with switching mine and Master’s bedsheets once every couple of days without him noticing…</p>
<p>“Whoops, I’ve gone and gotten my head in the clouds again.”</p>
<p>I shook my head to clear my mind and focused once more on the cooking before me. Master liked to have more vegetables than meat in his soup, and he preferred them chopped large enough that he could identify them.</p>
<p>I placed the vegetables into the boiling pot and skimmed off the scum from the top. Then I added in goat milk and butter. I let it simmer for a while, before finally adding salt to taste.</p>
<p>It was a recipe my mother had taught me, but apparently it was very similar to one of Master’s favorite foods from his world, something called “cream stew.”</p>
<p>“It’s done. Now…”</p>
<p>I took a couple of slices of bread that had just finished lightly toasting and melted some cheese over their tops. As I gave a nod of satisfaction at the finished meal, the landlady came over.</p>
<p>“Oh, excellent work, as always. Is this for your master?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, it is.”</p>
<p>“…I know it’s rough, but hang in there. Here, take this as well.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure why, but the landlady handed me a scarlet fruit called a kolin. Fruit was expensive, though, so I gratefully accepted it.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, thank you…”</p>
<p>I supposed I might as well add it to the meal, so I sliced the fruit in half. Master had taught me about these things in his world called “apple rabbits” that you could make out of fruit like this, so I gave it a try.</p>
<p><em>Master is going to be eating this rabbit… Tee-hee, gosh, I like the sound of that…</em></p>
<p>I placed a lid on the pot, took the two slices of toast with cheese, and the kolin rabbits, and carried it all up the stairs to Master’s room, since the bowls and spoons were in his pack. When I entered, Master was sitting up in bed.</p>
<p>“Ah, Minnalis, you’re back.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master. I’ve made supper, too. Cream stew.”</p>
<p>“Ooh, looks great, as always.”</p>
<p>I made a portion with more vegetables in it and handed it to him.</p>
<p>““Thanks for the food.””</p>
<p>I performed the premeal gesture that Master had taught me and watched him closely as I reached for my serving. He seemed to enjoy his meal. That was nice. Also, I wanted that spoon. No, I wanted to <em>be</em> that spoon.</p>
<p>He tried to hide it, but I could see Master had been in a bad mood lately, ever since he went out hunting alone two days ago. I didn’t know what happened out there, but it seemed to have angered him.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Master? Did you not find anything out?”</p>
<p>Master had used the experience from those Redcaps to unlock another of his old abilities. It was a soul blade called the Mystic Blade of Soulfire that allowed him to become an invisible ghost whenever he liked. This ability allowed him to walk the streets and enter buildings unseen. Unfortunately, he couldn’t control his physical body while doing this, so he stayed in his room at the inn as we made up a story about him being injured by monsters.</p>
<p>Whenever he went somewhere, Master tried to look happy, but I could tell he was secretly feeling down. I’ve been watching him for so long now, after all. I imagined he was still depressed about being cheated for all that time in his previous life. Seeing him so sad made me so excited, my heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Nah, I did, I confirmed some of my suspicions. It’s just…”</p>
<p>Master shuddered with disgust.</p>
<p>“I saw this awful scene at Eumis’s mansion. It made me want to strangle her on the spot, and I didn’t think it was possible to hate her any more than I already did. She’s downright evil. I’ve only grown more convinced of that these past two days.”</p>
<p>He always made this face when confronted with filth like her. He tapped the end of his spoon impatiently against the bottom of his bowl.</p>
<p>“Revenge isn’t justice; it’s only for my benefit. There’s no point in getting revenge if it doesn’t satisfy me, and I won’t let anyone else have all the satisfaction, either. But if we could share it together…”</p>
<p>His dark smile crossed his lips.</p>
<p>“I think that would be more fun. I guess it depends on the person, though. Also, we’ll probably have to play this one by ear a bit since I haven’t written the script.”</p>
<p>“…Can we save the riddles for another time, Master? I’ve been working hard by myself, finishing all those requests, and just today, I got us promoted to E rank. I want to be part of your revenge; I don’t like being kept in suspense.”</p>
<p>My task had been to gain experience in preparation for the real thing, and I had contented myself with it as penance for my past mistake. Even though Master had already said it was okay, I could see he knew it was weighing on my mind. But now, there was little left for me to do, and I wanted to move on to other things. It was hard, not being part of his vengeance. Perhaps it was time to end my self-imposed punishment. Any longer, and I’d risk being left behind.</p>
<p>That said, we’re against one of his enemies this time, so it’s only natural I should resign myself to a supporting role. Since we share revenge, though, my hatred for that woman is no less than his.</p>
<p>Yet I found it hard to stand up for myself. I was like putty in his hands. His warm, gentle hands…</p>
<p>Uh-oh, time to use my skill.</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry, I guess it must be pretty lame just watching me get all hyped up by myself. Sure, I’ll fill you in… Actually, I’m surprised you got our rank raised already. Guess we don’t need to take any more requests for a while. That’s perfect timing, actually. It’ll be time soon. I’ll just check some things tomorrow and we can start deciding the basic outline.”</p>
<p>“So…what did you find out in the end?”</p>
<p>“Well, Eumis is scum for sure, but her sister is, to put it arrogantly, worth a try.”</p>
<p>“Eumis’s…sister?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I thought I’d gotten used to being unable to help people, but I guess not. I just can’t stand to see what she’s going through.”</p>
<p>His voice was dark, pitch-black, and so quiet it seemed to tremble. Yet it didn’t sound weak. In fact, it sounded so hot that I’d be burned if I were able to touch it.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>But, Master. Her sister? You know what that means, don’t you? A woman.</em></p>
<p><em>No, it’s fine. I’m fine. Doesn’t bother me at all. Hmph.</em></p>
