<p>I quickly checked her status, but I didn’t find any skill that would allow her to see me. It must have been her intrinsic ability, Intuition, that tipped her off.</p>
<p>“…Must be my imagination…”</p>
<p>The maid called Soriy looked around curiously, but unable to find anything, continued on down the stairs.</p>
<p><em>Wait! There she is!!</em></p>
<p>“Ah, Mistress. I see you’ve returned.”</p>
<p>“Indeed I have, Soriy.”</p>
<p>At the bottom of the stairs stood that wretched louse Eumis.</p>
<p>“I assumed you would be spending the day at the office today,” said Soriy.</p>
<p>“I just came back home to rest, and while I’m here, there are some papers I need to stamp. They should arrive any moment, so until then, why don’t you take a break with me? I’ll be in my bedroom. Could I trust you to bring the usual stuff?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes, ma’am. I’ll go fetch it now.”</p>
<p>“Tee-hee-hee… I’ll see you there, then.”</p>
<p><em>Hmm…this is my chance to see what they get up to in private.</em></p>
<p>Just as I thought I’d made a blunder, I came across a gold mine of potential information. Watching the maid talk reminded me who she was. This woman was Eumis’s trusted retainer. When Eumis was away from the estate—and her responsibilities fell to her younger, elven-blood sister—it was Soriy who advised her in that capacity. Even now, she must have some knowledge of the inner workings of the estate, and she certainly knew a lot about Eumis. I might learn something of her true nature if I sat in on their little break time and listened to their chatter.</p>
<p>I decided to follow up on this lead before I searched the upper floor. A grin crept across my lips as I trailed behind them.</p>

<p class="space-break">…I thought I might overhear something juicy, like problems they were having, people they didn’t like. I wasn’t prepared in the slightest for this.</p>
<p>I mean, what the hell am I seeing?</p>
<p>“Mmah… Hee-hee-hee…this is the spot, huh, Soriy?”</p>
<p>“Aahn! N-not there, Miss Eumis… Aaah! Ahhh…mm… Mmm-hmm…!”</p>
<p>“Ah, you sound so cute, Soriy. You can moan louder if you want, you know?”</p>
<p>“Mmh… Aaaah!”</p>
<p><em>Why do I have to watch these two pigs mating…?! Ugh!</em></p>
<p>Hmm, I suppose it’s not technically “mating” if they’re the same gender. If it were any other duo of pretty girls in this situation, I’d thank my lucky stars, but to me, this pairing was less like a porno and more like a horror movie. I felt sick.</p>
<p>By the way, “the usual stuff” turned out to be some kind of sticky lotion. They were rubbing it all over their hides like slimy little maggots.</p>
<p><em>Hmm, but I guess I did learn something. Eumis is actually a lesbian.</em></p>
<p>So this is what they did behind closed doors. The pervasive, sickly odor of incense filled the room.</p>
<p>I had always wondered why she never seemed to react at all to the suitors who came to court her. Some of them were rather handsome men, even by this world’s standards. This explains it. The pig was only ever interested in girls.</p>
<p>“Aahhh…mmm… Mmm!”</p>
<p><em>Okay, that’s enough. I can’t take it anymore…</em></p>
<p>It felt like I was taking psychic damage just standing here. A second longer and I was going to be forcibly sent back to my real body. I slipped out, phasing through the closed door, still reeling from the sight.</p>
<p><em>Time to pull myself together. I need to find a study.</em></p>
<p>Those two seemed to be keeping themselves occupied, so I could probably get away with making myself partially corporeal if it made things easier. Shaking my head to remove the images I had just seen from my brain, I headed up the stairs. I was checking all the various rooms one by one when I hit upon something promising.</p>
<p><em>This is the only room with two layers of physical defenses… There’s an item stopping me from detecting what’s inside, but I can tell there’s some sort of magic circle surrounding the whole room.</em></p>
<p>It wouldn’t be easy to get inside, but that just meant there must be something in there worth hiding. The magic circle probably wasn’t a detection spell, since it would conflict with the anti-detection magic item. It was probably something designed to inflict harm on intruders.</p>
<p>They really didn’t want people getting in here. The physical defenses were no threat to me while I was incorporeal, so the only thing I had to worry about was the magic circle which covered the whole room. That said, I was going to have to enter it to find out what I was dealing with, so I covered my ghostly body with a thin layer of mana to raise my magical resistance. With this in place, I would have a few seconds before the magic circle’s effect, whatever it was, acted upon me. That would buy me enough time to figure out what it was and, if necessary, get out again while I thought up a plan.</p>
<p><em>So what secrets are you hiding in here?</em></p>
<p>I passed through the door and entered the room. I was prepared for any magical trap I might activate. What I was not prepared for, however, was what I saw. It wasn’t a study at all. There were stuffed toys everywhere, and nothing like a large desk where somebody might work. It just looked like a bedroom, and there was someone inside. It was Eumis’s sister.</p>
<p>I had considered using her to exact my vengeance against Eumis, but now that I was in her room, there was something very strange.</p>
<p><em>Hold on, what the hell…? What does this mean? This mana…it’s a Contract spell. What is it doing here…?</em></p>
<p>The magic circle was not, as I had surmised, for repelling intruders. Its purpose was to apply a <em>curse</em> to something specific in the room.</p>
<p><em>And following the mana leads me to her. The curse is on Eumis’s sister. What is going on here?</em></p>
<p>Contract magic was usually the exclusive domain of demons. Their particular brand of mana was required in order to activate the spell, though it could be maintained after that without it.</p>
<p>It was strange enough for such a spell to be hidden in the Elmia household in the first place, but that the magic circle maintaining it was focused on Eumis’s own sister was simply baffling.</p>
<p><em>First things first, I should use my Appraise skill on the magic circle to learn more</em>, I thought, when suddenly…</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p><em>Hmm…?</em></p>
<p>The girl sitting by the window, an open letter in her hand, was staring right at me in amazement, her eyes a brilliant crimson.</p>
<p><em>…Crimson? Ah, crap, don’t tell me…</em></p>
<p>I tried moving left and right, and the girl followed my movements. Her eyes went wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Harboring one last glimmer of hope, I turned my Appraise skill upon the girl, only for those hopes to be dashed.</p>
<p>“…Are you a ghost?”</p>
<p><em>…This day is just full of surprises.</em></p>
