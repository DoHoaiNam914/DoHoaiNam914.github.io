<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-epilogue">The Day Her Life Turned Upside Down</a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>es, this is a story about the day her life turned upside down. A day that started like any other, the sun shining brightly in the sky; the birds singing. To everyone else, the day would continue like any other, too, until the streets sank back into the vermilion light of dusk.</p>
<p>But she would remember that day forever, right up until the moment she expired…or even beyond.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“Kaito didn’t come back today, either.”</p>
<p>I sighed deeply, blowing bubbles in the bathtub. It had been four days since the spirit, Kaito, passed through my door and appeared in my room. I was really surprised. I never thought the day would come when I would get to meet a real live spirit.</p>
<p>There was a story my mother used to tell me when I was younger, about a half-elf girl and a light spirit who lived inside a doll. They ran into problems, but they always overcame them by working together, and they lived happily ever after.</p>
<p>That was just a story, though. I’m not a half elf; I only have elven blood in my veins. And I’m not saying I want to spend my whole life with a spirit. I just want to talk to them. And maybe be their friend.</p>
<p>“…Maybe I was acting <em>too</em> friendly.”</p>
<p>Spirits were whimsical and fickle beings. They hardly ever showed themselves to people at all. Even if one showed up in a human dwelling, nobody would be able to see it unless they had my Scarlet Eyes, or if it chose to reveal itself. Otherwise, it was normal for people to go their whole lives without seeing one at all.</p>
<p>“…Next time, I’ll make sure to ask him if he wants to be my friend.”</p>
<p>Apparently, there were special items that could summon spirits, but they were so rare and expensive barely anybody could get their hands on them. Eumis had one, though, but she couldn’t show it to me because it was “delicate.”</p>
<p><em>Maybe he found me boring. I’m not good at keeping a conversation going</em>, I thought, as I splashed about in the tub.</p>
<p>It was the first time I had seen a spirit. At first, I thought it was a ghost, but it must have been a spirit because he was able to materialize and let me touch him.</p>
<p>“I’ll have to think of something more interesting to say for next time.”</p>
<p>I stood up out of the bath and dried myself off, before pulling on my pajamas and rubbing my hair with a towel. Then I poured myself a cup of water from the jug provided in my room, and holding it in both hands, drank it dry in three gulps. When I lived in the village, the man next door told me this is what you do when you get out of the bath. Actually, you were supposed to put one hand on your hip, too, but my mother got angry when she saw me doing that, so I’d always done it like this instead.</p>
<p>Then, all warm from the bath, I crawled under the covers and snuggled up in bed.</p>
<p>According to Eumis, there were only a few more days before the spell would be complete. Then I would say good-bye to this bed, to this room. She said I could keep my stuffed toys, but it was still a little sad.</p>
<p>However, it would mean I could live together with my mother and my sister again. It was very exciting.</p>
<p>“Hmm. What should I do? What if he comes back and I’ve already gone? He won’t know where to find me.”</p>
<p>I sat up in bed and pondered. I couldn’t ask Eumis to let him know, because she didn’t have my Scarlet Eyes. She wouldn’t be able to see him even if he did come back. Besides, he said I was supposed to keep our meeting a secret, and I promised I would.</p>
<p>I wondered and fretted, but in the end, I didn’t get anywhere and before I knew it, I had fallen asleep.</p>
<p class="space-break2">A few days later, Eumis came to my room, all smiles.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Shuria,” she said. “The spell has finally been completed.”</p>
<p>I already knew, because I’d seen the last of my mana leave my body with my Scarlet Eyes. But when that happened, my first thought had been, <em>Oh, I suppose I’m not going to get to see Kaito again after all.</em></p>
<p>“…So does that mean I can go outside again?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you may. I made sure to keep this day open, so why don’t we go out together?”</p>
<p>“…I’d like that very much.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s settled. Soriy, could you get everything ready?”</p>
<p>“Understood, Mistress,” replied the maid, bowing and leaving the room.</p>
<p>I would finally get to leave the room and go into town with Eumis. It was like a dream come true.</p>
<p>“This is going to be such a wonderful day,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed it shall,” answered my sister, lips breaking into her usual smile.</p>
<p class="space-break2">After that, I went shopping in town with Eumis. I hadn’t had time for sightseeing when I first arrived in the city, and this was my first time seeing it up close.</p>
<p>“Wow, there are so many people and so many shops!”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee! I suppose it must seem that way to you, having lived in a small village for so long.”</p>
<p>Eumis was disguised in a low hat and a pair of glasses. I was also wearing a similar hat, but to be honest, it made it a little hard to see, and I didn’t like it.</p>
<p>“…Eumis, Eumis, what is that?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s a magic item for starting fires. We have one at home in the kitchen.”</p>
<p>“And what’s that?”</p>
<p>“That’s a game board.”</p>
<p>The warm rays of the sun seemed to be cheering us on as shopkeepers called out their wares in the marketplace. There were more people I could see with a turn of my head than lived in my entire village.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>“What have you found? Oh my, what an adorable doll.”</p>
<p>At a stall selling miscellany, I stopped in front of a large stuffed toy of a white kitty cat. It was holding a knife and fork in its hands, and wearing an apron stained with what looked like ketchup.</p>
<p>Eumis looked at me and chuckled. “Excuse me, madam. How much is this doll?”</p>
<p>“That’s eight large coppers.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much. Here you go, Shuria.”</p>
<p>“…I can have this?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s a bit late to change your mind now, I’ve already bought it! Hee-hee, here, take it!”</p>
<p>Eumis was very kind. The doll itself was cute, but the fact that my sister bought it and gave it to me made me very happy. I squeezed it tightly and smiled.</p>
<p>“It’s almost time for lunch. I’ve asked Soriy to meet us in the park for sandwiches. Shall we go?”</p>
<p>“Yes, please, Eumis!”</p>
<p>She took me to a wonderful garden. I had read about them in my novels, but never seen one. There was nothing this fancy in the village I was from. We sat on a park bench, eating sandwiches out of a wicker basket.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time I’d eaten lunch with Eumis, but today was a very special day nonetheless.</p>
<p class="space-break2">After lunch, we went and looked at some more shops. The time flew by, and soon enough, the sky began to redden with the light of dusk.</p>
<p>“Er, Eumis… I had a lot of fun today, but are you sure it didn’t bore you?”</p>
<p>“Oh? Why would that be?”</p>
<p>“Well, you had to waste your valuable time off looking after me.”</p>
<p>“That isn’t true at all. I had fun shopping, too. Besides, today is a very special day, the day the spell of three years in the making finally draws to completion.” Eumis smiled. “Now, the sun has almost set. We should go.”</p>
<p>“…Go where?”</p>
<p>“Well, the truth is, your mother and sister are already here in this city.”</p>
<p>“Huh?!”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee. I knew you’d be surprised, so I kept quiet. Soriy’s been helping prepare your welcome-back party, so I expect they’re ready waiting for us right now.”</p>
<p><em>Finally… I can see my family again!!</em></p>
<p>I was very lucky, because Eumis had allowed me to receive letters from them once a month, and visited me herself so I wouldn’t be lonely, but it had still been almost three years since I had seen my mother and my sister, so I missed them very much.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. They’re all waiting for you at your new home.”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Eumis and I set off down the twilit streets. My heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest. I wanted to run all the way there as fast as I could, but I didn’t know the way. Eumis guided me through the unfamiliar city, walking ahead of me.</p>
<p>So I didn’t know what kind of face she was making at that moment.</p>
<p>“…This is my new home?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, it is.”</p>
<p>Eumis brought me to a quiet building on the outskirts of the city. It was large, but out of the way, and with my Scarlet Eyes, I could see that there were a great number of spells cast on it, just like Eumis’s mansion. I didn’t have her intuition for magic, so I didn’t know what they did, but I thought they must be “defensive wards” of the sort that Eumis had told me about.</p>
<p>“You won’t have to worry about Mother and Father. They believe this to be merely one of my research laboratories. Even they cannot enter without my permission.”</p>
<p><em>So even if they came back to the city, we can hide indoors for a few days and they won’t find us</em>, I thought. Even though he was my father, I didn’t want to see the lord or his wife who had chased us out of the city. I am sure they had no desire to see us, either.</p>
<p>“Let’s go inside, shall we?” asked Eumis.</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>The inside of the house looked normal. Of course, it was simple compared to my room in Eumis’s mansion, but it still looked far more habitable than our village hut.</p>
<p>“Thank you for waiting, Mistress and Miss Shuria.”</p>
<p>Soriy bowed her head as she saw us. Wearing her usual maid uniform, she greeted us in a very dignified manner.</p>
<p>But Mother and Shelmie were not with her.</p>
<p>“…Where is my family?”</p>
<p>“They are farther inside,” Eumis explained and began walking immediately as though she knew where she was going. She was followed by Soriy, and I trailed after them.</p>
<p>They opened a door I thought would lead to another room of the house, but it appeared to descend into the basement. From below, I could sense an unfamiliar magic I disliked very much.</p>
<p>“Er, Eumis…? Is my family really down here…?”</p>
<p>“This way. Follow me,” urged Eumis, and without turning back, she descended the staircase.</p>
<p>“W-wait! Wait for me!”</p>
<p>Feeling uncertain, I followed her down the stairs. With each step, I thought about how I’d soon get to see my family again. I was very excited, but at the same time, a little uneasy.</p>
<p>It was my family. I’d lived with them all my life, and we’d been exchanging letters these past three years. But somehow, I had a strange feeling.</p>
<p>At the base of the stairs was a simple iron door.</p>
<p>“They’re both waiting for you, just beyond this door,” said Eumis, smiling.</p>
<p>She let me go first. I approached the door and hesitated before it.</p>
<p><em>Oooh, I’m so nervous.</em></p>
<p>What would I say to them first? I wasn’t good at being loud, but if there was ever a time to be energetic, this was it. I took a deep breath, pushed open the creaking iron door, and called out in the brightest voice I could manage.</p>
<p>“Mother, Shelmie! It’s been so long! I missed…you?”</p>
<p>But I didn’t make it to the end of the sentence before my voice failed me.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>What greeted me beyond that door was not what I had expected to see at all.</p>
<p>It was like a prison, as dark and as gloomy as a cave, and the room was full of <em>things</em> writhing on the ground, speaking only in strange, groaning sounds. Their bodies were putrid, like animal innards, and their mouths hung open vacantly.</p>
<p>“Eek! Eumis! Those are undead!!”</p>
<p>With my Scarlet Eyes, I could see the negative energy those <em>things</em> gave off. It wrapped around them like stagnant murk, the mana I sensed before and found so unpleasant. The <em>things</em> looked unlike any creature I had ever seen before, and I couldn’t tell what they had originally been, but they were undead, I was sure of it.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen these kinds before, but they’re undead!”</p>
<p>“That’s right, they are. These ones didn’t handle the preservation process very well. The mana we used to prevent the flesh from rotting also damaged it and transformed it into that dark color, like filthy ditch water.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>I looked up at Eumis beside me, but I saw someone else standing there. A stranger, grinning, saying the most peculiar things as if they were perfectly natural.</p>
<p>“Maybe things would be a little different if they still had their hearts, but unfortunately that’s just the way it is. Living hearts are absolutely essential for the process of refining magical stones. The undead can go on living without them, but it seems to have deteriorated the body’s ability to contain mana and caused the flesh to start rotting.”</p>
<p>She placed her hand in her palm and sighed, as though the bizarre sight before me was nothing out of the ordinary at all.</p>
<p>“Wh-what are you saying?”</p>
<p>The person who looked like my sister simply continued to smile.</p>
<p class="space-break1">She had her face, she had her voice, she had her mannerisms.</p>
<p class="space-break1">And yet, I felt like I was looking at someone I had never met before in my life.</p>
<p>“Necromancy is a tricky business. Few are left who practice the arts, and fewer still documents remain. I have failed many times, but these are my most valuable test subjects yet. By sewing together the organs of monsters, I have managed to bring some semblance of life to them. They can even talk, after a fashion, and they never complain about the things I do to them. All that’s left now is to find a way to bring back their minds.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Who was she?</p>
<p>Who was the person standing there, before my eyes?</p>
<p><em>There’s no one I know who makes this face.</em></p>
<p><em>There’s no one I know who talks like this.</em></p>
<p>“My, there’s no need to look so upset. This is the day you finally get to meet your beloved family again. Smile! They’re both watching.”</p>
<p>“N-no…”</p>
<p>As I stood there, paralyzed, Eumis took my hand. I tried to pull away, but she was bigger than me.</p>
<p>“It’s time for your touching reunion.”</p>
