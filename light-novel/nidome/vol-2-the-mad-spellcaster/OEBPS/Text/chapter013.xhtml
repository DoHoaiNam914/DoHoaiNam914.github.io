<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">“W</span>hoopsie-daisy. Look, Dot, there’s one over there. Don’t let it get through.”</p>
<p>As Zuily cleaved a goblin in half with her two-handed broadsword, another slipped past her guard and made a beeline for Terry in the rear. Dot, however, was quick to react to her words and stood in the goblin’s path.</p>
<p>“I got it already! Terry!”</p>
<p>He swung his sword down at the goblin, but the monster blocked the first attack with its club, a crude weapon made of some bit of tree it had found lying around. With his second blow, Dot put some distance between himself and the creature.</p>
<p>“Got it in my sights!” Terry launched a bullet of ice at the lone goblin. The creature couldn’t dodge, and as the man’s spell blew a hole in its chest, it let out a single strained cry that sounded like a frog being squashed. Meanwhile, Zuily mowed down a final goblin with her greatsword and brought the battle to a close. After severing their ears for trophies, the three of them regrouped.</p>
<p>A few hours had passed since they’d entered the forest. The sun was at its peak, and the number of goblins Zuily’s team had defeated had just reached double digits.</p>
<p>“We’ve managed to do better than expected,” observed Zuily. “What say we break for lunch?”</p>
<p>“<em>Phew</em>, finally,” said Terry with a sigh.</p>
<p>“You’ve got no energy, Terry,” scolded Dot. “I spotted a clearing up ahead while I was scouting. Let’s move there.”</p>
<p>Dot led his party to the clearing, and they all picked a spot on the ground and sat down. Then Dot produced some meat jerky and rye bread from an old sack.</p>
<p>“So how come we ain’t gone after the brat and his staff the moment we entered the forest? That’s what we’re really after, right?”</p>
<p>“Dot, you moron. We may as well let ’em hunt some extra goblins for us to take back with us. Besides, we have to stay out here awhile or the guild’ll think something’s fishy when we come back. We’re still planning to stay in this town for a while, after all… Mng.”</p>
<p>Zuily washed down her dry bread with a swig of water and tore into the hard meat with her teeth.</p>
<p>“Anyway, they can’t have gone far. They gotta be back in town by sundown or they forfeit the match. Not only that, but you don’t have to go deep into the forest to find a bunch of goblins.”</p>
<p>“True, the encounter rate here does seem particularly high compared to other forests,” noted Terry.</p>
<p>“Did ya not know?” Zuily asked. “A few years back, there used to be a village by the base of the mountains here. One day, stray demons possessed the townsfolk so they could stage an assault on the city of Elmia. In the end, it never came to that, but the villagers went mad from their possession and started lashing out at anything and everything, so the soldiers had to come and put ’em all to death.”</p>
<p>“And what does that have to do with the high encounter rate? I don’t see the connection.”</p>
<p>“Just let me finish, will ya? Why do you always gotta skip over the fun stuff?” said Zuily, waving her water bottle at Terry. “So that village disappeared, and all the requests asking adventurers to come to this forest suddenly stopped. Until then, there were quite a few coming in from Elmia, too, but they all stopped as well.”</p>
<p>“And then, as if to make matters worse, a <em>silly rumor</em> starts going around! And all the superstitious rookie adventurers who came here for experience stop showing up, too!”</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m the one tellin’ this tale! Don’t steal the show!” cried Zuily, bringing her fist down on Dot’s head.</p>
<p>“Ow! You didn’t have to hit me, boss!”</p>
<p>Ignoring his teary eyes, Zuily returned to her story.</p>
<p>“And so, apart from the guild’s regular monster-slaying expeditions, adventurers stopped coming to this forest. Without anyone to cull the numbers, obviously that’s gonna make the encounter rate go up.”</p>
<p>“I see. And so what was this silly rumor?” Terry cocked his head as Zuily took another bite of her jerky.</p>
<p>“Terry, you should pay attention to more than just your magic items,” warned Dot. “They said that the ghosts of those villagers still haunted this forest, and that if ya met one, you’d suffer a curse that can never be lifted. That’s what kept people away.”</p>
<p>Terry let out a brief sigh. “Good grief. Undead appearing is one thing, but ghostly curses? The imaginations of some people.”</p>
<p>“Well, it wasn’t just that rumor which kept people out. Even if you ignored it, the only monsters you can find in these parts are goblins and Green Boars. There ain’t nothing worth the trouble of defeating, and even if you’re just after experience, if you’ve got half a head, you’ll stay away from this forest and pick somewhere less crowded. Plenty other places you can find goblins and Green Boars without being up to your neck in ’em.”</p>
<p>Terry nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“In fact, we’re quite lucky those twerps picked this place. This way we can kill ’em without anybody finding out.”</p>
<p>“In that case, shall we get it over with? My MP is starting to wane from these constant back-to-back battles. It’d be best to get it done after this short rest… I wish to see that beastfolk slave weeping and screaming as soon as possible, and since we’re killing her right after, I have to make the most of it.”</p>
<p>Terry began to laugh cruelly, and Dot joined in.</p>
<p>“After we kill the two guys, we’ll have to find an abandoned lodge to have our fun,” he said. “Don’t want the monsters to catch us with our pants down, so to speak!”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you two forgetting something? The staff’s what’s important! Also, if you break that girl before I get a chance to, I’ll rip off the ones between your legs!”</p>
<p>““All right, all right!””</p>
<p>“Ugh, guys are all talk. You know we gotta take that kid out first, right? The other two fledglings’ll be quaking in their boots after they see their partner die, so before they can act, we hobble that skinny punk’s legs so he can’t walk. Ah, I’d like to keep him alive, if you don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Why not kill him?”</p>
<p>Dot looked confused. It was Terry who answered his question.</p>
<p>“You just don’t get it, do you?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>““It’ll be way more fun to see the look on that kid’s face as his slave is defiled in front of him!!”” the other two both let out in unison, and then Zuily’s boisterous laughter mingled with Terry’s sly chuckles.</p>
<p>“Eh. I don’t really see it. Seems like it’d be more annoyin’ than anything else, to me. Oh well, if that’s what you guys want, then I can’t disagree.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be great if we could get her to betray her Master in return for her life?” suggested Zuily.</p>
<p>“Then how about we have that slave girl finish off that thin whelp for us? We can tell her we’ll let her live if she does,” added Terry.</p>
<p>“I like that sound of that. Buuut, she’s probably been commanded not to defy her master, so I doubt it’ll work.”</p>
<p>“You two are twisted,” said Dot. “Well, as long as you don’t damage her neck, it’s all good with me.” This time it was he who shrugged his shoulders in resignation. He didn’t really mind either way. Sure, it was dangerous to leave the punk alive, but he’d only just registered the previous day. He was a complete novice. What harm could he do? As long as they killed the mage kid first, the others would pose no threat.</p>
<p>“Right then, let’s finish eating and head out.”</p>
<p>It was only the scout, Dot, who was fast enough to raise a voice in response to what happened next.</p>
<p>“Whoa—”</p>
<p>But he was unable to warn his party in time. Even if all three of them had been on guard, the attack was so swift they would not have been able to react.</p>
<p>A paralytic mist was carried by the soft breeze and descended upon the three. In an instant, that semitransparent white mist immobilized the lot of them.</p>
<p>“Wh-what…? P-paralysis…?”</p>
<p><em>What the hell? A Paraz Moth? Why would it be here? No…their spores don’t take effect this quickly…!</em></p>
<p>Then the mist vanished as quickly as it had appeared. It had already sunk in.</p>
<p>“Dammit… I can’t move…!”</p>
<p>“B-boss! Th-this ain’t good… I can’t…move a muscle…!”</p>
<p>“Just…wait. I’ll drink a healing potion… and then…”</p>
<p>Whether by her higher stats or just plain fortuity, Zuily could still move, albeit sluggishly. She forced her stubborn hand down to the pouch belt at her hip. Her arm moved excruciatingly slow, but at last she reached the detox potion she kept on hand for emergencies.</p>
<p><em>Dammit, move faster…!!</em></p>
<p>Taking care not to drop it, she slowly brought the potion up to her lips.</p>
<p>“All…right…”</p>
<p>As the potion came into view at last, that was when she heard it.</p>
<p class="space-break3">“Oh, my condolences! You were too slow!”</p>
<p class="space-break3">I descended on that place, like a demon stoking the fires of hell.</p>
<p>“Gaaaaaaaagh!!”</p>
<p>The glass of her vial shattered beneath my boot, and with my rage-filled stomp, I must have lacerated her hand as well, for red blood pooled out from under my foot and stained the earth.</p>
<p>“Hey, how does it feel to be thwarted so close to your goal? Just when you think, <em>Thank goodness, I’m nearly there</em>? How does it feel to have everything taken away from you and torn apart before your very eyes?”</p>
<p>“Grrrh! Arghhh!!”</p>
<p>“Huh, I guess you can’t answer me, can you?”</p>
<p>I suppose some of the detox potion must have entered her bloodstream via the wounds in her hand and begun to counteract the numbness. Not enough so she could move again, but just enough so she could feel the pain in her hand.</p>
<p>“Master, it’s not nice to steal my food before I get a taste.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Ah, sorry. It was just so perfect that I couldn’t help myself.”</p>
<p>I shrugged and lifted my shoe from her hand. My playful, taunting words were coming from above her head, where she couldn’t see.</p>
<p>“That…voice…!”</p>
<p>Lying facedown on the ground, unable to move her neck, Zuily could see only as high as our waists. There was no way she would’ve forgotten my voice after only a few hours.</p>
<p>“What…are you doing…? Graaargh!!”</p>
<p>“This piece of trash is awfully loud, Master. It’s harsh on my ears.”</p>
<p>Minnalis trampled Zuily’s hand even more brutally than I had done.</p>
<p>“Who did you say you were going to defile in front of whom, again? I can’t believe the filth that comes out of your mouth, you roach.”</p>
<p>“Grh! Gah! Aaaaargh!!”</p>
<p>The cruelty with which she trampled that hand was a testament to the extent of her anger. I could hear a crunching sound like gravel as she crushed it beneath her boot, a look of supreme disgust on her face.</p>
<p>“And I’m to beg for my life before you? Betray my master for you? …Just how much are you willing to put me through before you’re satisfied, huh?!”</p>
<p>“Y-you’re… Ghah!”</p>
<p>Zuily tried to speak, but Minnalis kicked her in the jaw. Then she trampled on Zuily’s other hand, and she let out another cry of pain.</p>
<p>“Do you dwo…habe any idea…whad you’re doing…?”</p>
<p>Thanks to the antidote moving through her bloodstream, Zuily could still speak to some extent, even if she couldn’t move.</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s that supposed to mean, you fat sow?”</p>
<p>“Ugh!! Stop— Graaargh!!”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Does your hand hurt? Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Stop! Graaaargh! Urghhhh!”</p>
<p>Now that Minnalis had lifted her foot from Zuily’s right hand, it was my turn again. I crushed her hand beneath my boot for a while, listening to her screams.</p>
<p>“Now then, which of you said to have Minnalis kill me? It was you, wasn’t it, third-rate archer?”</p>
<p>“Th…ird…rate…?!”</p>
<p>I peeked over at Terry, chuckling. His sharp glare made it clear what was on his mind.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Third. Rate. To be honest, I’m surprised you’ve survived this long. It’s a miracle, if you ask me.”</p>
<p>“You think I’ll…let you…? Gah! Gghh?!”</p>
<p>I kicked him over onto his back and launched my foot into his jaw just as Minnalis had done.</p>
<p>“Hey, does that hurt? Does it? Having to crawl around on the ground like a caterpillar while I talk shit about you? How does it feel? Come on, tell me!”</p>
<p>Smiling, I approached Terry, plucked the bow from his fingers, and snapped it in two before his eyes. As he glared up at me in indignation, I merely sneered back down at him and dropped my boot onto into his stomach.</p>
<p>“Stop… Please stop…”</p>
<p>After kicking him in the gut repeatedly, his mind finally snapped, and those words were all he could muster.</p>
<p>I’d had my fill and looked over at Minnalis. She was playing with Dot now, breaking down his will to resist.</p>
<p>“I don’t know why the others keep you around if you can’t even warn them of one measly ambush. And we were watching your battle, too. All you do is leave the killing to other people. What a worthless piece of trash. You know what they call people like you? Parasites. Oh, sorry, perhaps you’re too stupid to understand that.”</p>
<p>“Gr… Stop…this…”</p>
<p>Minnalis kicked Dot around on the ground, looking down at him with a sneering smile. Well, maybe “smile” wasn’t the right way of putting it—she had lost none of her anger, and the rage was clear on her face as she beat him without mercy.</p>
<p>While he had showed resistance at first, Dot, too, gave in to the pain and eventually could manage nothing but weak groans. Perhaps we were rougher than we meant to be, but it’s what they deserved. Their words earlier were like oil for our flame.</p>
<p>“So you were planning to kill us. Obviously, you considered the possibility that we would counterattack, right? You prepared yourself for this eventuality, didn’t you? You’ve made your peace?”</p>
<p>I put a fair bit of mana into my aura and watched the faces of Zuily’s party turn pale. It seemed they finally realized what kinds of people they were up against with. If they had still been thinking they could have fought back if only they hadn’t been taken by surprise, then now I had finally shattered that last shard of defiance.</p>
<p>With their pride stripped from them, all they had left were pathetic whimpers.</p>
<p>“W-we were wrong! W-we’ll make it up to you, just please, spare our lives—!”</p>
<p>“Whoops, sorry, it’s a bit early for that,” I said, cutting her off. “We’re only just getting started. Don’t start saying ‘spare me’ yet—this is just a warm-up. Minnalis!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master!”</p>
<p>Minnalis nodded and used her Intoxicating Phantasm to create what we might call an anesthetic. A red-and-orange marbled orb of liquid appeared in her palm. It was about the size of a marble, too; a strong enough dose for the three of them. Unlike the numbing poison, this would only rob them of their sense of touch and immobilize them. They’d still be able to see, hear, and speak, but they would be unable to feel anything or move a muscle from the neck down.</p>
<p>So you can see, it wasn’t quite like the anesthetic in our world.</p>
<p>“Now then, let’s start the preparations. Master, could you help me administer the poison?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“Wh-what are you—? Gwah!!”</p>
<p>I held open the mouths of Zuily’s party as Minnalis poured the poison inside.</p>
<p>“Okay, it should take effect immediately. It’s even stronger than that paralytic we just used, so it should override the effects and allow them to talk again.”</p>
<p>Minnalis’s mouth curved up into a crescent. It seemed the MP drunkenness was kicking in, and she was adopting her usual seductive behavior. This always happened when she made complex poisons with Intoxicating Phantasm, which required a lot of MP.</p>
<p>That smile sent a chill up my spine, but it also took my breath away. It was beautiful and terrifying all at once.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! Just you sit tight and wait! We’ll show you a glimpse of the depths of hell!” exclaimed Minnalis. It was clear from the look on her face she was enjoying this from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“All right, I suppose I should start getting ready, too.”</p>
<p>Minnalis had already made her preparations. Now it was my turn. I would need two of my soul blades: the Monster’s Blade of Hatching and the Fairy’s Blade of Water.</p>
<p>First, I conjured up the former in my hand. If I was sloppy with my control while constructing a soul blade, then the mana would leak out, taking on a distinctive hue. This time, I thought that might add to the spectacle, so I let it happen. Tiny motes of black light danced in the air.</p>
<p>“Come forth with beastly voice. <em>Hatching Flower</em>.”</p>
<p>As I channeled my mana into the sword, red, pulsating veins appeared along the green flower bud that acted as the blade. Then the bud grew black and purple splotches and swelled up, as Zuily’s party looked on in horror.</p>
<p>“Wh-what the hell is that…?” asked Zuily.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Sorry, can’t tell you that yet,” I replied with a fake grin.</p>
<p>It seemed Minnalis’s new poison had taken effect already, for while Zuily could not move a muscle otherwise, she could now speak normally. Terror and uncertainty were beginning to show on her face as she watched the Monster’s Blade undergo its unsettling transformation. While her group couldn’t guess what was going to happen, they could clearly tell it was going to be something very bad for them.</p>
<p>Then, with a <em>shriek</em>, the flower petals unfurled.</p>
<p><em>“Jarrllghhh!”</em></p>
<p>“““Grh!!”””</p>
<p>It was a shrill cry, inhuman, like glass scraping on a chalkboard. It wasn’t particularly loud, but it took the three adventurers by surprise, and their faces froze in terror.</p>
<p>As for how I was handling it…</p>
<p>“Nnnrgghh. Master, I really hate that sound!”</p>
<p>“Minnalis… I said I’m fine.”</p>
<p>She had just come from behind me and clapped her hands over <em>my</em> ears. We hadn’t come across any good earplugs in town, so I told her to just plug up her own ears when the time came.</p>
<p>“Eh-heh-heh… That’s no good, Master… I’m your slave…you should order me to serve you! Whee! Whee!”</p>
<p>“Ah! Stop it! Let go of me! Your breasts are touching me!”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, Master? I’m doing it on purpose!” Minnalis giggled. The MP drunkenness had unveiled her naked lust.</p>
<p>“Settle down for a bit.”</p>
<p>“Aw. Don’t I get a reward for being so good?”</p>
<p>“Rrrgh. Fine, but later. Just drink this.”</p>
<p>In a motion I was getting used to, I pulled Minnalis toward me and forced an MP potion down her throat. All the while I was saying to myself, <em>It’s just the MP drunkenness. It’s just the MP drunkenness.</em> It seemed to be even worse than usual this time, but soon enough she would return to her usual self, I was sure.</p>
<p>“Wh-what the hell is wrong with these two?”</p>
<p>“I—I dunno…”</p>
<p>Terry and Dot, meanwhile, looked very confused. They couldn’t understand us. They had no idea what was coming, and they were afraid. I could hear it in the particular quality of their voices. Zuily, meanwhile, was less interested in our conversation. Her thoughts were dominated by the sight of the creature emerging from my Monster’s Blade of Hatching.</p>
<p>“Now, how are you feeling, Slimo?”</p>
<p><em>“Kupie!”</em></p>
<p>An oddly cute voice answered as Slimo the Slime emerged from the blade. Through the Control Brand, I could tell that it seemed to be in top condition. After ejecting Slimo, the flower of the Monster’s Blade withered back into a bright green bud again.</p>
<p>“A…a slime?” asked Zuily in confusion.</p>
<p>“Yep, not a variant, nothing strong, just an ordinary slime,” I replied. Indeed, it was nothing special. It had no eyes, no nose, no mouth, just a transparent blue body, like jelly. It was about the size of a balance ball, a little larger than average, but not enough to make it a variant. The only thing that distinguished it from a run-of-the mill monster was the Control Brand drawn in mana on the surface of its springy body.</p>
<p>Slimo wiggled on the ground, chirping its signature cry. I always wondered where its voice came from since it didn’t have a mouth.</p>
<p>“All right, now, I know it’s a lot I’m asking of you, but are you ready?”</p>
<p><em>“Kupie! Kuupie!!”</em></p>
<p><em>Leave it to me!</em> it seemed to be saying. I gave it a good pat on the head…or, well, the top part of its body, anyway. Its skin felt cool and elastic. It was a pleasant sensation.</p>
<p>I dispelled the Monster’s Blade of Hatching and conjured up the Fairy’s Blade of Water in its place. The bladeless hilt was wrapped in a deep blue cloth.</p>
<p>“All right, I’m counting on you, Slimo!”</p>
<p><em>“Kupie!! Uu…ku!”</em></p>
<p>Slimo made a cheerful noise in response and, with what appeared to be a little bit of strain, split itself in two. I held my sword near one of the new Slimos and used its body to form its blade. It was about a tenth of the sword’s normal size and composed of the same translucent blue as the slime itself.</p>
<p>“Wh-what? What are you trying to do?” asked Zuily.</p>
<p>“I wonder. What do you think?” replied Minnalis, chuckling in anticipation of what was to come.</p>
<p>“You’ll find out soon enough,” I said. “The preparations are complete. At my current level, it’s quite difficult for me to maintain this blade for very long, so let’s not waste any more time.”</p>
<p>The corners of my lips curled up in a smile. First, I approached Zuily and held my sword up in my right hand.</p>
<p>“W-wait… Please, stop…”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t worry. You won’t die. Yet.”</p>
<p>Zuily’s face twitched in terror. I sneered at her and cut off her head, then did the same with the other two.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Oh, don’t worry. You won’t die. Yet.”</p>
<p>The face I looked up at was plastered with psychotic joy. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him raise his blue crystalline blade, and, as if in slow motion, I felt it cut into the back of my neck.</p>
<p><em>Dammit! I can’t die here! Not to a punk like this!!</em></p>
<p>I felt my decapitated head rolling along the ground. Maybe it was because of that Lagonid girl’s poison, but I didn’t feel any pain. Even now, I could still see. I watched him cut off the heads of Terry and Dot as well.</p>
<p>I had heard that executed criminals could still move their mouths and blink for a few moments after their heads were removed. I guess that was true. However, it would only be a few more seconds before the specter of death consumed me.</p>
<p>I watched as he finished off the party members with whom I’d faced and overcome so many brutal struggles. Without the pain, my death didn’t even feel real. All that was left was to await the…</p>
<p>“W…wait, what?! What’s going on?!”</p>
<p>A second, two seconds, three seconds. Why wasn’t I gone yet?</p>
<p>Had I not been decapitated after all?</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Wh-what the hell?! Didn’t you cut off my head?”</p>
<p class="space-break1">“How is this happening?! I thought I was supposed to be decapitated…!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">I heard the bewildered voices of Dot and Terry. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see their heads rolling gently along the ground, and something covering the base of their necks where the blade had sliced through.</p>
<p>“Pff! Ah-ha-ha! Sorry, my bad! I guess you can’t see too well!”</p>
<p>The kid’s laugh gave me the chills. No sooner did I see his foot appear before my eyes than I felt a tug on my hair and rose into the air. When he brought me level with his own eyes, only then did I finally understand the state I was in.</p>
<p>“Wh-whaaat?! What the hell?!”</p>
<p>From here, I could see the ground below clearly. There lay <em>my own body</em>, twitching and oozing blood from its severed neck.</p>
<p>“What’s happening?! Why am I…? You cut off my head! That’s my body! Why am I still alive?!”</p>
<p>“Heh, pretty cool, eh? I had Slimo cover your neck when I cut off your head. It’s keeping the blood pumping, taking in oxygen from the air, maintaining blood pressure, allowing me to keep you alive. See, it’s even acting as your lungs and vocal cords, which is why you can still speak. And Minnalis’s poison prevented you from dying from shock immediately.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What are you talking about? Don’t just talk gibberish—explain yourself!”</p>
<p>“Ahhh, well, I guess you wouldn’t understand. Even Minnalis was confused when we tried it on a goblin.”</p>
<p>“Maybe that’s normal in your world, Master, but here, people die when they’re killed! Severed heads that can speak are like something out of a horror story!”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not common in my world, either. Actually, it’s <em>more</em> normal for this world, since you already have the undead and such.”</p>
<p>“But the undead don’t talk or breathe!”</p>
<p>“…That’s true, they don’t.”</p>
<p>Once again, the damn kids were having another ridiculous conversation in front of us.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s just say we’ve kept you alive from the neck up. Look, I’ll show you.”</p>
<p>He gave a dramatic shrug and placed my head on the rock where we had just been sitting. Then the sword he was holding melted into nothing, and he hoisted up Terry’s and Dot’s heads by their hair.</p>
<p>Their faces were frozen in expressions of shock. I was sure I was making the same face, too. I could see the transparent blue substance—a slime, apparently—covering our necks. Moving around and pulsating rhythmically within it was a muddy red fluid, which seemed to be our blood.</p>
<p>My head was spinning. It was like he’d turned us into monsters.</p>
<p>“You understand now? Come, I’ve prepared a little show. Not many people get to see this before they die.”</p>
<p>But he was the true monster, playing with our lives, a bone-chilling smile on his lips.</p>
<p>He placed Terry’s and Dot’s heads alongside my own.</p>
<p>“Slimo!”</p>
<p><em>“Kupie!”</em></p>
<p>The slime responded to the kid’s call, and slowly started creeping toward our bodies.</p>
<p>“Wh-whoa, hold on, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>I felt like I’d said that a million times today. The kid didn’t answer. He just smiled as he petted the slime on the head, and said, in a voice devoid of emotion…</p>
<p><em>“Dinnertime.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Kupie!”</em></p>
<p>“No…! Noooooo!!”</p>
<p>At that single word, the slime pounced forward as if it had been waiting and descended upon our bodies.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Noooo!! Stop! Stooop! My body…!!”</p>
<p>There was a series of sickening crunches as the slime compressed our bodies. And it wasn’t just me who screamed out in horror.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Stop! Stop this at once!! If you lay another hand on our bodies, I’ll…! D-do you know who we are?! Stop this at once, I said!!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Wh-what the hell, man…? This…is a dream!! Gyaha! Gyahaha! Yeah, it’s a dream! It’s gotta be! I mean, this don’t make no sense! There’s no way this could all be really happening! Gyahahahahaha!!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">It really seemed like a vision, like Dot said. A terrifying nightmare.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh. Well, what do you think? This is a rare experience, I think, watching your own body be devoured while you’re still alive. I do hope it’s to your liking.”</p>
<p>Just as the Lagonid girl said, we could see exactly what was happening inside the slime’s transparent blue body. We heard the dull crunch of our bones snapping. I saw Dot’s arm get mangled with a crack. I watched Terry’s foot twist and break in two. I witnessed the armor being stripped off my torso, watched my belly burst open and my organs be squashed together like red meatballs.</p>
<p>And every time I watched part of my mangled body being torn out of shape, I felt something inside me crack.</p>
<p>“No… This can’t be happening… It’s not happening, it’s not happening, it’s not happening…”</p>
<p>Terry was the next to break after Dot. He just kept whimpering, “It’s not happening” over and over again.</p>
<p>“Aargh! Please, just stop! We’re sorry! We’re sorry! Please, just stop…! No more…!!”</p>
<p>A strangled voice was all I could manage. My own body was being toyed with, mangled, while all I could do was watch. I was going to lose my mind.</p>
<p>I knew this was the end. But I didn’t want to be driven mad before it happened.</p>
<p>“Hmm, pathetic. You’re already giving up, and you haven’t even felt any pain.”</p>
<p>“Even the goblin was more fun to torture than you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Behind the laughing duo, the scraps of our bodies mixed and swirled within the slime until it was no longer possible to guess whose was whose.</p>
<p>I didn’t get it. I didn’t get it. I just didn’t get it.</p>
<p>Who <em>were</em> they? <em>What</em> were they? Why were they laughing? Why were they just having a friendly chat while I was in this state?</p>
<p><em>“Kyupuh!”</em> After feasting itself on our bodies, the slime spat up a huge metal lump that had been our equipment.</p>
<p>“Grrrrr! What did we ever do to you?!” I roared with fury, but the brat before me didn’t appear unsettled in the slightest.</p>
<p>“Huh? What’re you talking about? Don’t get mad at <em>me</em>. You were going to rape Minnalis in front of me, weren’t you? And then you were going to kill me.”</p>
<p>“B-but, still. This is just too cruel…”</p>
<p>“Cruel? Surely you’re joking. You thought if you were strong, you could get away with anything, and nobody would care as long as they didn’t find out. Well, then you need to accept that if you’re weak, anything can be <em>done</em> to you, and if people <em>do</em> find out, then they <em>will</em> care. This is just the natural consequences of your behavior, don’t you think? Hey, I’m asking you a question.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Don’t sulk. This isn’t cruel. If you’re gonna live by the sword, then you ought to die by the sword. This is a fitting end for scum like you, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“A fitting…end…?”</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>“Listen, Zuily. You mustn’t do bad things. They have a way of coming back to bite you.”</em></p>
<p><em>“</em>Tsk. <em>Yeah, yeah. Whatever, you’re always going on about this karma or whatever.”</em></p>
<p><em>“That’s right, karma. What goes around comes around. Remember that, and grow up into a good strong girl…”</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Suddenly an old memory came to mind. A conversation with the village priest from when I was just a child.</p>
<p>I see, so this is karma.</p>
<p>These were all the bad things I’ve done coming back to bite me.</p>
<p class="space-break3">…So what?!</p>
<p class="space-break3">“No, no, no, no!!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">I don’t want to die! I don’t want to die! I DON’T WANT TO DIE!!</p>
<p>Not like this!!</p>
<p>Ever since I’d become an adventurer, I knew I would die by the side of the road somewhere. But I never expected anything this awful! This is just too much!</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose it’s about time to say good-bye. Minnalis, Slimo, and I will take one each.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master!” cried the beastfolk girl as she reached into her item pouch, retrieving an old, rusted mallet.</p>
<p>“It’s a dream, it’s all a dream! A nice, lovely drea—”</p>
<p>“Bye-bye!”</p>
<p>“Gplh!”</p>
<p>There was the swish of the hammer in the air and a sickening splat from beside me. Dot’s hot, sticky blood was plastered over the side of my face.</p>
<p>“Next, Slimo. Time for your dessert.”</p>
