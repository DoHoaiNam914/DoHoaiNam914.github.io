<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter001">A Reunion Unbeknownst and the Scales of the Heart</a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t had been several days since we’d left the capital. The road ahead stretched on forever. The only thing that had changed was that the sparse forests around us were turning gradually into denser woodlands.</p>
<p>“Ahhh… I knew it. It’s too late for me,” I said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Hmm? What is?” asked Minnalis.</p>
<p>“Oh,” I replied. “I mean I’m never going to feel safe walking down the middle of the road in broad daylight without a disguise or anything.”</p>
<p>During my first life, my travels across the land had never gone this smoothly, especially not after the princess started sending people to assassinate me. I usually traveled at night to take full advantage of the Clothes of Dark Spirits, then either used all my mana and concentration to conceal my presence with my soul blades or used the Contrarian’s Blade of Mirrors to alter my appearance. I rarely opted for the latter method, though, because there was only one form I could adopt, that of a pretty young girl, which wasn’t ideal for lying low.</p>
<p>Of course, few people realized it was me in that form, if they even saw me at all. Still, it was better not to attract attention whenever possible, and besides, that was without factoring in the repulsive men who I drew in with that guise.</p>
<p>“So you see,” I explained, “I avoided the road during daytime, and if I had to go somewhere, I’d wear a hood and blend in with a traveling caravan so nobody would recognize me.”</p>
<p>What a miserable life of traveling, if you could even call randomly fleeing “travel.”</p>
<p>“To be honest, it doesn’t even feel right hanging out with you. Even when I mingled with the caravans, I never conversed or interacted with anyone else.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t trying to insult her. It was just that traveling alone had been my life for so long, it was going to take some time to readjust.</p>
<p>“But what’s that got to do with it being too late?” Minnalis asked, confused.</p>
<p>“I just mean I feel like I’ve had to live like a criminal my whole life, always anxious when out under the heavens.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t even as if I’d done anything to be ashamed of. My parents always told me to hold my head up high for the Sun Deity, and now I couldn’t even do that. It was a small promise in the grand scheme of things, but it was another one I’d broken.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose I’m probably a lost cause anyway, given I’m planning on torturing and killing all my old friends.</p>
<p>“The heavens?” asked Minnalis.</p>
<p>“Oh, I guess that sounds weird ’cause you guys don’t worship the sun and the sky here,” I mused.</p>
<p>Maybe there <em>was</em> some cult somewhere that deified the sun if I looked hard enough, but it seemed like no major religion did, at least to my knowledge. The religions of this land venerated either God himself, or something known as “the Spirits.” Though moral priorities differed slightly, that was pretty much the only difference.</p>
<p>“In my old land, we believed the sun was a god. If you did something bad, then you were supposed to feel guilty about showing yourself before it.”</p>
<p>“Huh. What a strange belief.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. In fact, it wasn’t just the sun. In my country, they said that gods dwelled inside all sorts of things, like tools. It was inconsistent for sure.”</p>
<p>I mean, I could see the good in that belief, but it was certainly very bold of us to decide that gods would deign to take up residence in our old pots and pans. Anyway, I wasn’t sure how to reconcile this with the fact that I knew a god, or rather, a goddess. At least, that’s what she called herself.</p>
<p>“Whatever, I’m sure I’ll get used to it soon enough. You don’t need to worry about anything.”</p>
<p>Humans are an adaptive species. Just as traveling alone had become a habit, journeying with Minnalis would surely become one, too. And in any case, I don’t intend to let ethics cloud my judgment. I’ve learned the hard way just how big of a mistake that can be. Besides, I think pretty much everyone would agree I’m on the path of evil now.</p>
<p>“Let’s change the subject,” I said, stopping in my tracks. “Here’s the first lesson of the day.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?!”</p>
<p>Minnalis’s ears perked up, and her face became deathly serious. To spice up our travels, I’d taken to engaging in a training of sorts to increase her base stats. She knew this meant another lesson was about to begin.</p>
<p>“There’s a fine target around here somewhere. Find out where. You’ll never uncover it relying solely on your physical senses. Its camouflage and stealth abilities are off the charts,” I clarified when I saw her nose twitching.</p>
<p>Her approach wasn’t a bad one. As a beastfolk, her physical abilities were higher than those of humans, and that extended to her senses as well. Tracking via smell was second nature to her, but we couldn’t let it stay that way. Get dependent on a single method, and you’ll be screwed when you face an enemy that it doesn’t work on. Having strengths and weaknesses is only natural, but if you allow a strength to be defeated, or a weakness to go unmitigated, it could cost you your life. That’s something an enemy could take advantage of.</p>
<p>“Monsters can’t hide their mana,” I hinted. “You should be able to pick up on those traces and then track it like you normally would.”</p>
<p><em>Is this too advanced for her right now?</em></p>
<p>The creature wasn’t impossible to find; I had just done it myself. I’d been scanning the area, looking for something that could serve as Minnalis’s target, the whole time we were walking.</p>
<p>It’s hard to explain what sensing magic feels like. It’s like straining to see through a dense fog, or trying to pick out a single voice from indistinct mumbles coming through a wall. Sometimes, it’s like trying to grab mist. And because it was so hard to put into words, practical experience was of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>“The monster shouldn’t be so hard to defeat once you find it, and its meat is pretty tasty. I think we’ll have it for lunch.”</p>
<p>Despite appearances, it was delicious. Plus, in this day and age, even food products in Japan are genetically modified. If something could be done about the way it <em>looked</em>, then perhaps it could earn a coveted S rank on my monster meat tier list.</p>
<p>“Oh! I found it! It’s over there!” cried Minnalis.</p>
<p><em>“Greeeeee!!”</em></p>
<p><em>Fwip.</em> Minnalis’s throwing knife flew toward the base of a tree. From seemingly out of thin air, a large frog, about the size of a boar, began materializing into view. It was a Pelia Grok, a mutated variant of a much smaller species known as a Pure Grok.</p>
<p>“I-is this thing really edible, Master?”</p>
<p>Since coming here, I had been subjected to all kinds of weird and wonderful cuisines and eaten things that would make any normal high schooler turn up their nose. Now I could handle just about anything, as long as it wasn’t insects. So it wasn’t because our target was a frog that Minnalis reacted the way she did. There was some other visual element that shocked her.</p>
<p>“You’re saying that because of its color, right?”</p>
<p>It was not a friendly-looking color. Its slimy body was purple and green, with red and black patches. Warts covered its body, and its flabby pink tongue lolled from its mouth. Its appearance just screamed “I’m poisonous! Don’t eat me!” I don’t know how the first person discovered this creature was edible, but I commend their courage.</p>
<p>“Well, I can vouch for its taste; I’ve had it myself. I can guarantee it’s at least two ranks above what we’ve been eating so far.”</p>
<p>As long as I had good food in my belly, I could forgive the other hardships of travel. I couldn’t wait to finally sink my teeth into some juicy meat. The forests around the capital were cleared out by the royal knights on the regular, so only the weakest, most common enemies like goblins, garm, and boars could be found there. And I’m sorry to say that the meat on those enemies left much to be desired. Barely any parts of goblins and garm were even edible. I’d heard of one land where goblin testicles were considered a delicacy, but I wasn’t interested in trying that myself.</p>
<p>So I guess we found something besides insects I won’t eat, then.</p>
<p>“Is that right, Master? In that case, I’m looking forward to it,” said Minnalis, sounding a little excited.</p>
<p>“Well, we’ll just sprinkle some salt on it and spit roast it. We’ve had nothing lately but soup.” I walked over to the Pelia Grok and lifted it up by the legs. Its body was coated in slime, and it was cold to the touch. “Minnalis, there’s a trick to preparing this. I’ll show you. Could you get the table?”</p>
<p>“Of course, Master.”</p>
<p>Minnalis set up a large, kidney-shaped table she pulled from her rucksack. Before being enslaved, Minnalis had always cooked for her ailing mother. It was an insult to even compare her skills in the kitchen with those of a casual cook like me.</p>
<p>“Hmm, now that I’m getting a good look at it, it is a bit slipshod.”</p>
<p>The table’s construction was far from perfect. It was little more than a cross section of a large tree with some legs attached. I’d improvised it so that Minnalis would have <em>something</em> to work with, but it was clearly unfinished. Granted, the table was perfectly smooth and solid as a rock thanks to my S-rank abilities, but you couldn’t change the fact that it was just untreated wood. It wasn’t waterproof or varnished, so it would rot with time.</p>
<p>“We’ll buy a real table when we get to Elmia,” I assured her.</p>
<p>“What? But, Master, you put so much effort into making this one for us…”</p>
<p>“That’s fine; this was only supposed to be temporary, anyway.”</p>
<p>After rubbing some salt into the body of the Pelia Grok, I used the Fairy’s Blade of Water to wash away the slime. Then, slicing open its back with my knife, I separated the meat, bones, and giblets.</p>
<p>“That should do it. Can I leave the rest of the cooking to you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Of course, Master.”</p>
<p>I handed her the skewers I had made from a few branches and left her to set about preparing the large cuts. By the time I had finished wiping down the table, I could smell the salted meat slowly roasting over the fire.</p>
<p>“Mmm, that smells good.”</p>
<p>“They’ll be done soon, Master. Give me a minute.”</p>
<p>Minnalis had taken care of most of the process. I suppose that wasn’t such a bad thing, since the finished product would turn out better this way.</p>
<p>“Sounds good.” I sat down on the ground across the bonfire from her. The crackle of fat as it fell into the fire set my stomach growling. “Mmm, are you sure it’s not done yet…?”</p>
<p>“No. Frog meat has to be cooked a little longer,” she snapped back, a serious glint in her eyes.</p>
<p>“O-oh.”</p>
<p>Just then, I sensed something else nearby.</p>
<p>…I guess the scent of cooked meat must have attracted it.</p>
<p>But then what popped out of the bushes was a small garm pup. Just as Minnalis was about to toss a knife at it, I stopped her. “Hold on.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Master?”</p>
<p>“It’s not hostile… I think it’s just hungry. It looks like it hurt its leg and can’t hunt.”</p>
<p>I took a piece of uncooked meat and tossed it over to the garm. The monster poked it a few times with its front paw, before tearing into it viciously.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re a hungry little fella. Wait there, I’ll fix up your leg for you.”</p>
<p>Trying not to frighten it, I conjured up the Nephrite Blade of Verdure behind my back and cured the garm’s wound while it was distracted by the food.</p>
<p>“Should you be doing that, Master?” asked Minnalis.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t kill a baby dog just for the experience points, even if it <em>is</em> a monster.”</p>
<p>I doubted the creature understood what I’d been saying, but still it gave me a lick as if in thanks.</p>
<p>“Now you’ve had your food, shoo. This is human territory. It’s not safe for a little one like you.”</p>
<p>The pup looked a little bewildered as I tried to shoo it away, before turning and fleeing into the depths of the forest.</p>
<p>“…Weren’t you going to keep it?” asked Minnalis. “I thought that’s why you helped it…”</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “That was…just on a whim.”</p>
<p>That’s right, it was just on a whim.</p>
<p>A whimsical favor to the garm cub I’d condemned <em>during my last life</em>. I saved this one because it pained me to see it die and do nothing to help.</p>
<p>“I befriended a garm pup once before. But it ended up dying because of me.”</p>
<p>This whelp, weak and hungry, had reminded me of that creature. I couldn’t just do nothing. Even though I knew that the two garm had nothing to do with each other.</p>
<p>“It was just an impulse. There’s no significance to it whatsoever.” I turned back toward the fire and reached out for a bite to eat.</p>
<p>“Master, it’s not ready yet.”</p>
<p>“…Fine,” I relented, my arm dropping dejectedly by my side. “I’ll wait.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">We trekked a bit farther that night and found somewhere suitable to set up camp. Lying beside the fire, Minnalis turned over beneath her blanket. I was tired, too, but on the road, you never knew when monsters could strike. What’s more, we were a party of only two. It would be easy for a pack of monsters to attack us, especially after sunset.</p>
<p>I used to put up barriers while I was sleeping during my fugitive days, so I’d never needed to worry about keeping watch. Now, however, I had way too little MP, so there was simply no way I could keep a strong enough barrier active until morning.</p>
<p>I brought a tea of medicinal herbs to my lips.</p>
<p>“Ow! My tongue…”</p>
<p>I grimaced. The drink was just hot enough not to burn me, while the heat and bitterness kept me awake. It was made from fuzzyweed, a wonderful fantasy plant that eased drowsiness and fought off exhaustion. It grew almost everywhere and was incredibly cheap, even in the cities, so it was a powerful friend to beginner adventurers everywhere. The problem was it tasted like pure cocoa and coffee and matcha mixed together, and you had to brew it right after sundown and drink it immediately, while the water was still piping hot, or else it lost its effects. It was a cruel prank of a drink, but my only other options were to buy expensive magic items for setting up a barrier, hire a wizard to do it for me, or travel as part of a larger party and set up a proper watch order. In fact, this was one of the original reasons I’d gone after a slave—before I found Minnalis, my partner in crime, that is. As long as you could put up with the taste and heat, fuzzyweed allowed you to travel with a party of only two people. That meant it was always in demand.</p>
<p>My shift ran from sundown to midnight, while Minnalis watched the camp until sunrise. I glanced at the hourglass marking the length of my shift. There was still a lot of sand in the top. It looked like it would be several more hours before I could drift off.</p>
<p>“Hurgh… It’s so bitter…,” I said under my breath. I didn’t want to wake Minnalis, but I just had to complain to someone, even if that was just myself. The fire crackled. I added some sticks to keep it from going out, then put down my wooden cup, and watched the flickering flames. It was a good time to sort through some things in my head.</p>
<p>The first thing that came to mind was the incident at the walls of the capital.</p>
<p>I had to stop focusing on people who had nothing to do with my revenge. This was important; if I didn’t draw a line, the boundaries of my revenge would blur. It would mean that I wasn’t confident enough in my conviction.</p>
<p class="space-break1">When is it revenge, and when is it just taking out my anger?</p>
<p class="space-break1">If I left that line undefined, eventually, like a poison, it would lead to doubt. And if that doubt went unchecked, I would soon become nothing more than a monster, destroying anyone and everyone in my path.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Revenge is an emotion.</p>
<p class="space-break1">We set out on the path of vengeance to prevent that feeling from destroying us. If we gave in to it and let the heat inside us take control, it would never extinguish, not even long after putting all our foes to death.</p>
<p class="space-break1">It would break us completely. We’d never be human again… At that point, we may as well be dead.</p>
<p class="space-break1">So I wouldn’t cross this line I drew. Since I didn’t want to lose myself to hate, the only people I should plan to exact my vengeance upon were those directly connected to me. It was going to be impossible to prevent some unrelated parties from getting caught in the cross fire, though, and that, I had no problem with. I wouldn’t stay my blade if it brought me closer to taking out my true foes or if it was necessary for my survival. Any hesitation I had on that front had died long ago, before I did, on the road of my previous journey.</p>
<p>The important word was balance. Fail to control the anger in my heart, and I’d lose myself to destruction. But try too hard to save everybody, and I’d spread my efforts too thin and lose it all.</p>
<p>That’s why I’d stopped using good and evil as a basis for my decisions.</p>
<p>“It’s not the whole world I swore revenge on. There’s no point in torturing people who have nothing to do with me.”</p>
<p>I said it aloud, gave those thoughts form, so that I wouldn’t forget it. That’s right. It’s not the whole world. I swore revenge on my old comrades. They’re the ones who double-crossed me.</p>
<p>I had already misjudged who my enemies were the first time around. I would not make the same mistake twice.</p>
<p>“Oh, how much easier it would be if I really did hate the world…”</p>
<p>Things would have been much easier. I wouldn’t have had to be selective; I could just run around slaughtering whatever I came across. That’s probably what I would have done if I’d never met Leticia. If all that ever mattered to me was getting back to my world.</p>
<p>When I first came here, it didn’t feel real. A world of stats and levels, of magic and skills. Ferocious monsters of all shapes and sizes that gave you experience when you killed them, allowing you to reach superhuman levels of power. Potions and magic that could heal wounds, even regrow lost limbs. It was like I’d been trapped in a game. One where all I had to do was defeat evil and restore peace to the land.</p>
<p>If I’d been betrayed without ever realizing this world actually was real, I probably would have seen the people of this land as nothing more than tools. I could easily imagine what I would look like then. A monster, joylessly executing my retribution until the entire world ended up consumed in flames.</p>
<p>I’m sure it would be very easy. But it would also give me no delight, no satisfaction. It would amount to little more than a senseless act of self-destruction; a dramatic suicide.</p>
<p>“Crap.”</p>
<p>The bonfire collapsed, bringing me out of my reverie. It had gotten quite cold now, and I hurriedly threw on another few dry-looking twigs.</p>
<p>“…Ugh. It’s so bitter…”</p>
<p>My cup of fuzzyweed decoction was still pretty full. I took another sip and pulled out a handful of dried vegetables I had picked up in town to take away the bitterness.</p>
<p>Next, I took a fairly long branch in my hand and activated the Fairy’s Blade of Water. Reforming it into a knifelike blade, I set about sharpening the stick to a point. I then stuck some of the dried vegetables to it, roasted them gently over the fire, added some seasonings, and sucked on them.</p>
<p>The night was still young.</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>I could think about my troubles all I liked, but the answers wouldn’t come out of thin air. I decided to change the subject, so I set about figuring out how to assign all the experience points I had gathered along the road since leaving the capital.</p>
<p>For starters, I paid off my debt in full and got myself a few points away from level 2. That way, I could level up quickly if need be. I had to think about when the best time for that would be, though, since I could boost my stats quite a lot just by unlocking soul blades. There was one that temporarily lowered my stats in exchange for an EXP boost, but it also reduced the attack of all other weapons to zero while it was equipped, so I was simply far too weak to use it until I got a little stronger.</p>
<p>After that, I had about 25,000 points remaining.</p>
<p>“Hmm… What should I do…?”</p>
<p>The enemies around these parts weren’t bad in terms of experience, but the problem was they were hard to encounter. Since I planned to stay here in Elmia for a little while, there wouldn’t be a lot of experience to go around.</p>
<p>And so it came to pass that despite a lot of head-racking and hand-wringing, I had left my experience points unallocated until now, prompting Minnalis to ask me, “<em>Master, are you a wuss?</em>” I wanted to cry. Not piss myself, though.</p>
<p>“I feel like Minnalis has gotten a lot stricter with me lately…”</p>
<p>While she still respected the master-slave relationship, it seemed like she sometimes had this aura about her I couldn’t defy. Not that I was expecting her to serve my every whim, but something seemed off.</p>
<p>I let out a brief sigh and poked the fire, and my mind drifted toward the things that had happened along our journey. I had never really paid attention to the world around me last time. It didn’t really matter to me so long as I had food to eat, and I didn’t have time to go off exploring, anyway. So now, when I would buy some trinket of dubious utility or be taken in by the rip-off prices of the food stalls, Minnalis would look at me with that emotionless grin of hers and say, “<em>Master, are you an idiot?</em>” I suppose growing up in a poor village made her reluctant to waste money even when we could.</p>
<p>The only times she smiled genuinely were when she was coming up with new and exotic forms of revenge, putting them into practice against some random goblin she’d found, or occasionally, when she was in a good mood, getting MP-drunk and reveling in a brain-dead stupor all night.</p>
<p>In any case, it looked like I’d need to finally make up my mind and decide which soul blades to unlock. And so, after much umming and ahhing, I went with the Challenger’s Blade of Adversity. My stats were going to be on the low side for a while, so there would be plenty of opportunities to use it, and if it turned out my opponents’ stats were lower, then I could simply switch to another soul blade and avoid the penalty that way.</p>
<p>That had cost me 15,000 experience points, and so I was now sitting at 10,000. I considered unlocking a soul blade that would give me an Agility or MP buff, but I decided against it. If I used these experience points to level up, I could easily get to level 20. I could keep it in reserve so I’d have more leeway to adapt to whatever came my way.</p>
<p>“Let’s leave it there,” I announced, and when I looked over at the hourglass, the top half was completely empty. That had taken longer than I’d thought. I moved to wake Minnalis, but she sat up in bed before I even reached her.</p>
<p>“Master, it’s time for us to switch,” she told me.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re already awake.”</p>
<p>“Yes……Master, you sure like muttering to yourself.”</p>
<p>“Wha—?!”</p>
<p>Well, that’s unavoidable, isn’t it? I’ve been traveling solo for so long. It’s like when you live by yourself!</p>
<p>“I don’t mind it during the day, but at night, it’s hard to sleep because I want to know what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>Her poker face I could probably chalk up to that skill of hers. That meant she was probably pretty angry at me.</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>“No need to apologize, just keep it in mind in the future.”</p>
<p>I meekly pulled up my blanket and closed my eyes. It was starting to feel like the balance of power in our relationship was shifting. She would go along with my plans and decisions, as long as she didn’t have any serious objections, but apart from that… Well, it wasn’t as though I didn’t even exist to her. It was more like she was concerned about me, but she expressed that sentiment pretty coldly.</p>
<p>The reason for this behavior was obvious. She didn’t like that I’d put myself in danger back at the capital.</p>
<p>Beneath her exterior, Minnalis seemed a lot more serious than me. I knew I shouldn’t read too much into it, but it did make me wonder…</p>
<p>My head filled with such thoughts, I gently drifted off to sleep.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Looks like you’re fast asleep, Master.”</p>
<p>After making sure he wouldn’t wake up, I turned off my “Iron Mask” skill and set about combing his hair like usual.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, how is Master’s voice so pleasing to my ears? Has he the blood of a siren in his veins?”</p>
<p>I struggled to keep my voice low. My face, unfettered by the skill I had been previously using, melted into one of pure pleasure.</p>
<p>“I need to buy some sort of magic item that can record his voice and preserve it for all eternity…”</p>
<p>No, that’s not a waste of our money. It would be a perfectly sensible purchase… And this is totally unrelated, but I suppose I’ll keep my mouth shut the next time Master wants to buy some useless trinket at the market. Perhaps I could gently coax him into heading somewhere I can find a magic item like that the next time we’re in town.</p>
<p><em>It’s just the snacking I can’t forgive…</em></p>
<p>I always made my displeasure known whenever Master dropped his coin at a food stall. It was <em>my</em> job to cook for him, and no one else’s. I get the ingredients more cheaply and make sure they’re worthy of his plate. And after all that, he has the nerve to say to me “Oh no, I’ll get something in town, it’s fine.”</p>
<p>Oh, what am I saying? My food is nowhere near being fit for his palate. I must improve. “The way to a man’s heart is through his stomach” is apparently what they say. I’ll make sure he doesn’t develop a gut for anyone else but me.</p>
<p>“…But I wish he wouldn’t use disposable cutlery. What a waste. Oh well. I suppose I’ll have to study the bars and taverns to learn what he likes. The food stalls, on the other hand, are a little suspicious. Who knows what they put in their food…?”</p>
<p>I spoke quietly so that even if Master were to wake up, he wouldn’t be able to hear me. I suppose I’ve become more like him, talking to myself in the middle of the night. What a pleasant thought. But since I just told him off for the same thing, it’d be best if he didn’t catch me doing it.</p>
<p>I continued to tend the bonfire, turning those frivolous musings over in my head, and soon enough the night broke into dawn.</p>

<p class="space-break">We continued on our journey, engaging in lively debate about the finer methods of torture, and training ourselves for when we could put those methods into practice, until we eventually arrived at the town of Golet. Our next destination was Elmia, but between us and it lay a vast forest.</p>
<p>We’d found an inn rumored to have good lodgings and rested to ease our weariness. While the bedding wasn’t as soft as the stories had made them out to be, it was still a good-quality inn and a lucky find. There’s nothing better than down duvets and mattresses stuffed with cotton rather than straw.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Master.”</p>
<p>“Mrph… I’m so sleepy… Five more minutes…”</p>
<p>Lucking out was rare. As tourists, we couldn’t exactly expect to get the best information by asking around, and even though I retained memories from my previous life, rating every single lodging in the land was not exactly high on my list of priorities.</p>
<p>That was why I wanted to sink into softness for as long as I could.</p>
<p>“Just let me stay a little longer…,” I mumbled, pulling the soft duvet over my head.</p>
<p>“We have to be up early today! Didn’t you want to go to the Adventurers Guild?” snapped Minnalis, cruelly stripping me of my heavenly fleece.</p>
<p>“Nooooo… Give it back…”</p>
<p>“No. This is mine now—I mean… Never mind, just get up.”</p>
<p>Minnalis tossed the blanket onto her own bed. Then she came for my pillows. Bit by bit, I was robbed of my dear bedding, and when still I clung reluctantly to the bare sheets, she grabbed the side of the bed and lifted it sharply using her beastfolk strength, rolling me out and onto the floor.</p>
<p>“Aaaagh! Owww!”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I could do nothing with the hard ground, and so at last I stood up and confronted the demon in my room.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be so violent, Minnalis!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Master, but you’ve already slept in once!”</p>
<p>…Did I? Hmm, come to think of it, perhaps I did say “Five more minutes” five minutes ago as well…</p>
<p>“Besides,” she went on, “you told me to make sure you woke up this time.”</p>
<p>“Did I? Huh, so I did.”</p>
<p>As my mind cleared, the memory of what I’d said last night returned to me. I hadn’t wanted to oversleep again like I had done in the capital.</p>
<p>There was <em>a particular reason</em> I needed to be up early today. That was why we’d bought a double room. Well, one reason, anyway. The other was Minnalis.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Can you really not stand to be in the same room as me, Master?</p>
<p>“Oh, I see, sometimes boys have to be alone.</p>
<p>“It’s fine, I totally understand.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">…Minnalis had said, with reproachful eyes that proved she didn’t understand, but it shook me so much I agreed to take a double anyway. Now that I thought about it, though, I bet that only made me look even more guilty.</p>
<p>…No, she really did have the wrong impression.</p>
<p>“I already asked the kitchen to make us breakfast while you were sleeping in, so let’s go downstairs.”</p>
<p>“Good idea, let’s get some grub.”</p>
<p>I put a lid on the troubling thoughts that were beginning to surface and expelled the last of the drowsiness from my body with a terrible yawn that seemed to contain all the darkness of my worst nightmares.</p>
<p>Then I got dressed and went downstairs.</p>
<p>I made sure we each waited in the corridor while the other was changing. Minnalis suggested we just do it together to save time, but I would die on this hill. I mean, men, you know what it’s like in the morning, right? Just being in the same room was hard enough. Er, so to speak.</p>
<p>As we feasted on the breakfast provided by the inn, we exchanged our ideas on torture.</p>
<p>“I still think being slowly devoured alive is the worst way to go.”</p>
<p>“You do seem to be partial to that one, Minnalis. For me, it’s less about the death and more about seeing them suffer. Some people have low pain tolerances, while others don’t feel it at all. There would be no point torturing the latter with physical wounds. They could die before they even realized what was happening, and then it’s game over.”</p>
<p>“Good point, Master. We want them to expire in misery and regret. To see their faces warped with…”</p>
<p>Of course, we were careful not to let anyone nearby hear what we were talking about. Minnalis wasn’t currently hiding her ears and tail, and her rabbit ears flopped around as she spoke. I had told her to stop concealing them around the time we passed through Dotre.</p>
<p>Beastfolk were oppressed in the Orollea Kingdom, but it wasn’t as if everyone in the country hated them. In fact, beastfolk adventurers traveled through towns and villages outside the capital all the time. They had full citizenship and were treated just like anyone else. The only people who despised them were the nobility in the capital. Most of them had never even seen a beastfolk before and just assumed they were an inferior species.</p>
<p>That was why beastfolk were treated so badly in the capital and why there was such a bustling black market trade for them; curious aristocrats wanted to purchase one without anybody finding out.</p>
<p>In that sense, Minnalis had been quite unlucky. Perhaps the village she’d grown up in had been an isolated settlement of bigots. There were even some in our current town. Not a lot, but some.</p>
<p>I suppose I had been staring at her for a while, as she asked, “…Are you worried, Master? About my ears?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? I think they’re fine,” I said. “They’re pretty cute. You look good.”</p>
<p>Even those who discriminated against beastfolk would find Minnalis quite beautiful. In fact, this world was full of gorgeous people compared to ours, and yet even among them, she stood out as the cream of the crop. She could give my little sister a run for her money.</p>
<p>Around these parts, there was almost no prejudice against beastfolk, and the odd merchant or adventurer would give Minnalis a passing glance, before noticing the Slave Brand on her neck and leering at me. When that happened, a frigid glare from Minnalis was often enough to send them packing. And if those men happened to be with women of their own, the aftermath was always a riot to watch.</p>
<p>“O-okay. Um… Are we going to the Adventurers Guild today?”</p>
<p>“Mm, yeah. We’re quite far from the capital now. It’s only a little farther to Elmia.”</p>
<p>Word of our deeds wouldn’t have traveled this far out, and we needed the status and privileges that being a recognized adventurer bestowed. As a hero, I’d had access to those benefits the first time around without even having to lift a finger, but now I was going to build it all up again myself. The top-ranked adventurers received some very nice perks, but I couldn’t afford to rise through the ranks too quickly, or I’d draw unwanted attention. It was quite the conundrum.</p>
<p>Well, we’d cross that bridge when we came to it. First things first, I needed to register and get my foot in the door.</p>
<p>“Hmm…this breakfast is just all right…”</p>
<p>The portions were large enough, and it wasn’t totally inedible, but there was a quality to the mouthfeel I couldn’t quite describe. Honestly, Minnalis’s cooking was leagues above this mush.</p>
<p>“I agree, Master. I was wondering why this place wasn’t more popular. It’s cheap, and the beds are good… Now I know.”</p>
<p>She took another bite of her food and pulled a face very difficult to put into words.</p>
<p>We’ll pick something up in town for supper.</p>

<p class="space-break">After taking care of breakfast, we set out a little earlier in the day than usual. Our destination was the Adventurers Guild. Our mission, to register me as a member.</p>
<p>The guild connected adventurers with people who needed things done. It existed in every country and was a completely neutral institution founded on the tenets of freedom, power, and exploration. It guaranteed recognition for its members and moderated disputes between them and their clients. In other words, it was a freelancer agency for people with swords.</p>
<p>Now, the word <em>adventurer</em> had quite a ring to it, but the actual job wasn’t so glamorous. Gathering herbs, picking up trash, collecting rent, investigating cheating spouses, smuggling letters, and escort duty were the kinds of odd jobs you were expected to do, and unless you had a contract, you’d likely never work for the same client twice. Work was unsteady and irregular, so your income and lifestyle as an adventurer were constantly in flux.</p>
<p>That said, you only had to deal with those sorts of tasks when starting out. An adventurer’s primary task was the slaying of monsters and the collection of their materials. Once you leveled up enough by killing goblins and garm, you got to the point where you could start raking in the dough by taking on stronger monsters. Of course, they wouldn’t send you into battle against the most dangerous enemies right away. Adventurers were divided into categories based on their exploits, and you could only take on work that you were strong enough for.</p>
<p>Excluding the bottom rank of apprentices not yet old enough to become adventurers, who were sometimes called G rank, the lowest official one was F, and this was where you’d find your goblin- and garm-slayers. From here, you worked your way up the rungs by proving yourself, until eventually you could ascend to the highest rank of SSS. Similarly, all identified monsters were given a grade from F through SSS, sometimes appended with a plus or minus to indicate where they fell within that classification. It was this rank that determined whether an adventurer was suited for taking on a particular foe.</p>
<p>All this meant was that while you were a low rank, you saw a lot of danger, but didn’t get any of the juicy jobs.</p>
<p>Adventurers who attained the title of SSS were regarded as legends. But only a small fraction could kill enough dragons and clear out enough dungeons to get that far. Most people either died in the attempt or found a level they were comfortable with and stayed put.</p>
<p>Still, the profession was in no risk of dying out so long as there were people looking to make a name for themselves, or who had no other avenue of employment. All you needed to become an adventurer was to be over fourteen years of age and able to pay the registration fee of a couple large silver coins—about the cost of a single meal.</p>
<p>You didn’t need connections or riches; no distinguished career or birth. You could even take the fee on credit if you had no money at all, so even an orphan bereft of worldly possessions could become one.</p>
<p>For that reason, adventuring was also seen as an occupation for those who couldn’t find safe and stable employment, or as a home for people who rejected that lifestyle.</p>
<p>Now, getting back to the point, scoring an adventurer’s ID papers for ourselves would come with many benefits. First, and perhaps this went without saying, we could prove our identity. The four powers that ruled this continent were the kingdom, land of human supremacy; the beast lands, land of beastfolk supremacy; the empire, a meritocracy; and the Church. Lost in the cracks between these four titans were several smaller and mostly inconsequential nations. Having the status of an adventurer in good standing with the guild made traveling from one country to another much smoother. Citizens without status were not permitted to dawdle too long in large cities; a stay longer than ten days required a proof of character of some sort.</p>
<p>Second, adventurers were exempt from civic entry tax. In some ways, this was a no-brainer. If they had to pay every time they wanted to enter and leave a city, then their services would become prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p>And third, there was an unspoken rule that you didn’t pry too closely into an adventurer’s history.</p>
<p>There were nobles whose houses had fallen into ruin, ex-criminals who had put their old lives behind them, aristocrats and royalty seeking to hide their true identities. People who changed their names and took up a life on the road. Everyone knew you never asked questions about an adventurer’s past. There were many in this line of work who preferred that such things remained secret forever.</p>
<p>It was perfect for a couple of fugitives like me and Minnalis. Well, I guess technically, that was just me.</p>
<p>The first and third points were what I was after. The second point was probably more what Minnalis was interested in.</p>
<p>“By the way, Master, how come we need to go to the guild so early in the morning?” asked Minnalis. The sun had not even fully risen, and many shops were still getting ready for business.</p>
<p>“Like I said, we want to avoid the clichés.”</p>
<p>All sorts of things could happen when you signed up to be an adventurer. Some of the old hands start giving the new guy some trouble, one thing leads to another, and suddenly everyone’s got a favor to ask of the guild’s new rising star. I’m sure you’ve all seen it a dozen times before, and I have no intention of rehashing that old, worn-out trope. Besides, I had enough of being people’s slave the first time around.</p>
<p>“We really don’t want to get into a fight. For now, we just want to keep as low a profile as possible. That’s why we’re going in early, so that there won’t be so many people.”</p>
<p>“Huh… I suppose I have heard of things like that happening…” Minnalis tilted her head, apparently unconvinced.</p>
<p>In the stories read in this world, upstart heroes would often run into their first major challenge while registering at the guild, so she definitely knew what I was getting at. She probably just thought I was acting overly cautious by expecting a fairy-tale-esque plot twist. Well, maybe I was. But only because it did, in fact, happen to me the first time around when I registered at the capital. Just one little fight was enough to land me in hot water with the guild leader, who saw me as “<em>having potential, but a little rough around the edges…</em>” You know how it goes. It was all because I’d needed some social standing besides that of a hero, and I had ended up with a lot more trouble on my plate that I didn’t need.</p>
<p>Anyway, while I was remembering all that, I suddenly found myself standing before our destination. It was a wooden building that towered over its neighbors, with a sign hanging out front depicting the guild’s crest: a sword and a shield marked with a wing.</p>
<p>“Nice, there are even fewer people around than I expected.”</p>
<p>“…Does it really happen that often?”</p>
<p>Minnalis still had her doubts. She didn’t get it.</p>
<p>She <em>just</em> didn’t get it.</p>
<p>“Minnalis, it’s like I’m hexed. Whenever I go to the slums, I get accosted by thugs. It’s the curse of being an otherworlder. All we can do is be aware of it and try to avoid it.”</p>
<p>“Right… I see. Sounds tough.”</p>
<p>Minnalis obviously still didn’t believe me, but she said nothing more than that. Listening to her, even I wondered if I was overthinking things. But it didn’t matter, just so long as everything went smoothly. I walked through the doors with Minnalis by my side and approached the reception desk.</p>
<p class="space-break2">Inside, it was as I expected: not many adventurers had shown up yet. The area we were in was quite large, modeled on a tavern or a restaurant. The few people present already were squinting at the rather <em>sparse</em> pickings on the quest board.</p>
<p>That was typical for the early hours; the new quests were posted just after noon. Why noon, you ask? Well, because then the guild’s tavern could make its money.</p>
<p>Quests were first come, first served, so to get the best jobs you would show up right after they were posted, and then perhaps you’d stick around and grab lunch at the tavern.</p>
<p>Many adventurers took advantage of their flexible working hours to wake up a little later, often skipping breakfast entirely and enjoying a big lunch instead. Though that was more of a time-management issue on their part and not really the guild’s fault. Still, the system did little to discourage it.</p>
<p>“Let’s see…”</p>
<p>After taking a brief glance around, I walked up to the reception desk. The whole thing was constructed out of plywood, with several booths where the receptionists sat. As for the receptionists themselves, they came in two flavors: pretty young women and hulking, great big oafs so strong they didn’t look right sitting at a desk.</p>
<p>Because of their profession’s low barrier to entry, many adventurers were uneducated, or rather, unversed in culture and etiquette. To them, might meant right. Not all adventurers were like this, and people tended to learn the importance of keeping good relations with others as they rose through the ranks. Unfortunately, those who did so were very much the minority, so some of the more <em>heavy-handed</em> receptionists were chosen specifically for their abilities to deal with those unruly sorts. The pretty ladies, of which there were a fair few, were there to counteract that. It wouldn’t do to go scaring off all the freelancers. Besides, some of the more, shall we say, <em>inexperienced</em> adventurers responded better to a lovely face on the other side of the window.</p>
<p>I guess what I’m trying to say is that people are all idiots.</p>
<p>“Good morning! What can I do for you today?”</p>
<p>I headed to the second-closest desk and the woman there greeted me with a customer-winning smile. I could feel Minnalis’s glare burning a hole in my back, but I didn’t care. Why should I have to talk to some meathead this early in the morning? It’s not like looks particularly mattered to me, but if I have the choice then I don’t see why I have to speak to a guy who sucks all the air out of the room. I’m not into men.</p>
<p>“I’d like to sign us both up to be adventurers.”</p>
<p>“Both of you?” The receptionist woman looked me up and down with an evaluating glance. It was too obvious. She must have been new.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but only people ages fourteen and older can register to become adventurers. Until then, you’ll have to be an apprentice. You won’t be able to raise your rank, but you’ll be able to take on odd jobs around the city as long as they’re safe. And while you won’t be able to benefit from the adventurer perks, you can make free use of our special beginner training course, and—”</p>
<p>“Actually, I’m seventeen. And she’s sixteen.”</p>
<p>I hesitated in my response because I was actually over twenty. Or at least, it felt like it. My status screen said I was seventeen, so I guess I had to go with that.</p>
<p>“Huh?” The receptionist lady stared at me with wide-eyed shock. It was a magnificent look of surprise, and one I was well used to by now. It was obvious she was taken aback by me specifically, and not just bad at judging ages. And of course, I wasn’t trying to look young or anything. It was just the magic of being Japanese, I guess.</p>
<p>To be honest, I was going to think nothing of it until I looked over at Minnalis, who was wearing a totally straight face. I’m sure she was laughing at me until she activated her Iron Mask skill. I needed to talk to her about that later.</p>
<p>“Understood. Then could both of you touch this crystal, please?” she asked, producing a small sphere about the size of a baseball. It was a magic item known as an Age-Reading Orb, and as the name suggested, it could detect people’s ages. I didn’t know exactly how it worked, but it could tell if we were fourteen or not.</p>
<p>“This ball will turn red when you touch it if you’re under fourteen. The age restriction is laid down jointly by all the nations, so we couldn’t bend the rules even if we wanted to. Please understand.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t asking her to bend the rules for me. She must have assumed I was a noble or something. Probably because of Minnalis, or rather, the Slave Brand upon her neck. Slaves were expensive, and we were dressed in fairly fancy garb from the capital. It was clear we weren’t exactly short of money.</p>
<p>So she was probably thinking, <em>This whelp is going to tell me he doesn’t care what the Age-Reading Orb says, and that he can use his influence to get whatever he wants.</em></p>
<p>In fact, the first time around, I had already seen someone try to do precisely that.</p>
<p>But even though I knew she was right to take precautions, it still annoyed me to be lumped in with those sorts of people. And even through her perfect smile, I could clearly see the disdain she held for me deep down. Minnalis must have noticed it, too, for she dispelled her Iron Mask and gave a slightly disapproving glare.</p>
<p><em>All right, calm down, me. This actually works to my advantage.</em></p>
<p>I should have expected we’d be scorned because we appeared so young. But that was actually a good thing. The whole idea was we didn’t want to attract attention, and by concealing our true power, we’d succeeded at exactly that. Still didn’t mean I had to like it, though.</p>
<p>I took the Age-Reading Orb in my hand and, sure enough, it turned green.</p>
<p>“Minnalis.”</p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p>I tossed the orb to her, and it glowed green in her hand, too.</p>
<p>“Er… Apologies, but the orb is actually guild property, so please be careful with it…,” cautioned the receptionist, a slight twitch in one eye. Looked like someone had put a stick up her butt. If she’d been placed on duty without any experience, though, then she must have been fairly capable. I considered intimidating her a bit to put her in her place, but I could easily imagine that turning into a whole kerfuffle with one of those meatheads standing in the corner, so I dismissed the idea.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, sorry. It just didn’t look that valuable to me. I’ll try to treat it with a little more respect than <em>the guild shows its adventurers</em>.”</p>
<p>“…Gh.” She offered a pleasant smile, filled with poison.</p>
<p>It seemed she understood what I was really trying to say. <em>I know what you’re up to, and I don’t need magic or skills to do it.</em> Well, they don’t let just anybody run the guild’s help desk. She must have had her head screwed on straight, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>“Let’s just hurry up and see the paperwork, Miss Receptionist.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes. I’ll go fetch it now…” Looking a little flustered, she disappeared into the back.</p>
<p>“Master, you don’t seem to be satisfied letting her off that lightly. Are you sure you didn’t want to teach her a lesson?”</p>
<p>“No. Don’t forget why we came here at the crack of dawn. It’ll all be for nothing if we get into a fight with her.”</p>
<p>“I suppose so, but I do detest the thought of being looked down upon by such an ignorant cow.”</p>
<p>My dear Minnalis seemed even more irritable than usual today. Of course, I felt the same way she did toward the receptionist, but so long as she gave us what we wanted, I really couldn’t care less.</p>
<p>“Here are the registration forms. For one copper, we can fill it out on your behalf. Do you need us to?”</p>
<p>“No, thanks.”</p>
<p>I took the two sheets of paper, handed one to Minnalis, and started filling out the fields. When we had both finished our forms, I handed them back to the receptionist.</p>
<p>“Kaito and Minnalis, ages seventeen and sixteen. Races, human and Lagonid. And you both fight with swords, I see. Party name, ‘Scorn Road.’ Is this correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll make your guild cards now. It’ll take a few moments, so please take a seat.” The receptionist gestured to a sofa. Then she pointed to the bookshelf next to it. “The books there should fill you in on the finer workings of the guild. I can also give you a verbal overview later if you’d like, but since it seems you can read and write, please peruse them while I go and prepare your cards. There are also bestiaries detailing the trophy parts and weaknesses of various monsters, and field guides describing what kinds of medicinal and poisonous herbs you might come across. Feel free to read them at your leisure. I won’t be long.”</p>
<p>After saying all she was required to say, the receptionist left. Since I didn’t feel like twiddling my thumbs, I picked a small text about how to be an adventurer from the shelves. Minnalis was also literate, so I picked out a book for her titled <em>Poisons and Medicines</em>. Her “Intoxicating Phantasm” skill allowed her to create poisons, so perhaps it was worth it for her to learn a bit more about them.</p>
<p>As for me, I had already scanned pretty much every monster, poison, and medicine I’d come across with my Eight-Eyed Sword of Clarity, so I could access the data at any time. What interested me more right now was how the Adventurers Guild operated. The last time, they had elevated me to the top rank immediately once they realized I was a hero, so I didn’t really have a clear handle on how the job actually worked.</p>
<p><em>…Or so I thought.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the book didn’t tell me anything I didn’t already know.</p>
<p><em>“Increase your rank by doing jobs to increase the number of requests you can take on.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Adventurers pay no fee to enter and leave cities.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The guild’s backing makes it easy to cross borders, even in times of war.”</em></p>
<p>There were only a few small details that had escaped my knowledge until now. Apparently, there was a party rank in addition to our individual ranks. A party could be treated as, say, D rank if it could fight on par with a D-rank adventurer, even if was comprised of only E-rank adventurers. This would allow them to take on D-rank quests.</p>
<p>And there was one other point of interest; something that hadn’t mattered to me when I was a hero last time. Entry into dungeons controlled by the countries or the guild was only permitted to adventurers of D rank and above.</p>
<p>That was quite inconvenient for us.</p>
<p>Of course, we were well equipped to handle a dungeon already, but I hadn’t wanted to raise my status so soon for fear of attracting unwanted attention. Especially not now, before I had the chance to return to full strength and take care of anyone who came snooping my way.</p>
<p><em>I’d have to discuss this with Minnalis later</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>Once I finished extracting what information I could from the title, I turned to the back cover, where there was a pyramid chart with seven rungs labeled “Guild Rank Overview.”</p>
<p>Beside each rank was a colored plate and a brief description. From SSS, reading downward, they said:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="ul-list">SSS (White) : Legend, hero of folklore</p>
<p class="ul-list">SS (Black) : Inhuman levels of strength (Only a few every 50 years)</p>
<p class="ul-list">S (Red) : Super genius (Only a few every decade)</p>
<p class="ul-list">A (Green) : Genius (Only a few every year)</p>
<p class="ul-list">B (Yellow) : Top-rate worker</p>
<p class="ul-list">C (Brown) : Veteran Adventurer</p>
<p class="ul-list">D (Blue) : Fully fledged</p>
<p class="ul-list">E (Gray) : Half-fledged</p>
<p class="ul-list">F (Purple) : Practically a beginner</p>
<p class="ul-list">Appr. (None) : Unable to register</p>
</div>
<p>There was no color listed for apprentices since they didn’t receive a plate.</p>
<p>After looking it over, I returned the book to the shelf.</p>
<p><em>Come to think of it, nothing bad has happened yet. Was I overthinking things?</em> I wondered.</p>
<p>Not a second later, I realized I had thought that too soon.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha!! What luck! Never thought we’d come across an Oral Rabbit!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, they’s sneaky bastards, that’s for sure.”</p>
<p>“Let’s turn it in! I can’t wait to see how much it’s worth!”</p>
<p>Three adventurers suddenly walked in through the front door, needlessly belting out their plans to all within earshot. One was a woman with a mole beneath her left eye and curly dark hair that came down to her shoulders. The second, a short fellow with drooping eyes and spiky blond hair. And the third, an educated-looking gentleman with narrow eyes and black hair that was quite long for a man.</p>
<p>As they glanced over at me, a sensation like lightning crawled under my skin. That was something I didn’t expect to feel today. It rose up in my throat, thick and burning, hope and pain mixed together. So bitter, and yet so, so sweet.</p>
<p>“…Ah… I guess I really am cursed.”</p>
<p>Fate had no regard for me. It always came. No matter how much I hacked and hacked to sever it from my existence, I couldn’t cut it away from me. Oh well. If this was destiny, then so be it. I didn’t know if this was good luck or bad, and to be honest, it didn’t make one blind bit of difference. Curse or no, there was only one thing that mattered.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Standing right there were the people I longed to kill.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>Ahhh, who would’ve thought they’d show up here!</em></p>
<p>The woman with the mole, the leader, she was called Zuily. The short, blond-haired scout was Dot, and the black-haired man with the bow on his back was Terry. And there was one missing. One more person who ought to have been with them. The cheeky mage kid who always bragged about how he used to be a noble: Hansel.</p>
<p><em>Dammit, I don’t have enough info on them yet.</em></p>
<p>My shallow relationship with them meant I didn’t have a lot of data to go on. I had originally met them somewhere else, and all I knew about them was their names, how strong they were, and their general personalities.</p>
<p>Ahhh, how frustrating.</p>
<p>I picked up a bestiary and pretended to flip through the pages as I watched them carefully. Sure enough, eventually, one other person entered the guild. A short boy with bright blond hair, wearing leather armor beneath his brown robe, and carrying a staff in one hand.</p>
<p>“…Ahhh, <em>there</em> you are.”</p>
<p>I covered my face with my hand to conceal the grin that rose to my lips unbidden. Through my fingers, I watched as Hansel peered around the guild and approached the reception desk. My blood raced, burning my body as if molten rocks had been dropped into my veins.</p>
<p>I’m sure the right thing to do would be to forgive what these people had done. If they kept to themselves, there’d be no reason to kill them. Perhaps I would have agreed, long before the scales of my heart were tipped.</p>
<p>After all, it wasn’t so clear-cut whether or not these guys had betrayed me. I won’t try to pretend that my blood and flesh were immediately wreathed in flame, transforming into bubbling poison the instant I saw them.</p>
<p>But… Ahhh, it was no use. I couldn’t forgive them. Not a single bit of me wanted to.</p>
<p>I’ll seal them underground and wrap them in cold flames. I’ll use red-hot iron bars to suck all the moisture from their bodies. I’ll burn them blacker and blacker until nothing remains but ash. I’ll kill the bastards. Kill them all.</p>
<p class="space-break1">…The scales of my heart tipped to one side with nary a quiver of hesitation.</p>
