<p>Even if this were a dream. No, because it was a dream.</p>
<p>“Argh, dammit. I really needed that.”</p>
<p>All I could do was cry. It felt like life was telling me that none of it was real. That my shining treasure had no more value than burning garbage.</p>
<p class="space-break2">So yeah. I’m gonna have to kill you after all.</p>
<p>I can’t allow you to get away with this.</p>
<p>Even if I wanted to, I couldn’t. But I don’t.</p>
<p class="space-break2">Perhaps you were deceived. Perhaps you were only doing your job.</p>
<p>Perhaps you didn’t know what you were doing when you attacked me.</p>
<p>But you know…</p>
<p>That place did nothing to you. And you didn’t care how much it meant to me. You didn’t care about the life you snuffed out that night.</p>
<p>To you, it was just a church. An old ruin. Just a field of flowers with a single old tree. And the beast you killed, nothing more than a monster.</p>
<p class="space-break1">But to me, it was one of the few precious things Leticia had left me.</p>
<p class="space-break1">To me, it was a life that could never be replaced.</p>
<p class="space-break1">A memory of bygone days and the existence of a single monster.</p>
<p>…“I didn’t know” just isn’t going to cut it.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Master, it’s unwise to fall asleep here.”</p>
<p>“Mmh…mmrh…”</p>
<p>A sweet voice gently roused me from my slumber, and a soft hand rocked me awake.</p>
<p>“Hwah… Minnalis… Sorry, guess I dozed off.”</p>
<p>I shook my head, and bit by bit, my mind began to clear. We had split up to do the shopping, and I had arrived at our meetup spot a little early. I had sat down on a bench in the town square to stare at the clouds while I waited for Minnalis to arrive, and I suppose the warm rays of the sun must have put me to sleep.</p>
<p>“How did it go? Did you find the things we need?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and I managed to get them quite cheaply, too!” Minnalis smiled.</p>
<p>“Oh, nice.”</p>
<p>Then, as if on cue, both of our stomachs growled. Going by the position of the sun, it was probably about time for lunch, anyway. We had gotten up early, so we were famished by now.</p>
<p>“Let’s get some food while we have the chance.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, I’m quite peckish.”</p>
<p>I stood up from the bench and started walking.</p>
<p>No matter how calm I appeared, I couldn’t get that lot out of my head. All I could think about was what I had seen a few hours prior at the guild.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Minnalis, I’ve decided to end their lives.”</p>
<p>She heard the clank of my scales falling cleanly to one side.</p>
<p>“…Understood, Master.”</p>
<p>She grasped what I was feeling immediately and gave a single nod.</p>
<p>Minnalis shared in my revenge. While the overlap of our memories wasn’t perfect and there were many gaps, this part, at least, seemed to work as intended.</p>
<p>Now, what to do next? I replayed the facts in my head.</p>
<p>When Hansel had arrived at the guild, he hadn’t called out to his teammates. Instead, he had gone right up to the counter next to ours, speaking to a receptionist a little older than the one we had spoken with, perhaps to the point she could be called a veteran.</p>
<p><em>“I’m here to be an adventurer. Proceed with the formalities.”</em></p>
<p>Using my mana to enhance my hearing, I could pick out Hansel’s arrogant voice.</p>
<p><em>He’s here to register…? So he isn’t with Zuily’s party yet.</em></p>
<p>I clicked my tongue silently. It would be hard to keep track of them all if they weren’t together. Not the biggest problem in the world, but it sure made things difficult.</p>
<p><em>“You’re here to be an adventurer? Understood.”</em></p>
<p><em>“If you have time to repeat my own words back to me, then snap to it, woman!”</em></p>
<p>The receptionist shrugged off Hansel’s words and politely continued the conversation, but at each stage, she was hounded by tales of his house’s former glory and unreasonable requests. I didn’t envy her position.</p>
<p>“I think we can leave him be for now, Master.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. What about Zuily and the others?”</p>
<p>While Hansel and the receptionist were locked in pointless struggle, I turned my attention over to the other group. The three of them were eating breakfast together in the tavern at the guild. They had each ordered some rather expensive items and appeared to be enjoying a celebratory meal. Clearly, they had been partying all night prior to this, too, for their faces were still flushed red with alcohol. It seemed they had been returning from an orc-slaying quest when they happened upon the Oral Rabbit and, with great difficulty, took the thing down.</p>
<p>An Oral Rabbit was a rabbitlike monster about a half meter in length, with small horns and a mouth that looked like it had been torn open. Its attack and defense were zero, but it had a ridiculously high speed and an ability that allowed it to camouflage into its surroundings. All this made it a surprisingly tough opponent. Above all, they were rare. With their heightened senses, they could disappear before a predator got close, making them incredibly hard to find. It was for these reasons that, despite their utter lack of combat ability, they were D-rank creatures. However, their meat was a delicacy, their organs had medicinal properties, and the horns and claws could be used to make powerful magic items. Even their fur was prized for its softness and warmth. Therefore, the reward for catching one was high. Just a single specimen could net you enough money to live off for a whole month.</p>
<p><em>So that’s why they’re here so early in the morning.</em></p>
<p>They seemed to have captured the Oral Rabbit late at night, and by the time they’d returned to town, it was still before dawn. Obviously, the guild was closed, and so instead of returning to their lodgings, they had frequented some of their favorite pubs while they waited for the guild to open for the day.</p>
<p>“…” I watched them laugh and make merry, just as they had done when they’d burned my field of flowers to the ground.</p>
<p><em>“Right, then. I’d say it’s about time we turn this thing in.”</em></p>
<p>Zuily rose from her seat and, still a little giddy, made her way over to the reception desk.</p>
<p>“…Hmm? What’s this…?”</p>
<p>Just then, something happened I wasn’t expecting. Zuily headed to the very same desk Hansel was using.</p>
<p><em>“Outta the way, kid. Can’t ya see I got shit to do?”</em></p>
<p><em>“H-how dare you! Are you drunk?”</em></p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha, looks like things are about to get interesting.”</p>
<p>“It appears to be turning into a quarrel, Master.”</p>
<p>Zuily was drunkenly picking a fight, while Hansel seemed quite taken aback by a member of his dream profession acting so unseemly, adding fuel to the fire with remarks like “Aren’t you ashamed to be hammered so early in the morning?” and “This is why you’ll never go up a rank!”</p>
<p>Obviously, Zuily wasn’t one to take this kind of slander lying down, all the more so because it had spoiled her good mood. While content to taunt him at first, she gradually grew more and more heated, spilling out clichés such as “What does a brat like you know?” or “Adventuring isn’t all sunshine and rainbows.”</p>
<p>Under the watchful eye of the guild, their spat was unlikely to become more than a conflict of words; otherwise, they might have lunged at each other’s throats already. Scuffles like this, though, happened every day, and the guild wouldn’t bother intervening in every little argument that transpired on its doorstep.</p>
<p>Which meant there seemed to be no end in sight for these two.</p>
<p><em>Now, I wonder what will happen next…?</em></p>
<p>The timing couldn’t have been more perfect. I had been wanting to find out more about these four so I could think of ways to kill them. All I had to do now was sit back and watch, without drawing any attention to myself…</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Kaito, Minnalis! Your cards are ready!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Read the room, newbie…!!”</p>
<p>The receptionist had been in such a hurry to get back to me she hadn’t even noticed the argument going on right before her eyes.</p>
<p>“Shall I turn her into mincemeat, Master?” asked Minnalis.</p>
<p>I had looked right at her when she called my name. There was no pretending I hadn’t heard her now.</p>
<p>“…No need. In fact, this might work out in our favor.”</p>
<p>I had wanted to watch the fight a little longer, but what was done was done. It wouldn’t even be too bad if I were to get involved. That way, I could guide the flow to my advantage.</p>
<p>In any case, getting our identification came first.</p>
<p>“There are your guild cards. We charge five silver pieces for replacements, so please try not to lose them.”</p>
<p>The receptionist handed us two pale yellow slips about the size of a credit card. They felt like plastic, but supposedly they were made of some special monster material.</p>
<p>“Please let out a little blood onto the cards. That will register them with you.”</p>
<p>The receptionist handed over a pair of needles with which I pricked the tip of my finger. As the blood dribbled onto the card, it shone momentarily with a pale glow, before returning to normal.</p>
<p>“The registration process is complete. The information on the card can only be read by the owner, or by the guild through the use of one of our magic items.”</p>
<p>With the card in my hand, I focused, and sure enough, words appeared on the surface.</p>
