<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ow much value do my memories add to the scales in my heart?</p>
<p class="space-break1">There was nothing special about a certain place, per se. The important thing was the memories I made there, and nobody can ever take those away from me. They are the precious treasures from my first attempt at life.</p>
<p class="space-break1">…That’s why I feel like they’ve now been sullied by dirty hands.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I know you weren’t aware what that place meant to me. And I know you never thought critically about it. But to me, that transgression is more than enough to want you dead.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p class="space-break1">What do you think in a world like this, where you don’t need a reason to bring death upon someone?</p>
<p class="space-break1">Where yesterday’s friends could very easily become tomorrow’s enemies?</p>
<p class="space-break1">In a world mired in filth and despair?</p>
<p class="space-break1">What do you think?</p>
<p class="space-break3">…Are your lives really enough to tip the scales in my heart?</p>
