<p>“The all-around sword-wielder in the lead, the speedy rogue for scouting, and the ranged bowman bringing up the rear, is it?” asked Minnalis.</p>
<p>“Add a powerful mage for some extra firepower, and their party’s decently balanced.”</p>
<p>When I first met them, Zuily was rank B+, and her associates were rank B, assuming they were telling the truth. That was three years in the future now, though. I didn’t know for sure what rank they’d be now, but judging by their stats, I’d say they were at least two below that.</p>
<p>“Now, I can more or less guess from the name, but… Hmm…”</p>
<p>I turned my appraisal abilities on Zuily’s intrinsic ability, Nose for Gold. Apparently it gave her an intuitive understanding of when she was looking at something expensive. The catch here was what exactly it considered pricey. It couldn’t detect an item’s abilities, like my Appraise could. Nor could it sense the magic power residing in an item, or even convey anything about its abilities to her at all. That was why it had reacted to Hansel’s staff, but not to the Eight-Eyed Sword at my hip or any of my other soul blades, even though by any metric, they were far stronger. Nobody could use those weapons except me, and if someone tried to take them, they would vanish. Therefore, in terms of money, they were worthless.</p>
<p>“Now, how should we do it?” I closed the status screens.</p>
<p>“I have a few methods I haven’t been able to test on monsters yet…,” started Minnalis.</p>
<p>“No. Those are useful if we’re trying to think up new ways to make people suffer, but by themselves, they’re mainly for inflicting pain.”</p>
<p>Since we couldn’t talk to monsters, it was sometimes necessary to turn to harsher methods to get them to comply. A sharp dosage of pain was usually enough to trigger their survival instincts and allow us to experiment on them. But that was all Minnalis’s methods could accomplish. Even if we could force our victims to perform complex tasks, it wasn’t great for our purposes because there was no intention behind it, just instinct.</p>
<p>“Simply inflicting pain isn’t the goal here. We want them to be bathed in fear, crying out in madness. Otherwise, it’ll never be enough. So here’s what we’ll do. First, we’ll………… Then we’ll…………, and then finally, we’ll kill them.”</p>
<p>I described to Minnalis one of the many torture methods floating around in my head.</p>
<p>“I see. I certainly agree that would be fun to watch. But is such a thing even possible?”</p>
<p>“Maybe? We can try it on a goblin first. Let’s grab lunch and head out.”</p>
<p>I stood up from the table, and she followed suit.</p>
<p>“But that doesn’t seem like it would be very painful. Can’t we at least give them a little discomfort before they die?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but we have to make sure they don’t hurt too much. If it’s at the point where they prefer death, then we’ve gone too far. Not that I’d have any qualms about handing it to them!”</p>
<p>We were just heading down the stairs of the inn when a voice called out.</p>
<p>“Oh, you just got back. Are you heading out again?”</p>
<p>It was the inn’s owner, the landlady.</p>
<p>I was considering how to respond when Minnalis opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Yes! Master and I are heading out on a date!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">“M-Minnalis?!”</p>
<p>She calmly took my arm as I blinked at her in shock. Then she brought her head close to my ear and said in a low whisper, “Master, I think it would make for a better deterrent if we appeared to be intimate. After all, slaves can still be traded away if their master wishes. Better for me to seem like your favorite thrall with whom you wouldn’t part for all the gold in the world.”</p>
<p>“Mm… I guess you have a point…” I glanced over at her face, but it betrayed not a shred of emotion.</p>
<p>Not a shred. Just making sure you got that.</p>
<p>So wasn’t this going to have the opposite effect? It’s going to look like I, the master, forced an innocent slave girl into acting as my lover. How cringe is that?</p>
<p>“Minnalis, smile. Even if it’s an act. If it’s too embarrassing, then you don’t have to hold on to my arm—just smile, for god’s sake!!”</p>
<p>The landlady’s eyes glazed over slightly as if she were witnessing something very sad. <em>Minnalis, please stop with the poker face! I’m begging you.</em></p>
<p>“Whatever. Let’s just go, Minnalis.”</p>
<p>“M-Master?”</p>
<p>Now it was her turn to be puzzled. It was already too late to clear up the misunderstanding, so I just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. I never thought there’d be an ambush waiting for me. That landlady was going to have to wrong idea forever now.</p>
<p>When I thought about being subjected to her pitiful gaze again, I wanted to cry. Not pee my pants, though.</p>

<p class="space-break">By the time Zuily, Dot, and Terry finally arrived back at their inn, they were all reaching their limits and collapsed into their respective beds, snoring loudly until evening.</p>
<p>It was no surprise. Now that the excitement of catching the Oral Rabbit and their second wind had worn off, exhaustion was starting to set in. For the past few days, they had been out hunting orcs, and then there was the rabbit hunt, the pub crawl, and now the argument with those newbies. Reaching their rooms at last had triggered a wave of exhaustion they simply could no longer resist.</p>
<p>Once they finally shook free of the shackles of drowsiness, the party gathered at their usual pub and raised one more glass to the capture of the Oral Rabbit.</p>
<p>“This is another fine mess you’ve gotten us into, Zuily.”</p>
<p>The sun was still up, and there was a sprinkling of customers at the bar, as Dot interrogated Zuily over tankards of cheap ale.</p>
<p>“Eh, wossat?”</p>
<p>“Obviously, he means those kids,” Terry replied, snacking on a little stir-fry as he enjoyed his drink. “Isn’t this a bit of a duff job at our age? A D-rank party should be after more substantial prey than goblins.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zuily burst out laughing. “Pfft! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Did I say something funny?” asked Terry.</p>
<p>“Who knows?” said Dot, and two of them just stared at her in confusion.</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry, I thought I’d already told you. It’s not a duff job. Far from it. I’d say we’re probably looking at a few gold at least. It might even be our most substantial prey yet. The nose knows.”</p>
<p>Terry and Dot leaned in closer, grinning.</p>
<p>“Oh, for real? Should be able to get some decent grub with that. Even with the Oral Rabbit, we only got enough to pay off half our bar tab.”</p>
<p>“Gold, eh? That would be nice… There’s a magic item I’ve had my eye on for a while…”</p>
<p>“Terry, always going on about your magic items. How about you try buying a woman fer a change, hmm?” advised Zuily, grinning.</p>
<p>Terry shrugged. “You two know that prostitutes aren’t my thing.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’d rather have a girl who kicks and screams,” said Dot. “I don’t see the appeal, myself. Isn’t it annoying if she fights back?”</p>
<p>“That’s the best part. Besides, you can hardly talk, neck-lover. You’ve got a rather weird fetish yourself.”</p>
<p>“…Did you guys forget there’s a lady at this table?” asked Zuily. “You both sound like sickos to me.”</p>
<p>““Says the woman who enjoys torturing other women to death!””</p>
<p>“Touché.”</p>
<p>Their uncouth laughter echoed around the room. In a bar at this hour, they were hardly out of place. Their laughter disappeared among those of the other patrons, and nobody could hear what they were saying.</p>
<p>“So which one’s the target?” asked Dot. “The dumbass who started the whole thing? Or the skinny boy with a sword and his slave girl companion?”</p>
<p>“The dumbass. His staff is quite the artifact. He must be some noble’s stock, probably pretty low in the pecking order if he’s come all this way without a retainer. I’m betting he was disowned for being useless, and they gave him that staff to send him his way.”</p>
<p>“He did seem to talk an awful lot about himself. I could very easily see a noble displaying that level of foolishness,” noted Terry.</p>
<p>“And that kid with the slave girl seemed awfully polite as well,” said Dot. “He must be related to some rich bigwig or be a noble’s bastard son.”</p>
<p>“He’s a no-go,” argued Zuily. “Wasn’t carrying anything of value. He still has to die, so might as well have a little fun with that Lagonid slave of his while we’re at it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sounds good,” said Dot. “Make sure you let me have a go before you break her, boss.”</p>
<p>“Would you let me go first?” asked Terry. “That’s when you get the best screams.”</p>
<p>The party let out another round of sleazy guffaws. Similar conversations were in progress all around the bar. Amid all the noise of revelry, not a single person overheard their conversation.</p>
<p>Not a single <em>person</em>.</p>
<p>“Squeak, squeak.”</p>
<p>Only a mouse, hiding in the shadows beneath the tables.</p>
<p>On the body of that mouse glowed a strange magical mark. A Control Brand.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break">“Ha, I knew it. They are trash.”</p>
<p>I had come out to the forest with Minnalis to survey the location of our battle in advance, and the mouse I had sent to spy on Zuily’s party had brought me some useful information.</p>
<p>Of course, it was no ordinary rodent. It was a monster known as the Small Mouse that I had subjugated using the Monster’s Blade of Hatching.</p>
<p>While the Small Mouse was technically a monster, in terms of combat ability it was no different from a regular mouse, and they littered the streets of big cities posing no particular threat.</p>
<p>The Monster’s Blade of Hatching wasn’t shaped like a sword. The guard and hilt looked normal enough, but the blade resembled an unripe flower bud. It allowed me to control any monster so long as its level was lower than the sum total of all my stats (not including HP and MP), divided by 100. The maximum number of monsters I could control at once was equal to my max MP divided by 100, and I could also store them inside some sort of magical pocket dimension within the blade itself. Last, controlling a monster allowed me to see through its senses.</p>
<p>I had captured Mouse #1 here as a test of my ability, but it turned out more useful than I’d expected. It couldn’t understand, much less speak, any human language, but I could at least communicate “yes” and “no” using gestures. Since it was so small, I didn’t even have to keep taking out and putting away the Monster’s Blade of Hatching in order to store it in that mysterious space.</p>
<p>I could see what it saw, hear what it heard, and it could go nearly anywhere as long as there was a gap big enough for it to fit through. It was truly the perfect spy. And I had sent it out to monitor Zuily’s party as a sort of test run.</p>
<p>“Hmm? What’s that, Master?”</p>
<p>“I just got a report from Mouse #1. They’re having a disgusting conversation.”</p>
<p>“Can you let me listen in as well?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Let you listen? Well, I haven’t tried, but the Holy Sword of Retribution always keeps a magic channel open between us. I imagine we could set it up so you could tune in if we wanted to, but I wouldn’t advise it. I really don’t think you want to hear this.”</p>
<p>I shrugged. Minnalis didn’t appear to like my response.</p>
<p>“That’s not very nice, Master. I may be your slave, but I’m also your partner in crime. I’m not saying you can’t keep secrets, but you really don’t need to worry about me. What would you do if I were to find out only after killing them that they hadn’t suffered enough?”</p>
<p>“O-okay, settle down.”</p>
<p>She stared right into my face. But I had to agree with what she was saying.</p>
<p>“Fine, okay then.”</p>
<p>I tried linking up our magical channels so Minnalis could listen to what Mouse #1 was hearing. There was an electrifying, almost impossible to describe sensation, but it seemed to have worked.</p>
<p>Zuily’s party were still engaged in their repulsive conversation. I could forgive some tactless utterances made in the grip of liquor, but the sorts of things they were saying were beyond that. It made me want to murder them on the spot.</p>
<p>Minnalis listened in with an impenetrable visage, but I could almost see the air around her shimmering with her fury.</p>
<p>Well, we couldn’t stand around listening to them forever. It was time to get on with the inspection. Just as I thought that, Minnalis severed the connection. She looked at me with a smile worthy of the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>“Master, tomorrow is going to be so much fun, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“…Y-yeah.”</p>
<p>Even I was a little perturbed by her daunting smile.</p>
<p class="space-break2">The next day. After eating another similarly iffy breakfast, I left the inn with Minnalis. We didn’t need to be up so early today, so it was a decent while after sunrise, and the town had already come alive.</p>
<p>In a town where people gathered from across the country, many stores were already starting to open around sunrise, and most traders were active by midday, such as hawkers flaunting their dubious wares on the street, novice merchants trying to turn a profit, and shopkeepers selling bargains in their secondhand stores.</p>
<p>Unlike in Japan, people in this world had no way of telling the exact time, so they relied on their internal clocks and the position of the sun to make rough estimates. And yet somehow, the shops all opened at the same time day after day after day. It was very strange.</p>
<p>Although I suppose I don’t have a watch, so I can’t check.</p>
<p>Today’s battle would start at the east gate. It wasn’t far from the inn, but there were a lot of shop stalls along the way. As much as I wished to sample some of the wares, we had no time to waste, so we walked straight to the place we had agreed to meet. However, there was already someone there.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I thought we would be the first ones,” I muttered.</p>
<p>We were still a ways off, so he hadn’t noticed us, but we could make out Hansel standing by the gate. He was speaking to a guard at the checkpoint. His glorious blond hair was easy to pick out, even among this crowd—in this world, they all had wacky hair colors.</p>
<p>“Did you want to be first, Master?” asked Minnalis.</p>
<p>“No, not really. It’s just not what I expected.”</p>
<p>Hansel didn’t really seem like the kind of person to be overly keen about making his appointments.</p>
<p>I suppose I was also a little disappointed since I was going to have to go talk to him now and somehow resist the urge to strangle him to death on the spot. There would be enough of that today as it was.</p>
<p>“Well, the longer we starve, the better lunch will taste. Come on, let’s go,” I urged.</p>
<p>“Yes, Master!”</p>
<p>When we got a little closer, Hansel seemed to recognize us and bounded over, looking somewhat relieved.</p>
<p>“Morning all! You’re running late. I thought I’d come to the wrong place!”</p>
<p>“Late? I thought we were a little early,” said Minnalis. Most adventurers went out hunting a little later. Besides, all we had said was to meet before noon, so there was no “early” or “late” about it.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? You were far earlier yesterday. And I’d ask you not to address me, slave. In fact, it’s probably best you don’t stand too close. I don’t want your beast stench getting on me.”</p>
<p>Hansel complained as if it were what he was born to do. He twisted up his face as he looked at Minnalis, and it was clear he had already labeled her as someone far below him.</p>
<p>It was a gaze I had been subjected to many times when the world had turned against me.</p>
<p>It was a gaze Minnalis had been subjected to many times by the people of her village.</p>
<p>It was a gaze that seemed to be the same wherever you went in this disgusting world.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Anyway,” he said, “about today. Why on earth did you retire early last night? We didn’t get to practice our formations!”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>While I fought to keep the rage from showing on my face, Hansel brought up something else. It was so sudden, I didn’t quite realize what he meant.</p>
<p>“I said, we didn’t get to practice our formations. How are we supposed to act efficiently as a party if we don’t even know each other’s abilities?”</p>
<p>Hansel wore a face like he was explaining all of this to a particularly dim-witted child.</p>
<p>All the thoughts in my head suddenly froze. Why did he think he was just going to be able to join our party? His skull must have been full of stuffing. As I reeled in shock, Hansel took that to mean I had no response. With some sort of proud look on his visage, he continued.</p>
<p>“Well, all we have to do is have you two distract the enemy so they don’t come near me while I’m preparing my spells. Ah, but don’t stray too far from me, got it? I haven’t got the fine-tuning down yet, and the slave aside, I wouldn’t want to be responsible for getting <em>you</em> caught in the cross fire.”</p>
<p><em>…So basically you want us to act as your meat shields, is that it? What a stand-up guy.</em></p>
<p>Having us act as decoys was one thing, but this squirt basically just said he wouldn’t care if he hit Minnalis by mistake. Logically, I could follow his reasoning, but emotionally, I had lost it.</p>
<p>“…” The sentiment on Minnalis’s face, however, vanished almost instantly. She’d been relying on that skill of hers a little too much lately. I’d have to warn her about it later.</p>
<p><em>Ahhh, I just want to crush his stupid little face in my hands.</em></p>
<p>My feelings finally caught up with me, like a stove heating up the box containing my heart.</p>
<p>Hansel’s behavior was not at all strange for the son of an aristocrat. By the time they grew up, they would no doubt have gained a modicum of humility. That was right for this world.</p>
<p>But I no longer cared about what was right and wrong. I’d tried that the first time.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to think about it ethically. I didn’t care if there were reasons why he was like that.</p>
<p>The only thing that mattered was how it made me feel.</p>
<p>“Minnalis, it’s a little early, but let’s preheat the oven,” I whispered.</p>
<p>“Yes, Master!”</p>
<p>I didn’t have to hold back.</p>
<p>I just had to wait. Just a few hours.</p>
<p>And once we’d finished the preparations, we could begin the banquet.</p>
<p><em>…I will make sure you feast on despair before you die.</em></p>
<p>While Minnalis hung her head in mock shame at Hansel’s words, I watched a grin spread across her lips. Her emotions had become too much for the Iron Mask skill to conceal.</p>
<p>…Did my saying we could begin make you that happy, Minnalis?</p>
<p>Ahhh, what am I saying? Of course it did.</p>
<p>I know because we feel the same joy, the same pleasure.</p>
<p>Her mana started to take on an ominous hue.</p>
<p>“…So do you understand now why you should be impressed with me?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, sir. Very much so.”</p>
<p>While Minnalis worked her magic, Hansel seemed quite oblivious, instead rattling off all the spells he’d learned and what was so great about them. Minnalis obviously had no interest and kept her responses perfunctory. We could easily confer among ourselves while Hansel was enraptured with his speech, but I decided it would be best to let Minnalis concentrate for now.</p>
<p>“Indeed you should be. But that’s not all! Heed my words, for one day my name shall be known throughout the kingdom—nay, throughout all the lands…!”</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>“…Corrupting Needle.”</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">And with those words, Minnalis’s spell was complete. The weapon made of her hatred flew through the air, all but invisible to everybody else.</p>
<p>“Hmm? What’s that? A bug?”</p>
<p>Hansel’s loud mouth finally stopped moving. He put his hand to his neck, but there was no mark. Or rather, there was, but it was far smaller than a bug bite.</p>
<p>Corrupting Needle was a spell Minnalis had invented that, as the name implied, created a tiny needle out of frozen venom. It combined the poisons she made with Intoxicating Phantasm and an ice needle produced with the help of her relatively high affinity for ice and dark magic. We’d hit upon the idea in conversation together after leaving the capital and had managed to find the time to develop the spell on the way. It was difficult to control, but because of its small size and the minuscule amount of mana contained within it, it was almost impossible to detect with physical or magical senses. It melted immediately after poking a hole in the target, whereupon the poison entered the body. However, the icicle itself was not particularly strong and could be blocked by all but the weakest armor. Given the tendency of beastfolk magic to disintegrate over long distances, the spell was quite limited in its use and not nearly as versatile as we had hoped.</p>
<p>The ability to infect an unaware target, however, more than made up for its shortcomings. We only had one day. It was very important that no one catch on to what we were up to until it was too late.</p>
<p>“Oi, oi, what’s all this? You got here early.”</p>
<p>As if on cue, Zuily and her gang showed up.</p>
<p>“Didn’t fancy making your elders wait? That’s awfully considerate of you. Maybe if you grovel on the floor and lick the dirt off my boots, I’ll let you go!”</p>
<p>It was painfully obvious she would do no such thing. I could see in her eyes, as they greedily passed between Hansel’s staff and Minnalis, that she was merely taunting us. But Hansel couldn’t. He flew into a rage, foolishly taken in by Zuily’s insults.</p>
<p>“You got some nerve! As if I would ever stoop to such lowly behavior!”</p>
<p>“Oh, really?” replied Zuily, shrugging her shoulders in an exaggerated display of disinterest. “In that case, I guess we’d better get started.”</p>
<p>“Just you wait! I’ll have you all weeping before me!”</p>
<p>“Heh. I’d like to see you try. You should be more worried about lettin’ the goblins get the better of you. It’s happened to adventurers before.”</p>
<p>“Wha—? Who in their right mind would lose to a goblin?”</p>
<p>“You never know in this business. You could be alive one minute, and dead the next. Surely you knew that, right?” said Zuily, chortling as she showed her plate to the checkpoint guard and passed through the gate.</p>
<p>The south gate, where we had arrived in town, was almost entirely overrun by the bushes and trees of the forest, but in contrast, the east entrance opened onto a vast green plain. After traveling northeast for some time, we arrived at a sprawling forest at the base of some small foothills. The six of us—me, Minnalis, Hansel, Zuily, Dot, and Terry—traveled mostly in silence until we arrived.</p>
<p>“All right. The match will last until sunset. Then return to the guild, make your report, and wait for the other team to arrive. If either team doesn’t make it back to the guild by sundown, they forfeit.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I get it already! Let’s get a move on! With me on your team, we can’t lose! Ah-ha-ha-ha!!” Hansel shouted.</p>
<p><em>Nice, looks like the poison is beginning to take effect.</em></p>
<p>Minnalis’s poison started by absorbing the mana of its host, so the first symptom to display itself was MP drunkenness. It’d be only another hour, maybe two, before Hansel was completely incapacitated.</p>
<p>The boy leaped off into the forest with a cheer, and Minnalis and I walked after him. The plan was to break off from him and head after Zuily’s party, but getting him to agree to that sounded like a pain, so we stayed with him for the time being. In any case, soon enough, it wouldn’t matter. He’d be lying dead on the forest floor.</p>
<p>I glanced furtively over at the other party and watched Zuily and her friends disappear into the forest in another direction. Even now, she was watching us hungrily, her eyes clouded with greed.</p>

</div>
<p class="space-break">“Haah…haah…haah…”</p>
<p>It was hot. How long ago had we entered the forest? It seemed like at least a minute, and yet it felt like no time at all.</p>
<p>This was strange. Something was wrong.</p>
<p>My body felt like it was burning. Was it heatstroke? My mind faltered. All I was doing was walking, but it felt as if I were moving through water.</p>
<p><em>…Dammit! Why</em> now, <em>of all times?</em></p>
<p>I pushed my aching joints onward. I knew there was no way I could win the match in this state, and yet I couldn’t possibly give up and return to town without having slain a single goblin. It would be a disgrace.</p>
<p><em>…Goblins prioritize weakened opponents. If we run into one, it’ll come after me, no doubt.</em></p>
<p>I looked up ahead. Somehow, the other two had gotten ahead of me. When did that happen? They looked fine. Whatever I had, it seemed like it was not affecting those two.</p>
<p><em>Looks like I’ve got no choice but to resort to plan B.</em></p>
<p>I may have been losing my mind, but I could still cast spells. If it came to a fight, I’d use a Fireball to hobble these two. Then the goblins would come after them, and I could finish them all off with Fire Lance. After that, all I’d have to do was collect all the ears and return to town. I could blame my loss on this illness; it’d still be impressive how many I’d managed to kill in this state.</p>
<p><em>It’s not a very pretty method. As a noble, I don’t want to rely on it. But…</em></p>
<p>This was about something more important. My pride.</p>
<p>I may have lost my status when I was chased out of the family, but I could still distinguish myself on merit. I could become an A-rank adventurer and establish my own house.</p>
<p><em>No, I</em> will. <em>I’m a noble. My father and my brothers may have laughed at me before, but we’ll see who’s laughing when I’m the one on top!!</em></p>
<p>That’s right. I was a noble. And as one, I couldn’t allow myself to face such shame on my very first mission. It was only natural that I exploited those two for my benefit. After all, what else were commoners for? Wait… Wasn’t that boy an aristocrat? Well, it didn’t matter. He had cast away his nobility the moment he took on a beastfolk for a slave.</p>
<p><em>Dammit, where are they? Where are the goblins?</em></p>
<p>I was really struggling now. I’d been taking stamina potions, but they didn’t seem to help.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, the two walking in front of me stopped in their tracks.</p>
<p>“Hey, Minnalis, you think we should get started?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, Master. He’s looking so pitiful now. I think it’s about time.”</p>
<p>“Hey, what are you two babbling about?” I asked, failing to conceal the anger in my voice.</p>
<p>But they didn’t respond. Instead, they started moving again. This time, at a brisk pace.</p>
<p>“H-hey! Slow down! We have to move more carefully in the depths of the forest! What if we get ambushed by goblins?”</p>
<p>They were breaking an inviolable rule of adventuring. Never let your guard down in a monster’s territory, especially when visibility was bad. I had to stop them. I shouldn’t even have been raising my voice, but I hadn’t the time to worry about that. If they went any faster, I wouldn’t be able to keep up. I couldn’t allow myself to be left alone in the forest in the state I’m in.</p>
<p>If I wanted, I could probably still put up a monster-repelling ward and make my way safely back to town, but I couldn’t. My pride wouldn’t allow it.</p>
<p>“Hey, wait! I said, wait!”</p>
<p>I called desperately after the pair, but they didn’t stop, and soon they disappeared from view.</p>
<p>“Haah…haah…haah…”</p>
<p>I tried to gather my breath and look around, but there was no sign of them.</p>
<p><em>What now…? Should I go after them? Perhaps I should head back… No, what am I thinking? I couldn’t possibly do something so shameful!</em></p>
<p>Thoughts whirled in my mind. My body sagged. As I shook my head to remove those cowardly thoughts, suddenly I spotted a figure in the corner of my eye.</p>
<p>“Hmm! Ah!”</p>
<p>Almost as quickly as it appeared, it was gone. But it was that disgusting slave girl. I was sure of it. She couldn’t have gotten far. I called out after her.</p>
<p>“H-hey! I’m over here! Wait for me!”</p>
<p><em>Calm down. Think. They need you. They can’t win the match without your spells. There’s no way they’d leave you behind.</em></p>
<p>I gripped my beloved staff and shouted as loudly as I could muster.</p>
<p>“Can’t you hear me? I’m here! Right here!”</p>
<p>The staff I’d stolen from my house when I left had now become my walking stick as I climbed up the hill toward where I’d seen the figure.</p>
<p>“Dammit, have I lost her again?!”</p>
<p>I looked around once more. There was nobody there. Not a trace. The forest was silent. Still and cold. A piercing frigidity, like it was trying to get rid of me.</p>
<p>Then, just as I was about to give up, I saw the figure again at the edge of my vision. Again I chased after it, and again I lost track of it. Again. Again.</p>
<p>“Grrrhh! Damn it all! What the hell is wrong with those two?!”</p>
<p>They were laughing at me. They were laughing at me. They were all laughing at me!!</p>
<p>The heat and rage boiled my brain until I could no longer think. Then, after so many games of hide-and-seek, I finally arrived at a small garden.</p>
<p>“Haah…haah…haah… Wh-where am I…?”</p>
<p>It was a secret place, nestled among the trees, filled with a rare variety of flower with pale petals.</p>
<p>“What weedy-looking plants. Not an ounce of dignity in them.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. So that’s what they look like to you.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Before I could turn around to face the voice, something nudged me slightly in the back.</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Like a blade of ice, a chill ran up my spine, a freezing wave that flushed all the heat and anger from my body in an instant. It was a coldness I had never felt before in my life, and its spectral chill dominated me. Unable to keep my footing, I toppled to the ground. As I did, I turned and saw the man’s face.</p>
<p>“Eek! Aargh?!”</p>
<p>He was not the man I’d met. His wicked smile turned me to stone. The feeling of the earth as I collided with the ground was so, so distant.</p>
<p>“Now, you’d better make the most of that feeling. This is the last chance you’ll have to feel anything.”</p>
<p>“Agh…wh…what…gah…”</p>
<p>My instincts acted before consulting with my rational mind, and I pressed my hands into the ground to rise to my feet. It felt as if it were all happening so very far away. Before I could even stand up, the man kicked me down once more.</p>
<p>Then, as I rolled along the ground, the sensation of the ground beneath my body disappeared.</p>
<p>“Guh…”</p>
<p>My stomach rose into my chest, then as I hit the ground again, it knocked the wind out of me. I was at the bottom of a deep hole, too deep to crawl out of unaided. Even the sun’s rays, high in the sky as it was, did not reach me down here. The soil here was damp, like after the rain.</p>
<p>It was like it was my grave.</p>
<p>““…””</p>
<p>Looking up out of the pit, I saw them standing over me. The man and the woman. When I first met him, I had thought him unimportant, with the only thing about him worthy of note being his striking black hair.</p>
<p>Having a slave girl had been a good sign. It meant he was of high birth. From a purely personal standpoint, I thought of him as a fellow noble.</p>
<p>But it was simply unacceptable for his thrall to be a beastfolk. Even if his family disowned him, even if he was forced to scrape together a living with his own two hands, to partner up with a foul beast was the same thing as discarding his pride. I knew then that we could never work together.</p>
<p>That’s why this was always going to be a one-off. They were useful to me, for now, and if I needed to be rid of them, I could do so easily.</p>
<p>They were my pawns.</p>
<p>“Why are you glaring at me like that…? Why are you glaring at me like that?!”</p>
<p>But his eyes. It was like I had no value whatsoever.</p>
<p><em>“My, what a loathsome dullard. I simply cannot believe you are my own flesh and blood.”</em></p>
<p><em>“What rotten luck I had to be stuck with a brother like you! Just go off and hide in a corner somewhere.”</em></p>
<p>“Stop it…! Don’t look at me like that!!”</p>
<p>The heat whittled away at my strength, and eventually, even that was sucked away by the chill. Though my body no longer listened to me, it burned with fervent indignation.</p>
<p>“You bastards, you bastards, you bastards! You’re laughing at me! You’re all laughing at me!!”</p>
<p>All of them! My father, my brother, and now these two!</p>
<p>“I’m a noble! You understand? I’m better than you! And I won’t be put out by the likes of you!!”</p>
<p>My mana swelled, spreading through my body and blasting off the fetters of my weakened state.</p>
<p>“O ball of raging flame, heed my wrath! Take my mana and give my fury form! Let my incandescent rage reduce all who oppose me to ash! <em>Fireball!!</em>”</p>
<p>My anger unleashed a wave of mana from my body, and my staff amplified it to untold levels. I was only barely able to keep the spell under control. The flames roared like an unruly tiger.</p>
<p>“Ha…ha-ha! Die! Burn to ashes!!”</p>
<p>The blazing orb leaped from my hands to obliterate all in its path.</p>
<p><em>Yes! They’re toast!</em></p>
<p>It was on course for a direct hit. They’d never be able to dodge it in time.</p>
<p>…Or so I thought.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, what tepid flames.”</p>
<p>All it took was a brush of his hand. He didn’t even have to try. Just a flick of his wrist, and the flames were gone.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. That was my prized spell. It was the most powerful attack I’d ever produced in my life.</p>
<p>Why? Why, why, why, why, why?!</p>
<p>“Waaaaaaarghhh! <em>Fireball!!</em>”</p>
<p><em>Hurry! Hurry!</em></p>
<p>I didn’t even know why I was hurrying. My body simply obeyed my instincts.</p>
<p>“<em>Fireball… Fireball… Fireball…! Fireball!!</em> Wraaaaarrrgh!!”</p>
<p>I no longer cared about efficiency. I just put in just enough mana as was necessary to hold the form of the spell.</p>
<p>“They’re pale,” commented the man.</p>
<p>I’d lost control, but out of all the incantations I was hurling, one was sure to hit.</p>
<p>“Wh-what are you?”</p>
<p>But they didn’t.</p>
<p>“And fragile,” he continued.</p>
<p>Without even offering even an ounce of resistance, he snuffed all my spells out.</p>
<p>“WHAT ARE YOU?!”</p>
<p>“But most of all,” he said, “they’re tepid.”</p>
<p>Last shot.</p>
<p>I squeezed out all my mana, the last of my MP, and poured it into one final Fireball. The spell to decide my fate.</p>
<p>Only for that man to crush it in the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>“Yet even flames as cold as these can still rekindle the fires of my heart.”</p>
<p>“Aaagh! Why…? You… You’re a monster!” I managed to get out in a trembling, quavering voice.</p>
<p>He hadn’t even done anything to me, but the feeling of being trampled on, of my pride and joy being torn apart, was too much to bear. Even as my body slowly succumbed to heat and exhaustion, my mind was annoyingly as sharp as ever, and it never let that feeling go.</p>
<p>“You think?” he asked. “Well, you can blame your future self for angering <em>this</em> monster.”</p>
<p>His black eyes looked down at me.</p>
<p>“To be honest with you, I wasn’t sure I was going to kill you guys. After all, you weren’t the ones who betrayed me, and logically, I can’t really fault your behavior. So on one side of the scales, I could have done nothing.”</p>
<p>“Wh-what are you…?”</p>
<p>“I guess that just means my scales must be busted. Because there’s no way this is the right thing to do. This is just petty revenge, like a child who throws a tantrum when he doesn’t get what he wants. But still…”</p>
<p>They were the eyes of the dead. Like a broken puppet missing a critical piece. A pair of vacant eyes. And deep within, a fire so dark I couldn’t even see what was burning.</p>
<p>“I thirst. I thirst so bad I can’t take it. And I know, in my head, I’m overthinking it, that I’ve just got a persecution complex, but it’s no use. Every time I look at you, I can still smell the burning flowers, still feel the garm’s cold dead body… I can’t escape it!”</p>
<p>The dead man smiled.</p>
<p>He smiled in reverence of a thirst so black I do not even know what it was for.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“So I don’t care anymore if I’m no longer a hero. All I see in the mirror is an ugly, vile, coarse man. A revenant emerging from the depths of the swamp.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">His voice seemed stained with blood. The dead man took out some kind of flask from his pouch and poured its contents into the hole.</p>
<p>“Blah! Wh-what is this? Oil…?”</p>
<p>The liquid got in my eyes, and I couldn’t clearly see what it was, but it felt slippery and clung to my skin, and its unmistakable smell filled my nostrils.</p>
<p>“Tell me, didn’t you feel the pain? Or did the MP drunkenness and the poison make it too hard to tell?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Look at your hand. <em>It’s melting.</em>”</p>
<p>“Wh-what?”</p>
<p>I glanced down. I didn’t even have the time to question what he meant.</p>
<p>The enduring heat. The exhaustion. The sudden loss of MP. The damp hole. I had thought a few drops of sweat to be nothing surprising.</p>
<p>“What the hell is this?! Why? Why?”</p>
<p>But it wasn’t sweat. It was just as the dead man said.</p>
<p>“Waaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrghhhh!!!”</p>
<p>…Something else was dripping down my fingers, like molten wax. Something that definitely wasn’t sweat.</p>
<p>“It’s melting! Like a candle! Aaaargh! Grrrrrgghh!”</p>
<p>Even if my mind didn’t know what that liquid running down my hands was, my instincts did. It was my own body. A patchwork glob of pale skin, pink flesh, and red blood.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw it and understood, I felt pain like my skin was being flayed off.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! Like a candle, he says! Now that’s a nice image! That’s exactly right. Your flesh is now like wax. You won’t burn, you’ll melt. Nice and slowly.”</p>
<p>His voice was soft, like melting venom. The dead man held a single match.</p>
<p>“Grh…! Rggh.! No… Stop!”</p>
<p>“Burning to death would be too good for you. You’re going to watch your own body dribble away. You’re going to feel the heat roast your body until your last moments. And then you’re going to die.”</p>
<p>“Stoooooooppppp!!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">Then I saw the dead man’s lips break into a chilling, ghoulish smile…</p>
<p class="space-break1">…and the match tumbled from his fingers and spiraled gently into the pit.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The oil erupted into roaring flame.</p>
<p>“Graaaaaargh! Aaargh! It’s burning! Gyaaaaaagh!”</p>
<p><em>It burns! It burns! It burns!!</em></p>
<p>Why? Why? Why was this happening?!</p>
<p>My body dripped away as the flames wrapped around me.</p>
<p>“I suppose you want to know why I’m doing this to you, don’t you? Well, good. Now you know how I felt. I wanted to know why it all happened that night. I wanted to know so, so much.”</p>
<p>“Graaaaagh! Aaaaaaghh! AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?! Where are your fancy spells now, huh?”</p>
<p>Even the air I breathed in was searing my lungs. The raging flames heated the air, and I was melting, inside and out. The inferno caused bits of my body to puddle and pool on the ground.</p>
<p>“Here, Master! I fetched some more oil!”</p>
<p>“Cheers, Minnalis! Here you go, have a refill!”</p>
<p>“GAAAAAAAAAAGH?! Aaagh! Grrrgh!”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee! I’ll help out as well!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, come on. Quickly now, before he melts! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!!”</p>
<p>“Gwaaaaaagh! Hrg! Gruuuueeeehhh?!”</p>
<p>The two sloshed oil on me from above, as if playing with me. Each time a torrent of fuel came raining down, the flames burst with new life and liquefied another part of my body.</p>
<p>“Bbblgh! It huuuuurts! Help… Help meeeee!!”</p>
<p>“No way. After all, when I pleaded with you to stop, did you listen to a word I had to say?”</p>
<p>My melting face blocked my mouth, making it difficult to breathe. Both the outside and inside of my body were turning to mush. The pain and heat were so unbearable I thought it better to drop dead right away and get it over with. But only my body was melting. My mind was still sharp, and I could feel in excruciating detail the sensation of my form getting smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>“Come on, come on, come on! Suffer! Scream! I want everything you burned that day to hear you! Melt! Crumble! Wither in pain!”</p>
<p>My body was falling to pieces. I watched as what had once been a limb slowly dissolve into a puddle on the ground, as if mocking me. My arms fell from their shoulders, my legs descended into puddles, and my face blistered and bubbled until I could no longer see.</p>
<p>“Gbbh! Gh! Bh…”</p>
<p>My ears and nose had long since melted away, but I could still feel the pain. Then, finally, my eyelid flesh seared over my eyes.</p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha-ha!! Here’s the last flask of oil! Let’s see a marvelous pyre!”</p>
<p>My right eye was already gone. With my world cut in half, the last things I saw were the orange flames and the pure white sun.</p>
<p class="space-break1">And silhouetted therein, the form of the dead man, looking down on me with a twisted smile.</p>
<p class="space-break1">In the next moment, everything went black. But the heat and pain never vanished until the moment my consciousness was obliterated.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Man, burning things never gets old.”</p>
<p>The garm must have suffered a similar fate, trapped inside that church. Or perhaps it was crushed to death in an instant by falling rubble. I’ll never know.</p>
<p>“…If I could make a wish, I’d like for it to have died a quick and painless death,” I said.</p>
<p>The moisture in Hansel’s body made a crackling sound as it burned. It was the same sound as the trees had made in my past life.</p>
<p>“Right. One down, three to go. Let’s go, Minnalis, we’ve still got a lot to do.”</p>
<p>I took in the smell of burning flesh one more time before rising to my feet.</p>
<p>“Yes, Master.”</p>
<p>“You’re next, Zuily, Dot, Terry. I’ll show you the terror you only get to feel once in life.”</p>
<p>This was only the first act. I’ll kill you all. Kill you all. Kill you all.</p>
<p>Every last one of you.</p>
<p>I’ll drag you down to the depths of hopelessness and despair.</p>
<p class="space-break2">Later, an adventurer happened upon a bizarre sight in the forest. In a small clearing, in the center of a circle of flowers, someone had dug a large hole. Within the hole was the unmistakable stench of burning flesh, and the earthen walls of the pit had been charred black. An investigation by the town of Golet determined that due to the nature of the trap, it was likely that bandits or possibly Redcaps were to blame. However, a body was never produced, and soon enough, the incident faded from public memory.</p>
