<p><em>Why does she have Scarlet Eyes?</em></p>
<p>Turns out there was an awful lot going on in this mansion that I didn’t know about. It was particularly strange because I had met this girl before, and she never had red eyes.</p>
<p><em>Did I misremember things…? No, she had green eyes, I’m sure of it.</em></p>
<p>Intrinsic abilities were generally fixed at birth, and people with the Scarlet Eyes ability all had red eyes. Except I distinctly remembered her having green eyes before. It wasn’t easy to forget seeing that small elven girl on the battlefield the first time I fought the horde here.</p>
<p>If only I had her data from last time still stored in the Eight-Eyed Sword of Clarity, I could be sure, but unfortunately, it was only after I met her that I’d acquired that soul blade.</p>
<p><em>In any case, it doesn’t seem like she’s trying to raise the alarm.</em></p>
<p>I was about to run away, but her behavior gave me pause.</p>
<p>This was how I could hit Eumis where it hurts. I knew it. It was mostly conjecture at this point, but this had to lead me to an aspect of Eumis I didn’t see the first time.</p>
<p><em>The problem now is what exactly do I do here?</em></p>
<p>“Be not afraid. I come in…peace? I don’t suppose that’s very convincing.”</p>
<p>I needed to materialize a little in order to talk. I was only creating a false body out of mana, though. My real body was, of course, still back at the inn. Hence, it was a little weaker than a real human body. To her Scarlet Eyes, I would look exactly the same, but at least by giving myself a voice, I might appear a little less creepy. Right now, I wanted to buy time until I could figure out exactly what was going on here.</p>
<p>“…You’re not a ghost. You’re…a spirit?”</p>
<p>“Er…what? No, I…what?”</p>
<p>Something seemed to resonate with the young girl—though I wasn’t sure exactly what—and she hopped out of her seat and crossed the room toward me. Her facial expression didn’t change, but she seemed intensely curious about me.</p>
<p>“Wow. I’ve never seen a spirit before, not even in the forest! To think I would see one here…”</p>
<p>She was like a teenage schoolgirl meeting her favorite pop star. I could almost see the sparkle in her eyes.</p>
<p>“I’ve got so many things I want to ask a spirit. Where do you come from? Is it the forest outside the city? What do you eat?”</p>
<p>“Huh? No, you’ve got it all wrong. I’m not really a…”</p>
<p><em>What the hell is going on? Was my memory always this bad?</em></p>
<p>The Shuria I remembered was never this talkative. She was always emotionless, only ever answering questions with “yes” or “no.” I had tried talking to her a few times, but not once had she ever struck up a conversation in return. She was like a doll. At least, that’s how I remembered her.</p>
<p>So what is this? It wouldn’t be wrong to still call her a quiet girl, for sure. But there was emotion behind her actions, and that was something I had never seen before.</p>
<p>Perhaps she just really liked spirits that much. Was that possible?</p>
<p>“Uh-um, and also…,” she stammered.</p>
<p>“Hold on, calm down— Uh…”</p>
<p>“Ee…”</p>
<p>As the restless girl instinctively grabbed my hand, my arm fell off. Right now, I might as well have been made of polystyrene. I suppose the shaking was too much for my poor shoulder.</p>
<p>“Ee…eh…oh…”</p>
<p>“Um… You okay?”</p>
<p>Being only a temporary body, it didn’t hurt me at all, and I could always just make another one. The girl, however, was clearly disturbed by the sight. I could almost see her soul leaving her body. I waved my reconstructed hand in front of her eyes to show that everything was fine, but…</p>
<p>“Uhhh…”</p>
<p>“Nope, she’s a goner.”</p>
<p>I sighed and waited for her to return to the world of the living.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break">It took the girl a few minutes to come back to her senses. We sat across from each other at the large table in the center of the room.</p>
<p>“…I’m sorry. That was so rude of me… My name’s Shuria, by the way. Is your arm all better now?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m fine. My body’s mostly just made of mana, anyway.”</p>
<p>“…Spirits sure are something.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…whatever, let’s just go with that.”</p>
<p>It seemed she was more willing to talk if I let her believe I was a spirit. I used to know a priest on Earth. Perhaps I should try talking a bit more like him.</p>
<p>“…Why did you come here? Is there something you have to do?”</p>
<p>“I wanted to ask you something, um…my little lost lamb.”</p>
<p>“Shuria. Please call me Shuria.”</p>
<p>“…Right. Shuria. You can see the magic circle in this room, can’t you? You know it’s centered on you, right?”</p>
<p>While Shuria was having an out-of-body experience of her own, I had taken the opportunity to examine the magic circle for myself.</p>
<p>Here’s what it said:</p>
<div class="boxd1" style="margin-top:1em;">
<div class="boxd1">
<p style="margin-top:0.5em;"><span class="special">Six-Colored Hexing Circle of Transference</span></p>
<p><span class="special">By keeping the target within the confines of the Hexing Circle, the target’s skills and affinities in Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Light, and Dark magic can be transferred to a second target.</span></p>
<p><span class="special">Once the hex is 50% complete, the transferred skills and affinities manifest in the beneficiary. Note that in order for the hex to be effective, the target and beneficiary must share a soul compatibility of blood-relation class.</span></p>
<p><span class="special">Target: Shuria&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Beneficiary: Eumis Elmia</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0.5em;"><span class="special">Hex progression: 96% (Time remaining: 7 days)</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-top:1em;">It was quite a nasty curse. It took away not only your skill proficiencies but also your affinities. That meant that you couldn’t even build your skills back up afterward. Essentially, it made you unable to cast magic ever again.</p>
<p>I looked at her with my advanced Appraise skill, and her six elemental affinities were almost completely gone. Given her elven blood, they ought to have been pretty high. Her skill proficiencies, too, were way too low compared to her current level.</p>
<p>Contract spells of this type—ones that stole affinities and skills pretty closely linked to the target’s soul—took a considerable amount of time to complete, and it was clear that this Shuria girl had been confined to this room for a very long time indeed.</p>
<p>“This is so that I can give my talent for magic to Eumis. There are a lot of things in this world that I don’t understand.”</p>
<p><em>I don’t think there are many people who do understand these kinds of spells. They’re evil curses, used only by demons. But…</em></p>
<p>With her Scarlet Eyes, she could see the mana leaving her body, and thanks to the passive effect of the Mystic Blade of Soulfire, I could see raw mana, too. It was not a pleasant sight. How could she stay so happy?</p>
<p>“Why would you do such a thing…?”</p>
<p>“My sister Shelmie. She was sick. I agreed to give up my magic so that we could afford the magic potion to cure her disease.”</p>
<p><em>Her sister? I never knew Eumis had another sister.</em></p>
<p>“Huh. But how is that your price to pay? Shelmie is your sister, right? Doesn’t that make her Eumis’s sister, too?”</p>
<p>“We are only half related to Eumis. We grew up apart from her. We couldn’t expect to be given such a large sum for free simply because we were of the same blood.”</p>
<p>“And you’re okay with this?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m sad I won’t be able to use magic anymore, but she’s paying me enough to afford the magic potion and live comfortably with my family for the rest of our lives. I only ever used my magic as a means to survive, anyway. Besides,” she continued, “Eumis told me it would help her achieve her dream. I’m happy to give up my magic power if it is of use to her.”</p>
<p>“I see. You must really love your sister.”</p>
<p>“I do!” she said, without hesitation. “Eumis is amazing! She works so hard, and she handles her father’s work even though she’s only a few years older than me…!”</p>
<p>She smiled softly as she spoke, a rare change of expression. It was a testament to her love. I smiled back, but the shutters had already clapped over my ears. I was no longer listening, and in the back of my mind, the gears were turning.</p>
<p><em>So in order to advance her research, she took the magical ability of her elf-blood sister. And in return for taking away her means of earning a living, Eumis granted Shuria not only the magic potion to cure her sister’s illness, but also enough money to live out the rest of her and her family’s lives…</em></p>
<p>That explained why Eumis’s magical affinities were always much higher than a normal human’s should have been. But if that was all there was to it, there wasn’t much left to say. I may have found out why her magic was so strong, but there was nothing I could do to reverse the hex at this point. But that wasn’t the end of the story.</p>
<p>First, I had to find out why Eumis knew about this spell in the first place, and how she’d cast it.</p>
<p>And second, I had to work out why the Shuria sitting before me now differed to the one in my memories.</p>
<p>Also, it was probably just me being pessimistic, but I couldn’t shake the bad feeling that something else was wrong. The Shuria I remember seemed to have no emotions at all. Though she may have been reserved right now, she definitely exhibited her feelings. There was no question about it.</p>
<p>I felt a discomfort sticking into my throat like pins. It felt like any moment, everything was going to fall into place, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.</p>
<p>It was then that I heard a voice.</p>
<p><em>“—ria, have you been well?”</em></p>
<p>“H-huh? Oh!”</p>
<p><em>Hmm? What’s that?</em></p>
<p>I turned toward the source, only to find it was coming from a letter on the desk by the window. It was the one Shuria was opening when I entered the room. The paper was marked with the pale blue crest of the Elmia marquis. I was familiar with how the recording device attached to it worked. You could record messages into it and play them back at any time with a simple touch.</p>
<p>“Ah, this flower must have fallen onto the page,” guessed Shuria. I looked to see that one of the pretty purple and yellow flowers from a potted plant atop the desk had fallen from its stem and onto the paper itself. That must have activated the device.</p>
<p><em>“The Evening Calms in your garden have sprouted again. Shelmie’s been taking good care of them this year.”</em></p>
<p><em>What’s wrong?</em> I thought. <em>Why do I feel so…?</em></p>
<p>“Is that your mother?”</p>
<p>The voice I heard belonged to a young woman. Yet there was something off about it I couldn’t quite place, and it sounded as if I’d heard it somewhere before.</p>
<p>“Yes. Oh, and this is my sister Shelmie.”</p>
<p><em>“Have you been well, sister? You aren’t sick, are you? Are you eating and sleeping well? I feel so much better. I know you always say you’re doing fine, but I worry about you having trouble adjusting to your new life. I’ve been taking care of the flowers you planted. They tell me we’ll soon be able to meet again. I’m looking forward to it so much.”</em></p>
<p>“Shelmie… She’s my little sister, but she always makes fun of me.”</p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha…she sounds like a great sibling to me.”</p>
<p>Shuria even blushed a little in embarrassment. The girl in the letter reminded me of my own sister back home. She always had her act together, much more so than I ever did. She always fussed over me and told me what to do as well.</p>
<p>Even as I lingered in recollection, I noticed this voice also sounded off. I mean, it was that of a young girl, higher in pitch than the previous voice, but something still didn’t seem right about it.</p>
<p><em>…I know. There’s no emotion behind their words at all.</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t as though they were chanting in monotone; it wasn’t that obvious. But there was none of the intonation, inflection, rises and falls of pitch that people usually used when they spoke. It was fixed, like a machine was talking instead of a human. Yeah, as if the voices I remembered were…</p>
<p>As soon as I realized the significance of what I was hearing, I felt a <em>click</em> in the back of my head, as the last piece of the puzzle fell into place. The gears started to turn as I pieced together my theory.</p>
<p><em>…Ha-ha. I see. It all makes sense now. I suppose it is that easy to fool someone after all.</em></p>
<p>Shuria must have noticed it, too, that the voices of her family sounded different to how she remembered. But if Eumis told her that’s just how it worked, then why wouldn’t Shuria believe her? What reason would she have not to trust her dear sister?</p>
<p><em>As for the Contract spell… Ah, I know what she must have used. They were created using demon magic, after all. For the cost…well, that part is obvious. And then if I think about the sorts of things Eumis might do, the rest all comes together.</em></p>
<p>As soon as the final image formed in my mind, I began to feel dizzy.</p>
<p><em>…Oh. This again.</em></p>
<p>The whole thing had nothing to do with me, and yet it reminded me so much of myself that the dark flame inside me suddenly flared out of control, as if it had been doused in black, tarry oil.</p>
<p>“Can I just ask you something?”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>The letter had ended, and Shuria was carefully folding it back up when I called out to her.</p>
<p>“That flower that landed on the letter. Was it by any chance the same as those flowers your family mentioned?”</p>
<p>“Yes. They are extremely vigorous flowers, though they tend not to grow in great numbers.”</p>
<p>“I see. They’re very pretty,” I said, before standing up from the table. “I should get going. Please don’t tell anybody that you saw me. I wasn’t really supposed to come and talk to you.”</p>
<p>“R-really? Okay, I’ll keep it a secret!”</p>
<p>Shuria clenched her fists. Just like when she first saw me, I could somehow see the stars in her eyes despite her expression barely changing at all. I could probably trust that she wouldn’t tell Eumis about me now.</p>
<p>“Um… Can I ask you your name, Mr. Spirit?”</p>
<p>“Sure. My name’s Kaito.”</p>
<p>“Kaito… Um…will I ever see you again?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I think you will.”</p>
<p>With that, I returned fully to my spectral form, and ended the Mystic Blade of Soulfire’s effect.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Man… This world really is nothing but trash.”</p>
<p>After a short floaty feeling similar to using a teleportation stone, I arrived in my bed at the inn. Minnalis had not yet returned.</p>
<p>“Haah… Maybe I should go.”</p>
<p>The heat inside me boiled and seethed. Right now, I could find the perfect opponent on which to vent my anger. I’d been hoping to go there in a few days with Minnalis and let her practice fighting against a large horde. I suppose it just wasn’t meant to be. At least I’d get the chance to practice my secret technique. I still needed to find out how effective it’d be when I used it against Eumis. Also…</p>
<p>Argh, dammit. I couldn’t pretend anymore. There was no rational reason behind it. I just wanted to go wild or else I’d lose my damn mind. Right now, I was a pent-up ball of fire with nowhere to go.</p>
<p><em>“Glug-glug. Haah.”</em></p>
<p>I downed a potion to restore the MP I used up with the Mystic Blade of Soulfire, then I left the inn and headed to the east gate. There, I slipped off the beaten path and went down a woodland trail by myself.</p>
<p>Logically, I knew that this time would be better spent researching my enemy. There were still some things I was uncertain about, I realized that. It’s just, if I ran into her again there in the mansion, I don’t know if I’d have been able to hold myself back.</p>
<p>“Ah, they’re in there. Perfect chance to let off some steam and practice my secret technique.”</p>
<p>I stood before the forest. Within it, I sensed a writhing mass of monsters, of far greater numbers than when I went against Zuily’s party. In only a few more days, they’d spill out of the forest and attack the city.</p>
<p>My lips curled up into a smile. When it came to venting my uncontrollable rage, the more the merrier. I sauntered gleefully into the forest, barely making it ten paces before a pair of goblins leaped out at me. Conjuring the Soul Blade of Beginnings in my right hand, and the Nephrite Blade of Verdure in my left, I sliced them both cleanly in two.</p>
<p>““Grah-grah-grah?!””</p>
<p>“Sorry. It’s not you guys I have a problem with.”</p>
<p>Tying the Nephrite Blade of Verdure to my hip by its tassel, I took the Holy Sword of Retribution in my left hand.</p>
<p>“Grah!!” “Bregh?!” “Kraugh?!” “Gr-gah!!” “Brooouh…” “Gah?!”</p>
<p>“It’s no use. It’s still not enough. But I can’t let my partner see me like this.”</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, I flitted from spot to spot, annihilating the monsters all around me, while turning and slicing the ones that attempted to flank me. The forest was filled with the screams of dying monsters, so much so that my ears were beginning to go crazy.</p>
<p>“I just need to let out some stress…”</p>
<p>In the few minutes since I entered the forest, I had slaughtered all the monsters found in the outer reaches. Detecting an even greater presence lurking ahead, I approached a clearing about the size of a gymnasium, where a great number of people must have cut down the trees to set up camp. There I found many monsters: Redcaps, hobgoblins, Sword Goblins, Red Boars, Big Boars, orcs, High Orcs, trolls.</p>
<p>They all turned and glared at me. There were easily about a hundred of them.</p>
<p><em>Ah, maybe now I can finally fight to my heart’s content.</em></p>
<p><em>“Glug, glug, haah.”</em></p>
<p>I took another MP potion, and tossed the empty bottle aside, then immediately leaped into the crowd of monsters.</p>
<p>“Gragh?!” “Gu-guh!!” “Goragh!!”</p>
<p>I stabbed the three closest to me with a single thrust and pulled out my sword, soaking the ground in their blood.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“…so much for blowing off steam by killing you.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">With that, I released the brakes on my body and forced my gears into overdrive.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“Ha-ha!! Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!”</p>
<p>My blade showed not a drop of mercy. Heads flew, blood spurted. I pierced organs and crushed necks.</p>
<p>“Die! Ahhh, this is good! Marvelous!”</p>
<p>The blood went to my head and made me giddy. A feeling almost like being drunk rose up and washed away my thoughts. No emotion, no doubt. My whole mind was devoted to murder. I loved them. I loved these monsters I could slaughter without feeling guilty.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha! Aha-ha-ha-ha!!”</p>
<p>The mad laughter flowed from me almost unconsciously. It was a rampage, but it was a righteous one.</p>
<p>This was no careful killing, no pinpoint strikes to the vitals. I was just swinging my sword with enough force to tear them messily apart. By the time I was halfway done, the bodies formed a pile, and blood soaked the soil.</p>
<p>Before long, the only thing there that still drew breath was me.</p>
<p>“Haah…haah…hooo…”</p>
<p>I took a deep sigh, as if expelling the leftover heat. All that remained within me was a pile of smoldering embers and a great feeling of emptiness.</p>
<p>The words poured from my lips. “Why do I only ever find out once it’s too late?”</p>
<p><em>You were right, Leticia. There are beautiful things in this world. But there are also nasty things, dirty things. Way more of them than either of us ever imagined.</em></p>
<p>My fists were clenched so tightly my fingernails drew blood from my palms. This was the highest form of self-deceit. I knew that. If there were anything I could do, I could make it part of my revenge, turn it to my advantage. But there wasn’t, and still I sympathized with her. I pitied her. I saw myself in her. And I decided to voice the complaints I’ve been bottling up inside me this whole time.</p>
<p>“…Why do I only ever start from the point of no return?”</p>
<p>I had always told myself thinking about it wouldn’t help, but it was just an excuse. I was like a crying child throwing a tantrum, knowing I couldn’t have what I wanted but still refusing to accept it.</p>
<p>If this was really a do-over, then why was I only brought back to the moment I arrived? From that point on, it was already too late. I had already lost everything by then.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha…pathetic.”</p>
<p>I knew I ought to be grateful. It was a miracle I had been given another opportunity to exact my vengeance. The world didn’t revolve around me. It didn’t care one iota about me and my problems, and even though I’d gotten a second chance, it didn’t mean I was special. My do over was given to me not because I’d sworn revenge, or because I’d wished for it. It was something the Goddess or whoever gave to everybody.</p>
<p>Yet I couldn’t get it out of my head. I couldn’t help but scream and wail at how unfair and pathetic it all was.</p>
<p>That’s why I had to unload my anger. Because it was something I could never talk about. It was a weakness of mine. My greatest weakness. And the sight of that girl hit me right where it hurts.</p>
<p>“I really…don’t want anyone to ever see me in this miserable state.”</p>
<p>I wanted to go back. I wanted to go back so much I could scream. It was pathetic. Was that any way for an avenger to act?</p>
<p>“I’ll kill them. I don’t care anymore what happens. I have to trample them into the ground and slaughter them.”</p>
<p>That was all I could think about now. This was the path I had chosen, the only way I could be satisfied. My final complaint purged the impurities from within me, leaving only a pure, black, cold flame of vengeance. Kill them all. The oath that brought my soul back to life.</p>
<p>My prey had been brought before me. I didn’t have time to wallow in regret. I had to make her suffer. Tear away at her heart and mind until nothing remained but despair. And then I’d kill her.</p>
<p>When I carried out my revenge, I needed my heart to contain nothing but vengeance. Revenge was sweet, a loving but jealous mistress. She would not permit me to look away.</p>
<p>“Haah… I think that helped me calm down a bit.”</p>
<p>In the aftermath of my rampage, I felt my worries and anger slip away, as if sinking to the bed of a deep lake.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha… Look at me now. This is just laughable…”</p>
<p>I realized I was utterly drenched from head to toe in monster blood. It was disgusting.</p>
<p>I still had around 30 percent of my MP remaining, but I was already feeling drunk from the sudden loss. It was a feeling I usually found unpleasant, but now it felt somehow comforting.</p>
<p><em>That took longer than I expected, and I even used all the techniques I had access to right now. I’m just not up to where I was before yet.</em></p>
<p>Thinking this, I took a flask of water from my pack and held it high above my head, dousing myself in water to wash away the blood. As the cold water hit my skin, I remembered Shuria’s words.</p>
<p><em>“Kaito… Um…will I ever see you again?”</em></p>
<p>“Yeah, you will. I’ll make sure of it,” I vowed.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I will drag you from that world, through a sea of needles, into the light. And if you wish, I will show you the way from there.</p>
<p>Like the devil himself.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“…All right.”</p>
<p>Shaking the water off me like a dog, I stretched my limbs and cracked my neck.</p>
<p>“I’m hungry. And tired. I wanna go to bed…,” I groaned, rubbing my rumbling belly.</p>
<p>The hour was not yet right for afternoon tea, but although I had enjoyed quite a hearty lunch, I was already starving, as if I had not eaten all day. In addition, the use of my secret technique had drained my MP and left me totally exhausted. Trying to ignore the pervasive smell of blood, I pulled from my pack a couple of pieces of dried meat I wouldn’t need to cook. Chewing on them, I reluctantly decided I really ought to do something about the state I’d left the forest in, and summoned Slimo to take care of the bodies. The smell would have to remain. There was nothing I could do about that.</p>
<p>Then, with no further reason to loiter in the forest, I started walking, greedily wolfing down the meat as I tried to find somewhere that didn’t smell quite so foul.</p>
