<p><em>“Kyui!”</em></p>
<p>The kid’s pet slime extended two feelers from its body.</p>
<p>“It’s not happening. This <em>can’t</em> be happening. It doesn’t make any sense. It can’t be happening, because…it just can’t be— Blghf!”</p>
<p>The creature swallowed up Terry’s head within itself. There was the dull snap of flesh and bone cracking, tearing apart. One of his eyeballs flew out of the slime’s body and rolled along the ground, but the slime picked it up with a feeler and sucked it back inside like liquid through a straw.</p>
<p>“No…why is this happening…? Why? Why…? Gah!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">“That’s what I asked myself all the time. It’s what I screamed into the sky. <em>Why is this happening?</em> But you never answered me. So why should I answer you?”</p>
<p class="space-break1">The last thing I saw as my vision split in two was that punk’s smile. Laughing with scorn, as though looking down in disgust on the entire world, even himself.</p>

</div>
<p class="space-break">Ah, at last.</p>
<p>I’d finally finished them off.</p>
<p>“Master, are you crying?”</p>
<p>“Huh?” I brought my hand to my cheek. It was true.</p>
<p>“I wonder why. Ha-ha-ha… I dunno, but…I feel good. Really good. You feel it, too, don’t you? I mean, you’re crying as well.”</p>
<p>“What?” She tapped her face gently, and sure enough, tears were streaming down her face.</p>
<p>As for why we were weeping, I didn’t know.</p>
<p>It wasn’t sadness, but it wasn’t joy, either.</p>
<p>There was no pain, no suffering.</p>
<p>It was as if something tying us up had finally been undone, and the tears were washing it away.</p>
<p>“I feel like there are going to be a lot more tears from here on out, Minnalis.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master.”</p>
<p>And then, we smiled.</p>
<p>The path we were on wasn’t the right one, but it wasn’t the wrong one, either.</p>
<p>So we beamed, with peace in our hearts, as the tears flowed.</p>
<p class="space-break2">The Monster’s Blade of Hatching engulfed Slimo like a Venus flytrap, without the painful cry it had emitted when he emerged. After letting it eat the two halves of Zuily’s head, I was done with it for now. Once it returned to the inside of the blade, I dispelled it.</p>
<p>“Minnalis!” I shouted just then.</p>
<p>“?!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, something came flying toward us. Eleven things, to be precise.</p>
<p><em>Dammit, will I make it?!</em></p>
<p>I had completely let down my guard, and my reactions were too slow. Switching into battle mode and ramping up my reaction time to max, I could see the flying things were spears, of simple make and specialized for throwing. They were tipped with a green liquid. Poison, no doubt. Four were headed toward me, and seven for Minnalis. I could see that she was trying to react as well, but she still had in her hands the rusty mallet she’d used to crush Dot’s head, not her usual sword. With that weapon, she could only handle two of the spears, at most.</p>
<p>Casting my attention to the surrounding area, I detected sixteen goblins. The five who had not thrown their javelins seemed to be advancing on us at speed under cover of the projectiles.</p>
<p>But even though I could determine all of that in an instant, there was a big difference between realizing what was going on and addressing it. My reaction time was as sharp as it had ever been the last time around, but the ability of my body to keep up was still a long way off.</p>
<p>So the option to handle this cleanly and effortlessly was already off the table.</p>
<p>With this many goblins, I didn’t have to worry about dragging things out. Without wasting a single drop of mana, I conjured in an instant the Soul Blade of Beginnings in my right hand and the Holy Sword of Retribution in my left. At the same time, I channeled as much mana as I could into my arms and legs, forcibly overriding the part of my body that sought to keep the flow in check for the sake of my limbs. In order to better understand the situation, I extended my magical senses into my surroundings.</p>
<p>Ignoring my aching muscles just for a second, I summoned up all the strength my current body could muster and leaped into the air. All of that took less than an instant. The inhuman speed with which I could make those kinds of decisions was precisely why I had earned the title “Master of Finesse” and had a Finesse score of SSS, the highest in the world.</p>
<p><em>I can let Minnalis handle the two in front. I just have to deal with the other nine.</em></p>
<p>By channeling mana into my legs and using Fleet-Foot, I could move even more quickly than my Agility score and Finesse allowed.</p>
<p>I ignored the four spears that had been aiming for me. Since they had all been on target, as soon as I left that spot, they posed no further threat.</p>
<p><em>That’s four down.</em></p>
<p>It was only a short time, and I was controlling every ounce of my mana so that it wouldn’t tear my body apart. Accelerating my creaking arm as fast as it would go, I swung the Holy Sword of Retribution at the frontmost of the three spears approaching Minnalis from her four o’clock position. Then with my other hand, I thrust the Soul Blade of Beginnings toward the one in the back, just scraping the spearhead and deflecting its trajectory. It flew toward the third spear and struck it like a billiard ball, knocking it off target as well. After seeing that, I killed my speed like my whole body was a shock absorber.</p>
<p><em>Just two left.</em></p>
<p>At that moment, the five monsters burst out of the thicket.</p>
<p><em>So these are Redcaps.</em></p>
<p>The Redcap was a member of the goblin family, but about a size smaller than the regular ones, and its head resembled a red hat, hence the name. They were a devious monster that excelled in group tactics. Apparently, the distinctive red markings on their heads were the blood of the prey they’d killed.</p>
<p>I quickly stepped off with one leg to change my body’s direction, and regaining the speed I had just lost, rushed back over to Minnalis, where two of the Redcaps had appeared.</p>
<p>“Don’t get carried away, you scum.”</p>
<p>“Gaah…”</p>
<p>“Grah…”</p>
<p>I let my soul blades fall from my hands and reached out, grabbing both the Redcaps by their heads. Then I ran about a person’s height into the air using Air Step, somersaulted, and with that momentum, tossed the goblins toward the last of the spears approaching Minnalis from her left. They crashed into them in mid-flight, whereupon the two Redcaps attacking us from that angle stopped in fright.</p>
<p>“Come on out, monsters!!”</p>
<p>There were still eleven Redcaps remaining in the bushes, the one still by me, one that had appeared behind Minnalis, and the two looking on in shock at the corpses of their allies I had just thrown into the spears.</p>
<p>I pulled back on the hilts of my two soul blades before they had time to fall and dashed over to the one attacking from the rear.</p>
<p><em>Rrgh! I can’t keep my mana under control much longer!!</em></p>
<p>I was walking a tightrope, and my body was screaming at me to stop. Any more power and I’d be in danger. And it had still only been fifteen seconds.</p>
<p>If I’d had a little more MP left, I could have used my secret technique, but I had used most of it toying with Zuily’s party.</p>
<p><em>I’m gonna feel sore tomorrow, that’s for sure.</em></p>
<p>Right now, I was just barely managing to keep myself within limits, but I was missing a vital piece of my secret technique, and without it, my muscles were calling out in pain trying to emulate it.</p>
<p>Just as I was in a good mood at having some unexpected revenge fall into my lap, right at the end, these idiots had to spoil it.</p>
<p>I poured that resentment into my attack, slicing in the shape of a cross with my two blades, cutting the Redcap standing before me into quarters.</p>
<p>“Master!!”</p>
<p>“Minnalis, you take those two! I’ll go after the ones still hiding!”</p>
<p>Once we got past the initial ambush, Minnalis could easily take on Redcaps in hand-to-hand combat, so I shot off into the forest without waiting for her reply. I sensed that the remaining goblins had not yet moved from their initial position and were still standing around about five meters away from us. Dispelling the Holy Sword of Retribution, I used my free hand to toss a couple of throwing knives at the two Redcaps on the right. The trees were obscuring a lethal strike, but that was no issue, for my knives were coated with a deadly poison of Minnalis’s creation. They struck the two Redcaps, one in the arm, and one in the leg.</p>
<p>“Gyararargh?!”</p>
<p>“Gyururugh?!”</p>
<p>The poison got to work quickly, and I heard the creatures groan in agony. They were stupidly strong compared to regular goblins, though not as much as orcs, and so it would take them a little while to die, but they were goners now. I could ignore them.</p>
<p>I then turned to the one in front and hurled the Soul Blade of Beginnings at its heart, meanwhile conjuring up the very versatile Pyrachnid’s Claw of Kindling in my right hand, and the Nephrite Blade of Verdure in my left. Once I heard the Redcap’s death wail, I felt the Soul Blade of Beginnings return to its rightful place within me.</p>
<p>Weaving my way through the trees counterclockwise from where I’d started, I tore through the monster in one clean sweep. I sliced its throat, cleaved the flesh of its neck, stuck my fingers through its eye sockets, and hurled away its severed head, smashing it against a nearby tree.</p>
<p>After killing another one cleverly hiding in the bushes to ambush me, I swapped the Nephrite Blade of Verdure for the Soul Blade of Beginnings and skewered the two attempting to run away while I was distracted with their friend.</p>
<p>“Last one, huh?”</p>
<p>A final goblin charged at me in a suicidal rush.</p>
<p>“Gyaraaaargh!!”</p>
<p>“Shut up. I’ll teach you to rain on my parade.”</p>
<p>I sliced it in half, drawing the skirmish to a close at last.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“Oww… Man, I think I overdid it. Ahhh, so tired. So sleepy. Wanna go home. Wanna go to bed. Wanna just laze around and do nothing.”</p>
<p>My body’s demands issued forth from my lips as idle grumbles. I was still feeling good about what had happened with Zuily’s party, but my body was going into full-on debt-collection mode. Even my reasoning was taking a back seat to the MP drunkenness. I’d taken a potion, but the effects would still take a while to clear.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, after I took care of the spears, I didn’t have to keep trying so hard. Why didn’t I realize that earlier?”</p>
<p>My arms and legs were going to be sore in the morning. I could already feel my joints creaking. That battle hadn’t even been that long. <em>Is this all I can handle right now?</em> I thought with a sigh.</p>
<p>I was capable of much more than that. I knew I was.</p>
<p>“Ugh. Maybe I’ll pick up some muscle rub from the apothecary when we get back. Nah, my MP will be recovered by then so I might as well just use the Nephrite Blade of Verdure… Damn, how did I ever survive without MP? I’ll have to practice my Meditate skill a bit more… Ah.”</p>
<p><em>Shit, I’m talking to myself again. I don’t even notice when I’m doing it.</em></p>
<p>And right after Minnalis pointed it out the other day. I ruffled my hair.</p>
<p><em>Let’s just take some trophies from the Redcaps and get back to… Urgh. I can’t be bothered. Do I have to get them all? Bringing sixteen back to the guild is sure to cause a fuss, too…</em></p>
<p>Redcaps weren’t much by themselves, but a group of sixteen was a force to be reckoned with, far beyond the capabilities of a newbie adventurer, as I ostensibly was.</p>
<p>Two or three would be far more manageable, at least that way I would <em>merely</em> be seen as an excellent novice with lots of training, rather than superhuman.</p>
<p><em>Yep, two or three will be fine. It’s important not to stand out too much. Sure, the reward from the guild will be lost, but there are bigger things at stake. It’s not just because I’m lazy, Minnalis.</em></p>
<p>I repeated my excuse to myself. Minnalis had been acting more and more like a bossy housewife with each passing day. What’s that, you say? I could just hand the trophies in bit by bit so as not to attract attention? Well… I didn’t think of that. Yeah, let’s go with that.</p>
<p>And so I carved off the trophies of the nearest two to me and returned to Minnalis.</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>But when I got back to the clearing, there was a bizarre sight waiting for me.</p>
<p>“Hello? Ground control to Major Minnalis. Anyone home? …What are you doing?”</p>
<p>The Redcap I’d sliced to pieces, the two I threw into the spears, and the two I let Minnalis shred to bits… For some reason, Minnalis seemed to have arranged the five monsters in a circle and was kneeling in the center. Her usually springy rabbit ears were drooping. I could almost see her dejection taking form behind her.</p>
<p>“I-I’m preparing for you to tell me off, Master. It’s my job to keep an eye out for the enemy, and yet I was having so much fun taking out the trash that I didn’t notice the monster attack…”</p>
<p>“Ahhh, don’t worry about it, you can feel sorry for yourself when we get home. Right now, I just want to get back to the inn and enjoy a nice nap.”</p>
<p>“Y-you’re not going to scold me?”</p>
<p>“Why would I? I didn’t notice them until the last second, either, so I don’t really have the right. We’ve both got a lot to learn.”</p>
<p>“You’re…not going to dispose of me? You’re going to let me stay as your slave? Stay as your partner in crime?”</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s gotten into you? It wasn’t your fault we got ambushed. Besides, if I could survive on my own, I wouldn’t have taken a slave in the first place, and the Holy Sword of Retribution binds us together anyway. I couldn’t leave you behind.”</p>
<p>To be honest, she looked like she wanted to be punished, but I wasn’t in the mood, so I pretended not to notice this. I could deal with that later.</p>
<p>“I guess the MP drunkenness hasn’t worn off yet, because your thoughts are still in a weird place. Here, have another one.”</p>
<p>“Hng! Ng…mnn…pahh…”</p>
<p>I forced another MP potion down her throat, and the blue liquid dripped from her lips. The teary look in her eyes was oddly suggestive. Usually, I’d be a little perturbed by a sight like this, but right now I was too tired to do anything about it. I just wanted to be under the covers again, and I wasn’t about to fall asleep here. Whatever Minnalis had going on, it was going to have to wait until later, because I was heading back as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“Just get up. We’re leaving.”</p>
<p>“Ah… Yes, Master…,” she said, rising to her feet and following my lead.</p>
<p>“For now, we’ll head back to the guild and make our report as per the plan.”</p>
<p>“I suppose so…”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t sound so depressed. Come on, stand up straight!”</p>
<p>“Ah… Oh! Yes, Master!”</p>
<p>I ruffled her long, black hair and set her mind to new thoughts.</p>
<p>“If you’ve got time to mope, think about revenge instead. We’re only just getting started, Minnalis.”</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because I was tired, or perhaps it was because of the MP drunkenness, but I couldn’t hide what I was feeling. A broad smile spread across my face.</p>
<p>“Ohhh, just imagining it gives me the shivers. Killing those guys made me feel a little better, but it’s not enough. Nowhere near.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>My eyes narrowed, and my lips curled upward.</p>
<p>“I just get so excited thinking about my revenge inching closer and closer to completion. Feel sorry for yourself if you wish, Minnalis, but you’re missing out on all the fun. Our next goal is just beyond these trees, remember.”</p>

<p class="space-break">“…and that’s about it.”</p>
<p>We were back in town, giving our report to the guild. Hansel had gone to relieve himself in the bushes when he was attacked by Redcaps. We were alerted by his screams and managed to kill the two that came for us, but fearing for our lives, we ran back to town, leaving him behind.</p>
<p>“We heard a terrible scream from Hansel, the noble boy, just a little before we finished fighting, so I think he…”</p>
<p>“I see… I’m sorry for the boy, but I think you two did the right thing. Redcaps specialize in group and ambush tactics, so I think if you’d gone to help him, it would have only ended even worse.”</p>
<p>Of course, we didn’t mention Zuily’s party at all.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it was a different person at the reception desk this time, one of the burly men. He was older and more experienced, and he understood the situation clearly.</p>
<p>“But I can’t believe Redcaps have spread to that part of the forest…,” he muttered.</p>
<p>“Indeed. Here are the trophies as proof,” I said, placing the two monster remains on the counter along with all the goblin ears we collected. The receptionist man took them carefully and eyed them with a serious look.</p>
<p>“Yep, this is a Redcap scalp, no doubt about it. Normally, they live in the hills deeper into the woods, but occasionally a stray pack of about half a dozen or so will wander into the lower reaches. All we can say is you guys got unlucky.”</p>
<p>“I guess so.”</p>
<p><em>Hmm? That was quite a large group we ran into, then.</em></p>
<p>Although we were downplaying their number to avoid suspicion, we had actually run into sixteen of the creatures. That didn’t feel like some stray pack…did they <em>all</em> get lost? Or was there something more to it?</p>
<p><em>Now that I think about it, before the undead army attacked, there were reports of heightened monster assaults. Could this be the precursor to that?</em></p>
<p>The first time I had come to Elmia, a swarm of undead had suddenly attacked out of nowhere. It turned out after the villagers were possessed by demons and the soldiers put them to death, the evil mana leaked out of their bodies and possessed the corpses of monsters. Those monsters then rose up and started killing other monsters to increase their ranks, before finally assaulting the City of Learning itself.</p>
<p>I had once stayed in the ruins of that village after the world turned against me. It was a cursed place. Deep scars in the earth still held vestiges of dark magics, and flowers bearing purple and yellow petals covered the rubble.</p>
<p><em>Last time, it was that piece of shit spellcaster Eumis who shared with us her knowledge of the undead, and it was an A-rank party comprising me, that damn princess, and the shithead knight commander who fought them off… I wonder what’ll happen this time?</em></p>
<p>It would still be another two months or so before that attack would happen. First, there would be an attack formed of goblins, Redcaps, and boars from the mountains. Luckily, there happened to be another A-rank party in the area, and coupled with the soldiers from Elmia, the city repelled that attack. That would happen about ten days prior. After fending them off, the city would send an investigation team into the forest to determine its cause, and that meant they were just barely able to respond to the army of undead in time. However…</p>
<p>That forest was the same one stretching between this town and the city of Elmia, so it wouldn’t be strange for its influences to be felt here, as well. It was likely that Redcaps appearing where they normally didn’t was another sign of that development in the works.</p>
<p>While I was thinking about all this, the receptionist finished counting my trophies and produced a sack of coins.</p>
<p>“There’s no request for Redcaps, so we’ll pay the normal fee. As for the goblins, here’s the reward for those.”</p>
<p>He tipped out a few coins onto the countertop and put the sack away.</p>
<p>“And I’d say we’re already looking at about E-rank levels of skill for coming back unharmed after fighting Redcaps, even if it was only two. Keep completing your requests and we might see fit to increase your rank.”</p>
<p>“I see, thank you.”</p>
<p>“And just a little word of advice, if I may. Zuily’s party may be D rank, but I haven’t heard good things about them at all. I think it’d be better for you if you try to steer clear of them. I heard about your wager, and I’ll pass the results on to them when they show up. You two kids head home for now, and let me handle them.”</p>
<p>“That’s very nice of you, thank you very much.”</p>
<p>This guy’s ripped, handsome, <em>and</em> nice. Not fair.</p>
<p>I bowed to the gruff-yet-polite receptionist, and then Minnalis and I left the guild.</p>
