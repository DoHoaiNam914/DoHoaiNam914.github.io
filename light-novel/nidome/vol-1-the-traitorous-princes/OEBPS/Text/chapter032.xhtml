<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ey, have you heard? They say the hero made some kinda deal with devils, and by killing the demon lord, he’s all set up to take her place. Turns out he ain’t as goody two-shoes as he led us to believe.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I heard that. Also heard he was behind the rebellion in the slums. Apparently, he went to the king after that and told him to enslave the whole lot of ’em. The king couldn’t say no, poor devil.”</p>
<p>“Guess now that he’s the new demon lord, he’s forgotten who helped him get this far. I mean, the slum dwellers aren’t <em>all</em> criminals—most of ’em are just people who can’t afford to eat no more, now that everything’s so damn expensive. That hero’s a real asshole.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, he doesn’t deserve to be called a hero. He makes me sick.”</p>
<p>In the royal capital was a run-down tavern a little off the high street. The sky outside was gloomy and gray, and rain hit the ground like buckets of water.</p>
<p><em>Damn them, talking shit behind my back…</em></p>
<p>I sipped my watered-down ale and listened closer to the surrounding voices, my hood pulled low over my face to conceal my identity. However, all they did was complain about how they couldn’t go hunting because of the rain, or about how their wives wouldn’t let them spend any money. I wasn’t drunk yet, but my thoughts started to turn introspective.</p>
<p>…It had been nearly six months since I defeated the demon lord. Everywhere I went, my reputation was in the gutter, and the deeds I’d supposedly done got worse every day. Even here in the royal capital, where I’d spent so many of my days, I was an outlaw. The times I had once been lauded as a savior seemed so far away.</p>
<p>I couldn’t even walk the streets without disguising my gender and appearance using the Contrarian’s Blade of Mirrors so that nobody knew who I was. I wouldn’t even have been able to enter the city at all if it wasn’t for the small number of allies who still helped me.</p>
<p>On my way here, people I thought were my friends turned on me. The reasons they gave for attacking me were utterly incomprehensible.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The fighter, whose noble character I admired, said I was standing in his way of becoming the ultimate hero.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The dancer, a reassuring sisterly presence, told me she wanted to grant her husband, the fighter, his dream and collect the bounty on my head.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The clumsy wizard, who came to care for me along our quest together, revealed a desire to experiment on me for the purpose of being remembered for generations.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The merchant, who helped me commercialize my modern-day knowledge, tried to kill me out of the fear that I would sell that knowledge to others and threaten his monopoly.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The martial artist, who was unsociable but loved animals, wanted to kill me simply to become stronger.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The assassin, dispatched by the kingdom to assist us and whose information saved our lives on many occasions, told me with cold eyes that the king had ordered my death, and he would not hesitate to obey.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The villagers who helped us on our travels looked at me with greed in their eyes as they admitted they had sold me out for coin.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Finally, there was the kindly priestess, who always cheered everyone up. She declared me the enemy of her God, said I had been corrupted by evil. She never told me the reason for her betrayal.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The kingdom, the empire, the beast lands, the Church. One by one, the lands I’d sworn to protect turned against me. The people believed their leaders without suspicion, and I, whom they had called a hero, became a target of scorn. Even now, I still hadn’t come to terms with the fact that I had been betrayed. I wanted to scream at their reasoning. I was reduced to hiding myself like a criminal, my heart burning in a sea of hostility, until at last, I returned to the royal capital. It was tough. It was painful. Many times, I wanted to give up, but the one thing that gave my broken heart solace was the promise I had made to the demon lord.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>“Promise me you’ll go back to your family. Your home.”</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">…That was what the girl I killed said to me. What a demanding girl she was. Through all the lies, the deceit, the bluff and bluster, behind all the haughty laughter, she was a coward. A crybaby. And she understood me more than anyone else. She brought color into this black-and-white cardboard cutout of a world, and everyone hated her for it.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I clasped the small pouch hanging from my neck. Inside was the magic stone that held the sorceress’s evil power. To a demon like her, it was her heart.</p>
<p>It required an enormous amount of mana to summon a hero. The royal family exhausted many of their most precious magical artifacts bringing me over. The sorceress gave me that power in the form of this stone, her own life, all to grant me my wish and let me return to my world.</p>
<p>She said we’d settle things once and for all, with no regrets, and then she let herself get killed.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>“It seems I shan’t be accompanying you back to your world after all. Well, no matter. You’ve helped me so much, Kaito. It’s about time I gave something back. It’s like I said: I never leave a debt unsettled.”</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">“You always did like overkill.”</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>“Promise me you’ll go back to your world. Your family. Your home. Oh, but don’t forget me too quickly. Be sure to mourn me. Construct a tomb worthy of my greatness and weep as you remember my legacy. Kaito, all you ever think about is your own world. I want to have you to myself for a while! Hee-hee-hee! When I think about it that way, dying doesn’t seem so bad after all!”</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">“Don’t give me that. I know you’re scared; don’t lie to me.”</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>“Oh, and one more thing. Make sure you get all you want out of life. I’m giving you my own, so you had better not waste it. I’ll be watching over you, so look out, mister! If I see you slacking off, I’ll come back to life and beat you up! Or I’ll haunt you!”</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">“I’d be fine with that, if it meant I got to see you again as a ghost or anything else.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">Her voice was so burned into my mind, I still heard it when she wasn’t around. The last words we shared passed through my thoughts. She was a selfish girl, right to the bitter end, and I was a horrible person for letting her go through with it.</p>
<p>Now that I had slain evil and saved the world, it was my turn to be on the receiving end. She used to call me a fool. Turns out, she was right. I was a fool. An idiot. A coward. I could only regret that I had realized it too late.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>So now I would do anything to keep that promise. I would return home to my family, just as she wanted. It was the only thing keeping me going.</p>
<p>Before I realized it, my tankard was empty.</p>
<p>“Hey there, young lass, sucks to see such a beautiful girl lookin’ so down. How ’bout drinks? On us.”</p>
<p>“…I’ll pass. Barkeep! The money’s on the table.”</p>
<p>“He…hey! <em>Tsk…</em> Not interested, eh?”</p>
<p>After refusing the drunkard’s generous invitation, I headed out into the rain, and my hood protected me from the heavy droplets. On rainy nights, the street was bare. I used the effect of the Wing Blade of Detoxification to purge the alcohol from my system before heading to the slums. The people there were grateful to me for saving them when the Wall Eaters destroyed the city barriers and allowed monsters to attack, and they offered me shelter where the kingdom wouldn’t find me. I planned to infiltrate the castle the next day and find my way back to the summoning chamber where I had first come to this world. It seemed the king, queen, and knights were all out of the castle at the moment.</p>
<p>I didn’t know why the kingdom had betrayed me, or if they truly believed all this talk about me becoming the next demon lord, and although I would have loved to hear the answer, the priority right now was returning to my own world.</p>
<p>“…Looks like I was right to sober up.”</p>
<p>I headed down a side road as naturally as possible before turning around and attempting to draw out the people who had been tailing me ever since I left the tavern.</p>
<p>“What do you—? <em>Ahem</em>, might you have some business with me? I don’t recall doing anything that might capture the attention of two lovely gentlemen such as yourselves.”</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered I was supposed to be a woman and corrected my speech. A deathly hush fell over the alley. Just as I thought my pursuers were about to spring a surprise attack, two men dressed in black stepped into view.</p>
<p>“You are the hero, correct? In that case… Urk!”</p>
<p>By combining my mastered Fleet-Foot skill—“Godfoot”—and my mastered Air Step—“Blinkstep”—I teleported behind the two men faster than the eye could see and held my Twin Blades of Shadow to their throats.</p>
<p>“Where did you learn that information? This disguise is too perfect for any of the townsfolk to see through.”</p>
<p>“W-wait! The princess sent us! She heard that a woman who looks like the hero was in town and sent us to find her!”</p>
<p>Now that they mentioned it, the two men did look familiar. I recalled seeing them among the princess’s entourage.</p>
<p>“Alicia? What does the princess of this traitorous country want with me?”</p>
<p>“Th-the princess herself has not betrayed you! We are your friends! We know what you want, and we braved danger to come find you so that we can return you to your original world, as promised!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“The king and queen may have been taken in by the Church’s lies about your succeeding the demon lord and forced you to shoulder all the people’s resentment against the kingdom’s oppressive rule, but the princess is still on your side! Besides, the summoning ritual is a secret of the royal family, passed down only through oral tradition! You need her help to perform it!”</p>
<p>They had a point. I was not well versed in magic. I couldn’t even cast it myself. Either way, I was going to need to learn the ritual from the royal family first. I was planning to do that by searching their library, but if what these men said was true, that would be a fruitless effort since it wasn’t written down anywhere.</p>
<p>“…So what do you want with me?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We can take you to the princess right now, if you’d like. Come with us to our hideout. It’s okay; we’re your <em>allies</em>.”</p>
<p>…Could I trust them?</p>
<p>I had parted with the princess before my final battle with the demon lord, and I had not seen her since. It was entirely possible what these men said was true, and she was only pretending to go along with her mother and father. If she helped me, I could return to my world immediately. I could put an end to this life on the run. A life spent wading through muddy water.</p>
<p>“<em>Please just trust us.</em> The princess has been worried sick about you. That is why she sent us to make contact with you as soon as possible. She said she wanted to help you.”</p>
<p>At those words, I choked up. The men before me—they looked like me. Their words were my words. <em>Please just trust me.</em> It was all I ever wanted.</p>
<p>“…Okay. I’ll come with you.”</p>
<p>I removed my blades from their throats, and the two men were visibly relieved.</p>
<p>“Th-thank you. Please follow us. We’re heading inside the castle, to the place you first appeared when you were summoned. From there, you’ll use a teleportation stone to warp to a safe location while we prepare for the ritual. We don’t know who could be watching, so we need to take every precaution, you see.”</p>
<p>For purposes of national security, there were small magic items in every town or village that blocked teleportation in or out of the settlement. Otherwise, when war broke out, enemies could bypass the country’s defenses. However, there was a location within the castle from which teleportation to any destination was possible. That was the summoning chamber where I had first arrived. Otherwise, it would not have been possible to summon me from my world. The artifacts that suppressed that building’s effective range were not buried deep in the ground like the others but were removable to allow for long-distance teleportation.</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>I wanted to say my last good-byes to the people who helped me up to this point, but I decided not to. As long as the world saw me as evil, it would be dangerous for anyone to be affiliated with me. If I could end things without needing to rely on them anymore, then that was best for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Following the black-robed men, I arrived at a small copse on the outskirts of the city.</p>
<p>“Hey, I thought we were going to the castle,” I called out.</p>
<p>“Indeed. There’s a path within this forest that leads straight to the summoning chamber within the palace.”</p>
<p>I walked with the two men deeper into the forest, and before long, they began to rummage around on the ground, searching for something. Within about ten seconds, they found what they were looking for and lifted up a huge square-shaped slab of rock. Heading down into the hole, I was greeted by a thick carpet of dust and a scent of damp and mold that I was well used to by now. The stone staircase and stale air were certainly in line with what I expected a secret underground passage to be like.</p>
<p>“This way, please. If you could watch your step.”</p>
<p>The two men retrieved candles from their pockets to light the way, and we descended into the passage. The tunnel remained level for a while, the air heavy and stagnant, and for the longest time, the only sound was the echo of our footsteps on the flagstones.</p>
<p>Then at last, we reached a dead end, and when the two men lifted the ceiling, I found myself once more in the familiar summoning chamber from all those years ago.</p>
<p>“Ah, Hero! I’m so glad to see that you made it!”</p>
<p>I looked to the source of the voice, and standing right there, smiling like a flower, was Princess Alicia, looking as beautiful and delicate as the day I met her. She had been fifteen then, and while she had certainly grown up magnificently in the subsequent years, she had not changed at all in some ways.</p>
<p>“Are you hurt, Hero?”</p>
<p>“O-oh, no, Princess. I’m surprised you knew—”</p>
<p>“—That it was you? You have told me about the Contrarian’s Blade of Mirrors before.”</p>
<p>The princess broke into a familiar smile. Seeing it put my mind at ease. It was like nothing had happened, like we were still back before things went so wrong. I had decided to trust her—that was why I was here—but part of me had still feared she would turn on me like all the others, attacking me with her signature Light magic as soon as she saw me.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you have many questions, but we have no time. Take this teleportation stone and activate it by charging it with mana. It should work so long as you’re in this room.”</p>
<p>The princess handed me a semitransparent yellow crystal. It was an item I had used many times before.</p>
<p>“Once you arrive, we can talk further. I’ll teach you the ritual to return to your world there.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Thank you.”</p>
<p>I channeled my mana into the teleportation stone, and it began to glow. The spell encoded within the stone activated, and a magic circle spread out and encompassed me.</p>
<p>At that moment, the princess laughed.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Hee-hee. Oh, what a hopeless fool you are.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">Before I could respond to her mocking words, I was shrouded in light and whisked off. The last thing I saw was the princess’s true face as the veneer of respectability peeled away.</p>
<p class="space-break2">As soon as the teleportation ended, I immediately sensed danger and channeled mana into my emergency soul blade, the Aegis Blade of Shielding. A split second later, an unimaginable barrage of spells rained down on me. Through my enhanced Reaction Time, I could see each and every one of them in detail. A blazing fireball. A razor-sharp icicle. An invisible blade of wind. A boulder heavy enough to crush me. A spear of pure light. A grasping shadow. Over a hundred different spells descended upon me, seeking my death, and this magic… I’d felt it somewhere before.</p>
<p>I dispelled my disguise and prepared for battle. When the dust and rubble that had been thrown into the air by the attack settled, I saw hundreds upon hundreds of knights, the scars across their faces a testament to their combat experience. Leading them was the man who taught me how to fight, the royal-knight commander, and beside him, her long silver hair still glowing with the mana from her spells, was Princess Alicia.</p>
<p>“Honestly, for being such an idiot, you’re as stubborn as a mule.”</p>
<p>I quickly assessed my surroundings. I was in some sort of arena beneath a vast dome, and I recognized it as the Guardian Room of a dungeon we had encountered along our quest, the Fuuga Ruins. Given that I would expect the Guardian to have revived by now, they must have defeated it again, and indeed, I could see that the Dungeon Core behind the princess had lost its magical glow. It would have been easy enough for them to do if they knew how to take it down. After all, it was with these knights’ help that I had defeated the boss in the first place.</p>
<p>“…Alicia. So you’ve betrayed me, too?!”</p>
<p>“Betrayed you? Oh my, no. To do that, I would have to be your ally first, no? It’s not a betrayal if I was never on your side to begin with. Could you imagine? A princess teaming up with a filthy otherworlder? Just the thought of it makes my skin crawl. Thank heavens I don’t have to put on that disgusting act any longer.”</p>
<p>She smiled. It was her true nature, unclouded by deceit.</p>
<p>“Honestly, if you’d just crawl over and die already, I could wash my hands of all this. You’re like a gutter rat. Oh well, I suppose it’ll be over soon enough.”</p>
<p>“Alicia…you…!”</p>
<p>“You can’t teleport out of here, can you? And we’re far from any city, so we don’t have to worry about causing damage. We control the exits, and you’re far outnumbered. Even you won’t last long.”</p>
<p>She was telling the truth. It was impossible to <em>activate</em> teleportation magic while in a Guardian Room. You could teleport in, but not out. My only hope would be to get out of this room to somewhere I could teleport from, but it wasn’t possible for me to fight my way through hundreds of the kingdom’s best warriors to the room’s sole exit. Maybe I stood a chance if some of them were the inexperienced rank and file, but that wasn’t the case here. There was no way for me to break through.</p>
<p>“I must say I’m glad you’re so stupid. You were so easy to trick. Even those commoners living near the slums deceived you.”</p>
<p>“Wh-what? …No!”</p>
<p>“Indeed. Ever since you arrived in the city, they’ve been reporting your movements to me. All I needed to do was drop them a couple of gold coins and they told me <em>everything</em>.”</p>
<p>“…Krh…”</p>
<p><em>“Now it’s our turn to help you.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Of course we’d pay back our debt!”</em></p>
<p>The images of the villagers who’d helped me flashed through my mind. They had gone against me, too.</p>
<p>“…Dammit! How could they stab me in the back so easily?!”</p>
<p>I felt anger at being betrayed and disappointment in myself.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Why hadn’t I been more distrustful? I had been in the city for only two days, and people came in and out of it all the time. How would anyone have noticed that there was a woman in town who looked like the hero when I wasn’t even showing my face?</p>
<p class="space-break1">And what about this supposed hideout? Why hadn’t I realized it before? The summoning chamber may let you teleport to any location, but that didn’t apply in reverse. If this safe house was outside the city, how was I supposed to teleport back in?</p>
<p class="space-break1">I was naive. I had failed to notice what was going on. I could console myself by saying I had been tired from my long journey, from my life as a fugitive, but it was cold comfort now.</p>
<p>“Why…? Why would you go so far just to kill me?!”</p>
<p>“Oh my, stalling for time? Fine by me. I suppose you have done rather well for a rat. Very well, I shall entertain you.”</p>
<p>The princess chuckled, giving me a scornful look the likes of which I had never seen.</p>
<p>I would never die before fulfilling my promise and returning to my world. I needed something, anything, to get myself out of this situation. My darting eyes fell at last upon Princess Alicia herself.</p>
<p>…Everything I had seen in her until now had been an act.</p>
<p>“It’s not good for the royal family to have someone running about with so much power. As long as you live, it threatens the peace and stability of our nation. The seeds of rebellion are sprouting. Therefore, we must have you take all our citizens’ discontent. Then by killing you, we can crush that potential unrest as well.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you…”</p>
<p>“Or at least, that’s what Mother and Father would say, but the true reason is that I simply cannot permit you to exist. Oh, how revolting it is that an otherworlder like you is allowed to wear our beautiful skin, speak our beautiful words, and live in our beautiful world! I thought demihumans and beastfolk were repulsive enough, but you’re even more sickening than them! It’s foul! Do you have any idea how hard it was for me to hold back my vomit while we traveled together?”</p>
<p>“…Gh!”</p>
<p>She wasn’t just treating me with contempt. In her eyes, I wasn’t a human at all. She looked at me like I was a piece of filth rotting before her. Like my mere existence offended her to her very core.</p>
<p>But then her face changed in an instant, back to the smiling flower I had seen <em>so many times before</em>.</p>
<p>“However, I will do one last thing for you,” she stated. “I’ll teach you how to get back to your own world, like I promised I would.”</p>
<p>Alicia laughed, as if she found the idea funny. As put off as I was by her sudden transformation, I felt something else. Something deeply disturbing.</p>
<p>“No lies, I promise. To prove it, I’ll even swear using the Oath of Fidelity.”</p>
<p>The “Oath of Fidelity” was a means for users of spirit magic to verify their claims. If they swore falsely by it, the caster would lose whatever they specified in the oath, along with the ability to ever cast spirit magic again.</p>
<p>“I swear, in the presence of the myriad spirits, that my words on the summoning ritual and ritual of departure be true, and may the spirits take my arm if not. <em>Oath of Fidelity</em>.”</p>
<p>Alicia’s body was enveloped in a pale light, indicating that the spell was successful. As long as the light surrounded her, Alicia could not tell a lie or else she would lose her arm.</p>
<p>“Now, I shall reveal all.”</p>
<p>Alicia smiled a sadistic smile, one she could never show as a princess. The mere sight of her set alarm bells ringing in my mind.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Why was she going to so much trouble to make it clear she wasn’t lying?</p>
<p class="space-break1">Why would she tell me what I wanted to know right before she killed me?</p>
<p class="space-break1">Alicia’s motives worried me, but I recognized this as an opportunity. I needed to find a way out of here, but I was also desperately in need of the ritual to take me home. Under this oath, it was basically impossible for her to lie.</p>
<p>“The ritual itself is simple. Like other rituals, all you need to perform it is the appropriate tribute. For the hero summoning and sending ritual, you need an item containing an enormous amount of mana, the ancient inscriptions found in the summoning chamber, and one other thing. What do you suppose that is?”</p>
<p>“One other thing, huh…?”</p>
<p>Summoning me required the royal family to give up several of their most powerful artifacts. The more you had, the less powerful the individual tributes needed to be, but in order to count as tributes, these objects had to be above a certain power level. Higher-quality items could hold more mana. For weapons and armor, that meant the materials it was made of, how it was constructed, and the skill of the person who created it. It was incredibly hard to find items of high enough quality to use as ritual tributes, not to mention the vast reserves of mana you had to imbue them with. Even a kingdom would struggle to locate such items. That was why I held on so tightly to that bag around my neck.</p>
<p>“There’s something else you need…?!”</p>
<p>“Indeed. No amount of mana alone is enough to defy heaven’s rule, even for an instant. Did you never consider that?”</p>
<p>Alicia flashed me an innocent smile. Then as if to deny me the thought, she spoke in a voice laced with venom.</p>
<p>“There are four steps to the ritual. The first is to open a portal in the space-time of this world. Next, you must open a portal in the space-time of the other world. Then you must create a path that bridges the two portals. Finally, you must draw the summoning target through. Each of these steps requires one tribute, and the mana is just for priming the ritual and drawing the target out. So what do you suppose the other tributes are?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I understood very little in the ways of ritual magic. The only ritual I knew offered a few medicinal herbs as tribute to apply a detoxifying effect. I had seen larger rituals performed, but I didn’t know what the tributes were. This type of magic was already arcane enough.</p>
<p>“Tee-hee. Very well. Then I shall give you a hint. In order to complete the first step…”</p>
<p>A chill of fear ran up my spine.</p>
<p>“…in the place in which the portal was to be opened…”</p>
<p><em>Don’t listen</em>, my body was saying. I wanted to plug my ears and drown out her voice. But I had to listen. I needed to hear what she would say. I had to know.</p>
<p>“…two hundred members of the humanoid race were put to death.”</p>
<p>I felt the blood drain from my face. Pleased by my reaction, Alicia had on a demonic smile.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee. Allow me to ask you a different question. On our side, we used beastfolk slaves captured from abroad. Now…</p>
<p class="space-break1">“…what do you suppose we used for the bridge and the other portal?”</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>Wh-what the hell…?</em></p>
<p>If opening a portal on this side required a sacrifice of two hundred of this world’s people…</p>
<p>…then surely, to open a portal in my world, it would need… But that would mean…</p>
<p>“Now, tell me, Hero. Didn’t you mention to me before where you were and who you were with when you were summoned? Why don’t you tell me what was used for the portal first?”</p>
<p>I had been in my classroom at school. Then the offering would have been the people there with me…</p>
<p class="space-break1">…which would have been my teachers and friends?</p>
<p class="space-break1">“You’re…you’re lying.”</p>
<p>“I’m not. It’s the truth. Look, my arms are still here. The people who died when you were summoned were the two hundred people physically closest to you at the time.”</p>
<p>Somewhere deep inside me, I heard my heart crack.</p>
<p>“You little shiiiiits!”</p>
<p><em>““““““Restraining Thorns!””””””</em></p>
<p>“Gah! Grh!”</p>
<p>Fueled by anger, I summoned my most powerful soul blade. However, before I could take a single step, magical chains appeared to hold me back. The chains, covered in gray spikes, obeyed the wills of the magical knights who summoned them, rising up out of the ground and trapping me like a net. I was unharmed thanks to the Clothes of Dark Spirits I wore, but the bindings left me unable to move in the slightest.</p>
<p>“Tee-hee! Like I said, it’s the truth.”</p>
<p>“Shut it! I’ll murder you! Get the hell out of my way, dammit!”</p>
<p>I was seething, seized by an uncontrollable rage. I struggled against my chains, but all I could do was rattle them powerlessly. Alicia watched me with the biggest grin on her face.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“…Now, that just leaves the question of the bridge, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p class="space-break1">It was like an ice cube had been slipped down my back.</p>
<p>“Wait… What do you mean…? You mean…there’s more…?”</p>
<p>The dread was clear in my voice as my lips faltered while trying to put together the words.</p>
<p>What more was she going to say? What other terrors did that monstrous smile have to reveal?</p>
<p>“The space between worlds is the divine realm. No human can survive such a transgression unaided.”</p>
<p>I didn’t want to listen. I didn’t want to listen. I didn’t want to listen. What else did she sacrifice to bring me over here?</p>
<p>“It’s said that those who intrude upon the divine realm are marked with great power. That is why heroes arrive in this world with powerful intrinsic abilities. However, that is of little use to us if the hero is dead on arrival. Thus, a bridge is required that allows the hero to pass from one world to the other safely, while still receiving the power of the divine.”</p>
<p>My friends. My teachers. Two hundred people. What was left for them to take?</p>
<p>Then Alicia said her final words, drenched in pleasure, as if she were biting into the tender flesh of a cherry and tasting its sweet juices.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“The materials required, the tribute for that step, are five people whose souls are aligned with your own. For example…</p>
<p>“………your parents, your siblings, your grandparents. Your relatives.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">I heard a sound, like my world was being pinched out by the princess’s poison-stained fingers.</p>
<p>“What…are you saying? Huh…? No…that’s not… I mean…”</p>
<p>My mouth was forming words, but I had already stopped thinking. I had no idea what I was saying.</p>
<p>“I’m saying they’re dead! Your family, your friends. They all died so you could come here!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">They’re dead? Mom? Dad? Mai? Suehiko? Kenta? Yuuto? Mr. Oogane?</p>
<p>Why? Why? Why? Why, why, why, why? That means I can’t go back!</p>
<p>I promised her. I promised I’d go back and see my family. I told her. I’d go back. I promised. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Look at your face! That’s what I wanted to see! Ah-ha-ha! Hey, how does it feel? You wanted to go back to your world, didn’t you? See your family? Your friends? Well, they’ve been dead this whole time, you little shit! Ha-ha-ha-ha!”</p>
<p>Her shrill laughter was like a blade between my ribs. I could feel myself falling apart.</p>
<p>“You won’t believe how hard I had to try not to laugh when you first told me! That was the only time I found it tolerable to be with you, because you were so damn funny!”</p>
<p>My world spun. Forward, backward, right, left, up, down, it all blended together into one big, oversaturated blur.</p>
<p>“Stop… Just… Please stop…”</p>
<p>“<em>‘I’d like to go back home. Mess around with my friends again. Eat dinner with my family again.’</em> That’s what you sounded like before you went off to kill that dumb shrew. Well? I thought that was a pretty darn good impression of you.”</p>
<p>This was it. I was breaking down.</p>
<p>The sound of creaking branches, of cracking glass. My world was being replaced with something else.</p>
<p>“Still want to go back? Go right ahead. Rape some beastfolk girls, make some little half-breed babies, and they should be enough to get you a bridge back! Actually, don’t do that, or I’ll have to kill them. I don’t want otherworlder spawn spreading its filth in this world even for a second.”</p>
<p>“Ngh!! Aliciaaaaaaaaaaaa!”</p>
<p>My mana rushed into my arms and legs, fueled by my rage, and I tore apart the chains that bound me.</p>
<p>“Now! Concentrate fire!” ordered the knight commander.</p>
<p>“Grrraaarghhh! Get out of my way!” I screamed. The knights fired their spells at me, but I didn’t even look in their direction.</p>
<p>I was burned with fire, shot with water, sliced by wind, beaten with stone, pierced with light, and tormented by darkness, and yet the one thing that drove me was the thought of using the sword in my hand to stab Princess Alicia right through her rotten heart. Any desire to get away had long since disappeared. As the soldiers brandished their weapons, I dashed between them to arrive before her.</p>
<p>“Diiiiiiie!”</p>
<p>I swung my sword toward her with all my rage.</p>
<p>“Grh! Grrrgaaah!”</p>
<p>“Tee-hee. What a fool you are. Couldn’t even see through that illusion? How pathetic.”</p>
<p>Her body had dissolved into a fine mist, and dozens of arrows landed in my back.</p>
<p>My Clothes of Dark Spirits had exhausted all their power getting me through the barrage of spells and could not stop the ensuing onslaught.</p>
<p>“Now, I’m afraid the show is over. As thanks for entertaining me, I shall end your life personally. What an honor. You, hand me your sword.”</p>
<p>A knight standing near the princess produced his weapon, and Alicia took it in her hands before slowly walking toward me.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>“Hey, Kaito.”</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">In my last moments, I heard the voice of the girl they called evil.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>“I’ll do anything and everything I can for you. I’ll give you half the world if I must. So please come to my side.”</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">I wasn’t able to hold her trembling hand.</p>
<p>She knew I would refuse. She knew I wouldn’t take it.</p>
<p>She was left to cry her cold tears alone.</p>
<p>It was my fault. I made a mistake. I was wrong.</p>
<p>And this was my punishment. I was finally going to pay the price for my stupidity.</p>
<p><em>“Promise me you’ll go back to your world.”</em> The life she had given for me, the promise we had made. It was all for nothing. My home had already been taken away from me for good.</p>
<p>“Now die, you monster from another world wearing our skin.”</p>
<p>I was about to be killed, but my mind was flooded with regret.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>“Make sure you get all you want out of life. I’m giving you my own, so you had better not waste it. I’ll be watching over you, so look out, mister!”</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">The moment the princess’s sword plunged toward my heart, I remembered those words.</p>
<p>“Wh-what is the meaning of this?!”</p>
<p>Alicia’s sword never reached my chest. There was a ringing sound as it struck the <em>demon heart</em> hanging around my neck. The accumulated power of the demon lord flowed out of it and flooded into the Guardian Core. It was enough to revive the Guardian immediately.</p>
