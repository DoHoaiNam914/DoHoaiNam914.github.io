<p class="space-break">The slave seller made his escape around the time the strange man dressed in black conjured an ominous-looking short sword out of nowhere.</p>
<p>He found the man suspicious at first, but all that mattered to him was whether he could pay. When the man said he would pay up to ten gold coins for slaves with a market price of four at best, he knew he had a chump on his hands. He could sell him some expensive slaves at a significant markup and rake in the cash.</p>
<p>But then the man asked about that Lagonid girl. A worthless beast who was left in her cage to die because it cost too much to even <em>feed</em> her. Surely, even this naive man wouldn’t pay much for her, and so the slave seller was just about to steer him toward some pricier slaves when the man declared he would pay ten gold coins for her.</p>
<p>What luck! Ten gold coins for a product he was just going to throw away. The slave seller thought it must have been his lucky day, and he rubbed his hands, imagining all that free profit.</p>
<p>Things took a strange turn not long after the contract was signed, when the man gave his new slave some expensive potions to drink. Then they talked for a bit. The slave seller couldn’t quite follow, but their conversation was disturbing all the same. The breaking point was when the customer pulled out a black-and-red blade—a terrifying weapon. He didn’t need to know what it was to see that it was a bad sign.</p>
<p>The slaver knew danger. He did business in the slums, after all, and his survival instincts were telling him to get out of there as quickly as possible. His slaves and his money wouldn’t matter if he wasn’t alive to enjoy them. He slipped away while the two were talking and flew out into the street, taking only a bag of gold that he kept behind the counter for emergencies.</p>
<p>He didn’t look back; he just ran in search of the safe house he had prepared for such an eventuality. Tripping over himself and losing his way several times, he eventually arrived at its door.</p>
<p>“Hey, now. You wouldn’t leave a customer waiting, would you?”</p>
<p>The man stood before his very eyes, wearing a smile in name only.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Ah! Er…um…well, you see, I had an emergency to attend to…,” the slave seller stammered, his face pale, before making a break for one of the side alleys nearby.</p>
<p>I wasn’t about to let him escape, for he was now one of my sworn enemies. I knocked him out with a blow to the back of the head. I had to be careful; too much force could break his neck, and we didn’t want him to die just yet. It would be awfully rude of me to start the <em>meal</em> without my partner, after all. I planned to take a purely advisory role this time, but I figured I may as well be proactive and find out some information about the slave seller that Minnalis would find useful.</p>
<p>The Holy Sword of Retribution only showed me the moment her desire for revenge took root, so I knew nothing about Minnalis’s enemies except for this man. I needed to talk about all of them and learn how to make them all suffer. If all I had was my own hate, I couldn’t do anything except kill them immediately.</p>
<p>I lifted the unconscious man onto my shoulder and made my way back to the slave market. When I returned, Minnalis had herded all the slaves into the largest cage, and she was working on something in the cooking area at the back of the shop. There was still a little room in the cage, despite there being about twenty slaves crammed in there.</p>
<p>“Hey. Got him for you,” I announced.</p>
<p>“Ah, thank you, Master. My hands are full right now, so please just throw him in there with the rest of them.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Okay.”</p>
<p>“Gah…!”</p>
<p>I unlocked the cage, which was attached to the wall, and tossed the man inside before relocking it. As he hit the hard stone floor, he came to his senses and looked around in confusion.</p>
<p>“Y-you bastard! Do you have any idea what you’re—?!”</p>
<p>“I’m dooone! Whoa… I’m so dizzy all of a sudden…” The man was interrupted by a jubilant cry that came from the kitchen and seemed totally inappropriate. Technically, this level of excitement was just right for what was about to happen.</p>
<p>Minnalis appeared, looking a little unsteady, with the most beautiful smile on her face.</p>
<p>“That’s what happens when you use all your MP up at once. Hurry up and drink the potion I gave you.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master… Tee-hee… Hey, will you give it to me mouth-to-mouth…?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Awww, why nooot?”</p>
<p>“You’re just high from the MP loss. I’m not so thirsty that I’d take advantage of a girl in that state.”</p>
<p>MP loss led to a sensation of drunkenness. Using a decent amount in one go would just cause headaches and a sensation of <em>dizziness</em>, but go beyond that, and it could feel like you’d been out drinking all night, complete with a loss of inhibitions. Restoring your MP wouldn’t instantly sober you up, either, so you had to be careful.</p>
<p>Checking her status, I saw that her MP had gone from the 90 percent she’d had when I left her, down to about 10 percent. It was quite a lot, considering that an average fireball you’d use in battle consumed only ten MP.</p>
<p>Minnalis was already excited enough from getting to use her new power and exact her vengeance. I was probably going to need to give her some space the next morning.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Minnalis had taken the MP potion and was guzzling the blue liquid in a most provocative manner.</p>
<p>“<em>Phew…</em> Master, you are such a tease.”</p>
<p>“Come on. Stop messing around. Isn’t it about time to start on the main dish?”</p>
<p>“Yep! Hee-hee!”</p>
<p>It appeared Minnalis required no further assistance from me, so I sat back to enjoy the spectacle. With a buoyant mood that refused to acknowledge the bleak atmosphere of the room, she happily <em>carried the food she had prepared over to the cage</em>. It took several trips. She’d used up everything the slave seller kept in his stores.</p>
<p>“Here you go; food’s ready! Eat up!”</p>
<p>The smell of the meal was divine, but as expected, neither the shopkeeper nor the slaves would even touch it. They just stared at Minnalis with apprehension.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I guess you guys don’t want to eat my cooking… Then why don’t we start with you? You were giving such a dirty, rotten look to me and my mother the entire way to the capital.”</p>
<p>“Eek!”</p>
<p>Still smiling, Minnalis glared at one of the manacled slaves with the look of a predator eyeing up its prey. As her mana surged, the color disappeared from her beige eyes, replaced with a gray haze that glowed with a dim, faded light.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Mind turn to chaos. <em>Intoxicating Phantasm</em>.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">Her words were gentle, beguiling, and emotionless, like a witch.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Aaah! Aaaaahhh! What’s happening?! Make it stopppp!”</p>
<p>Her mana merged into a pale mist that enveloped the man. The other slaves and the dealer could do nothing but watch, their faces pale with terror as they struggled to comprehend what was going on. The mist dissolved into the man as though it were being absorbed through his skin, and he wailed madly.</p>
<p>“Graaarh! Aaaargh! Give me the food! Give it to meeee!”</p>
<p>He launched himself toward the bars as though he had forgotten he was shackled, and when he tripped and fell to the ground, he still crawled desperately on all fours, like an animal. He grabbed fistfuls of the steaming-hot food and shoveled it into his mouth without a shred of dignity.</p>
<p>“Ohhh, this stuff is stronger than I thought. Look how hungry he thinks he is now! It’s going to take some experimenting to get the level just right.”</p>
<p>Minnalis cackled as she watched the ravenous man. The other prisoners were starting to feel uneasy. All she had done was make him eat some food. They were expecting something far crueler from her.</p>
<p>“Now,” she said, “it’s time for the rest of you to eat up. Don’t worry, I’ll be gentler this time and let you slowly give in to madness as your hunger grows… Mind, stir. <em>Intoxicating Phantasm</em>.”</p>
<p>“Wha…? Urp…”</p>
<p>“Ah… Uhhh…”</p>
<p>“Wargh… Urgh…”</p>
<p>The pale mist appeared once again and coiled around the men before sinking into their bodies. This time, they didn’t instantly make a mad dash for the food, but they still approached it timidly. Just a couple of them reached out at first, but with time, all of them gave in to the hunger, and before long, they were all feasting to their hearts’ content.</p>
<p>Minnalis grinned and looked at them fondly, like she was watching a plant she helped grow. Soon, it would bear fruit. Very soon now.</p>
<p>“Urgh? Argh… GRAAAARGH!!”</p>
<p>“Ah, there it is! <img alt="image" src="../Images/music.jpg"/>”</p>
<p>The first to react was the man she had first used her magic on. Minnalis’s expression transformed into a wicked grin.</p>
<p>“Gah! Urgh! Aaaaaaaargh!”</p>
<p>His arms were the first to change. His tanned, muscular arms became shriveled <em>and green, like a goblin’s</em>. The other slaves froze midmeal and stared at him in astonishment. The man writhed in pain and gazed blankly at his transformed arms. However, it was not for long; soon after he stopped eating, his ravenous hunger consumed him once more, and he rushed back toward the food.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Now, eat up, my lovelies. The more you eat, the more you transform into a goblin! I hope that doesn’t bother you. If so, no matter. Soon, your hunger will be so great, you won’t be able to control yourself. Hee-hee-hee!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">“No! Noooooo!”</p>
<p>“Urgh! Gah! Urp!”</p>
<p>“Gaaaah! Ugh! Grrrrrrah!”</p>
<p>Most of the prisoners began vomiting up their undigested food, but their hunger kept growing, snowballing out of control as if mocking their attempts at fighting back.</p>
<p>“Aaagh! Gah! No! I can’t eat! But I’m so HUNGRYYYYYYY!”</p>
<p>“<em>Huff, huff, huff, huff.</em> I don’t care. I don’t care anymooooreee!”</p>
<p>No matter how they tried to resist, all of them succumbed to their hunger and resumed eating. Then soon, they began to transform.</p>
<p>“Graaaaah!”</p>
<p>Minnalis watched them through the iron bars of the cage and stamped on a spindly green arm that reached out through them. Even after wincing in pain, the creature quickly got back to scooping up more food.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! You just can’t keep your hands off my food, can you? Eat as much as you like! There’s plenty more where that came from!”</p>
<p>“Gah… Gaaaaaargh!”</p>
<p>One particularly anguished scream rose out above the sounds of the feasting prisoners. However, this was not anguish at his transformation.</p>
<p>“Oh my, you’ve turned completely into a goblin now. I’m glad to see you love my food so much. Hee-hee!”</p>
<p>The man who first started eating was also the first to complete his transformation; he started scratching and clawing at his own body, his repulsive face stretched even uglier in pain. Yet even now, he didn’t stop eating and continued to shove food into his mouth.</p>
<p>“One thing I should mention: This food is lethal to monsters; it causes them to die the most horrific, painful deaths. How does it feel to eat it knowing that? Are you listening to me? Well, I suppose you can’t answer. After all, goblins can’t say anything except <em>Gah</em>.”</p>
<p>By this point, most of the prisoners had transformed into goblins and were clawing hysterically at the food. The more they ate, the closer to goblins they became, and the more the food racked their bodies with unbearable pain as it killed them. They could not stop eating, even though the last vestiges of their minds knew what it was doing to them. Their survival instincts knew only that they had to eat, and it overpowered what little reason they had left.</p>
<p>Minnalis gazed at the cage of goblins that used to be her owner and fellow slaves with a look of pure satisfaction, like her heart had been set free.</p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Die, die, die! Suffer and perish, powerless to do anything about it! Feel the helplessness I felt when my mom passed away and die as wretchedly as she did! Ah-ha-ha! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!”</p>
<p>One goblin stuck its head out through the bars toward the food, even as it suffered. It was impossible to tell who it had once been. Seeing this, Minnalis stamped on the goblin’s head, pressing it down into the fatal meal.</p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha-ha! Still hungry, are we? Ah-ha-ha! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!”</p>
<p>Minnalis’s wild laughter continued until the very last of the goblins’ shrieks had ended.</p>
<p class="space-break1">It had not taken long for every living thing in that cage to cease breathing. A pile of goblin corpses marked the success of the first step in Minnalis’s revenge. The heat that burned inside her was now my heat, too, and it exploded into rapturous delight within me. Watching them claw for that food, even knowing that it was going to kill them, was so much fun that I thought my sides were going to split. It sent shivers up my spine every time one of them screamed with the pain of transformation or retched as the poison killed them from within.</p>
<p>“Wonderful. Wonderful work, Minnalis. To make them feel hunger and then plant goblin-transformation and monster-killing poisons in their food. Heh, I knew I was right to pick you— Ah!”</p>
<p>I had accidentally said what I was thinking out loud. I was just so happy. She had thought long and hard about how best to make them suffer. She had shown to me beautiful proof that her words had been sincere all along. I was giddy with excitement at watching her take the first step down her path of revenge.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, I did it. I finally did it. The first part’s over, Mom.”</p>
<p>Minnalis opened the cage and approached the pile of bodies, her hands clasped in prayer. Her face was peaceful, and her gait solemn as she basked in the aftertaste of the forbidden fruit her patience had borne. She was a true avenger, and I simply watched her in silence, without interrupting her trance.</p>
<p class="space-break2">That day, a slave market in the slums closed down, and the slaves disappeared. The building went untouched until a few days later, when a robber broke in.</p>
<p>All the robber found there was an indescribable stench and a cage full of rotting goblin corpses.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“Well, I suppose we’d better be on our way.”</p>
<p>As much as I would have loved to stay there, appreciating the beauty of the moment forever, we had to be moving on, and I clapped Minnalis on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“…Yes. I must thank you, Master. It was your power that allowed me to exact such delicious revenge.”</p>
<p>“No need to thank me. My power is your power, and your desires are my desires. The moment you chose to seek vengeance, our paths became intertwined. This is no mere transactional relationship we share. We’re partners in crime, remember?”</p>
<p>Minnalis shook her head.</p>
<p>“It may have been my choice, but it was you who gave me that decision. I chose you, Master. That is why you are the one who is owed thanks for this vengeance I now bear. You gave me the opportunity to take my revenge, when I could only sit powerlessly as the heat smoldered inside me and I waited for death. The only thing I truly consider mine is this anger, and even that I now share with you. I offer everything else I am to you in its entirety. You can have my body, my soul, my life, to do with as you please.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need any of that. Calm down.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Master! <img alt="image" src="../Images/music.jpg"/> You’re such a tease…! <img alt="image" src="../Images/music.jpg"/>”</p>
<p>Minnalis wrapped her body around me. I pushed her away. The girl was a full head shorter than me, and despite her shabby appearance, there was a strange lust in her flushed cheeks and tear-stained eyes. She chuckled, and it sent a shiver down my spine. It felt like she was a predator eyeing up her next meal.</p>
<p>The MP drunkenness must still be affecting her. Depleting and restoring her MP so much was causing her conscious mind to recede, and her animal instincts were coming to the fore.</p>
<p><em>I just need to bear with it. She’ll calm down eventually, and when she does, her sexual urges should disappear, too.</em></p>
<p>If you just ignored drunks, they stopped being a problem. It was only because you gave them attention that they kept bothering you.</p>
<p>“Let’s get going; we’ve only just started down the path of revenge. There’s still much further to go. Save your thanks for when it’s done. Or are you telling me this was enough to sate the vengeance within you?”</p>
<p>“No, you’re right, Master. I must keep improving, so that the fruits we taste are sweeter than ever before! Hee-hee! Ah, my mind swims at the possibilities!”</p>
<p><em>…This…</em>is <em>going to wear off…right? I can’t have her acting like this the whole time…</em></p>
<p>I left the building. Some time had passed, and it was now afternoon. Clocks were something of a luxury in this world, and so the only ways to tell the time were to go by the position of the sun or the chiming of the church bell.</p>
<p>I glanced at Minnalis, who was walking alongside me, and decided it would be best to head into the city and buy her some decent clothes.</p>
<p>“Ah, could you hide your ears and tail? If not, we’ll buy something here in the slums to cover them up before heading into town.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Master. I still have a lot of MP left, so I’ll just use my illusion magic.”</p>
<p>Minnalis wove her mana skillfully, and her rabbit features disappeared in a puff of smoke. Even with her “Illusion Magic” skill at level 3, perfectly executing a spell like that while skipping the verbal components was no mean feat.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Eek! M-Master?”</p>
<p>Examining the spot where her ears had been, I found that my hand encountered the softest and fluffiest sensation.</p>
<p>“Mmm… Ah… Master… Not there…”</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry, I was just curious.”</p>
<p>Minnalis’s sensual voice brought me back to my senses, and I withdrew my hand. The first time around, I’d only been interested in slaying the demon lord and getting back to my own world as soon as possible, so I ended up ignoring many of this world’s mythical features. While I was never sitting idle, I still felt like I had wasted my time somehow.</p>
<p>“I suppose we should talk about what we want to do next. Personally, I was planning on leaving town sometime today.”</p>
<p>“<em>Phew…</em>” Minnalis paused to catch her breath. “Today?” she asked, looking dubiously up at the sky.</p>
<p>I understood what she was getting at. The sun would only be up for another hour or so, and the four gates in each direction, which permitted entry to the city, were closed at night, making it practically impossible to leave. Even if we made it in time, the closest neighboring towns were half a day’s travel away. That was why when people had to go somewhere, they usually set off in the morning.</p>
<p>“You saw for yourself how many enemies I have. The king, queen, princess, and all the royal knights. Well, I gave the princess and the knights a little preview yesterday. I’d guess around this time tomorrow, they’ll be able to talk again, and I’d like to be out of the city before then. I’m not strong enough to stand against them yet, so we don’t have much time. Come to think of it, what’s the last memory of mine that you can vicariously see?”</p>
<p>The Holy Sword of Retribution didn’t reveal everything. I doubted that it showed her my memories from the start of my second chance, since those were all after I swore revenge. But that would mean…</p>
<p>“Hmm? Now that you mention it, it didn’t make much sense. Are you a ghost, Master? What was all that about you being a hero and the world turning against you…?”</p>
<p>“Thought so. You saw up to my death. I also only saw the crucial moments of your life. I’ll explain everything later, so just bear with me for now.”</p>
<p>Minnalis nodded, though she still looked confused. “Okay, Master. In that case, let’s get the bare minimum food and clothing and leave this place as soon as we can.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, no, we don’t need to go that fast. I plan to <em>leave at night</em>. Hold on, aren’t you a little put off by the fact that the whole royal family is my enemy?”</p>
<p>We were talking about antagonizing the royalty in a land where the crown wielded absolute power. It was the same as the country itself being after you.</p>
<p>“Well, sure, I was a little surprised, but the important thing is that they’re your enemies. We’ve agreed to take revenge on them no matter the cost, right? The fact that they’re royalty doesn’t change any of that.” She smiled, almost as though the thought of it excited her.</p>
<p>“…Heh, you win,” I said, raising my hands in surrender. “It was a dumb question, I suppose. I really am glad to have you as my partner in crime.”</p>
<p>I had been underestimating her. Even if she stayed in that weird mood forever, she’d still be the best partner I could ever ask for.</p>
<p>“Oh! Well, yes. I suppose I’m also quite happy I joined forces with you, Master.”</p>
<p>For a moment, she almost looked embarrassed, but she quickly recovered and gave a slight smile. It seemed she was still a little tipsy.</p>
<p>“First, we’d better do something about your clothes. We’ll need traveling clothes that hide your ears and tail, and a weapon for you to defend yourself. Also, food.”</p>
<p>“Hold on, Master. How are you planning to leave the city at night? The gates will close soon.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, don’t worry, we won’t be using the gates. <em>We’ll be leaving through a hole in the walls.</em>”</p>
<p>“Th-there’s a hole in the walls?” Minnalis asked, bewildered.</p>
<p>The walls were the city’s last defense against a monster attack. Any damage to them would constitute a grave threat to national security. That was why the wall had Self-Repair and Degradation Down enchantments. It was hard to imagine what kind of force would be necessary to blow a hole in it that was large enough for a person to go through. Under normal conditions, that is.</p>
<p>“There will be. Right now, the slightest damage will break it wide open. I know this for a fact,” I revealed, giving her a smile.</p>
