<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>re you really okay with giving me such nice clothes?”</p>
<p>Minnalis had changed out of her slave attire, which was little more than tattered rags with holes torn in them for her arms and head, and into a set of clothing I had picked up at a secondhand store. The sky above was growing dim and bathed the streets of the city in a twilight glow. Despite her reaction, the clothes weren’t that special—just a little above average of what the townsfolk might normally wear. If she was comparing them with what she had as a slave, then yes, they must have appeared quite nice indeed, but they were nothing to get excited about. While I was at it, I had also purchased an outfit for myself that allowed me to blend in more.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. You’re a beautiful woman, Minnalis. I’d rather you didn’t look like a slave, or else the pigs and the monkeys wouldn’t leave us alone,” I said as I remembered a rather unpleasant memory with the nobility and the delinquents.</p>
<p>Slaves were treated as property, and if you walked down the street flaunting your expensive property, you’d run into two types of people. The pigs, who wanted to purchase it for themselves to show off their money and status, and the monkeys, who simply cornered you in a dark alley and shook you down for all you were worth.</p>
<p>I had to deal with that kind of greed the first time around, too. There was one particular noble who stuck out. He wasn’t very good at concealing his desires, but he knew how to cover his ass so he would never get in trouble.</p>
<p>That said, delinquents were rare outside the slums, and the example I’d made was also very effective at keeping them at bay. The nobles, however, could still be a problem. I wanted us to stand out as little as possible right now. Getting into a commotion with an aristocrat was the last thing we needed.</p>
<p>The potions had removed all traces of the bruises across her body, and the dark circles around her eyes had disappeared, too. She was still looking a tad underfed, but anyone could tell she was gorgeous. If nobody suspected she was really a beastfolk, then as long as she looked like a slave, nobles would come out of the woodwork like termites, looking to buy her off me.</p>
<p>“…Beautiful? You…you think I’m beautiful? … Hee-hee-hee!”</p>
<p>Minnalis stopped and shook, her face flushed. I turned and called to her.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Does it still hurt? I guess the potions wouldn’t have healed everything, huh?”</p>
<p>Restoring HP with potions recovered your physical energy, while replenishing your MP restored your mental strength. Both potions also restored Stamina, but it wasn’t magic or poison that had caused Minnalis’s Weak status; it was continuous exposure to a harsh environment. Even a status-healing potion wouldn’t work on it. The only way to recover was with proper rest and good, nutritious food. For a beastfolk like her, that shouldn’t take much longer than three days or so.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but we need to keep going to the item shop. We might not be able to cure your Weakness, but we might find something to make it a bit more bearable, and once we get out of the city, we can take things easy.”</p>
<p>Potions came with a wide variety of effects. There were HP and MP recovery potions, of course, but there were also potions that gave temporary stat boosts, penalties, negated status conditions for a limited time, or even heightened your senses, allowing better use of skills.</p>
<p>Potions that dealt with status conditions came in two types: “recovery” potions, which dealt with the root cause, and “relief” potions, which only tackled the surface-level symptoms or merely weakened the condition’s effect. One of those relief potions could be very useful for Minnalis right now. It wouldn’t be a permanent solution, but it would make things a lot easier for her. Or so I thought, but Minnalis simply shook her head as if to say she was okay.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s fine; there’s no need to go that far. My body just feels a little heavy, that’s all. Besides, it seems that those goblins were counted as <em>defeated</em>, so I went up another level. I should be all right in another day or so.”</p>
<p>Minnalis offered me a gentle smile, but her face still looked a little red to me. There was something wrong with her for sure, but she didn’t seem willing to take a potion. If things got worse, I might have to force-feed her again, I thought, and I tried to walk slowly so she didn’t fall behind.</p>
<p>I kept an eye on Minnalis as we walked, and sure enough, her condition didn’t seem to be that big a deal. Whenever she looked at me, she flashed such a perfect smile that I couldn’t imagine there was anything troubling her at all. Her face was no longer red, but she still appeared unusually reserved.</p>
<p>As we entered the item shop, I considered stocking up on relief potions anyway, just in case we needed them. It wasn’t like we’d be out of the woods immediately after leaving the city. I bought some simple HP and MP potions, several status-recovery and status-relief potions, as well as a few days’ worth of food and a good amount of seasoning.</p>
<p>“Here you go. I got you a Weakness relief potion. Drink up.”</p>
<p>“N-no, I told you, I’m fine. I couldn’t possibly take something so expensive.”</p>
<p>“…Just shut up and drink it. I don’t want to have to hold on to it.”</p>
<p>Minnalis was reluctant, as I had predicted, so I gave her an order as her master. I wasn’t about to use the Slave Brand on the exhausted girl, nor for that matter would I do it even if she were healthy. I would never resort to force to get her to do what I wanted. Having said that, her reluctance was going to cause us problems down the line, so I put my foot down, gave her a serious look, and lowered my voice to tell her it was important. It might have looked a little intimidating, but Minnalis was my partner in crime. We shared the same vengeance now, and she knew I wished her no harm. Hopefully, I wouldn’t scare her. I was just trying to get across the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>“I…I’m sorry, Master. I’ll drink it.”</p>
<p>I didn’t mean for it to be such a big deal, but at last, Minnalis politely took the potion and downed it. I checked her status and saw that her condition had changed to <em>Weak (Poor)</em>, and her stats were reduced by a third instead of a half. Her face was looking red again, but I figured it would be okay once we got on the road.</p>
<p>The next stop on our list was the weapons and armor shop. I could fight with my soul blades, but Minnalis was going to need a weapon, and the two of us needed armor. Because her mana dropped off with distance, it made sense to gear her up as a close-range fighter, but she shouldn’t have to fight barehanded. It wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world with her stats, but her Intoxicating Phantasm ability was based on poison, as the name implied. It would be more effective if she could inflict slashing damage with a knife or sword, rather than the blunt damage of unarmed strikes.</p>
<p>“Minnalis, do you know much about weapons?” I asked.</p>
<p>Judging by her skills, she had no firsthand experience, but even if she was just a little familiar with a particular type, it would make things easier. I suppose she could also use her bare hands, or rather, her claws. There were many kinds of fighting styles, so to begin with, I wanted to pick a weapon that was easy for her to use.</p>
<p>“No… Sometimes, the adventurers who guarded the merchant caravans that came to our village would teach me how to swing a sword, but that’s about it… I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? You don’t need to apologize. There’s time for you to learn, and it’s not your skill in combat that I chose you for. I bought you because you had what it took to be my partner in crime.”</p>
<p>At that point, we arrived in front of the weapons and armor shop. It was a warm and unconventional (read: shabby) storefront near the border to the slums, with a carved wooden sign hanging outside that read L<span class="small-caps">IECIAL</span> W<span class="small-caps">EAPONS AND</span> A<span class="small-caps">RMOR</span>.</p>
<p>“Hey, welcome!” A young boy, the apprentice, greeted us as we walked in. “I’m sorry, but we’re about to close for the day. I’d hate to rush you, so maybe you could come back tomorrow…?”</p>
<p>It was certainly getting late enough to be called dusk. Taverns were lighting their lamps and serving up ale for the evening.</p>
<p>“It’s okay; I already know what I’m going to buy. It doesn’t have to be anything special, so it shouldn’t take long, and it’s kind of urgent that I get it done today.”</p>
<p>“I suppose that should be all right… Boss! There’s a customer here!”</p>
<p>While Minnalis was gazing, starry-eyed, at all the new and exciting merchandise, a loud voice came back from the rear of the shop, where the boss appeared to be working on something.</p>
<p>“Huh? Tell ’em to get lost! When are we meant to eat if we’ve got people oohing and ahhing over weapons an’ armor all night?!”</p>
<p>“He says he already knows what he wants!”</p>
<p>“Then sell ’im it, you numpty, and get ’im outta here!”</p>
<p>The apprentice turned back to me. “Okay, what would you like?”</p>
<p>“Two sets of novice adventurer gear, four sets of repair tools, and ten mass-produced longswords with scabbards. Whichever ones you choose are fine.”</p>
<p>“That’s a lot! Excuse me, sir, but can you pay for all that?”</p>
<p>The boy eyed me suspiciously. Not surprising, since what I had just asked for totaled about a month’s wages (roughly twenty large-silver pieces), and I looked no richer than a normal citizen. I felt Minnalis beside me getting annoyed, so I hurried to smooth things over.</p>
<p>“Yes, I can. Here,” I said, producing a single gold piece from my pouch. The boy’s eyes went wide, and he apologized.</p>
<p>“Is that…a gold coin? Sorry, er, I mean, pardon me, sir! I’ve been so rude!”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t worry. I’m not acting on behalf of a noble or anything. It’s just that I’ve come into a bit of money recently, you see.”</p>
<p>The fact that I wasn’t a noble myself was probably clear from the way I was dressed, but that gold coin had still given him the wrong idea. It wasn’t strange for one acting on behalf of a powerful individual to abuse that power, and nobody wanted to be on the receiving end of a nobleman’s wrath, so it was best to avoid offending such people wherever possible.</p>
<p>“Re-really?”</p>
<p>“It’s true. Cross my heart.”</p>
<p>My playful response seemed to calm his nerves somewhat, and he gave a short sigh as though deflating.</p>
<p>“I’m really sorry for doubting you, sir. I’ll go get them now. Two novice adventurer’s armor sets, four repair kits, and ten mass-produced longswords, was it?”</p>
<p>“That’s it, thanks.”</p>
<p>The young man ran about the store, gathering up the items I had requested and placing them atop the counter.</p>
<p>“Here you are, two novice adventurer’s armor sets, four repair kits, and ten mass-produced longswords. That’s five silvers times two, which is one large silver, plus two large coppers times four, seven…no, eight, plus one silver and five large coppers times ten, which is…er…one large silver and five silvers. So in total, that makes…um… Ow!”</p>
<p>A beefy fist came down on the young man’s head as he desperately tried to count on his fingers.</p>
<p>“How long are you gonna stand there dawdling? You should be able to do sums in yer ’ead!”</p>
<p>A rather impressively built older craftsman lumbered out of the back of the shop.</p>
<p>“That’s nothing to hit me for!” the apprentice squealed. “It’s not gonna make me go any faster!”</p>
<p>“Don’t you talk back to me, you little runt!”</p>
<p>“Ow, ow, ow, ow!”</p>
<p>The man’s face was stern, and his beard thick. It was a testament to his dwarf blood. One-quarter, if I remembered correctly.</p>
<p>“Master? Is something the matter?” asked Minnalis. It seemed she had noticed the bittersweet expression on my face.</p>
<p>That was because these two were killed the first time around, and it was all my fault. I had told the princess about their heritage, oblivious to her complete disdain for foreigners, and she put both father and son to death. Apart from their beards and small stature, dwarves were very similar to humans in every way. For a man who was only one-quarter dwarf, and especially his son, who was only one-eighth, it was hard to distinguish them from humans. I had been led to believe they went back to their hometown, and I only learned the truth when the princess herself admitted it to me.</p>
<p>I’d listened in despair as she thanked me for helping rid her country of vermin.</p>
<p>I knew it had been foolish of me to come here, but I had to see them again, even if just for sentimental reasons. Maybe if they had survived, they would have simply turned against me like everyone else. I didn’t know. They’d never lived that long. But at the very least, while I knew them, they’d never once betrayed me. And so while I hated the people of this country with a burning passion, all I felt when I looked at these two was guilt.</p>
<p>I never meant to let my emotions show through so plainly. Was Minnalis always so perceptive, or was it because of the new bond we shared? I didn’t know the answer to that.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing.” I shook my head. I didn’t have the time to explain it to her now.</p>
<p>“The stuff on the table,” started the shopkeeper, “comes to two large silvers, five silvers, and eight large coppers. You can adjust the size of the leather armor by fiddlin’ with the straps, but if it still don’t fit, we can fix it for you for one silver apiece. As for the swords, I don’t know what you want ten of ’em for, but if they get scuffed up so bad that you can’t mend ’em with those repair kits, we can reforge ’em for you for about a silver each, too. That depends on how damaged they are, of course. Anything else you want to know?”</p>
<p>“Is it all right if we change into our armor here? We’ve got a lot to carry.”</p>
<p>I placed a gold coin onto the counter and received my change in large and regular silvers.</p>
<p>“Go ahead. You need me to show you how to put it on?”</p>
<p>“I know how to do it, and I’ll help her myself. It’s not too hard.”</p>
<p>The armor set comprised a leather breastplate and waist guard, along with leggings and gauntlets, which were both made of leather and iron. I quickly put my own set on, then gave Minnalis a hand with hers. The reason I refused the shopkeeper’s help was because although Minnalis’s ears and tail were invisible, they were technically still there, and the shopkeeper might stumble upon her true identity if we weren’t careful. I wanted to believe that these two wouldn’t sell us out, but I knew how people who were close to me could switch sides when their circumstances changed. I knew it all too well.</p>
<p>“Mph… Kaito…you’re hurting my chest…”</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry. I pulled too tightly.”</p>
<p>I was lost in thought and had used more force than necessary. The tightness was squeezing her sizable breasts, causing them to spill over. As I hurried to loosen the straps, the shopkeeper clapped me on the shoulder and gave me a thumbs-up.</p>
<p>“Nice work, lad!”</p>
<p>“Shut up, old man! Have some self-respect in front of your son!”</p>
<p>“Huh?” asked the son. “What’s that about me? Is something happening I should know about?”</p>
<p>The shopkeeper was as shameless as ever. It was partly why we got on so well last time, but it was also a pity, as it was the only blemish upon his otherwise outstanding character. I loosened Minnalis’s armor and attached two of the swords to her belt, while I bundled the others together using the cord on their scabbards and carried them myself.</p>
<p>“Sorry for stopping by when you were about to close. Oh, I know, I’ll tell you something I heard to make up for it. Apparently, antidotes are about to jump in price. I’d stock up on them while you can.”</p>
<p>“Huh. That right? I’ll keep that in mind,” replied the shopkeeper.</p>
<p>“Heh, yes, that should do it… And I’m sorry for last time.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. Just some closure. Well, see you.”</p>
<p>I left the shopkeeper, who was looking somewhat puzzled, and exited the shop with Minnalis. Outside, the sun had pretty much set.</p>
<p>“Let me carry that,” she offered, pointing at my purchases. “I’m your slave, after all.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want anyone to know that, remember.”</p>
<p>“Well, even if I weren’t your slave, I still think I should help out…”</p>
<p>“It’ll look weird if a girl is lugging all my heavy things and I’m empty-handed. Besides, you’re already carrying our food. This is fine as it is.”</p>
<p>Minnalis still looked concerned, but I ignored her. It was certainly convenient that she made efforts to be proactive and respect our master-slave relationship, but I didn’t want her to be stuck always thinking she was below me. Minnalis wasn’t just my slave; she was my partner in crime. After seeing how well she performed, it would be a waste of her talents if she just did whatever I told her when it came time to plan our revenge. I would have to keep a close eye on how she viewed our relationship from here on out.</p>
<p>“Anyway, that should be all we need. Let’s be aware of our surroundings and get out of here.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">The sun had disappeared completely, and the moon shone in the night sky. In the poorer farmlands, where people lived by the hours of daylight, it would be pitch-black outside by now, and the only sounds would be the rustling of the wind and the chirping of insects. Here in the city, however, light and the sounds of revelry spilled out onto the streets from the taverns. Adventurers back from hunting and merchants loaded with the day’s profits shared stories and cracked jokes over pints of warm ale. In another two hours, even those last vestiges of activity would die out, and the night would be silent, but for now, it was the perfect time to go unnoticed.</p>
<p>We were headed to the walls a little east of the north gate, near the bounds of the slums. The hoods of the robes we had picked up at the clothes shop hid our faces as we moved through the night, and we only dropped them once we arrived at our deserted destination.</p>
<p>“We’re here. This is the place,” I announced.</p>
<p>I placed my hand gently on the wall and felt its cold stone, robbed of heat by the cool night air. It was as white as marble, but there was something rough like sand mixed in, and the moonlight glinted off its uneven surface. This was a material known as starlite, which had the unique ability to absorb mana from the air. Thanks to the spells cast on it, the wall could use this energy to repair itself.</p>
<p>“Master? I don’t see any hole…,” murmured Minnalis, examining the wall. Indeed, she could look all she wanted, and she wouldn’t find so much as a single scratch mark.</p>
<p>“Well, of course. If it were that obvious, it would have already been patched over. I never said there was a hole already. We need to make one.”</p>
<p>“Make one? You mean, break the wall? Apologies, Master, but I don’t think—”</p>
<p>To anyone with half a brain, it was common sense that the walls of the capital were indestructible. Children were told in fairy tales that these walls held fast under the charge of an Earth Dragon, a terrifying class-A monster that couldn’t fly but had immense strength. Even if that was just a fable, there were surviving records of the walls withstanding attacks from other equally impressive and rare monsters. For a single entity to breach the walls was an absurd notion, unheard of in even the drunkest adventurer’s tallest tales.</p>
<p>For the people living within them, the fall of the city walls would spell the end of the world. It was only because they knew the walls would stand firm against any attack that they could sleep soundly at night despite the monsters roaming the forests, plains, mountains, and tundras outside.</p>
<p>Anything with the power to penetrate the walls unaided would be a mythical being, right out of the pages of a children’s book.</p>
<p>…Would the people make me a hero, or a monster? Last time, it was the latter.</p>
<p>“A wall is nothing more than a pile of hard stones, Minnalis. How do you suppose it can withstand attacks from the strongest monsters in the world?”</p>
<p>“Well, because it has all sorts of magical enchantments, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Correct. All city walls have Self-Repair, Degradation Down, and Hardness Up enchantments. In addition, the walls of the capital have the properties Absorb Shock and Magic Dampen. Those magics have a lot of power invested in them to keep them at a very high level, and that power comes from the starlite, which absorbs mana from the air, that was mixed into these stones.”</p>
<p>Of course, all this was top secret information that only the privileged class had access to. As far as the citizenry was aware, it was just “a super-amazing wall that could repel any attack.” That was the only thing they needed to know.</p>
<p>“Meaning if it can’t get that mana, the wall’s strength will drop. It’ll just be a normal stone wall. That wouldn’t be so hard to break through, would it? And one more thing…”</p>
<p>I grinned and pointed toward the wall with the Soul Blade of Beginnings, a sword with no special abilities save the power to strengthen the blade by channeling mana into it.</p>
<p>“These little creatures eat <em>more than just mana</em>.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>I knew the wall was weak, but it crumbled even more easily than I’d expected. Using the tip of my blade, I tore away a stone, which fell to the ground along with several small translucent maggots of different colors: red, brown, and green. They wriggled on the ground, squeaking, their bodies coated in a transparent mucus that glinted in the moonlight.</p>
<p>And there, in the cavity…</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>Squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm, squirm.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">…the stones were overflowing with maggots, hundreds of them.</p>
<p>Compared with the cool, rough, hard exterior, the inside of the wall was warm and wet with mucus, like looking into a monster’s guts. Even the white color had faded to a dull brown.</p>
<p>“Are they eating it?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. They’re a type of class-D monster known as Magiphages, or Magic Eaters. These are actually a subspecies. They use their special mucus to melt down minerals and consume the mana within. They’ll keep feeding and multiplying until the entire wall is nothing but a pile of sand. I know them as Wall Eaters, but to be precise, this subspecies has yet to be discovered, and they <em>haven’t even been officially named yet</em>.”</p>
<p>The inside of the walls looked completely ruined. The maggots had eaten so many holes into the stonework, it resembled a sponge. They had taken their time, softening it little by little, imperceptibly, until it was so brittle that the slightest touch caused parts of it to disintegrate into dust.</p>
<p>“It’s now far weaker than any stone wall. Getting through the hard shell is the most difficult part. After that, it just opens up.”</p>
<p>As I poked the tip of my soul blade deeper into the wall, bits of stonework crumbled away along with the squealing Wall Eaters. The deeper I went, the more tightly packed the Wall Eaters became, until it looked more like a wall of flesh than of stone.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Minnalis just stared, dumbfounded. Even I was having trouble stomaching the idea of putting my hand any nearer to the writhing mass of maggots—thousands upon thousands of see-through little blobs dyed with red, brown, and green streaks like marbles. I wouldn’t be surprised if a girl like Minnalis was ready to faint from disgust—</p>
<p>“Master, what if we put one of our enemies in a hole and covered them in these maggots?” she asked with a serious look. It appeared I had underestimated her once again. She kept surpassing my expectations. I wanted to laugh.</p>
<p>“Hmm, not a bad idea, but just covering them is a bit low-level. What if we made them breed, multiply within their body, and devour them from the inside?”</p>
<p>“Impressive, Master. It certainly would be more effective if they felt the pain of being eaten from within.”</p>
<p>“Why not both? We could have them eat away from the outside, too. Hmm, no, that’s not very interesting. Perhaps if we could cause the skin to rot in some way…”</p>
<p>“Instead of filling their organs with maggots, we could bury the maggots in their skin. Imagine having to pull maggots out of your own skin, but they just keep coming! It could be fun to keep them sane the whole time instead of using my magic to drive them mad like we did today.”</p>
<p>“What if we had the dead ones come back to life as zombies and transfer their maggots to the survivors through their mouths? Although, that would mean some of them would have to die early. Maybe that plan needs a little work…”</p>
<p>We seemed to have gotten sidetracked into some sort of impromptu brainstorming session. Two heads really were better than one, and getting another person’s perspective was good stimulation for the brain.</p>
<p>As we chatted happily about our macabre subject, the tip of my soul blade opened up a hole in the wall that was large enough for a horse to pass through. The ground was littered with sliced and trampled Wall Eaters, which were lying in a puddle of slime and the crumbling remnants of the stone wall.</p>
<p>“Master, was it you who put these maggots here?”</p>
<p>“I wish I could say that it was, but no. I’d never even seen them until now. Anyway, look, we can get through.”</p>
<p>The tunnel in the wall reminded me of a hole in a sandpit. When we passed through it, we found ourselves in a thick forest. The moonlight filtering through the trees lent an air of mystery to the eerie environment.</p>
<p>“Yep, there’s no saving it now,” I muttered to myself. I gave a sigh of relief now that we were finally out of the city. Over the last year, I had come to feel that it was safer outside the walls than within them. I wondered if this was how criminals felt.</p>
<p>“Oh, almost forgot,” I said, heading back inside the walls. I scavenged up whatever I could find and dropped it in front of the fresh opening.</p>
<p>“Master, let me help,” declared Minnalis. “You’re trying to conceal the hole, right?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Ah, thanks. Try not to wake anyone up, though.”</p>
<p>The wall wasn’t supposed to collapse for another few days. If they found out now, they might still be able to <em>contain</em> the damage. Besides, I already knew how things went down the first time. Why not try to <em>spice it up</em> the second time around?</p>
<p>“It’s a bit silly of me to ask after lugging all this trash around, but do you think you could cast an illusion on the hole to hide it?”</p>
<p>“…Sorry, Master, but I’m a beastfolk. I can keep refreshing the illusions cast on myself as much as I like, but even if I leave one here, I don’t think it would last much longer than a day at most. I suppose if I kept coming back to recast it…”</p>
<p>“Forget it. We don’t have time to stick around. This cover should be more than enough to fool the people around here anyway.”</p>
<p>I sneered at the townspeople, who by now were in their beds. This place was on the brink of becoming part of the slums. Nobody would notice if a single pile of trash was out of place the next morning. People were too busy with their lives. All they cared about here was staying above the poverty line, and they’d sell their closest confidant if they thought it would help.</p>
<p>The longer they remained ignorant, the worse the infestation in the walls would grow.</p>
<p>“Well, seeing how many we killed getting through the hole, <em>the least we could do</em> to make up for it is give them a little extra time to eat the walls, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“You’re right, Master. Why, these maggots are practically saints compared with the scum who live here. Ohhh, I just want to strangle the lot of them to death right now!”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I don’t think we have time for that. Just find solace in the fact that thanks to <em>this</em>, a few of them will end up dying horrible deaths.”</p>
<p>At length, we finished our makeshift cover. Nobody would ever spot any trace of the hole in the wall unless they specifically came over and moved the trash out of the way.</p>
<p>“Oh, here’s an idea. Let’s take some of these guys with us.”</p>
<p>I scooped up several of the Wall Eaters that were still alive into a glass bottle. Then I piled up some twigs and leaves to cover up the hole in the wall from the outside, too.</p>
<p>“Right. Let’s start by heading a little deeper into the woods. There’s an abandoned hunters’ lodge up ahead.”</p>
<p>“Okay, Master.”</p>
<p>I was quite familiar with the topography of the surrounding woodlands from my first time here. I knew exactly which way to go.</p>
<p>“Once we’re there, we can plan our next move. First, we need to get rid of your Weak status. It’s a shame for a girl as beautiful as you to be walking around with her stats halved.”</p>
<p>It was handy having a pretty girl around. In battle or negotiations, that sort of thing mattered more often than you might think. There had even been a time where I was forced to disguise myself as a woman using my soul blades, though I wished I could banish those memories from my brain.</p>
<p>Anyway, forget about that. This time, I had Minnalis, who as anyone could see was gorgeous, and she’d be even better-looking once she had a decent meal and some good rest.</p>
<p>“F-flattery will get you nowhere, Master. You don’t need to butter me up to get anything out of me. I am your slave, after all.”</p>
<p>“I’m not trying to get anything out of you. Don’t treat me like a playboy.”</p>
<p>“A playboy? What’s a playboy?”</p>
<p>Minnalis appeared a little red-faced as she puzzled over my words. I thought she might still be feeling a little of the MP drunkenness, but maybe this was just how she reacted to compliments. Putting that aside, I pondered how best to answer her question.</p>
<p>“Aaah, like a player… How can I explain it? It’s like, oh, I don’t know…”</p>
<p>The two of us walked deeper into the forest together as the moon shone high above us.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“Haaah!”</p>
<p>“Gaaaaaagh!”</p>
<p>I felt flesh and bone part under my blade, and the boar-like monster gave a cry of pain as it died. I say <em>boar-like</em>, but its green fur and the single black horn atop its head made it pretty difficult to mistake it for the real thing.</p>
<p>It was a beast-type monster known as a Green Boar—a regular foe for beginner adventurers, roughly on the same level as a goblin, though rarer. (It would be fairer to say that goblins were freakishly common.) While the boar’s attacks were slightly stronger than those of a goblin, it could only charge in a straight line, which made them easy pickings.</p>
<p>The most important distinction, however, was that you could eat them. It was about the worst-quality meat you could get, but it filled the stomach, and it was incredibly common for poorer adventurers who were just starting out to keep dried pork on them as emergency rations.</p>
<p>“Gragh! Gah!”</p>
<p>I sliced past the Green Boar, taking out its right foreleg before delivering the finishing blow by cleanly lopping off its head with the Soul Blade of Beginnings. I was tempted to hang it up on a tree from its hind legs to drain out every bit of blood, but we had all the meat we needed, and so I left its body on the forest floor. It would only take a few hours for a pack of garm, a type of canine monster, to show up, attracted by the smell. Their intelligence was low, and they would likely feast on the Green Boar without bothering to check their surroundings. The plan was to ambush them from behind while they were distracted and reap a load of experience points in the process.</p>
<p>“<em>Phew</em>, finally above three thousand…”</p>
<p>I was retracing my steps to where Minnalis was waiting, checking my experience using my status screen. It had been two days since we escaped from the city together, and I had spent that time hunting goblins, Green Boars, and garm to raise my level and improve my combat ability.</p>
<p>The knights I’d encountered in the summoning chamber were weak, with most of them never having seen actual combat in their lives. They were mostly for ceremony, to lend an air of respectability to the castle. I could hold my own against a group twice their size, but the combat squad led by the royal-knight commander was a different story.</p>
<p>The ceremonial knights held their posts only because they were the sons of nobility, and they worked to increase their levels in relative safety, surrounded by their squires. Their main purpose was to instill a sense of respect and admiration in the people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the combat squad existed only for battle. When war broke out or monsters attacked, and invaders slipped through the gates, the royal combat squad put their lives on the line to defend the kingdom. Some of them were so grizzled and scarred that the kingdom was hesitant to put them on display. Their skills, however, were real.</p>
<p>If I got surrounded by more than about a dozen of them, I’d have no choice but to run. Otherwise, they’d hang my body from the castle walls for all to see.</p>
<p>I could spend my experience points either on raising my level or unlocking my soul blades. The priority was getting my power back as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>“Seriously, Goddess. This negative twenty thousand is a hefty penalty…” I let out a long sigh.</p>
<p>I had killed a grand total of fifty-four goblins, Green Boars, and garm over the past two days and gained about two thousand experience points. Even added to the points I still hadn’t spent yet, everything came up to only three thousand. Twenty thousand was still a long way off. What’s more, I had been pretty lucky at spotting groups of monsters so far, and I didn’t expect this pace to continue.</p>
<p>“‘New Game Plus,’ my ass… This is even harder than last time.”</p>
<p>The monsters near the capital were weak, with an average level of around 20. That was about the same as an adult male who lived and worked in the city and never set foot beyond its walls. However, having the same level didn’t mean they were of the same combat potential. Monsters had higher stats, and their instincts were geared for battle. In a head-to-head showdown between a human and a goblin of the same level, the goblin would win every time.</p>
<p>For experience, it was stats that made the difference, not level. You wouldn’t get much experience from an enemy with weaker stats than you, no matter how high their level was compared with yours. I might be level 1, but I was being buffed by my soul blades, and, although I couldn’t check right now, my <em>titles</em>. All in all, they were giving me about fifty levels’ worth of stat boosts. Monsters might be stronger than humans on average, but these ones were way weaker than me.</p>
<p>“We can save leveling up for later. Let’s start by unlocking the Eight-Eyed Sword of Clarity.”</p>
<p>I brought up my status screen, went to my soul-blade display, and tapped its name.</p>
