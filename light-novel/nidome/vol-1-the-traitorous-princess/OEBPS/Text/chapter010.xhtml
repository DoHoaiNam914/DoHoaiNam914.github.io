<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span> pushed the stone aside and exited into the bright outdoors.</p>
<p>“I’M FREEEEEE!”</p>
<p>After the long walk underground, I spread my arms and bathed in the sun’s radiant rays. I was in a deserted copse just outside the city. I took several deep breaths, savoring the smell of the sunlit trees and the warm earth. It made a welcome change from the damp subterranean cobblestones of the passage I had just walked.</p>
<p>It had been three months since I last saw the sun, including the time I spent in the Dragon Temple before I died. A tear came to my eye as I beheld its majesty.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, glorious sunlight…”</p>
<p>For a while, I basked in its magnificence beneath the clear blue sky. Then I collected my thoughts. My goal was simple. I would seek out those traitors who double-crossed me and exact my revenge, making each and every one of them suffer for their crimes.</p>
<p>The problem was that I wasn’t strong enough to do so yet. I needed more time. Everything had to be in place. At level 1, my stamina was nowhere near enough to take on a castle full of knights, at least not without improving my skills first.</p>
<p>For now, the only people who knew what I looked like were the princess and her knights. Unlike last time, when I was a renowned hero by the time I was on the run, there probably wouldn’t be any issue if I simply hid out in the next town over. If not, I could always wear a long robe that covered my face. At least that way, I could enter taverns and shops and maybe even walk down the street without being recognized.</p>
<p>I looked up at the sun once more, which was just slightly dipping in the sky. It triggered a memory of the first time I was summoned; I estimated it to be an hour or so past noon.</p>
<p>“The castle’s wizards are skilled, but I bet it’ll take at least the rest of the day before the princess can speak or write,” I said to myself. “I should have plenty of time, so long as I don’t get sidetracked.”</p>
<p>I strolled into the city and was greeted with the familiar view of the main street. The citizens here blithely listened to the words of the crown and the Church and believed me to be the enemy. Or at least they did last time around anyway. I couldn’t help thinking about how nice it would be if they tripped and cracked their skulls open on the stones, but unlike with the princess, I wasn’t driven to immediate violence. Perhaps it was because they weren’t responsible for the plot against me—they were just ordinary people who believed what they were told. I had to get my priorities right; there were bigger fish to fry.</p>
<p>After that consideration of my own feelings, I thought about how best to raise some money. I did have one idea. I felt around in the pocket of my old school uniform for the heavy necklace that I pinched off the princess. Even if you discounted the fact that it was a royal treasure, the item itself would fetch a decent price, since it held mithril, colorful magic stones, and an enchantment that imparted a tiny Dexterity boost. If I sold it, I would have enough money to last me a good long while. However, I would need to be cautious. I certainly didn’t look the part of a noble, and finding a buyer in the first place would be difficult.</p>
<p>None of the shops around here would do, so I headed elsewhere—to the slums, a quarter of the city that was home to all sorts of misfits and outcasts. As I walked in that direction, the streets gradually became dirtier and more run-down, until I arrived in such a forsaken place that, if I didn’t know any better, I would have doubted was still the same town.</p>
<p>Cracks and holes were visible in the walls of the crumbling buildings. The place stank of filth and human waste. The people squatting in the shadows had dark and sullen eyes, and I could feel their glares on me like hyenas awaiting their next meal. Half of them eyed me with fear, the others with curious hunger. The ones who dismissed me out of hand were new. Here, you learned in no time at all that you didn’t take people at face value.</p>
<p>“Hey, you there, in the funny clothes. What’re you doin’ all alone in a place like this?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Well, now. Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but ain’t no passage through these parts for free. You want through, you gotta pay the toll. You know the drill.”</p>
<p>About half a dozen men closed in on me, grinning.</p>
<p>“God, these clichés… Well, at least I know where things are going.”</p>
<p>Why did this always happen when I went to the slums? Sure, my clothes made me stick out like a sore thumb, but it was like they were all reading from the exact same script. I knew from my days on the run how useful the slums were, but if I had to go through this farce every time, I’d lose my damn mind. But what could I do? To them, this really was my first visit here. I just wished they’d shake things up a bit, because this part of the plot got real old, real fast.</p>
<p>The slum residents had already fled the area, not wanting to get dragged into a fight. Smart move. That’s how you survive here. Stick around, and you’d better have sharp wits and an equally sharp blade.</p>
<p>“Might as well ask,” I muttered before calling out, “Are you my enemies?”</p>
<p>“Huh? The hell are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Just answer the question. I’ve got no grievance with you. I’ll let you get out of this alive if you leave right now.”</p>
<p>“What? Man, I thought you were an idiot walking into this place by yourself, but you’re real messed up. Ain’t ya got the smarts to figure out what kinda situation you in? Man, we got a real sucker here, boys.”</p>
<p>The tanned, bald man who appeared to be the leader of the bunch laughed heartily, and his subordinates followed suit.</p>
<p>“Listen, buddy. Just hand over all your gold. Then we won’t kill ya. We’ll just sell you as a slave instead!”</p>
<p>“I see, so that’s the way it’s going to be,” I said.</p>
<p>The delinquents all came at me at once, so I stepped forward with the Pyrachnid’s Claw of Kindling and, using a swing, severed their legs at the ankles.</p>
<p>“Huh? Hraaaaaarghhh!”</p>
<p>The sudden loss of both their feet sent them into shock, and they collapsed headfirst into the dirt of the unpaved road.</p>
<p>“Who is this freak?! Aaargh! My legs! It hurts! It huuuurts!”</p>
<p>“Grrraaargh! What the…? Gaaaaargh!”</p>
<p>I chose the Pyrachnid’s Claw so that I wouldn’t get covered in blood. Its searing edge burned and melted flesh, cauterizing wounds immediately.</p>
<p>Last time, my uniform had been damaged early on as the result of a bandit attack. Not long after I threw it away, I came across a soul blade with the power to repair cloth. The irony was not lost on me, and it was painful to remember, even now.</p>
<p>“Hmm. I wonder if that worked. Open Status.”</p>
<p>I stood up straight and checked my status screen, ignoring the delinquents’ feeble cries as they writhed on the ground behind me. As I expected, I had just gained the skill “Fleet-Foot.” Also present was the “Darkvision” skill, which I had picked up in the underground tunnel.</p>
<p>Darkvision, as the name implied, was a skill that allowed you to see better in dark places. Fleet-Foot let you channel mana into your legs to give a temporary boost to your Dexterity stat.</p>
<p>I had attempted to use Fleet-Foot once before, back in the summoning chamber, when I dashed past the guards to grab Alicia by the throat. Back then, I could tell that it had failed to go off because I felt a little recoil damage in my legs. That was why I hadn’t gained the skill then and why my HP was a little below full. I still hadn’t had time to rest, so my HP wasn’t fully restored. My MP, however, which recovered over time, had gone back up to about half. Minus the 30 percent or so it took to execute Fleet-Foot just now, it was currently sitting at around 20 percent. It was going to be hard to train the skill if it required that much MP to use.</p>
<p>“Although…”</p>
