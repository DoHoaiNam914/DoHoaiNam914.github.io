<p>After allotting the required experience points, I closed the window and conjured the Eight-Eyed Sword of Clarity. It was a short survival knife that fit neatly in my hand. The blade was slightly curved, and the opposite edge was cut with tiny serrations. Eight round holes, each about the size of my thumb, were scattered across the thick part of the blade, and in every one of the holes was a crystal: seven colors of the rainbow, and the eighth a jet-black. At the base of the handle, there was a crystal containing an image of a book, which was set in a ring of gold. When the ring was twisted a quarter turn, the image changed from a closed book to an open one, and a green transparent window appeared that was not unlike a status screen. This one was called a data board.</p>
<p>“Huh. Looks like I still have the data from last time.”</p>
