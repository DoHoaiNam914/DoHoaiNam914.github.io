<p>A window appeared, and when I read it, I dipped my head and pinched the bridge of my nose.</p>
<p>“Oh, Goddess of Earth,” I grumbled under my breath. “I know you said levels were deducted based on the time I spent alive, but I didn’t think you meant it could go negative!”</p>
<p>I gave a brief sigh and tried to focus. The <em>Current Level</em> and <em>Experience</em> fields were ones I had seen before, but this <em>Experience Remaining</em> was new to me. The name gave me some clues as to its function, but to make sure, I gave it a tap.</p>
<p>“I knew it…”</p>
<p>A scrollable dial wheel appeared when I touched the numeric entry field, allowing me to allocate my experience points. Presumably, this was because I now needed to pay experience to reunlock my soul blades.</p>
<p>In any case, it was clear that my level would not be going up without some serious grinding. It was the difference in stats that mattered when determining gained experience from an enemy, not level, and since my stats were being boosted by my soul blades, I wouldn’t be getting a lot of experience unless it was from some <em>juicy</em> prey like those gargoyles.</p>
<p>I closed the tab and took a look at my soul blades instead. Glancing at the list, I noticed there was one other usable blade.</p>
<p>“So the ones I can use right now are the Soul Blade of Beginnings, the Pyrachnid’s Claw of Kindling, the Nephrite Blade of Verdure, the Tailor’s Hook of Mending, and the Holy Sword of Retribution.”</p>
<p>The other soul blades each indicated that they cost at least three thousand experience points to unlock, and the ones I wanted first were even higher than that. I didn’t have to think about that just yet, though. First, I investigated the soul blades I had currently, since it seemed they would be my main weapons for a while.</p>
<p>“Hmm, the Holy Sword of Retribution. I see…”</p>
<p>It turned out that this had been the source of my extraordinarily canny hunches of late. This sword provided a passive boon that warned me of any evil intentions directed my way. I noticed several other abilities as I scanned the page. Then there, at the bottom, were a list of its unlock conditions.</p>
<p class="nl-list">1. Sincerely swear revenge against at least ten people you once trusted.</p>
<p class="nl-list">2. Total amount of damage received from those people exceeds a certain threshold.</p>
<p>I must have unlocked this sword just before I died.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, I wonder what happened to…”</p>
<p>After I had more or less digested its abilities, I took another look at the soul-blade list and scrolled down to the very bottom. There was one entry there whose name was simply <em>???????????</em></p>
<p>It had appeared sometime after I slew the demon lord, though I never noticed exactly when, and it was still here now, the second time around. Nothing happened when I tapped on it, either, and unlike the other soul blades, there was no way to unlock it using experience points. It didn’t even have the lock icon. As far as I could tell, it would just remain grayed out forever.</p>
<p>“Not much to be happy about, is there…?”</p>
<p>With my current stats, I could only defeat around seventy royal knights before giving up the ghost. While it would take too long for me to pay off my entire debt and start leveling up, I could train my skills and start improving my stats immediately. I had no time to waste.</p>
<p>“Then I guess I’ll go buy one tomorrow. They’ll be useful after I leave the city, too.”</p>
<p>I started planning out what I would need after I left the city. Then once I settled my other affairs, I turned my mind toward the night’s main event. I placed the necklace on the center of the room’s table and readied an MP potion in my left hand. Then with my right, I took the Tailor’s Hook of Mending, a sword that had a long, narrow spike for a blade and a tip that was bent like a bird’s talon.</p>
<p>“Man, it sure is a shame I won’t get to see this. Hmm, perhaps I could get that Four-Eyes to capture some images for me?”</p>
<p>This dastardly plan was nothing more than a <em>slight</em> inconvenience in the grand scheme of things, but still, I would have loved to see the faces of the princess or her parents when it came to fruition. Maybe it would be worth pulling out all the stops on this one.</p>
<p>Also, I hadn’t really spent too much time interacting with the king and queen, so it was hard to say what the best way of getting revenge on them would be. I needed more information on them, no matter how risky it was. So as much as I shuddered to think of indebting myself even more to Four-Eyes, it had to be done. I would lick the dirt off his boots if it helped me get my revenge.</p>
<p>“However… Heh-heh-heh…”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help grinning as I thought of my plan going off. It’d been a long day, and I was feeling tired, but my work wasn’t over yet. If I didn’t do this, I wouldn’t be able to sleep.</p>
<p>I channeled my mana into the Tailor’s Hook of Mending and hummed a merry tune.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“La-la-la! <img alt="image" src="../Images/music.jpg"/> La-la! <img alt="image" src="../Images/music.jpg"/> La-la-la-la! <img alt="image" src="../Images/music.jpg"/>”</p>
<p>It was morning, just as the faint glow of the impending dawn brought the day’s first light to the pitch-dark sky. My singing was slightly off tune, but with no less spirit behind it as I grinned maniacally at the fruits of my effort.</p>
<p>“La-la-la! <img alt="image" src="../Images/music.jpg"/> La-la-la-la! <img alt="image" src="../Images/music.jpg"/> La-la! <img alt="image" src="../Images/music.jpg"/>”</p>
<p>My grueling work had taken longer than I expected, and in the end, I never got to sleep in the bed I’d dreamed of for the last three months. Instead, I added those frustrations to the revenge pile and continued, guzzling MP potions along the way.</p>
<p>I threw myself into my task, and once the hard part was over, I coasted on a second wind that made me completely forget about the exhaustion of the previous day. The word <em>sleep</em> was like a foreign language to me, and I was so far gone that I ended up drinking all my leftover MP potions at once.</p>
<p>I could tell I was losing it, but I relied on the adrenaline pumping through me to get me through the night, and at long last, I held the finished necklace in my hands. Once dawn broke for real, the sunlight would help me calm back down. Until then, I belted out a song they used to play on the radio while I did some stretches.</p>
<p>“SHUT UP! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT TIME IT IS?!”</p>
<p>“Ah… S-sorry…”</p>
<p>An unexpected scream from the room next door brought me back to my senses. I had forgotten what it was like to hole up in a hotel with other people sleeping nearby. Too long spent alone on the run. From across these thin walls, he’d probably heard the song I’d been singing all night as well.</p>
<p><em>Oh my god. I want to diiiie! How embarrassing!</em></p>
<p>I dived onto the bed and started rolling around to get the memory out of my mind, when my neighbor slammed on the wall again.</p>
<p>“I SAID SHUT UP!”</p>
<p>I guess I hadn’t quite settled down yet. <em>Sorry, my brain is on strike. I’m really sorry. I hate my life. I’m going to go to bed.</em></p>
<p>I was looking forward to a good night’s rest, but I didn’t want to get too comfortable and oversleep. There were still some things to take care of before leaving the city.</p>
<p>The previous day, the summoning chamber had been under the princess’s orders, so any outsiders couldn’t step into the place. By now, they would have found her and started administering medical treatment. Those wounds had taken quite some time to inflict, and they should still take a while to heal, but I wanted to be out of this city as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I looked at the bed with a mixture of longing and regret before seating my back to the wall, next to the window, so that the rising sun would be my alarm clock.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I overslept. Like, seriously overslept.</p>
<p>…I mean, come on! I didn’t think the sky would cloud over and block the light. What do you mean, I should know everything from the first time around? How am I supposed to remember what the weather was like four years ago?!</p>
<p>By now, the sun was high overhead, and it was already midday. I checked out of the inn as quickly as I could, but my shopping would have to wait until later. For now, I grabbed some lunch at one of the many food stalls before heading once again into the slums.</p>
<p>My <em>example-making</em> must have worked, for no delinquents accosted me today, and I arrived promptly at my destination. I passed by the place where I ran into that money changer, but today, he was nowhere to be found, and another one had popped up in his place. When he saw me, his face grew stiff, and he hurriedly bowed his head, and when I smiled back, he turned oddly pale.</p>
<p>I wasn’t looking to start a fight or anything, unless he gave me a reason.</p>
<p>Eventually, I came to the gargoyles, which were completely back to normal as if nothing had happened. In fact, if anything, they were a little stronger than before. It was only when I saw them that I remembered I still didn’t know the password. As I was wondering what to do, they addressed me in unison.</p>
<p>““You may pass.””</p>
<p>Well, that was convenient. I entered Jufain’s base and was met with the icy glares of the hired muscleheads I had run into the previous day.</p>
<p>“I won’t cause any trouble if you don’t, so settle down, friends,” I said with a sigh.</p>
<p>The bodyguards still watched me intensely. An understandable reaction, but one that would do them little good. They might as well relax and save themselves the stress. If they picked a fight with me, they’d be dead either way.</p>
<p>I headed up the stairs to the second floor, where Jufain was waiting for me with a smile. On his desk were four sacks of gold coins. Judging by the sizes, it looked like three bags of a hundred coins and one bag of forty.</p>
<p>“Here is the money we agreed on,” he stated. “Would you like to count it?”</p>
<p>“No need,” I assured. “Anyone willing to pull cheap tricks wouldn’t last long in that chair.” Mainly, I just couldn’t be bothered, but I figured I’d pay him the compliment. “All right then, here’s the necklace.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much. You’ve given me something quite remarkable. Hmm? …Ah, I see…”</p>
<p>Jufain clearly realized something as he took the necklace. Drat, and I’d even gone to the trouble of using a high-level disguise, hoping he wouldn’t notice. You just couldn’t pull one over on him.</p>
<p>“My, you are a handful,” he remarked. “I can hardly present this to the royal family in person now, can I?”</p>
<p>“That’s rich—as if you would ever do something so risky. Just foist it off on some noble who’s been giving you trouble and enjoy watching him take the fall. It’s not like you were actually planning to shoulder the risk of directly dealing with the royals. Oh, the shit that comes out of your mouth.”</p>
<p>I’d learned the first time around that the king, queen, and princess viewed the slum as a necessary evil at best. When rumors of the demon lord first started to circulate, people bought up goods, driving up prices, and the slum began to grow. It was obvious that if Jufain went to the king with his prized jewels in hand, the king would call them thieves and have the entire slum thrown in chains, forced to work as slaves for the good of the kingdom until they drew their last breaths. In fact, I learned later that he’d tried something just like that, and the people almost rebelled against him for it. After I defeated the demon lord and outlasted my usefulness, he jumped on the opportunity and claimed <em>I</em> had been the one to order their enslavement, which was what landed me in such hot water. Knowing him, it was almost certain he’d try to pull the same trick again, even if someone else had to be his scapegoat this time.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said, “I admit I’ve ruined your chances to buddy up with a powerful nobleman. How about I pay you twenty gold to make up for it, and another twenty if you do me a small favor?”</p>
<p>“I have no reason to accept either of those. I would much rather know how you modified this item so greatly in just a single night.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, that’s a trade secret. So will you do it or not?”</p>
<p>“I can’t answer until I know what the favor is,” replied Jufain, giving a light shrug.</p>
<p>“Fair enough,” I replied. “Don’t worry, it’s not too difficult. I just want you to make one of those alchemical life-forms for me. You know, the one you tried to spy on me with. I want it to record something in the castle and bring it back to me, maybe by turning into a bird or something.”</p>
<p>“I will be the one who pays the price if they find out where it came from. It’ll have to be eighty gold.”</p>
<p>“And? Surely, that’s no problem for someone of your skills. Thirty gold.”</p>
<p>“You misunderstand. Whether or not I <em>can</em> do it is not the issue. The penalty for failure simply outweighs the benefit. Seventy gold.”</p>
<p>“Come on. I bet the nobles’ estates are filled with your monitoring devices. All I’m asking is that you add the castle to that. Fifty gold.”</p>
<p>“Spying on the nobility and spying on the king are in two completely different levels of risk. Sixty gold. Ahhh, I see the sky is finally clearing up.”</p>
<p>Throughout the negotiations, Jufain had not once broken my gaze, but upon saying this, he smiled and turned to look out the window. It was his way of saying to take it or leave it.</p>
<p>“…Fine, it’s a deal,” I grumbled. “You really are the stingiest bastard I’ve ever had the displeasure of dealing with.”</p>
<p>“Flattery will get you nowhere. A pleasure doing business with you.”</p>
<p>Then Jufain opened one of the sacks and counted out precisely forty gold coins, transferring them one by one into a second bag on his desk. He then took it along with the smaller bag containing the last forty gold coins of my payment to make up eighty coins—consisting of the twenty I was offering for pulling that trick over him, plus the sixty we had just agreed on. Finally, he cleared away those two sacks and placed an object on the desk. It was a small glass bottle filled with a golden, metallic liquid.</p>
<p>“Here you are. The receiver to my Peeping Eye. If all goes well, this should give you a view of what the transmitter sees when it activates.”</p>
<p>I picked up the sealed bottle and placed it in my bag. “Now, why do you just so <em>happen</em> to have the thing I needed on hand, I wonder…?”</p>
<p>“That’s a trade secret,” replied Jufain with a disturbingly perfect fake smile.</p>
<p>“Well, catch you later, though I hope we never meet again,” I mentioned. I knew it was too much to wish for.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t be that way. I, for one, will welcome you back here at any time.”</p>
<p>It was never easy to tell how serious he was being. I couldn’t think of anything to say to wipe the grin off his face, so I left without another word. Somehow, it felt like I had just lost.</p>
<p>Well, if nothing else, I had little to worry about with Jufain’s alchemy on my side. Now I just had to hope there was no one at the castle whose senses rivaled his. In all the time I knew the princess, I never once saw her take that necklace off. Perhaps there was some practical or sentimental reason there, but either way, I wouldn’t be surprised if she put it on immediately without even checking it first.</p>
<p>And when she did…</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! I can’t wait to see the look on her face!”</p>
<p>It had been another good day, and I was in another good mood. It was a feeling I hadn’t felt in over a year. A year of life on the run, thinking only about my next meal or what dangers lay around me, without a single moment to relax. I practically skipped through the slum, euphoric as I imagined the princess’s face contorted with pain and the horrified looks on the faces of her dear mother and father. Once again, I gave thanks for being granted a second chance.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, how nice it is to have things to look forward to again!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">After leaving Jufain’s base, I set out once again toward the edge of the slums. The previous day, I had been meaning to get a little shopping done with my advance payment, but now that I had the whole sum, it was probably best to get the big purchase out of the way first. For safety, I stowed my gold sacks into a large drawstring bag that was commonly used in this world to hold supplies for long journeys on foot. After that, I headed to a lesser-traveled area of the slum. Here, adventurers walked the streets, while workers from who-knew-where hid their faces with filthy rags. This was the one place in the slums where buyers didn’t have to acknowledge the poor. A place to deal in all sorts of illicit goods. The black market. You could find forbidden tomes, drugs, fenced goods, dangerous ingredients, and, of course, slaves.</p>
<p>Some were prisoners of war or convicts forced to work in the country’s mines. Others were ruined by debt or kidnapped, then bought and sold as property.</p>
<p>As a slave, it was hard to know how you’d be treated. It depended on the master. However, very few slave owners considered their slaves to be disposable. If nothing else, they were expensive products.</p>
<p>There were even sellers who proudly set up shop in the city center and were frequented by nobility and other wealthy individuals, with many high-quality slaves for sale. However, without the proper connections, it was impossible to visit these particular sellers. Those without friends in high places, or who were willing to settle for lower-quality products at cheaper prices, came here.</p>
<p>I wandered the market, trying to recall its layout from the last time I was here. Wherever I went, well-informed violent types went scurrying off into dark corners when they laid eyes on me.</p>
<p>“I had meant to make an example…but maybe I took things too far?”</p>
<p>Word traveled fast. It turned out the mage I’d humiliated was a fairly influential troublemaker. By beating him so thoroughly, I’d made quite the impression in this might-ruled society.</p>
<p>“Oh well. At least it means no one will bug me anymore.”</p>
<p>I was looking for a place where I could do business as inconspicuously as possible, and as soon as I finished my train of thought, I came across a shop that looked relatively empty. Inside, there were no other customers but me. Perfect. The idle shopkeeper looked me up and down and, upon realizing I was nobody of importance, addressed me plainly.</p>
<p>“Come to buy slaves, have you? What’s yer budget?”</p>
<p>I considered how much money I might need to take care of the rest of my business, then replied:</p>
<p>“I’m looking to get a single slave for about ten gold. Bring some out for me, and I’ll take my pick.”</p>
<p>Apparently, at the fancier slave markets, the clientele would often pay in large-gold coins and sometimes even platinum if the <em>goods</em> were of high enough quality. Here in the slums, you never knew what you were going to find, but even the cheapest slave would set you back three gold coins or so. Seven or eight gold was more common, so a budget of ten gold should cover all but the most expensive.</p>
<p>“Pardon me fer asking, but have you got the cash?”</p>
<p>The shopkeeper tossed me a suspicious look. A nobleman’s son would go upmarket, and I looked too weak to be an adventurer. A young Japanese man like me probably appeared little more to him than a kid, unlikely to have that kind of money on him.</p>
<p>However, it made me angry to be looked down on, even if I understood where he was coming from.</p>
<p>“…See for yourself,” I growled as threateningly as possible, placing a bag of coins onto the counter.</p>
<p>“Oh…oh, no, that’s quite all right! Please come this way, sir!”</p>
<p>The man’s complete change of heart annoyed me. It reminded me of the two-faced traitors I hated with such a passion. Unfortunately, venting my anger on him would do nothing to get back at them, so instead, I held my tongue and followed him into the back rooms.</p>
<p>There sat slaves in iron cages, wrists and ankles bound in chains, their eyes consumed by darkness. There was no concept of nutritional science or good hygiene in this world, but even by the denizens’ standards, the environment in these halls was bleak.</p>
<p>There were two reasons I was buying a slave. The first was for disguise. After all, if the kingdom came after me, they would only be looking for a single young man with black hair and strange clothes.</p>
<p>Second, I needed a training partner. There were many skills that were impossible to acquire and train if you were alone, and even though I could use the Holy Sword of Retribution to detect if someone would betray me, I had not the slightest intention of making any friends, either. Hence, I needed a slave. Just until my skills were ready, then I could pay them off and cut them loose, and if worse came to worst and they continued to get in my way, I could always deal with them <em>permanently</em>.</p>
<p>Still, it made me sick to my stomach to treat anyone the way I was treated, to dispose of them after they’d served their usefulness, even if that person was a slave. As such, I wouldn’t have to go that far unless they actually turned against me. Also, as I honed my own skills against them, the slave’s skills would improve as well, so it was safe to assume they’d have the bare minimum they needed to survive if I did end up leaving them on their own.</p>
<p>What I was looking for was a transactional relationship, ideally where I could get as much out of it as I put in. That was what I thought…</p>
<p class="space-break1">…until I saw the eyes of a certain slave.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“As you can see, this slave is in prime working condition. <em>The one over there</em> would cost you a pretty penny more, but here…”</p>
<p>“Hey. Who’s the one at the far end?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Ah, the <em>Lagonid</em> girl, you mean. Truth be told, I was planning on disposing of her. I brought her here to the capital because I heard the noblemen in these parts were into that sort of thing, but I’ve been having trouble finding a buyer. She looks sweet on the outside, but that rabbit’s got a vicious streak. Even the Slave Brand couldn’t persuade her to behave, and she nearly died in the process. A shame. She’s got a pretty face, but nobody wants to buy a girl who’s willing to kill you during the deed.”</p>
<p>Human supremacy was rooted in the religion here in the capital, and beastfolk faced terrible persecution. Hence, it was rare to see one around here, and relations with the beastfolk country, which lay beyond the far side of the empire, were strained. Of course, humans were just as hated over there as beastfolk were here, so the two realms were as bad as each other.</p>
<p>“I’ve made my decision. I’ll take her.”</p>
<p>“Huh? I don’t think you understand, sir. Those beastfolk are stronger than they appear. She really might murder you in your bedsheets if you’re not careful.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care. I’ll pay you ten gold pieces if we can seal the deal immediately.”</p>
<p>“Well, if you’re sure, sir, then it’s fine by me… Is this your first time buying a slave?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is. Why?”</p>
<p>“In that case, sir, we’ll have to set up your Master’s Mark.”</p>
<p>“My what?”</p>
<p>“Your Master’s Mark, sir. It will allow you to control your slaves by inflicting pain upon them at your discretion.”</p>
<p>We returned to the front of the store, and I signed the purchase agreement. Then I signed another document that granted me my Master’s Mark. This document was itself a magic item, and as soon as I placed my signature, it went up in flames, and a rudimentary magic circle appeared on the back of my hand.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara1">System message: “Master’s Lash of Taming” unlocked.</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break1">It appeared I had acquired a new soul blade. I would have to look at that later.</p>
<p>“Now simply hold the Mark above her Slave Brand and activate it using your mana. That will bring the slave under your control.”</p>
<p>“Can’t another master just overwrite her Brand, then?”</p>
<p>“No. The Slave Brand will change in shape to match your Mark, and any further modifications will be impossible until your contract ends.”</p>
<p>He led me back to the cells, to the far end of the room. The iron grate squeaked as he pulled it open, and I stepped inside.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Like a prisoner, she was bound and gagged, her wrists in chains and large iron balls attached to her ankles. Bruises covered her body from head to toe, and her rags were speckled with blood, possibly her own. Her long hair was not quite orange but dark flaxen, matted and dry, as though it had gone neglected during her long imprisonment. Her distinctive, rabbitlike ears drooped. From the looks of it, she once had quite a fine body, but now she looked emaciated and weak. Her eyes were sullen, and the skin of her arms, legs, and cheeks stretched thin over her bones.</p>
<p>I wondered how long she’d been like this. She looked so tired that simply groaning used up all her energy, and she was caked in dirt, which showed she hadn’t seen the inside of a bathtub for a very long time. However…</p>
<p>“Ah, what brilliant eyes,” I observed.</p>
<p>Yes, even in her pitiable state, those eyes of hers yet burned.</p>
<p>A dark, dark flame. Like magma, churning deep below the earth.</p>
<p>Any normal person would have given up long ago, when the wounds inflicted on their body became too much to bear. And yet her eyes brimmed with such heat and pressure, they seemed ready to go supernova.</p>
<p class="space-break1">They were the sweet, sweet eyes of revenge.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I stroked her cheek and peered deeply into them. The Holy Sword of Retribution showed me the evils that lurked in other people’s hearts, but I didn’t need it to detect the lust for revenge she bore. Her eyes shone with a pure and burning hate.</p>
<p>“Don’t…touch…me…human.”</p>
<p>A pointed glare. A flash of teeth. We were two of a kind, no doubt about it. We were both fated to walk the path of revenge for the rest of our lives—unable to find peace until we exacted our retribution. Just like me, she was possessed of a pitch-dark soul that burned her away from the inside.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>First, I completed the procedure to contract her as my slave. Channeling mana into my hand, I placed it against the Brand on the back of her neck.</p>
<p>“Grh! Aaaaaaaarghhh!”</p>
<p>The Brand glowed with a magical light as the shape that was carved into her flesh transformed. When the light dimmed and her screams of pain subsided, I took out from my bag two potions—one for HP and one for MP, which I used for emergencies—and emptied them both into her mouth.</p>
<p>“Nglg! Glglg! Gluuughhh!”</p>
<p>“Now maybe you’re feeling well enough to talk to me,” I said.</p>
<p>My appraisal soul blade was still locked, but it was clear that some debilitating condition was impacting all her stats. HP and MP were both tied to Stamina. Restoring them wouldn’t bring her stats back to normal, but they should at least give her some energy.</p>
<p>“What…?” she began.</p>
<p>“Who is it you want to kill?”</p>
<p>My words lingered in the silence of the cell. I watched her intently. Through the windows of her eyes, the same color as her hair, I observed the raging darkness within. It was that to which I addressed my question.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Who do you want revenge on?”</p>
