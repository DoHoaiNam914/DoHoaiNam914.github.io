<p class="noindent"><em><span class="dropcap">W</span>ho is it you want to kill?”</em></p>
<p>That was the very first question my master had asked of me. Even as broken as I was, I realized that it was not what one would normally ask of a slave.</p>
<p class="space-break1">So I looked back into his eyes, and right then, I could tell he meant something. At the bottom of a dark pit of mud, there was a festering cloud and an unquenchable red-hot light.</p>
<p>Instinctively, I knew we were two of a kind.</p>
<p><em>“Who do you want revenge on?”</em></p>
<p>So when he asked that second question, I answered. Everyone who made me and my mother suffer.</p>
<p><em>“Isn’t it obvious? Two is more fun than one. Two can come up with much better plans, put much more effort into torturing our targets, breaking them, grinding them down into mush. People who just want to kill are of</em> no use <em>to me, but you aren’t like that, are you?”</em></p>
<p>Whether he meant to or not, he saved me by saying that. He gave me the strength and sustenance to keep my broken heart from falling apart completely. Like water on the seed of my revenge. When all I knew how to do was smolder in anger, he taught me new emotions and gave me new desires.</p>
<p>I wanted him. I wanted to be near him. I wanted to be useful to him.</p>
<p>I wanted to feel him, be with him, make him mine.</p>
<p>I think I fell in love with him.</p>
<p>Ah, I think I understand now how Lucia felt. Except my feelings are far stronger than hers, of course. That wicked little witch. I can use this love to nourish my vengeance. I was so lucky to fall in love, because now I know exactly how to grind her heart down into a sticky mess.</p>
<p>It would surely come in handy.</p>
<p>The demon living in my heart chuckled.</p>

<p class="space-break">It had nearly been ten whole days since I first met Master. In the dungeon, I learned a new facet of what made him so great. He was far stronger than I was, even though he was only level 1. He showed me that true strength lay in more than simple stats.</p>
<p>Master told me that there were other, hidden stats, which the status screen didn’t display, and that was where our differences lay.</p>
<p>I could feel myself becoming more like him in the way he conducted himself on the battlefield, in the way he swung his sword. But it wasn’t enough. I needed to train harder.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Nnnh…”</p>
<p>“Oh dear, I almost missed out on this rare opportunity.”</p>
<p>After I had finished poisoning the Guardian Room as Master had asked, I pulled his sleeping body away from the wall and into my lap. I was thinking about my worries as I brushed his silky hair.</p>
<p class="space-break1">There was one other flame in my heart besides my revenge, and unfortunately, it seemed like it was going to take a long time to make him mine.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Fortunately, he seemed to take note of my feminine charms. I could feel his wandering gaze whenever I feigned MP drunkenness. On my lips, my breasts, my butt, my legs, my thighs, and the place in between them.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Of course, it wasn’t as though he was ogling me all the time, but it didn’t need to be that obvious for me to tell.</p>
<p>…Though it was hard to keep the act up when the only thing I wanted to do was smile.</p>
<p class="space-break1">In any case, it was too soon to tell him how I felt, because there was another who occupied my master’s heart. The demon lord named Leticia.</p>
<p class="space-break1">She had been the one to save my master at his lowest point, just as he had saved me at mine.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Given all the things I learned when I had my vision of Master’s life, I could guess he harbored feelings for her. But this time, after his do-over, their relationship no longer existed, and I didn’t even need to ask to know that he didn’t want her to be involved in our quest for revenge. In which case, he would soon be forced to draw a line between the Leticia he remembered and the one in this world. When that time came, I couldn’t allow him to come to some strange conclusion like <em>No one else can ever replace her</em> and lock me out forever. That was why I couldn’t be too forward with him right now.</p>
<p><em>“After rejecting one woman, a man may go on to reject every other who comes his way, even after breaking up with the first woman.”</em> That’s what I heard from a party of adventurers who came to my village one time.</p>
<p>Therefore, I had to wait until his relationship with the demon lord girl was well and truly in the past. Then I could get Master to start thinking of a new future and slip into a little me-sized hole in his heart. Until then, I had to be prudent and refrain from any outrageous behavior.</p>
<p>I had been using the MP drunkenness as a cover to gradually file away at his emotional defenses, whittling down his reluctance, nestling up close to his heart, waiting for that moment to arrive.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I needed to be a woman who was normally calm and collected and was embarrassed by the things she did while under the influence. That way, he wouldn’t reject me out of hand.</p>
<p>“A new treasure—Master’s hair!”</p>
<p>I carefully pulled the hair from my brush and placed it inside the round Squirrel’s Blade of Holding. Master had allowed me to share in the power of this item, letting me amass a secret <em>collection</em> that even he couldn’t access.</p>
<p>Right now, the finest item in my collection was this.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, there you are! Tee-hee! Mmm, so delicious.”</p>
<p>I ran my tongue up the length of the wooden spoon Master had used.</p>
<p>Ahhh, I knew all that time and effort spent making this would pay off.</p>
<p>“Oh no, I mustn’t. Perhaps I really did use too much MP after all.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t afford to let Master see me like this, with my lust obvious. Not only was it embarrassing, but even I could tell it was a little extreme, and I didn’t want Master to be put off from me for good. The mere thought of it terrified me. I placed the spoon back and returned to watching Master’s face as he slept.</p>
<p>“Mmmmh…”</p>
<p>The time went quickly, and at some point, he seemed to be having a nightmare. As much as I wanted him to feel the softness of my legs a little longer, it was about time to wrap up. Besides, I could still use the MP drunkenness as an excuse for having him in my lap.</p>
<p>I would hide the second flame inside me with a mask of shadow and work my way into the recesses of his heart like an encroaching poison. Then when the time was right, I would strike.</p>
<p>I would surround him with me, so there was nowhere for him to run. Once Leticia was out of his mind forever, he would be completely engulfed.</p>
<p>Until then, I would have to console myself with the small times like this when I could expand my collection.</p>
<p>Master, I won’t let you escape from me, you know? Not before we exact our revenge, and not afterward, either. Not until my image is burned into those deep, dark eyes of yours.</p>
