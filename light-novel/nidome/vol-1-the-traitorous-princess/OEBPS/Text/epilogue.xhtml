<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span> was floating through a murky sea.</p>
<p>The dream had ended. I was drifting between wakefulness and sleep. Below me stretched the infinite depths. Above me, I could see the bright surface of the water.</p>
<p>“Kaito…”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a wavering shadow appeared before me, and I heard a voice as if from far away, strained through the abyss.</p>
<p>“Leticia…”</p>
<p>Her hair, a deep scarlet, redder than blood. Her gleaming black eyes. Her small, childlike body. Her dress, as black as night. She looked exactly as I last saw her. She was Leticia Lu Harleston, the forty-seventh demon lord.</p>
<p>“Kaito… Come to me…”</p>
<p>“Come on, brain! Are you really going to make her say that?!” I said out loud.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but laugh at myself. I knew just how pathetic I was, crying out over a dream that had reminded me of the past. How dependent was I on the girl I had killed with my own hands?</p>
<p>“But I suppose you’re right. I will get to see you again.”</p>
<p>And I would.</p>
<p>The Leticia who was still alive knew nothing about me. It would be nothing but sentimentality. Nothing more than selfish closure and atonement. Still, I longed to see her just one more time. Just to say one thing to her, and she’d never have to see me again.</p>
<p>I wanted to apologize. I wanted to wish her well and say good-bye.</p>
<p>“And when I do, I’m going to say, <em>O Lord, please take revenge with me, and I shall grant you half the world</em>.”</p>
<p>She wouldn’t know what I was taking revenge for, and I would not tell her. It was for me to deal with. Therefore, this was a request she could never accept. It would be my punishment for the sin of being the only one to know what those words meant.</p>
<p>I knew she wouldn’t understand. I knew she would refuse me. But I had to tell her. I had to.</p>
<p><em>…Then perhaps at last, I can let you go. Perhaps I can live, even without you by my side.</em></p>
<p>Ah, but…</p>
<p>“It’s such a shame I won’t be able to be by your side when I’m dead.”</p>

<p class="space-break">“…ster……aster…”</p>
<p>“Ngh… Ah… Minnalis?”</p>
<p>I was gently shaken awake to see Minnalis’s face centimeters from my own, her cheeks slightly reddened.</p>
<p>I knew I had been sleeping, but I remembered falling asleep with my back to the wall and one knee in my arms. Now I was lying on my back, and I could feel something dangerously soft behind my head.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Master. You were talking in your sleep.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, I was dreaming of the past… Wait, what is this?”</p>
<p>“Oh, the Guardian Room was bigger than I expected. I had to use all my MP on Intoxicating Phantasm, and I’m feeling a little tipsy…”</p>
<p>I’d also fallen asleep from mana withdrawal, so I guess she couldn’t resist, but even when it would be easy for her to get carried away, Minnalis did the responsible thing. She seemed embarrassed to have me in her lap, though—her usual poker face was failing her, and her lips were starting to tremble.</p>
<p>…Would it be bad to tease her a bit? Would that make me a terrible person? Her face was begging to be bullied, but I summoned up every bit of my adult self-restraint and refrained.</p>
<p>MP drunkenness is no joke. Regular drunkenness is no joke, either. Taking advantage of a drunk person is a despicable act. Besides, you never know when you’ll be the one in that position.</p>
<p>I stood up and shook my head, as if to dispel the remains of my drowsiness and tipsiness.</p>
<p>“How long was I asleep?” I asked.</p>
<p>“About an hour, I would say.”</p>
<p>“I see. And is the Guardian dead?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. Our experience hasn’t gone up.”</p>
<p>The hole I had made in the door was now plugged with scraps of garm fur. I could hear noises of the Guardian struggling in pain on the other side, so the poison appeared to be working as intended.</p>
<p>This plan was not perfect. It required that you punch a hole in the near-indestructible Guardian Door, and on top of that, you needed a poison strong enough to damage the Guardian itself. Guardians were incredibly resistant to status conditions, and this dungeon’s boss, the Goblin King, was no exception. What’s more, if the poison was strong enough, then it would even damage the weapons, armor, and materials that the Guardian dropped. To counteract that, you would have to rush into the poison-filled room as soon as the Guardian fell. (If you left them, the drops would eventually be absorbed back into the dungeon along with the Guardian’s body.)</p>
<p>The only reason we could use this plan was because we had the unnatural powers of the Pyrachnid’s Claw and the everlasting poison of Minnalis’s Intoxicating Phantasm, coupled with the fact that all we cared about were the experience points.</p>
<p>Another concern was that I wanted to keep my soul blades and their powers secret, but there was nobody around to see them this time, so we didn’t need to worry about that.</p>
<p>“Well, while we’re waiting for the Guardian to die, I’ll allocate my experience.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t going to get any experience points from the boss, because it was Minnalis who was doing all the damage. That meant I already had everything I was going to get from this dungeon.</p>
<p>Right now, I had around fifteen thousand EXP left. I’d spent three thousand on the Squirrel’s Blade of Holding, four thousand on the Fairy’s Blade of Water, and thirty-six thousand on the Wing Blade of Detoxification. That came to a little under sixty thousand EXP that I’d gained in this dungeon. If I wasn’t in debt and I put it all into leveling, that would be enough to get me past level 50.</p>
<p>Unlocking the Fairy’s Blade and the Wing Blade taught me something else. I could unlock the sealed abilities of my soul blades incrementally. The Fairy’s Blade had an ability that let you control the temperature of the water it produced, while the Wing Blade had abilities for resisting and curing all the various status conditions. However, each of these abilities required experience points to unlock.</p>
<p>I spent six thousand to unlock the blade itself, two thousand for each resistance (Poison, Paralysis, Sleep, Petrification, and Charm), and then twenty thousand to let me extend those effects to my allies. That made thirty-six thousand in total. This last ability could be upgraded to allow for a maximum of ten people to share the status-resistance effects, but for now, I could use it on just three people. That shouldn’t be too much of a problem since I wasn’t planning on surrounding myself with a bunch of random hangers-on like the last time.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to how to distribute my remaining fifteen thousand. I considered putting it toward my debt, but if I was increasing my stats, it was going to be harder to gain more experience in the future. It would be better to spend those experience points on a soul blade that I could use to counteract that effect.</p>
<p>To put it in video-game terms, the first time around was a normal playthrough. This time, I was playing with restrictions. That meant I had a few options available to me.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara1">Challenger’s Blade of Adversity</p>
</div>
<p>This sword grew in power the lower my stats were compared with my opponent’s. If my stats were higher, the sword would get weaker instead.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara1">Attacker’s Needle of Poison</p>
</div>
<p>This sword strengthened the effect of Poison on the target every time it dealt a hit, regardless of the damage caused. However, I couldn’t apply Poison to the sword itself, so I would need Minnalis’s help to make good use of it.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara1">Boundary Blade</p>
</div>
<p>For a bit of mana, this blade could produce a barrier that reflected ranged attacks back toward the attacker. The sword’s own attack power was practically nonexistent, however, so I wouldn’t be able to defeat an enemy any other way with it.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Considering my current stats and MP, it was going to have to be one of these three. As I was thinking things over, a bright flash of light suddenly emanated out of my pocket.</p>
<p>“Master?!”</p>
<p>“Ah, don’t worry, it’s okay.”</p>
<p>I reached inside and pulled out a small glass bottle. It was the one Jufain had given to me in the slums. I opened it and placed it on the ground, whereupon the golden liquid inside began to move around like a slime. It crawled out of the bottle and toward the nearby wall.</p>
<p>“That took longer than I thought. There’s no point if the princess’s burns have already healed by now. Let’s take a look and see…”</p>
<p>I had gone to great pains to disguise this magic so that it wouldn’t be discovered before I could see the beautiful sight it was going to reveal to me. I mean, it was only going to be more torment like I inflicted on her at the start, but there was no such thing as overkill in this business. It’s just a pity that all I could do was confirm if my plan had gone off. I had wanted to watch the princess suffer.</p>
<p>While I was thinking, the slime climbed up onto the wall before stopping at about chest height. There, it flattened out and expanded into the rough shape of a TV monitor. On its body, an image formed of someplace far away…</p>
<p>“What’s that…?” asked Minnalis.</p>
<p>“It’s the royal throne room. You saw it in my vision, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>There in the image were the king and queen, the knights, and Princess Alicia.</p>

</div>
<p class="space-break">It had been over ten days since that perfidious wretch betrayed me.</p>
<p>That day, I performed the hero summoning, just as the Great Spirits commanded. I gathered the required sacrifices, and the ritual had been a success.</p>
<p>However, the hero I had summoned was unruly, if not insane.</p>
<p>And to think that just once, I was willing to allow a worm to dream of becoming a hero.</p>
<p>“…Krh.”</p>
<p>The scars on my back burned.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>I will not follow your orders.</em></p>
<p><em>Let the scum I send you be a warning.</em></p>
<p><em>Your punishment will be many times more painful.</em></p>
<p><em>Prepare to lose all you hold dear.</em></p>
<p class="att"><em>The Revenant</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">My attendants said my skin was lovely as porcelain. Now it was ravaged by scars. Recovery magic could restore HP, but wounds like this would heal only with time. Only someone on the level of the archbishop of the Church could cast a spell strong enough to heal them completely.</p>
<p>Still, I had been having healing spells cast on me day after day, and the scars were fading. A few more days, and the message would be gone completely. I was no longer in any pain, but every time I remembered that man’s face, I felt a festering urge inside me.</p>
<p>On that day, soon after he left the room, I blacked out, as if fleeing from the unbearable pain. It was only the following day that I was rescued by the knights waiting outside, and when I next awoke, I was in my bedchamber within the castle.</p>
<p>The most powerful knights, including the knight commander, were covered in the scars of their many battles. They left them that way on purpose to strike fear into their enemies on the battlefield, but needless to say, it made them look quite vicious. For that reason, I had brought only my most noble-looking knights into the summoning chamber, so as to not scare the fledgling hero. Now half of them were still recovering in the infirmary.</p>
<p>Even with all medical resources diverted to myself, it was only a whole day after I was rescued that my burned throat was cured and I was first able to speak.</p>
<p>When they found us, the knights were a wretched sight, their arms and legs bent out of shape and broken, their faces beaten to a bloody pulp. It was a wonder that some of them were still alive. I lay there, my face bruised and my disheveled hair sprawling across the floor, with that hateful message scorched into my back.</p>
<p>It was impossible to tell at a glance what had happened, but it was clearly no accident. However, there was no information about the perpetrator to go on. The building had been surrounded by knights, so at first, it appeared as though he had simply teleported far away to safety. It was only when I could finally explain what had happened that searches were carried out in the capital.</p>
<p>The necklace he stole…for <em>“a bit of spending money,”</em> he had said. That treasure proved I was next in line to the throne. He couldn’t simply sell it at a shop, because it was inscribed with the royal crest. Even if he tried to take it elsewhere, out of the capital, word would get around.</p>
<p>That necklace was passed down to me by my late sister. It wasn’t for a beast like that to handle… No—it wasn’t for anyone but me to touch!</p>
<p>“You’ll pay for this…”</p>
<p>He would pay. The necklace would be returned to me, and that man would suffer for what he did. I would make him beg for mercy at my feet. Then he would be put to death.</p>
<p>However, although my knights had spent the last few days investigating, they hadn’t turned up any strong leads. It was possible he’d already fled the capital by now.</p>
<p>The day prior, one noble claimed to have found the necklace. This man was a count who was considered something of a nuisance by the people of the city, owing largely to his strong regard for the law and his overinquisitive nature. Supposedly, the necklace had turned up in a shipment of contraband that he had confiscated, and he was going to present it in the royal court today.</p>
<p>“Princess, it’s time,” said a handmaiden.</p>
<p>“Yes, I know,” I replied.</p>
<p>I checked my attire one last time, then headed to the throne room.</p>
<p class="space-break2">Atop his throne sat my father, King Rogia Orollea, a sturdily built man. Beside him was my mother, past forty but no less beautiful than she was in her youth, Queen Lecilia Orollea. And on his other side was where I sat. Also nearby was the prime minister, Roebentz, and Guidott, the knight commander, who stood close at hand, ready to leap to my defense if anyone were to threaten me.</p>
<p>“I would hereby like to return this item to the care of the royal family.”</p>
<p>The young count kneeled before us, and a handmaiden carefully took the necklace along with the pedestal atop which it sat and brought them over to me. As much as I wanted to rush out of my seat and snatch it back, I waited patiently for the handmaiden to get here before taking the necklace and placing it around my neck.</p>
<p>Immediately, I felt the mana running through it. Then the necklace glowed briefly with a pale-green light before returning to normal.</p>
<p>“<img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> ! Are <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> okay?”</p>
<p>My father turned to me and asked me a question, but I didn’t hear some of what he said.</p>
<p>“Yes, Father. I’m fine.”</p>
<p>I gave myself a quick look-over but could detect nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>“<img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> see. But then what was that light? …<img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/>, <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/>, do <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> two know anything?”</p>
<p>“<img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/>, <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> am but a mere knight. Perhaps the <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> can tell <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> more?”</p>
<p>“Wait, it couldn’t be…,” the prime minister muttered with a serious look on his face.</p>
<p>However, by this point, I had already figured out what had happened to me.</p>
<p>“<img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/>&#160;&#160; <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/>, <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> am not a specialist in these matters so <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> cannot be certain, but that light… Perhaps <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> are dealing with a curse of some description.”</p>
<p>“By the heavens… Surely not. The <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> appears to be well.”</p>
<p>“F-Father…I cannot hear you. No, to be precise…I cannot hear any words that refer to people.”</p>
<p>“Wh-what?! What is the meaning of this?”</p>
<p>I could hear most of what the others said, but names and pronouns failed to reach my ears. I hurried to remove the necklace.</p>
<p>“I… I can’t take it off! It won’t come off!”</p>
<p>The mention of a curse sent me into a panic. I didn’t fully understand what was happening. The next few hours were a jumbled blur. First, we gathered together everyone in the court who was familiar with magic. However, they were mostly trained in combat magic and had little knowledge of the theory underlying it. All we could discover was that a priest would not suffice to dispel this magic. It seemed further investigation was required into the nature of the curse, and the high level of disguise that had been placed on it necessitated someone with specialized knowledge. Researchers were called in from the nearby academy town, and a few days later, they set about experimenting on the artifact.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“That is enough for today. Please leave me. I wish to be alone.”</p>
<p>The researchers departed, and I was left to grind my teeth in frustration. Around this time of year, I would normally be networking and strengthening my <em>connections</em>. This kingdom was founded by a woman, and female rulers were taken no less seriously than male ones. Nonetheless, I still needed to show my face in order to be respected as the next queen, and so it was important for me to mingle with high society. However, as I was now, I couldn’t hear people’s names, or even words like <em>he</em>, <em>she</em>, <em>I</em>, <em>you</em>, or <em>them</em>. It was little impediment when talking to people I didn’t know, but it was critical if I was to make a splash in the court scene.</p>
<p>Though the academy had sent its finest researchers, I was told it would take two months at minimum to get to the bottom of this enigma. Even in the best-case scenario, there was no telling what effect two months of reclusion would have on my social standing.</p>
<p>“<em>Sigh</em>, it’s no use. I’m getting myself into a rut again.”</p>
<p>I was getting tired. I drank a cup of warm milk and got out of my chair, adjusting the hem of my nightie. Then I got into my bed, which was stuffed with the finest monster fur, and fell asleep almost instantly.</p>
<p>…I didn’t know that my sleepless nights were about to begin.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“Aaaaaaargh!”</p>
<p>“Krh, it’s no use! My healing magic is having no effect!”</p>
<p>“Dammit. Why aren’t the academy researchers here yet?”</p>
<p>It was the middle of the night, and my father had hurriedly called a nurse to my bedroom. It had been three days since I first put on the necklace, and the true nature of its curse was making itself clear. The scars on my back, which had been recovering, were now growing worse and worse with each passing day. Almost as if the healing <em>was being undone</em>. I was racked with scorching pain, as though my burns were still fresh.</p>
<p>“Grrrggghhh! Haaah, haaarghhh!”</p>
<p>It reached the point where I could no longer bear to lie on my back. It felt like each cut was being gouged out anew with a needle. I knew this was the necklace’s doing because of the pale light that shrouded my wounds every time the pain flared up, but that information did nothing to help against the pain, nor did any of the healing magic we had access to.</p>
<p>The pain was warping my perception of time. At some point, Father and the nurse had left my room. Or had I asked them to leave? It was shameful as a princess for them to see me this way.</p>
<p>“You’ll pay for this…”</p>
<p>I had no proof, but I just knew that he was behind all this. So I could bear the pain. I didn’t need any help. All I needed to do was capture the dark feelings that the pain induced. Wrap them in charred-black chains and pull them down deeper and deeper into the tar pit within my heart.</p>
<p>For defiling my family treasure, I would drive that otherworlder, that monster in human skin, to the depths of despair.</p>
<p>“You’ll pay… You’ll pay… I will have my revenge!”</p>
<p>I reveled in that night as jet-black hate stewed inside me. I didn’t let one second of it go to waste.</p>
<p>“Grrr! Graaaargh! Hrgh! Hhh! Aaaaaaargh!”</p>
<p>And so the night passed without me ever knowing the peace of sleep.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break">“All righty. Looked like it went off without a hitch.”</p>
<p>Seeing the princess enveloped in glowing light was proof that my machinations had succeeded. She had figured out the first effect, my modified “Impair Senses” that made her unable to hear names and pronouns, and the scene had been exceedingly fun to watch.</p>
<p>The necklace originally came with four effects: Auto HP Regen, Recovery Boost, Record Illusion, and Self-Damage Repair (Poor). I had modified two of these, removed one, and added an extra one in its place.</p>
<p>First was Record Illusion. I had changed this one into Impair Senses.</p>
<p>Then I converted Auto HP Regen into “Reverse Healing (Extra Poor).” This effect healed wounds by “rewinding” the wound until it was completely gone. This meant that if it was activated when the wound was in the midst of healing, it would rewind that healing back to the wound’s worst state and then heal from there.</p>
