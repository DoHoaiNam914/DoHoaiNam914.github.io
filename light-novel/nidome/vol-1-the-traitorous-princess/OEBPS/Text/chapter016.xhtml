<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here’s nothing here to eat…”</p>
<p>“We searched so hard, and not a single bite…”</p>
<p>To the north of the Orollea Kingdom, in a small village just outside the bordering Girigal Empire, a girl who turned fifteen that year was foraging in the snowy woods alongside her friend Lucia.</p>
<p>In those parts, the temperature dropped low in the winter, and though the crops were usually bountiful, the last ten years had seen a steady decline. At times like these, the village sought to endure the season by foraging for nature’s bounty in the nearby forests. However, this year, winter had come unusually early and blocked off the forest with snow before the village could secure adequate reserves. Though children were not permitted to enter the forest during this time of the year, the two girls had slipped away from the village while the men were away on hunting expeditions.</p>
<p>Lucia shrank into herself apologetically. Her wavy blond hair fell neatly around her shoulders. “I’m sorry for making you come with me, Minnalis. I just wanted Kril to have something to eat on his birthday…”</p>
<p>“No, it’s okay,” replied the girl, shaking her head. “Besides, I was the one who said we should search the forest. I wanted to celebrate, too.”</p>
<p>The two children had entered the forest, without telling the grown-ups, to find food for their friend to eat. However, even the trees that still had their leaves bore no fruit, and the snow fell so heavily around their roots that it was impossible to turn up even a single blade of wild grass.</p>
<p>Still, the girls searched the forest, their eyes wide with curiosity, looking for the special tree they had heard stories of that yielded exceptional fruit only in the winter. They forged ahead, the snow crunching underfoot as they walked. Before long, they came to the depths of the forest—a place they were told never to enter, even in the warmer months.</p>
<p>“Minnalis… Don’t you think we should head back soon?”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah. Let’s go home, even though we couldn’t find anything.”</p>
<p>Hearing Lucia’s worried tone, the other girl grew nervous, too, and was relieved to think of the village again. For a while now, the forest had felt darker, more foreboding, though in appearances, nothing about it had changed.</p>
<p>Lucia, who was just a simple child, couldn’t tell the difference. But the girl could, for <em>unbeknownst to the village, she was a beastfolk</em>. Her heightened senses were many times more sensitive than those of a human. To her, this part of the forest was like a different place entirely, and the eeriness made her skin crawl. She was the one who suggested they search for the fruit in the first place, though, and she couldn’t bring herself to suggest turning back when they had still not found it.</p>
<p>“Okay then,” she said, facing back where they came from.</p>
<p>“Ah, wait! Minnalis, look over there!” Lucia stopped and pointed at a tree a little way ahead.</p>
<p>It was difficult to get a good look through the branches, but the girl could definitely see several small yellow fruits that were about the size of fists. Lucia beamed as she pointed them out.</p>
<p>“Thank goodness! It wasn’t a waste to come all the way out here after all! Let’s grab them and head…back…”</p>
<p>Then all the blood drained from Lucia’s face. When the other girl saw <em>it</em>, she, too, went pale.</p>
<p>“Grrrrrah…!”</p>
<p>It was a single goblin.</p>
<p>Dwarfish in size with a repugnant face and green skin, goblins were known for their excessive breeding rate, and they were considered vermin wherever they sprung up. The girls had seen them before, albeit from a distance, as the creatures often appeared during harvest time to plunder the fields. The men of the village would band together to repel them, or if the monsters’ numbers were too great, then adventurers would be hired. One goblin would not be too much for the pair to outrun, even as young as the two girls were. However, the problem was the color of the creature’s skin. While normal goblins were green, this one was a deep blue.</p>
<p>“A variant…”</p>
<p>Regular goblins were weak monsters, the kind a novice adventurer might slay while collecting herbs for a quest. They were recommended targets for beginners because of their low threat level, and they were relatively harmless unless you encountered a large group of them. However, on rare occasions, specimens were born that exceeded the capabilities of their species. Goblin Soldiers and Goblin Magicians were famous examples of this phenomenon. However, there were also individuals whose abilities were so far removed that they were like a different species. These were called “variants.”</p>
<p>The girl had heard about them once before from a party of adventurers who stopped in the village. The monsters looked almost identical to a regular goblin, except for their dark-blue skin. Unlike their kin, which kept to warm climates and abhorred the cold, these variants thrived in the chilly climate and appeared in snowy areas, though sightings were rare. Their resistance to ice was extremely high, and weak magic would bounce right off them. Their intelligence and abilities, as well as their ferocity, were also several levels higher than those of other goblins.</p>
<p>“An Ice…Goblin…,” breathed out the girl.</p>
<p>Lucia, on the other hand, didn’t know what it was, but she could feel its overpowering aura all the same. Fortunately, the goblin was engrossed in picking fruit and hadn’t noticed the girls.</p>
<p>“Lucia, stay calm. We have to…”</p>
<p>“Nooo! Noooooooo!”</p>
<p>“L-Lucia!”</p>
<p>Before they could quietly make their escape, Lucia succumbed to pure fear. She let out a terrified yell and started running, unable to hear a single word that the other girl was saying.</p>
<p>“No! No! Nooooo!”</p>
<p>“Lucia!”</p>
<p>Lucia was suffering from the Panic status condition, the other girl realized. She had heard about it before when she was listening to the adventurers talking about their experiences, though there was nothing she could do to help her friend now. The girl turned to flee, catching one last sight of the Ice Goblin looking up in their direction and grinning as it spotted a more delicious <em>meal</em>.</p>
<p>The girls scrambled through the snow, hoping against hope to make it back to the village in time, but the goblin was clearly closing in on them. Running for her life, Lucia took one step on the unfamiliar, snow-covered paths and fell head over heels.</p>
<p>“Eek!”</p>
<p>“Lucia!”</p>
<p>“Urgh… Ow…”</p>
<p>Lucia had sprained her ankle as she fell into the deep snow, and she was now unable to stand. Even if the girl helped her up, her injury would make it impossible for the two of them to outrun the Ice Goblin.</p>
<p>“Grah-grah-grah-grah!”</p>
<p>The foul creature closed in on Lucia with mocking laughter, but the girl had the power to save her. The goblin was rich in mana, but it couldn’t cast spells. If she used her beastfolk strength, she could overpower it. However…</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>“Remember, Minnalis. You must never use your power in front of others. If you do, the illusion I placed upon you will be dispelled, and your rabbit ears and tail will be revealed.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Why is that bad, Mom? Why can’t people know we’re beastfolk?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I wish I knew, sweetie. We just look a little different; that’s all…”</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">“No! Nooooo! I don’t wanna die! I don’t wanna diiiie!”</p>
<p><em>…I’m sorry, Mom!</em></p>
<p>Seeing her friend in danger, the girl flew toward the goblin, disregarding the promise she made to her mother.</p>
<p>“Rrraaaaargh!”</p>
<p>“Grah?!”</p>
<p>Her flying kick connected with the goblin’s stomach. The force of the attack blasted the small creature away and into a nearby tree. Such a hit would have killed a regular goblin instantly, but the variant Ice Goblin sprung quickly to its feet and, displaying its heightened intellect, deduced that continuing to engage the girl would be a poor idea. Giving the pair a glowering look, it retreated into the depths of the forest.</p>
<p>“Lucia! Are you okay?! Are you hurt?”</p>
<p>“Mi-Minnalis… What are…?”</p>
<p>With a trembling finger, Lucia pointed, astonished, at the ears atop the other girl’s head.</p>
<p>Different kinds of beastfolk had different strengths and weaknesses, but on the whole, their physical stats were higher than those of humans, as well as their HP and MP. However, their mana was unique in that it grew weaker the farther away it traveled from their bodies, making their ranged attack magic considerably less effective compared with other races. The cloaking magic that hid her ears was a thin layer of illusion that wrapped around the body, so it could get around this weakness.</p>
<p>Her bloodline was particularly skilled at illusion magic, so it was no great hardship to craft a disguise that endured for long periods of time. However, since she’d used her full beastfolk power, the force of the mana emanating from her body blew the illusion away.</p>
<p>“Ah…er… I’m…I’m sorry, Lucia. I’m sorry I never told you. Please keep this a secret!”</p>
<p>“Huh?! Oh, er, okay.”</p>
<p>The girl gave a reassuring smile to her friend, who was still reeling from the shock.</p>
<p>The girl was not the child she once was. She knew the contempt this country had for her kind. That was why she’d followed her mother’s words all this time and never told a soul about her heritage, not even her closest friend.</p>
<p>“There we go.”</p>
<p>The girl recast the illusion that concealed her ears and tail. She learned the spell about four or five years ago. Before that, her mother always did it for her.</p>
<p>“Let’s get back to the village. We didn’t find any food, but we might run into more monsters, and it’s getting dark.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…you’re right. Let’s go home.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">It was already evening by the time they arrived back at the village. After the village elder scolded them thoroughly for going into the forest in winter, the two were sent home to await their punishment the next day. The girl went to her mother—Maris, who was bedridden—and told her about what happened in the forest.</p>
<p>“I see. You saved your friend,” Maris said with a weak smile.</p>
<p>The girl wondered why her mother seemed so sad, but as she was tired from the day’s events and unused to using her full strength, it didn’t take long before she fell sound asleep, dreaming sweet dreams of finding all sorts of fruits in the snowbound forest.</p>
<p>The next day, she was awoken by a knock on the door and led to the village square. For some reason, her mother was brought along as well.</p>
<p>“Hmm? What’s going on? Isn’t this <em>my</em> punishment? Why is Mom…?”</p>
<p>She was dragged along to where a large crowd had gathered. She stared, confused, at their thorny glares, and when the village elder spoke, his words caused her mind to go blank.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Minnalis. Maris. Is it true that you two are beastfolk?”</p>
<p class="space-break1">The girl couldn’t believe her ears. She barely understood what she was hearing.</p>
<p>“I’ll ask again. Are you two beastfolk?”</p>
<p>The elder’s words rang once more in her thoughts.</p>
<p><em>Why? Why? Why? Why? How did this happen?</em></p>
<p>Her mind was a storm of questions. She couldn’t process this information. She looked up at her mother for help and reassurance. Her mother’s countenance was grim, yet with a determined look, she dispelled the illusion that kept her true identity hidden.</p>
<p>A murmur swept through the crowd, and their eyes changed. It was like they were looking upon a pile of exterminated goblins whose bodies had rotted. The faces of the villagers she loved like family were twisted with disgust.</p>
<p>“Mo… Mom…”</p>
<p>The situation was changing too fast for her to keep up. Her confusion kept growing. She looked at the face of the village elder. His eyes were the coldest, most disdainful eyes she had ever seen. They scared her. Scared her even more than the Ice Goblin she had fought the previous day.</p>
<p>“We are beastfolk, as you can see. I’m very sorry for hiding it all this time.”</p>
<p>Her mother pressed her head to the cold, hard dirt in apology. Finally, the girl understood. The villagers hated them both.</p>
<p>“So Lucia was telling the truth…,” muttered the elder.</p>
<p>“L-Lucia?! No… No, she couldn’t have…,” the girl stammered. Lucia promised not to tell a soul the previous day. The girl looked around, searching for someone to tell her it was a lie, and there, nestled among the crowd, she saw the faces of her best friends.</p>
<p>Then her hopes of salvation were dashed. The boy, Kril, looked back as if she were garbage. And there, nestled by his side, stood Lucia, grinning, just out of his periphery.</p>
<p>“Wh-why? You said you wouldn’t tell anybody!”</p>
<p>The young girl couldn’t help but yell.</p>
<p>Lucia clung tightly to Kril’s arm as though afraid. “Eek! Kril…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Lucia. It’s okay,” assured Kril, patting her back gently and firing the girl a deadly glare. “Leave Lucia alone! I couldn’t believe it at first, but you really are evil! I trusted you!”</p>
<p>“What? What are you…?”</p>
<p>“Don’t play dumb! Lucia told me everything! You’ve been bullying her this whole time and threatening her to keep quiet! You made her cry!”</p>
<p>“Wha…?”</p>
<p>The girl was speechless. Lost for words. Even if she could say them, her mind utterly failed to come up with any words. Then her mother spoke again.</p>
<p>“Elder, I don’t care what you do to me, but please—please don’t hurt her! Please… I at least want her to live to see her eighteenth birthday…”</p>
<p>Maris lowered her head as she embraced her daughter. She had known this would happen ever since her daughter told her what happened in the forest. She couldn’t leave because of her sick health, and she knew her daughter would never run away without her. This was the only thing she could do.</p>
<p>“Please… I beg of you…”</p>
<p>“Foul beastfolk!” One villager had picked up a stone off the ground and hurled it at her.</p>
<p>“Who are you trying to fool?”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you lied to us all this time!”</p>
<p>“Damn animals in human clothing!”</p>
<p>One by one, the villagers joined in, raining down scathing words and sharp rocks upon the pair.</p>
<p>“Please… Please spare my child… Urkh!”</p>
<p>“Mom!”</p>
<p>Among the thrown stones, a large one struck Maris’s skull, drawing blood, and the girl instinctively imposed her own body to protect her. In all the confusion, her illusion had come undone, and her ears and tail were fully visible. Still, she thought only of protecting her mother. Maris had been ravaged by plague once in the past, and she was now a shadow of her former self, without the strength to stand against her attackers or endure their barrage.</p>
<p>“Stop it! Stop it! Stop iiiiit!”</p>
<p>The little girl’s wails rang through the square, but the villagers’ taunts beat her back down.</p>
<p>“Shut your trap, monster girl!”</p>
<p>“You dare use human words, you animal?”</p>
<p>“Why are you still alive?”</p>
<p>The words were like a stake being driven right into her heart. The girl felt a dark crack open up deep within her.</p>
<p><em>Why? It hurts… My heart… It hurts so bad…</em></p>
<p>As she cowered in fear, her eyes came to rest on her friends. Kril was swept up with the other villagers, shouting abuse and hurling stones, and there, by his side, pinching his sleeve in her hand and standing back where he couldn’t see, was Lucia, her face pulled wide in a mocking smile.</p>
<p>Then the girl finally understood. In mind, body, and soul.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>She betrayed me. She betrayed me. She betrayed me. She betrayed me!</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">“Why…? Why…?”</p>
<p>Tears trickled down the young girl’s face. The stones bearing down drove the wedge deeper and deeper inside. Just as her heart was about to break completely, the rain of stones suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>“What’s all this commotion?”</p>
<p>The men of the village had returned. They carried with them a humble number of wild beasts, the spoils of their hunting expedition.</p>
<p>“Father…! Father!”</p>
<p>Through teary eyes, the girl could just about make out the form of her father standing among them. He could make it stop. The villagers respected him, and everyone expected him to succeed the elder.</p>
<p>The villagers and her father conferred. She felt a wave of relief wash over her. Everything was going to be—</p>
<p class="space-break1">“No! I didn’t know about any of this!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">“ &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ”</p>
<p class="space-break1">The world began to turn. Her vision swirled before disappearing entirely.</p>
<p>“That woman tricked me, too! Those stinking creatures lied to me!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">She heard nothing, saw nothing, smelled nothing, felt nothing.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“What…is happening? Huh? I mean, what…?”</p>
<p class="space-break1">The last thing she heard was the sound of something shattering into a million pieces.</p>
<p class="space-break2">And then her world was annihilated.</p>
<p class="space-break2">The next thing she knew, she was being transported in a slave seller’s cart. All she remembered was being sold off for next to nothing by the man she had once thought of as her father.</p>
<p>Her body declined to the point where she was practically paralyzed, but the girl still found the strength to go on because her mother was with her. She faced harsh treatment at the hands of her masters, even worse than the way the other slaves were being handled, and being an expensive commodity didn’t lessen the disdain that beastfolk invited. She was given the worst food and beaten and whipped for no reason. If she was lucky, she got to bathe in the dirty water left over by everyone else, but otherwise, she didn’t even get that, and her masters kicked her into the mud, sneering at her for being smelly and dirty. They even put a harness on her and made her pull the cart from time to time, calling it an animal’s job.</p>
<p>Still, the girl persevered. She held on tight to what remained of her mind for the sake of her ailing mother. Yet for all she did to ease her mother’s stress, it was no use. Her once sweet, loving mother became less and less. The slave owners were using her as a scapegoat. Seeing the awful things that were done to the beastfolk made the other slaves feel better about their own situations. <em>Look</em>, the other slaves seemed to be saying to each other. <em>At least you’re not as bad off as them.</em></p>
<p>And it worked. The others laughed at the beastfolk’s treatment. When the girl was whipped and beaten, when her mother was dragged around by the hair, when they were both kicked to the ground, the slaves roared and howled like they were watching a comedy.</p>
<p>Six months after being sold into slavery, only half the distance to the royal capital, her mother’s body gave up completely, and the girl’s world shattered for the second time.</p>
<p>“<em>Tsk.</em> Broken, are you? You beastfolk ain’t half as tough as I heard you were. Can’t believe there are nobles into this crap. What’s the world comin’ to, I tell ya?”</p>
<p>The girl simply stared at the slave seller with vacant eyes.</p>
<p>“And yer mother’s gone and snuffed it, too. Can’t believe I’m out here lettin’ you impact my bottom line.”</p>
<p>With a twitch, something inside the girl reacted to his words.</p>
<p><em>Why…?</em></p>
<p>Something oozing like venom.</p>
<p><em>Why…? What did I do wrong? When did I become the enemy? What should I have done?</em></p>
<p>Something that burst up out of somewhere deep inside her and enveloped the remains of the girl’s dark, lifeless heart.</p>
<p><em>Whose fault is it? Why am I here? Who am I? Why do I exist? What do I feel?</em></p>
<p>The thoughts pressed down on the remains of her heart, heating them like magma deep underground. Wriggling, coiling, churning, those fragments were warped beyond all recognition.</p>
<p>When her heart was reforged, it held only a single, pure emotion.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Oh. I want to destroy.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">That realization was a single droplet that heralded the storm of emotion she had been holding back.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>…I despise them.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>I am consumed by hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. Raw hate.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>I hate Lucia. I hate Kril. I hate the man who was once my father. I hate the elder and all the villagers.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>I hate the slavers who made me and my mother into laughingstocks, and I hate the slaves who laughed at us.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>I want to hurt them and wound them and bend them and break them and grind them and slash them and cut them and blind them and slice them and choke them and burn them and split them and stab them and skin them and tear them and squash them. I want to kill them. I want to kill them. Kill them. Kill them. Kill them. Kill them. Kill them. Kill them. KILL THEM!</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">The thoughts covered her mind until there was nothing else left.</p>
<p class="space-break1">After that, she didn’t listen to anything the slaver sellers told her anymore. Whenever she disobeyed, she was beaten, whipped, starved, or whatever else they could think of, but nothing extinguished the fire within her. When she was so broken that she couldn’t move, when she was close to death, her flame yet burned. When sellers at the capital imprinted her with her Slave Brand and used it to inflict extreme pain, she glared back at her captors with unbridled malice. Before long, they gave up on feeding her, changing her, and bathing her and left her to rot in her cage. She spent her days imagining her brutal revenge and how she would tear her enemies limb from limb. Soon enough, even those days would end. She was going to die.</p>
<p>Despite being faced with this knowledge, the fire worming around inside her would not stop.</p>
<p>But even the hardiest beastfolk did not last long without food. Her mind was already fading, and all she could feel anymore was the burning heat at her core.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Ah, what brilliant eyes.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">A voice cut through her haze. A stranger was looking at her. These nobles from the capital were all the same. Many had visited, but this time, she had not the strength to lash out like before. The only thing she could do was glare with all the hate in her heart.</p>
<p>But when she looked into that boy’s eyes, she felt something deeply familiar.</p>
<p>“Don’t…touch…me…human.”</p>
<p>Already, her parched, cracked lips had spoken.</p>
<p>“Grh! Aaaaaaaarghhh!”</p>
<p>Then a flashing pain ran through her body and penetrated her clouded mind. It felt like her scars were going to burst, and a piercing scream escaped her. Just as the waves of pain subsided, the boy poured a strange liquid down her throat.</p>
<p>“Nglg! Glglg! Gluuughhh!”</p>
<p>She hadn’t even the strength to spit it back up. However, seconds after she ingested the mysterious fluid, her tired bones felt the faint spark of life. Having not had decent food or rest for days had rendered her body barren of mana, but now it felt at about half charged.</p>
<p>“Now maybe you’re feeling well enough to talk to me.”</p>
<p>The girl could not comprehend what the man standing before her was saying. Her recovering mind was only barely able to understand that she had just drunk some HP and MP potions. They weren’t something you’d give to a slave. They might not be entirely out of reach for the public, but they were still expensive.</p>
<p>“What…?” she began.</p>
<p>The girl had plenty of cause to suspect some kind of trap or other ruse, so the boy’s next words came as quite a surprise.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Who is it you want to kill?”</p>
<p class="space-break1">It was the greatest shock she’d felt since her mother’s passing, when the slaver had said the words that caused her mind to break.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Who do you want revenge on?”</p>
<p class="space-break1">Looking closer, she saw that the boy’s eyes didn’t seem too different from her own. She realized why they felt so familiar. They held the same heat that dwelled within her. His eyes were her eyes. Her answer to his question was immediate.</p>
<p>“My best friends. My father. The village elder and all the villagers. The slavers and the other slaves.”</p>
<p>“Is killing them all you want to do?”</p>
<p>He asked it like he already knew the answer. Of course he did, but he wanted her to say it. And she would. She would say it as many times as it needed to be said, until she no longer had to think about it. Until it became instinct, etched onto her heart.</p>
<p>“No. Death is too good for them. I want to make them suffer, hurt, weep, and wail. Then I want to break them. Slowly. They have to be fully broken when they die; otherwise, it’s just a waste.”</p>
<p>She smiled her first smile since becoming a slave. The boy before her, too, smiled at her words.</p>

<p class="space-break"><em>“Death is too good for them. I want to make them suffer, hurt, weep, and wail. Then I want to break them. Slowly. They have to be fully broken when they die; otherwise, it’s just a waste.”</em></p>
<p>The words of the broken girl brought a smile to my face.</p>
<p>“I have laid out two paths for you,” I told her. “On the first, we are master and servant, nothing more. When I have fulfilled your use, I will grant you money and power enough to survive on your own. I will release you from your slavery. You could live a long, happy, and fulfilling life.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You could rid yourself of the darkness inside your heart. Hide the scratches on your soul and pretend that none of it ever happened. A happy future full of laughter, one where you can smile.”</p>
<p>It was a joke on my part. Both she and I knew that our minds were made up. Still, I had to put it into words, if only to remind her of what might have been. We didn’t know what the future held. Perhaps one day, we would come to regret our choice. That was why I had to offer her another possibility, one that we could not turn back from.</p>
<p>“The second path for us to become comp…no, al…”</p>
<p>I stopped midsentence.</p>
<p>“Hmm… Neither of those words sound right,” I muttered to myself. <em>Companion</em>? <em>Ally</em>? That wasn’t what I came here for. Our relationship couldn’t be summed up with empty platitudes. Our bond was nothing so weak. There was only one thing to call a pact such as ours. A name for those spurned by the world, who spurned it in turn. A name for those who chose death over life, sin over virtue, retribution over redemption.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“The second path is to become my partner in crime. To embrace revenge, and to revel in its execution.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">I extended my hand, and a soul blade formed in the air above it. Black wisps coalesced into the form of a short sword with a double-edged blade that was shaped like a flame. Twisted up its fifty-centimeter length were red markings, the color of blood. Staring at it was like peering into the endless void. To gaze upon it was to bear witness to one’s own divine judgment. If I wanted, I could will it into the shape of a longsword for use in battle, but right now, this form was ideal.</p>
<p>Grasping the hilt of the Holy Sword of Retribution, I sliced the girl’s fetters clean off her body before embedding the blade in the ground before her.</p>
<p>“If you pick the former, then turn around. If the latter, then take the blade. Don’t make this decision lightly. There’s no going back. Once you grab hold of this sword, you will be irreparably damaged—tainted, cursed never again to lead a normal life. Cursed never to find rest until vengeance is yours.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“That sword will transform the heat burning inside you into a raging flame that will never go out. Try as you might, you will never be able to give up on your revenge. When you take this blade, your enemies will become my enemies, and mine yours. The hate I feel will become your hate, and your hate will become mine. Oh, and supposedly, you should get a new intrinsic skill based on your talents.”</p>
<p>“…Are you going to betray me?”</p>
<p>The girl’s eyes seemed to go on forever, a darkness without end. Oh, I knew. I knew my word wouldn’t cut it here.</p>
<p>“Once you accept this pact, we will no longer be able to harm each other. If one of us dies, so will the other,” I explained.</p>
<p>There was a flicker of understanding in the girl’s eyes. Not only did this contract prevent me from betraying her, but it also prevented her from betraying me. I didn’t want to be backstabbed again, after all, nor did I want to backstab anyone and end up just like those I hated the most. If it wasn’t for the power to enforce this contract, I wouldn’t be here offering this deal in the first place.</p>
<p>Having said all I needed to say, I released the hilt of the blade.</p>
<p>“Of course, you could always seek revenge on your own. My enemies are many, and you might not want to take on that much hate. Still, it would make me extremely happy if you accepted.”</p>
<p>“…Why?” the girl asked, but I knew she harbored no suspicion. She already knew what I would say. She was simply confirming that we were one and the same.</p>
<p>A maniacal grin spread across my face.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it obvious? Two is more fun than one. Two can come up with much better plans, put much more effort into torturing our targets, breaking them, grinding them down into mush. People who just want to kill are of <em>no use</em> to me, but you aren’t like that, are you?”</p>
<p>“Ah! Ah-ha-ha-ha!” The girl, overjoyed at my words, broke into laughter. “I like the sound of that. ‘Partners in crime,’ you say? You have a point. If I’m with you, my revenge could be all the sweeter. Together, we could drive them into far greater depths of despair than I ever could alone.” The girl’s gentle smile was worthy of the Virgin Mary, but her eyes shone with a mad glint. “In that case, there’s nothing left to think about. My flame of revenge will never die? Good. I don’t want to go back to those simple days spent stoking a smoldering heart. Taking on extra enemies is nothing compared with the thought of returning to that disgusting life I used to lead. The fact that it helps my revenge is just icing on the cake.”</p>
<p>“Then take the sword. It will show you what to do.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, she gripped the Holy Sword of Retribution by the hilt and removed it from the ground. As she did, the blade emitted a blinding black light that scorched the eyes. That was proof that it recognized her lust for revenge. That paradoxical light was a blessing upon her journey.</p>
<p>“Ah,” I said, “come to think of it, I haven’t asked your name.”</p>
<p>“My name? My name is Minnalis.”</p>
<p>“I see. I am Kaito Ukei.”</p>
<p>“Kaito Ukei… My master’s name is Kaito Ukei.”</p>
<p>For the first time, Minnalis smiled a peaceful smile. Then she leveled the point of the sword to her heart.</p>
<p>“It’s a pleasure to be working with you, Minnalis.”</p>
<p>“Likewise, Master,” she replied, then plunged the blade deep into her own chest.</p>
<p class="space-break2">The blade emitted a burning light before rapidly dissipating into shimmering motes. There was no wound on Minnalis’s body, nor so much as a hole in her dirty rags.</p>
<p>“I see,” I mused. “So this is the reason behind your revenge.”</p>
