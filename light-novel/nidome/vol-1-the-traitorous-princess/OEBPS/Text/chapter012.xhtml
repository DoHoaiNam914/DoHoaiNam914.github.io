<p>I still had some mana remaining, so I wasn’t feeling dizzy just yet. However, I was so exhausted, it felt like it had been four and a half days since my do-over began.</p>
<p>I was accustomed to not having to think about my skills, so it felt physically weird to not have access to them, even though I logically understood they were temporarily unusable.</p>
<p>“Hey, not so fast. You’re the leader, right?”</p>
<p>“Gaaaaah!”</p>
<p>Just as one of the delinquents attempted to crawl away, I stabbed the Pyrachnid’s Claw of Kindling through his hand, pinning him to the ground.</p>
<p>“Grgaaaagh! It burns! Aaargh!”</p>
<p>“Heh. This is pretty good. It’s nice not to get blood all over me,” I said nonchalantly as I watched the man scream. My sword continued to burn as it remained lodged in his wound, inflicting excruciating levels of pain that reduced the man to a gibbering wreck.</p>
<p>“When I’m not making fireballs, it doesn’t consume too much MP, and the blade is short and easy to handle. It even stops people from dying of blood loss. I’d only ever used it to start fires, but I’m beginning to think this soul blade will be very helpful.”</p>
<p>“You…you monster…”</p>
<p>“Agh… Aaaaah…”</p>
<p>I smiled, and the hobbled delinquents’ faces filled with despair. The crotches of their pants began to trickle.</p>
<p>“Geez, what a horrible sight. I get no pleasure from this, you know.”</p>
<p>I swore revenge on those who betrayed me, and it was those whom I wished to make suffer. Torturing these guys wasn’t enough to even get my pulse racing.</p>
<p>“I’m done here. See you.”</p>
<p>I took up the Pyrachnid’s Claw of Kindling and went around beheading them. Each swing of my sword was followed by the smell of burning flesh and a soft <em>thud</em>.</p>
<p>“I should get going,” I said to myself.</p>
<p>I left behind a littered mess of incomplete bodies, unidentifiable feet, and decapitated heads frozen in masks of pure terror.</p>

<p class="space-break">The man ran without looking back. His gait was floundering; he was only concerned with moving his body forward at any cost. He didn’t care about the cuts and scratches he took as he narrowly avoided walls and stray pieces of wood. He was mad with terror, and his instincts were telling him only one thing: <em>Run. Run for your life.</em></p>
<p><em>Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!!</em></p>
<p>Breathless, his body pleaded with him for rest, but his brain drove him relentlessly on. His mind drifted back to the source of his fear.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The day had begun like any other, with the man undertaking some routine work. The people in the slums were those who couldn’t show their faces elsewhere. Fugitives, orphans, nobles cast out of their families, merchants whose business ventures had failed, adventurers unable to pay their debts, and even ordinary people simply living in poverty. It was a place filled with shady sorts of every kind.</p>
<p>But it was a necessary evil. Without a slum, all <em>those</em> people would spill out into the rest of the city, disrupting the flow of things. Long ago, there was a prosperous trading city that had tried to expel people from the slums by force. While it had succeeded, public order suffered so greatly that merchants avoided the place, sending it on a sharp path down into decline, from which it never recovered. These days, most cities allowed their slums to develop, at least to a certain extent. That way, the citizens could expect a greater quality of everyday life, so long as they didn’t accidentally stumble into the slum itself.</p>
<p>However, the inhabitants of the slums were still not given the same level of recognition as the other citizens, and if they grew brazen enough to meddle in public affairs, the kingdom would have no choice but to respond with force.</p>
<p>The slums, for their part, also preferred not to have the city get involved, which was why in any similar settlement, the people who stood at the top took care of its management. They made sure that the slum didn’t grow too large, maintained a certain level of order, and ensured that things went as smoothly as possible with the outside world. And so it came to be established that those living in the slum would be responsible for anyone making trouble in the nicer parts of the city. In return, the kingdom would turn a blind eye to what went on inside. In this world, slums were places ruled by no laws of the crown.</p>
<p>The rulers of the slums in the capital had ordered this man, an ex-spy, to keep watch on the entrances to several cities in the area. They needed to know the physical descriptions of anyone entering the city who spelled trouble, and they needed to know about the children of nobles, rich men, or politicians, so that they could protect them if they wandered into a bad part of town. So long as the ex-spy did that, he would be allowed to continue operating outside the law.</p>
<p>The slums were the man’s own home, too, and he didn’t want to lose them. So when his skill alerted him to a young man heading there from the main streets, he went to his usual vantage point for a better look.</p>
<p>The boy looked to be in his late teens. Dark hair, light build. He was dressed in high-quality, jet-black clothes, but the design was of nothing the man had ever seen, even here in the capital. The boy certainly wasn’t a politician’s son, but he didn’t look like a beggar or an escaped criminal, either. Perhaps he was a noble or a merchant from some faraway town. It was hard to tell how much influence he might have, but he was certainly one to keep an eye on; the man could tell that much.</p>
<p>“In which case, perhaps I should let them rough him up a little before I intervene…,” the man muttered to himself as he watched the delinquents slowly surround the boy. He’d step in once the lost boy was wounded.</p>
<p>The man had an agreement with the delinquents. It was a con. If the man decided that it would be bad if the intruder died, he would step in, make a big show of fighting the delinquents off, and earn the person’s trust. Then he could gently encourage the stranger to leave without stirring up too much ill will.</p>
<p>He watched as the delinquents raised their fists. <em>A couple of broken bones should be enough</em>, he thought as he readied himself to jump in and earn the boy’s favor. But what he saw next struck him dumb.</p>
<p>“Huh? Hraaaaaarghhh!”</p>
<p>There was an inhuman scream. The man hurriedly tried to make sense of what he just witnessed, and it was only because of his training as a spy that he was even falteringly able to process the scene. The delinquents launched an attack, and the next second, they were sprawled on the ground. Now the boy was humming to himself, totally unfazed as he unleashed a scene of brutal carnage. At some point—the man didn’t see when—a dagger or throwing knife of some sort had appeared in the boy’s hand, and when at last the boy pinned the leader of the delinquents to the ground, took up his sword, and executed him, the former spy turned tail and fled as fast as he could.</p>
<p>What could he do against such strength? Would even the royal knight order stand a chance? The boy had a disregard for life like no one he had ever seen outside the slums. He killed those men like it was nothing, like he was doing a job. The work of the reaper.</p>
<p>The man didn’t know if the delinquents had blabbed about his involvement, but he did know that if that <em>thing</em> set its sights on him, he was as good as dead. So he ran. Anything to get even one step farther away from that monster. His survival instincts were in overdrive, spurring him on over shady bridges toward his destination. He knew there was nothing he could do alone, and so he pressed on, fueled by terror, to find the people in charge of this slum and report what he had seen to them.</p>
<p class="space-break2">Eventually, he arrived at the marketplace. The rows of decaying stalls, a far cry from the neat storefronts of the main streets, dealt in junk and poor-quality trinkets. Slipping past them, he rounded a corner, entered an unimpressive building, and came to a steel door that was flanked by a pair of gargoyles. Two sets of glowing red eyes, equally cold as their gray stone skin, peered down at him.</p>
<p>““Password?””</p>
<p>“Hah…hah… A battered key opens many doors.”</p>
<p>““You may enter.””</p>
<p>The man caught his breath and pushed open the steel door. Through the entrance was a different world, a room so clean that it was hard to believe that the slums were still outside its walls. It was filled with many sumptuous fittings, so splendid that it equaled the mansion of any aristocrat elsewhere in the city. Former knights and mercenaries sat around on high-class leather sofas, relaxing and placing bets.</p>
<p>“Hmm? What’s up, Jack? You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” noted one.</p>
<p>“Hold on, let me guess,” said another. “You ate some dodgy grub, and your guts are about to give up on you. Is that it?”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t think I didn’t see that just now! Tryin’ to distract me from the game, eh?!”</p>
<p>“<em>Tsk</em>, can never pull one over on you…”</p>
<p>Upon seeing his good friends making merry and calling his name, Jack felt his fear settle down. He was safe now, and he could let his guard down.</p>
<p>“I need to see the boss. It’s urgent,” he announced.</p>
<p>He had to report this incident as soon as possible. Jack didn’t know what the boy’s motives were, but he knew he wasn’t dealing with some kid who got lost and ended up on the wrong side of town. The boy knew about the criminal underworld; that was for sure. His deductions told him that the young man had no influence, but his instincts as a spy told him that the slum would be in great danger if this boy was left at large.</p>
<p>“What’s up? Has the crown dispatched troops?”</p>
<p>“…No. I’ll tell you later.”</p>
<p>There was no way he could sum up the destruction he had witnessed. As a spy, he had learned that it was best not to give only one word when a hundred would suffice. The best way to avoid misunderstandings was to be very clear about things. Thus, he said nothing until he could provide a full description.</p>
<p>He ascended a creaky wooden flight of stairs and knocked on a door at the end of the hallway.</p>
<p>“Who is it?” came a voice.</p>
<p>“It’s Jack,” he replied. “Boss, I have an urgent report.”</p>
<p>“Come in. Door’s unlocked.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me.”</p>
<p>He entered the room with grace and stood before a man about thirty years of age wearing a monocle, with slicked-back white hair. His narrow eyes gave him the impression of being very wise, and he was scrutinizing a document in his hands.</p>
<p>“You don’t mind if I read as you talk?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Of course not, boss.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t because Jack devalued the importance of his information but because he trusted his boss’s ability to listen carefully while also reading.</p>
<p>“Hmm, this may take a while, I see. Take a seat.” The boss grew more serious, sensing the gravity in Jack’s voice.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>As Jack sat down, his mind raced with where to start. He quickly got his thoughts in order and opened his mouth, but before he could say anything, the boss spoke.</p>
<p>“Hmm, Jack, it appears you screwed up.”</p>
<p>Jack faltered, thrown off by his boss’s sudden remark.</p>
<p>“Huh? Um, sir, what do you…?”</p>
<p>“Hello, you the boss around here?”</p>
<p>Before he could finish, there was a loud <em>bang</em> as the door was <em>kicked down</em>. Jack whipped around and almost felt like he could hear the blood drain out of his face. There in the doorway stood the black-haired young man, smiling as though showing up at a friend’s place. He held the severed head of a gargoyle in one hand and dragged the mangled body of one of Jack’s associates with the other.</p>
<p>Then, noticing Jack, he added, “Oh, thanks for showing me the way. Now we’re even for <em>that little stunt</em> you pulled on me.”</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break">The man ran ahead of me, and I followed. I knew he had a deal with those delinquents who attacked me. I even knew all the details. That was because they pulled the same trick on me last time, and I got them to spill the whole thing. So I knew where he was hiding, imagined he might try to report to Four-Eyes, who ran this place, and figured I’d have him lead me right there.</p>
<p>I remembered where I met the slum leader the first time, but I had no guarantee that he’d still be in the same place. He used a magic item that allowed him to move his base around and keep his enemies guessing, a prudent measure for one in his position.</p>
<p>I checked my status as I tailed the man and saw I had gained “Track Lv 2” and “Stealth Lv 1.” It was proving to be easier to learn and improve skills than it had been the first time around. Even though the levels were reset, I hadn’t forgotten how to use the skills. Perhaps it wouldn’t take as long as I thought to get back on form.</p>
<p>As I pondered this, I realized that the man had led me straight to his hideout. I was a little surprised. He was good at gathering information, and last time, he had turned out to be a useful ally. He had even once worked as a spy for some foreign country, so he was normally quite a wary person. His folly was that he was also a coward and ran at the first sign of danger, so even though I had never set my sights on him personally, watching those delinquents get slaughtered must have triggered something in him.</p>
<p>Murder was an everyday occurrence in the slums. A man would break your neck for a slice of bread. People died fighting over spoiled apples. Some even killed just for the thrill of it, before the slum leaders found them and beat them to death. Rarely did a day go by in the slums without somebody dying, and I had already seen several people squabbling over food scraps on my way here.</p>
<p>So the man was used to death, especially considering his previous job. He ran because he knew if I spotted him, he would be my next victim. Last time, that was exactly what happened.</p>
<p>The man ducked into a building, and I watched for a while before heading inside after him. There was a familiar steel door guarded by two gargoyles.</p>
<p>““Password?””</p>
<p>“Ah, right. Forgot about these guys.”</p>
<p>I scratched my head. The first time around, I had forced the man to bring me here, so the password hadn’t been an issue. I had been going for a more delicate approach this time, but it was starting to look like that wouldn’t happen.</p>
<p>The person I intended to meet was not one of my sworn enemies. However, he was certainly not my friend, either. He’d slit his mother’s throat if it benefitted him, and he was drawn to people who thought the same way. In fact, he would work with anyone who shared his mercenary attitude, no matter who they were. He never lied, but he was always planning to exploit you in some way, and you never knew exactly how. Give him a good enough reason, and he’d betray you without a second thought. I knew that, and he knew that I knew. We were simply using each other.</p>
<p>Still, I could do much worse in these parts, and he was the best partner I was going to get in a country like this one. Also, I needed him to sell the princess’s necklace for me, so there was no point in trying to antagonize him right off the bat.</p>
<p>Allowing yourself to lose your cool with him would be a mistake. He’d see through the bluff, bluster his way to your true intentions, and then auction that information off to anyone willing to pay a pretty penny. Sure, you could outbid them and stop that from happening—<em>if</em> you even noticed it was happening, that is.</p>
<p>Furthermore, his alchemist combat skills were almost as sharp as his wits. All in all, he was someone you couldn’t let your guard down around.</p>
<p>“Sorry for the sudden request, but do you think you could let me speak to your boss for a bit?”</p>
<p>““Password?””</p>
<p>It seemed the gargoyles were not too keen on making conversation. I thought back to the password I heard when I first came here, over three years ago. I found it hard to believe that Four-Eyes would be so stupid as to keep using the same password, but it was worth a try.</p>
<p>“The Nezrahare scares; its hair flares.”</p>
<p>““Incorrect. Begone, interloper.””</p>
<p>“…Damn, I knew I shouldn’t have bothered.”</p>
<p>The gargoyles beat their stone wings and rose from their plinths, seeking to drive me out now that I was considered an <em>enemy</em>. As they opened their mouths to cast a spell, I dashed toward them. Unlike dragon breath, which spread far out in a cone, gargoyle breath attacks were shorter and went in a straight line like a laser beam. Even without my skill levels, I was more than powerful enough to deal with a couple of simulacra that could only follow strict orders.</p>
<p>I weaved past the laser and struck one of the gargoyles. Its body felt unsurprisingly hard, and I knew I couldn’t break it with my current stats. Thus, I used my Control Mana skill. I transferred mana out of parts of my body, save my legs and eyes, and concentrated it into my arms to strengthen them temporarily. This technique was reserved for emergencies, since it left the rest of my body weak, but at my level, a direct hit would mean death either way.</p>
<p>I also didn’t want to use my soul blades. That Four-Eyes was no doubt watching me right now through these gargoyles, and I could do without giving him more information than he needed. Not to mention, gargoyles were exceedingly resistant, the bane of Fire mages everywhere. The Pyrachnid’s Claw would be of little use here.</p>
<p>Control Mana, on the other hand, didn’t use MP, because it was just moving mana around within the body. As for the downside, the gargoyles’ attacks could kill me regardless, but it didn’t matter because there was no way these things were going to hit me.</p>
<p>“Gurgh!”</p>
<p>“Gargh!”</p>
<p>I started with one, broke its wings, crushed its arms, grabbed its legs, and swung it into the ground, smashing its head. I hurled what was left of its body at the other one, and when it stopped moving, I held its head and gouged out the magic gems in its eye sockets that gave the gargoyle its power.</p>
<p>“What?! Who goes there?!”</p>
<p>A man of medium build had apparently heard the racket and come running. He hurriedly drew his sword and pointed it at me. Since it looked like I’d already screwed up settling this matter peacefully, I jabbed my fingers into the gargoyle’s hollow eyes and slammed its body into the man. The force caused the stony head to detach from its body.</p>
<p>“Gaaagh!”</p>
<p>My odd attack caught my opponent off guard, and he was unable to raise a defense before the gargoyle’s heavy stone body launched him against the wall. He slowly collapsed to the floor, hacking up blood as his broken bones pierced his internal organs. I left him and stepped inside.</p>
<p>“Hammonds, no! You bastard, you’ll pay for that!”</p>
<p>A slender man, seeing his fallen comrade, swung his sword at me. I parried with the Pyrachnid’s Claw before shattering his kneecaps with the gargoyle head that I had brought with me. As he fell to the ground, I grabbed both his arms and gave a firm kick to his spine, bending his limbs back as well.</p>
<p>“Grgaaagh!”</p>
<p>“Al! You brat, how dare you—!”</p>
<p>This was becoming a bore, so I channeled my mana into a menacing aura to intimidate the rest. They were mostly midlevel adventurers or fallen knights whom Four-Eyes had hired to guard this place—brainless muscleheads with low resistance to magic.</p>
<p>I looked around, but the man I’d been following wasn’t there. He was probably reporting to Four-Eyes in his office at the far end of the second floor. I looked down at the slender man, his arms and legs snapped like twigs. Might as well use him for intimidation value. It was too late to play friendly now that I’d forced my way through the gargoyles.</p>
<p>I grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and dragged him up to the second floor, ignoring his cries of pain as he struck each step. At the end of the corridor, I came to a warded, soundproofed door. With both my hands full, I had <em>no other choice</em> but to focus all my mana into my foot and blast the door clean off its hinges.</p>
<p>“Hello, you the boss around here?” I asked the man I was ostensibly meeting for the first time.</p>
<p>Staring back at me from within the room was the calm, unreadable gaze of Four-Eyes, as well as the pale-white face of the man who had so <em>graciously</em> acted as my guide.</p>
<p>“Oh, thanks for showing me the way,” I said. “Now we’re even for <em>that little stunt</em> you pulled on me.”</p>
<p>I looked back at Four-Eyes and smiled my best, business-winning smile. Let the negotiations begin.</p>
<p>“I should let you know,” he started, “that door contained several of my finest wards. I’m at a loss for words.”</p>
<p>“Sorry about that. I had my hands full with these unruly hounds of yours. It was the only way in.”</p>
<p>“I do apologize for that. My name is Jufain Gahl. People consider me somewhat of a leader in these parts. What business might you have with me?”</p>
<p>The man who called himself Jufain Gahl did not appear to be the least bit put off by the gargoyle head or fainted bodyguard in my hands, nor the fact that I had destroyed his wards. He simply offered a gentle smile, as though it were of no consequence to him whatsoever.</p>
<p>I had suspected that this wouldn’t be enough to intimidate him, but I had hoped to get a <em>hint</em> of a reaction at the least. Frustrated, I let the items I’d been holding drop to the floor.</p>
<p>“Oh, just a little something I was hoping you might take off my hands. As for my name, I’ll tell you for fifty gold.”</p>
<p>I casually took the necklace from my pocket. When Jufain spotted it, the look in his eyes suddenly changed.</p>
<p>“…Jack. Forget what you saw here and leave.”</p>
<p>“H-huh?” The white-faced man babbled like an idiot, unable to parse the meaning in Jufain’s words.</p>
<p>“You understand well the dangers of knowing too much, Jack. Leave now, while you still can.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes, sir!” Jack shot out of the room like a bullet. After I watched him leave, I turned back to Jufain, ready to make a deal.</p>
<p>“Let’s talk business,” I resumed. “How much will you pay for this?”</p>
<p>“Do you mind if I take a closer look?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. Go ahead.” I placed the necklace on his desk. He picked it up delicately and peered at it from multiple angles, checking each stone one by one, along with the fitting that held them, and the chain that fastened it to the wearer’s body. Eventually, he placed it back on the table.</p>
<p>“Remarkable craftsmanship. Beautifully cut stones, with a mithril base and chain. The enchantments are impressive, too. Auto HP Regen, Recovery Boost, Record Illusion, and Self-Damage Repair (Poor). I could pay thirty pieces of gold for such an item.”</p>
<p>“…Thirty gold, huh?”</p>
<p>A brief interlude about currency. There were seven types of coin in circulation: copper, large copper, silver, large silver, gold, large gold, and platinum. Each coin was worth ten of the denomination below it. A single silver piece would be worth somewhere in the neighborhood of one thousand Japanese yen, though the value of goods differed from our world, so it was hard to say for sure.</p>
<p>Large-gold and platinum coins were therefore so valuable that it was rare to see them in common use, unless you were a big trading firm or national government. For personal trade, people generally stuck to gold coins and lower.</p>
<p>All this is to say that the thirty gold pieces I was being offered were the equivalent of roughly three million yen. Certainly, if you considered the necklace on its own merits and considered it a mere accessory with a few fancy enchantments, such a price was more than fair…<em>if</em> you didn’t know the full story behind it.</p>
<p>“…I don’t appreciate you playing me for a fool, even if it’s just to find out how much I know.”</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>I glared at him. This time, I didn’t allow my threatening aura to spread out in all directions, but instead, I focused it directly on the man before me.</p>
<p>“Listen. I’m here because I know you’ve got the skills I need. So let’s skip the pleasantries. Otherwise, I’ll have to kill you.”</p>
<p>Both he and I knew the score. This was no ordinary necklace. There was an engraving underneath the stones that proved that it belonged to the royal family. In accordance with an ancient oath their ancestors once swore, bestowing the mark required an offering of royal blood and validated the necklace’s authenticity while also ensuring that only the royal family could benefit from its effects.</p>
<p>This man surely knew all that, because he had sent Jack away so that the underling couldn’t screw anything up. The only reason Jufain would offer me such a low price, then, was that he was trying to gauge my reaction, see how much I knew, and then use that information to gain the upper hand in the negotiations.</p>
<p>…However, he didn’t know what this deal meant to me. It wasn’t about the money. If it was, I could sell it to anyone and have more than enough to tide me over. This was all part of my plan for revenge. I brought it here because this man could do what I needed. He could return it to its owner in the most delectable manner possible. I was here because I wanted him to serve as my messenger pigeon.</p>
<p>So, just for a second, I set free my domineering aura. One that said, <em>Don’t you dare get in my way</em>. Jufain took a single breath, which was all it took to recompose himself.</p>
<p>“I do apologize. All I need to know is that the item is indeed genuine, and I can handle that much myself. Any further information, it seems, would cost me quite dearly.”</p>
<p>He chuckled softly to himself as he removed his monocle and polished it with a small piece of cloth.</p>
<p>“Let us call it three hundred fifty pieces of gold. I can pay ten up front, but it will take me a while to prepare such a large sum. Return here tomorrow, and you shall have the rest. I will return this to you for now.”</p>
<p>“You sure? Not worried I’ll take the money and run?”</p>
<p>“If you did, then that would mean I had misjudged you. I would only have myself to blame. Here,” he said, placing a small sack of money on the table.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” I picked up the sack, opened it, and tossed one of the coins back to Jufain.</p>
<p>“Whatever might this be?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? It’s payment for all the stuff I broke. See you tomorrow.” I twisted the corners of my mouth up into a smile. “What, did you <em>misjudge</em> me after all?”</p>
<p>“…Fifty gold pieces, was it, to learn your name?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, that offer’s gone. You snooze, you lose.”</p>
<p>I returned the sack containing nine gold pieces to my pocket and left the room.</p>
<p>“…Heh-heh-heh. I never tire of this slum. You never know what’ll happen next.”</p>
<p>Jufain was left with a joyful grin on his face. Then he dispelled the disguise he had placed on the gold coin in his hand, reverting it to its original grotesque form—which wriggled and squirmed between his fingers like slime.</p>

<p class="space-break">Things had gone well, and I was heading back to the city center in good spirits. I half expected to get dragged into another fight, but I made it onto the main road out of the slums without incident. The sun was lower now, and it wouldn’t be long before it set completely. I needed to start looking for somewhere to spend the night. I was used to sleeping in wet, stagnant air, on gravel floors whose cold stones stole the heat from my body. It was no surprise that I found myself looking forward to sleeping on my first proper bed in over three months.</p>
<p>“Hold on, this isn’t going to work.”</p>
<p>A single silver coin was more than enough to secure a room for the night. Prices in general were lower compared with Japan, but the rooms were relatively small, and they didn’t serve breakfast. It was quite likely they wouldn’t be able to give me change if I tried to pay with a gold coin, and I couldn’t go to a more upscale inn where that wouldn’t be an issue because those required proof of identity.</p>
<p>Ideally, I wanted to have a good stock of large silvers, silvers, and large coppers, so I scanned my surroundings, trying to locate a money-exchange service. A decent, aboveboard one in the city center might charge less in fees, but for dealing in gold coins and above, they would likely require proof of ID, too. As a result, I looked for one in the slums, where the prices might be higher, but they would <em>conveniently</em> neglect to ask such things.</p>
<p>“That one’ll do.” I picked a place more or less at random and headed over.</p>
<p>“Hey, kid. Looking to make an exchange?” the man whispered.</p>
<p>The word <em>meathead</em> was made for this guy. Setting up a money-changing booth in the slums was just asking to be robbed, so the only people who did it either had the backing of a powerful organization or were strong enough to defend it, like he clearly was.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I need to change my gold.”</p>
<p>“Gold, huh? How many?”</p>
<p>“Just one for now. I’d like it in silvers and large coppers.”</p>
<p>The man took out a pair of scales. On one side, he placed my gold coin, and on the other, a series of small weights.</p>
<p>“Okay, looks genuine. Minus my fee, I can give you five large silvers, twenty-three silvers, and twenty large coppers.”</p>
<p>Which meant he was taking a twenty-five-silver fee.</p>
<p>“That’s expensive.”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re free to go elsewhere if you don’t like it. Doesn’t matter to me.”</p>
<p>The fee was a little high, but not outside what one might expect to find in the slums. I also needed to move on and locate an inn. As I thought silently, the man counted out the coins and placed them in a pile before me.</p>
<p>Suddenly, something felt not quite right. Was he going to attack me? No…but something fishy was going on. My hunches had served me well today. I looked more carefully, trying to discern specifically what he was trying to do. However, even now, I could discover nothing strange about him. It was easy to dismiss my feeling, but the irrational part of me still distrusted the man, and my fear was warranted when I took the coins.</p>
<p>“Ah,” I said, “I see now. Hey, you.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? What’s—? Urk!”</p>
<p>I caught the man totally off guard, grabbing him by the neck and pinning him to the back wall.</p>
<p>“You bastard…,” he struggled to say. “I gave you the coins, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>“Coins? You mean <em>these coppers</em>?”</p>
<p>“Wha—?!”</p>
<p>I channeled a bit of mana into the coins, and with a <em>pop</em>, the illusion on them disappeared, leaving nothing but dirty coppers. I’d lost my “Sense Magic” skill, as well as the soul blade that gave me a passive buff to perception skills, which meant I’d been unaware of the illusion on the coins until I actually touched them. With some stroke of luck, I noticed it in the end, but I still considered this a failure on my part.</p>
<p>“Heh. It’s eat or be eaten here in the slums! <em>Force Up</em>!”</p>
<p>Giving up the charade, the man twisted his face into a wicked smile as he cast a spell to raise his physical ability. It seemed he was more intelligence-focused than I had given him credit for.</p>
<p>“For crying out loud, why does every single person I run into have to be like this? This world sucks.”</p>
<p>It was really getting on my nerves. My good mood was spoiled, I had to look at this guy’s dumb face, but worst of all…</p>
<p class="space-break1">…was the fact that he saw me as such an easy mark.</p>
<p class="space-break1">It made me feel like nothing at all had happened in the last four years, like I was still the same naive idiot I had been the first time around—making all the same mistakes, falling for all the same tricks, and being duped by the same traitors, who even now made my heart burn with the thought of tearing them limb from limb.</p>
<p>“Argh, it makes me sick.” I squeezed the man’s neck even harder.</p>
<p>“Gaaaargh! Why won’t this thing come off?!” he cried, pulling at my arm, but I had already channeled all my mana into it. His Force Up spell wasn’t enough for him to take on a member of the royal knight order, let alone me.</p>
<p>“Gah! Grugh! Wh-why…?”</p>
<p>The man struggled to understand why his bulging muscles didn’t let him tear off my slender arm with ease. That was because most people didn’t know about the technique I used to move mana around my body.</p>
<p>“Listen, I’ve had a good day so far, so I’m willing to let you go.”</p>
<p>“Guh! Ghgh! Gegh!”</p>
<p>A smile appeared on my lips as I thought about my accomplishments today, and I released my grip. The man seemed to finally realize he had messed with someone he didn’t want to mess with.</p>
<p>“Y-you want me to apologize?” he asked, the blood gone from his face. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have done that. I’m begging you, please forgive me!”</p>
<p>“Save your apology. I need you to make up for what you did.”</p>
<p>Placing the copper coins into my pocket, I silently drew the Pyrachnid’s Claw of Kindling. It was really coming in handy today.</p>
<p>“W-wait! No!”</p>
<p>The usual punishment for counterfeiting was the loss of both hands, along with a large fine. Forging a nation’s issued currency was a big deal, after all. Without their hands, a criminal would be unable to pay back the debt incurred by the fine and left with no resort but to commit suicide or sell themselves into slavery.</p>
<p>Thinking this, the man began to scream in panic.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, this sword is way too short to cut off your hands.” I laughed, though in truth, it could do just that. “But it does have some interesting properties. Usually, it’s only useful for starting fires or cooking meat, but against certain materials, it can be oddly effective. I wonder if that’s because of the monster it came from.”</p>
<p>“H-huh?”</p>
<p>To unlock the Pyrachnid’s Claw of Kindling, I had to defeat a monster known as the Solar Spider. This creature lived within the pyroducts created by molten lava flowing beneath the surface, and contrary to its appearance, it didn’t hunt living things. Its diet consisted instead of the minerals found in those caves, and it used a special excretion called flamevenom to melt down the rocks for consumption.</p>
<p>“Let’s see, the punishment ought to fit the crime, don’t you think? So let’s see that lying mouth of yours finish every last bite,” I growled, breaking the man’s arms and legs so he couldn’t flee.</p>
<p>“Grh! Grrrghaaargh!”</p>
<p>His scream rang throughout the slum, but the man’s nightmare was only just beginning.</p>
<p>“Here’s the first one. Eat up.”</p>
<p>I grabbed a nearby piece of iron and forced it into his mouth, propping it open. Then I took one of the copper coins and placed it onto the Pyrachnid’s Claw while running my mana through the soul blade. The coin melted instantly, and I let the molten copper trickle down the blade.</p>
<p>“Graaaaaaaaghhh!”</p>
<p>The droplets gave off a dull gleam as they fell into the man’s open mouth, searing his flesh from the inside. However, he didn’t die. Flamevenom was hot, but not hot enough to melt rock. Instead, it lowered its target’s melting point until it could. The Pyrachnid’s Claw was the same. The molten copper was only about three hundred degrees Celsius. Provided I didn’t go overboard, he would survive.</p>
<p>“Here comes number two. Just forty-six more to go. It’s not so bad with your Force Up on, is it? Okay, here’s number three.”</p>
<p>Each time I dropped the liquid metal into the man’s throat, I smiled as he let out a soundless scream.</p>
<p class="space-break1">By the time the meathead money changer finished imbibing the molten coins, the surroundings were bathed in the red glow of dusk. Another hour, and the sun would dip below the horizon completely. The man had passed out after being forced to eat the last coin. Now he just twitched and spasmed at my feet.</p>
<p>He had kept Force Up going until the very end, and if I just left him there, there was always the chance, however small, that someone would show up and be kind enough to go out of their way and get him medical treatment.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I suppose it wouldn’t be very nice of me to just put him out of his misery.”</p>
<p>The man reminded me of the pain of being tricked and betrayed. However, I said I’d call it quits if he ate all the coins, and I intended to keep my promise. If I went back on my word just to satisfy my own desires, that’d make me no better than the ones who betrayed me.</p>
<p>He would be no further impediment to my plans for revenge. He had settled his debt, so anything more would no longer be for the sake of retribution. I was an avenger, not some homicidal maniac. If I started deriving pleasure from killing, then I would die before ever getting my revenge and be replaced with something else.</p>
<p>I couldn’t allow that to happen. I had sworn vengeance. It was important not to cross the line. This man was not the one who needed to face my wrath. I had a second chance to get back at those who wronged me, and I would not let it go to waste.</p>
<p>“Still, humans are tougher to kill than I expected.”</p>
<p>To be honest, I wasn’t entirely sure he was going to survive to the end, but the meathead had been tough. I thought he would perish around the twentieth molten coin or so.</p>
<p>The idea had also been to make an <em>example</em> of him and strike some fear into anyone else who might cross me. In that sense, leaving him alive could send the message that I was a little too lenient on my foes, especially here in the slums.</p>
<p>That said, I wasn’t about to waste my precious healing on him, and if the slum dwellers staring out at us from their hiding spots were to swarm his body like ants once I was gone, that was no business of mine. I forgave him because it was what I said I would do, and there was nothing more to it than that. In the end, I didn’t care if he lived or died. He was just another inhabitant of this damn world. I had no duty to help him.</p>
<p>Now that his illusion had been broken, I went to the money changer’s stores and picked out five large silvers, twenty-three silvers, and twenty large coppers, then stowed them in my purse along with the gold coins that were already there. I placed the now-bulging sack into my pocket and started walking, without the slightest concern for the man I left behind me.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Let’s see.”</p>
<p>I was at the edge of town, a couple of streets off from the city center, in a room in an inn I had picked on a whim. I bent down and placed the cases I was holding under my arms on the floor. The glass bottles inside contained a blue liquid and rattled as I set them down. On my way over, I’d visited an item shop and spent four of my large-silver coins on a couple dozen low-level MP-recovery potions.</p>
<p>“First, let’s look at my status. There’s something I want to check.”</p>
<p>There were three ways of improving your stats in this world. First, you could raise your base stats through training and exercise. Exercise increased your physical stats such as Strength, Dexterity, and Vitality, while using up all your mana every day increased your capacity for magic. However, while these increases weren’t negligible, they weren’t that high, either. Training eventually gave diminishing returns, and there were also caps depending on your race or species. The reason a dragon was so powerful even at low levels was because of their racial modifiers.</p>
<p>Second, you could gain stat modifiers through skills. Barring a few exceptions, skills came in two types: active skills, which you could perform on demand; and passive skills, which were always on. Some passive skills provided boosts to certain stats, like the uncreatively named “Strength Boost” and “Vitality Boost” skills. Besides these, “HP Recovery Boost” also increased one’s max HP, and “MP Consumption Drop” provided an additional Resistance buff.</p>
<p>Incidentally, active skills, such as Air Step and Fleet-Foot, could be activated simply by paying any HP or MP costs, and by using them repeatedly, you could increase your proficiency and level. However, you couldn’t use this same technique to train passive skills, because they couldn’t be activated. Instead, passive skills each had their own conditions that you had to meet to level them up. For example, the skill I earned today, Track Lv 2, had the condition <em>Track a target without them noticing for at least ten minutes</em>. This skill, by the way, provided a bonus Dexterity boost.</p>
<p>As for my soul blades, they could be considered to have both active and passive skills. When using them as a weapon, they had special abilities that were not unlike active skills, and like passive skills, soul blades were unlocked by performing certain feats and provided bonuses to your stats once you owned them.</p>
<p>To take my Nephrite Blade of Verdure as an example, it provided modifiers to Stamina, Vitality, and Resistance, while the Pyrachnid’s Claw of Kindling boosted Dexterity and Vitality. However, soul-blade modifiers were additive—increasing your stats by fifty, for example—while skills were multiplicative, applying a percentage increase. Therefore, as my level increased and my base stats went up, the modifiers from my passive skills would become more significant.</p>
<p>But I digress. The third way of increasing your stats was through levels. Like training, this raised your stats’ base values, but the payoff was far greater. The only way to increase your level was to amass experience, which was given from killing a “living thing or object with a will of its own,” according to the status screen. Of course, that included humans. The stronger they were, the more experience you gained.</p>
<p>There was one more part to this stat-modifier business, but it was not widely known, and those who did know had their reasons for keeping it a secret. I’ll touch on that some other time.</p>
<p>I hadn’t finished off the bodyguards in Jufain’s residence, so assuming their friends had healing potions on hand, they should still be alive. Other than that, I had killed six delinquents and two gargoyles so far.</p>
<p>“…Hmm, but I’m still level one. Why?”</p>
<p>The delinquents were one thing. Their levels were unexpectedly low, and with all my stat bonuses, I was far stronger than them. It was no surprise that they hadn’t given me enough experience to level up, but the gargoyles had higher stats than me. Why else would my unfortified punch have no effect? Something was not right here. I tapped on the word <em>Level</em>.</p>
