<p>Akane watches him go in blank amazement. After a little while, she finally realizes that he just saved her.</p>
<p>“Fancy Hoodlum Slayer… Who are you…?”</p>
<p>For some reason, his voice sounded strangely familiar.</p>

<p class="space-break0">The next day, despite her parents’ concerns, Akane heads to school like always.</p>
<p>Thinking about what happened yesterday still fills her with fear, but for some reason, remembering the Fancy Hoodlum Slayer makes her want to break out laughing.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh… He was so dorky.”</p>
<p>She walks through the gate and, as usual, runs into her least favorite classmate. “Morning, Kageno.”</p>
<p>“Morning, Nishino.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Akane is so surprised, she forgets to keep walking.</p>
<p>Minoru got her name right. And what’s more, she gets the feeling that he’s actually looking at her this time.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. There’s something about his voice.</p>
<p>“…There’s no way.”</p>
<p>She shakes her head to banish that ridiculous thought, then chases after Minoru.</p>
<p>“Kageno, wait up!”</p>
<p>She wants to give chatting with him another go.</p>
