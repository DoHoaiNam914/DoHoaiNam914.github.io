<p class="noindent">“You know, I think this is the first time you’ve failed a mission.”</p>
<p>Epsilon raises a wineglass to her lovely lips as she gazes down at the Oriana night skyline.</p>
<p>“My deepest apologies.”</p>
<p>Number 559—Victoria—stands beside her.</p>
<p>The two of them are in the Super Royal Suite at the Mitsugoshi Deluxe Hotel right beside their Oriana Kingdom branch store.</p>
<p>The room’s furnishings practically scream classy, and the window has a gorgeous view of the entire royal capital.</p>
<p>A single night there costs a million <em>zeni</em> and is restricted solely to nobles, and yet even so, it’s booked solid for the next year.</p>
<p>“I saw your report on Number 666,” Epsilon comments.</p>
<p>“She needs to be dealt with promptly.”</p>
<p>“While I agree that her actions were rash, I think it’s a bit premature to be branding her a traitor.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“Your loyalty is admirable, but you have a tendency of getting overzealous. I plan on having you stand shoulder to shoulder with the Seven Shadows someday. Don’t let me down.”</p>
<p>Number 559 squeezes her fists tight. “…Yes, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Also, the fault for the operation’s failure doesn’t fall solely on you. I didn’t warn you about Number 666’s mother, and that’s on me.”</p>
<p>“That’s—”</p>
<p>“I never imagined that Queen Reina would be at Fort First. I should never have let those two meet, and for that, I take full responsibility.”</p>
<p>“You don’t—”</p>
<p>“I was never going to lie to her, but I was hoping we could wrap things up without her having to learn the truth.” Epsilon takes a sip of her wine. “I understand Master Shadow has taken point on the matter?”</p>
<p>“That’s correct. He was furious. He said what she did was ‘unacceptable.’”</p>
<p>“Interesting. He made contact with Number 666 earlier today, you know.”</p>
<p>“Our lord works fast.”</p>
<p>“So he does. But he didn’t execute her.”</p>
<p>“He must be after something,” Number 559 surmises. “He might plan on tailing her. Or perhaps he has some even deeper reason…”</p>
<p>“I haven’t the faintest. There are some vistas only Master Shadow can see.” Epsilon shakes her head. The gesture is tinged with sadness.</p>
<p>“His must be a truly lonesome view.”</p>
<p>“Indeed it is. And in spite of that solitude, he fights more nobly than any. That’s what makes him Master Shadow.”</p>
<p>Victoria wipes the tears welling in the corner of her eye. “Master Shadow…”</p>
<p>“Whatever our lord’s plans are for Number 666, we follow his lead. The problem is that ring you saw back in the ruins.”</p>
<p>Number 559 grimaces in chagrin. “We should have retrieved it then and there.”</p>
<p>“That would have been better, yes. You made the right call, though. That ring was the key.”</p>
<p>“So, the Cult’s really after the Black Rose?”</p>
<p>“It certainly looks that way,” Epsilon replies.</p>
<p>“In that case, we need to get the ring back quickly.”</p>
<p>“We have to play it smart. If we corner them, they’re liable to use the key, and if the legends are true, that would mean the Oriana Kingdom will—”</p>
<p>“Is the Black Rose really that dangerous?”</p>
<p>“There’s an old story about how Oriana was on the verge of destruction. That is, until they used the Black Rose to kill the hundred thousand Velgaltan soldiers besieging its capital in a single night. That tale is no mere children’s story.”</p>
<p>“The power that would require…”</p>
<p>“I’ve gotten in touch with Alpha, and she’s gathering more personnel. Once we’re ready, we’ll—”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the two of them are interrupted.</p>
<p>The door swings open, revealing Cid wearing a bathrobe.</p>
<p>“Whew, that was an awesome soak. Nothing beats a private open-air bath.”</p>
<p>He plops himself down on the room’s posh sofa, looking as pleased as punch.</p>
<p>“We’ll finish this discussion later,” Epsilon says quietly. Then, she goes and scooches right next to Cid. “Would you like something to drink?” she asks him.</p>
<p>“A coffee milk would totally hit the spot, yeah.”</p>
<p>Epsilon goes and gets a bottle from the refrigerator artifact. “What about something to eat with it? I can call up room service.”</p>
<p>“I could go for a light snack, sure. Ooh, like that roast beef we had for dinner. That stuff was great.”</p>
<p>“Ah, the Mitsugoshi five-star beef? If I may, it goes quite nicely in a sandwich.”</p>
<p>“Cool, I’ll get a roast beef sandwich, then. And also a regular roast beef. Oh, and a fruit platter on the side, too.”</p>
<p>“We’ll get them sent up at once.”</p>
<p>Number 559 rings a bell and conveys the order to an employee.</p>
<p>Cid takes the milk bottle from Epsilon and takes a big swig. “Whew. Coffee milk after a warm bath, doesn’t get better than this.”</p>
<p>“Here, let me massage your shoulders,” Epsilon offers.</p>
<p>“Wow, that brings me back. Back when I lived with my folks, you used to make me tea every day while I lazed about.”</p>
<p>“It was nice, being together all the time back then.”</p>
<p>“This is paradise.” Cid closes his eyes in bliss. “And you’re sure I don’t have to pay for any of this?”</p>
<p>“Oh, of course not.”</p>
<p>“Not even the room service?”</p>
<p>“No, no, the room service is free as well.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Epsilon. You’re a lifesaver.”</p>
<p>“I—I… Y-y-you’re too kind.”</p>
<p>Epsilon hangs her head. She’s bright red from the ears down.</p>
<p>Then, Number 559 joins in on the massage-giving. “Let me get your feet.”</p>
<p>Cid relaxes with the laziest expression imaginable on his face. However, Epsilon and Number 559 know full well that this isn’t the real him.</p>
<p>The average Joe they’re looking at is nothing more than a role he plays. Shadow, the ever-dignified lord and master of the Shadow Garden, is the person he is deep down inside.</p>
<p>By habitually pretending to be a hapless background character, he’s able to move about as he pleases without anyone taking notice or suspecting a thing.</p>
<p>However, it also means he always has to be “on,” never getting so much as a moment’s rest.</p>
<p>Epsilon wants to give him a brief moment of tranquility, even if she knows it can’t last long. She nestles as close to him as she can.</p>
<p>“About the you-know-what…”</p>
<p>Despite Epsilon’s hopes, though, Cid starts talking about work. A twinge of sadness runs through her as she presses her slime against the back of his head.</p>
<p>“…it looks like I’ll be able to settle things pretty quickly.”</p>
<p>“Goodness me. It hasn’t even been a full day.”</p>
<p>“My infiltration and investigation went off without a hitch. The only thing left to do is nip the problem at its source, and the mission will be complete.”</p>
<p>“I take it you settled things with <em>her</em>, then?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. When I get involved, I get results.”</p>
<p>Epsilon blushes a little, spellbound by the confidence in his voice. “You never fail to impress, Master Shadow. In just one day, you’ve already figured out everything and found a path to the solution…”</p>
<p>“Of course. The feats I’m capable of strike fear into even the gods.”</p>
<p>“E-even the gods?!” Epsilon cries. “I had no idea you had reached such a level! Consider me in awe, my lord!”</p>
<p>“Heh. I can knock a god out with just a single finger.”</p>
<p>“A-a single finger?! That’s incredible!”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh. If I get a chance, I’ll show you some time.”</p>
<p>Epsilon’s and Number 559’s eyes sparkle.</p>
<p>That’s their Master Shadow—doing the impossible and making it look easy!</p>

<p class="space-break0">The cool morning sunlight washes over me as I make for Oriana Castle.</p>
<p>Last night, I got to stay the night at a swanky suite for free. Can I get a hell yeah?</p>
<p>The breakfast this morning was buffet-style, which was excellent, and between that, the quick soak I took, the sauna, and the massage, I can’t think of a better way to start the day.</p>
<p>I’d say that it’s nice to have friends with connections, but from what I hear, Mitsugoshi is thinking of opening a line of beauty salons catering to the wealthy. They’re probably just using me as a guinea pig.</p>
<p>Plus, they based practically all of this stuff off the stories I told them about cosmetic surgery and cosmetology. Now, they’re planning on making money hand over fist off my knowledge.</p>
<p>“It’s fine, it’s fine. I’ve got my happiness, and you can’t buy that with money.”</p>
<p>I’m not sour about it. No way. Not me.</p>
<p>Now, Epsilon’s got work this afternoon, so it looks like I’m flying solo.</p>
<p>Thanks to my investigation yesterday, I discovered that Rose is only going along with the wedding because her mom’s been taken hostage. All I have to do is save Queen Reina to snap Rose out of her funk, kill Perv, and seize the throne.</p>
<p>It’s the perfect solution. Sometimes, life throws you an easy one.</p>
<p>“First things first, let’s figure out where Queen Reina actually is…”</p>
<p>I can picture it now—the eminence in shadow swoops in, conducts a flawless rescue op from the shadows, and fuels the birth of a legendary monarch.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh…”</p>
<p>My status as Epsilon’s apprentice lets me stroll right on into the castle, and loads of people greet me as I head to the music room. My cover is that I’m heading there to tune the piano.</p>
<p>I gotta say, though, this place is seriously hardcore about their art and culture stuff. I had no idea I was gonna pull so much attention as a mere fake apprentice.</p>
<p>“Mr. Apprentice!”</p>
<p>Margaret is in front of the music room. When she spots me, she jogs over and gets right up in my personal space.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?! After yesterday, I mean.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m aces.”</p>
<p>“I was so worried for you, I couldn’t sleep last night. That rotten guard…”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha, it’s all good.”</p>
<p>“You’re not hurt, are you? I swear, if that miserable wretch harmed your fingers, I’ll make sure he never wakes up again…”</p>
<p>“I’m fine, really.”</p>
<p>“Oh, thank goodness. Your fingers are more valuable than a guard’s life, after all.”</p>
<p>“For sure, for sure.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing for you to worry about, though. The horrible guard isn’t here anymore.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“He was caught stealing food, so he got reassigned.” She grins. “I was the one who reported him!”</p>
<p>“Man, what kind of asshole goes and steals food?”</p>
<p>“All those times he gave me those creepy looks, he must’ve been looking for an opportunity to do his crimes. That’s how I knew it was him.”</p>
<p>“Wait, so you didn’t actually catch him in the act?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t, but…I knew he was the one who did it, so I got everyone together so we could get our stories straight first.”</p>
<p>“Oh, clever.”</p>
<p>“I mean, the brute ate up all the tea and pastries in Princess Rose’s room. Can you believe it?”</p>
<p>“Damn, that’s messed up.”</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Now that she mentions it, I feel like I might’ve done the exact same thing yesterday, but…nah, probably just a coincidence.</p>
<p>“I did it all for you, Mr. Apprentice. I’m not going to let anything happen to you.”</p>
<p>“Aw, thanks.”</p>
<p>“By the way…did you and Ms. Shiron not come together today?”</p>
<p><em>Thump</em>.</p>
<p>Margaret shuts the music room’s door behind us.</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>“In that case, what would you say to a meeting with Earl Parton?”</p>
<p>She closes in on me.</p>
<p>“I dunno…”</p>
<p>I deftly retreat backward. My footwork is impeccable.</p>
<p>“Why not?! And why is it I can’t reach you?! I—I—I can get you an appointment with Marquis Newwealth, too, you know!”</p>
<p>“I’m still not a proper pianist yet.”</p>
<p>“Y-you’re a fantastic pianist! Tch, you’re so fast! And it isn’t just your speed, your movements are so smooth and efficient!”</p>
<p>“Nah, I’m really not all that.”</p>
<p>“Ms. Shiron is just using you! You have all that talent, and she’s perfectly happy letting it all go to waste. Tch, you’re so far away…but a good maid never gives up!”</p>
<p>Despite being out of breath, Margaret refuses to throw in the towel.</p>
<p>“You, uh—”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, what was that about someone wasting someone’s talent?”</p>
<p>The music room door swings open. Epsilon is standing behind it.</p>
<p>Margaret’s smile stiffens for a brief moment, but she quickly recovers and curtsies to Epsilon.</p>
<p>“Why hello, Ms. Shiron. I thought you weren’t planning on arriving until this afternoon.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t, but then I got this niggling worry that someone might be bothering my adorable little apprentice and getting in the way of his work.”</p>
<p>“In that case, ma’am, I’m glad to let you know that your concerns were unfounded.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I think they were quite founded.”</p>
<p>The two of them cross their arms in sync.</p>
<p>The music room is seized by a peculiar silence.</p>
<p>“Would you mind?” Epsilon eventually says. “My apprentice and I need to get ready for work.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I’ll brew you some tea.”</p>
<p>“Are you really going to make me spell it out for you? Do you have a field of flowers growing where your brain should be or something?”</p>
<p>“If you’re in the market for flowers, might I interest you in the royal flower garden?”</p>
<p>“Listen here, you flower-brained child: You’re a nuisance. Get lost.”</p>
<p>“Eep, she’s scary! Save me, Mr. Apprentice!”</p>
<p>Margaret scuttles over behind me—</p>
<p>“Now you see who Ms. Shiron <em>really</em> is.”</p>
<p>—and whispers furtively in my ear.</p>
<p>“I can hear you, you know,” Epsilon replies.</p>
<p>“Remember, Mr. Apprentice, I’m on your side. For now, though, you’ll have to excuse me.”</p>
<p>With that, Margaret—recognizing that the tides have turned against her—beats a tactical retreat.</p>
<p>Epsilon sighs. “Her country’s on the verge of war, and she’s acting like she doesn’t have a care in the world.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, the people here hardly even seem tense.”</p>
<p>“This nation’s aristocrats despise violence and adore the arts, just as they have throughout Oriana’s history. And all because of the Black Rose…”</p>
<p>“A black rose, hmm? I’d love to see one of those.”</p>
<p>The royal garden had all sorts of roses, but no black ones.</p>
<p>“<em>Gasp!</em> You plan on actually witnessing the Black Rose?!”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>I mean, I came all this way to the Oriana Kingdom. If they’ve got cool rare black roses, I definitely want to check ’em out.</p>
<p>For some reason, Epsilon starts muttering some stuff I can’t make heads or tails of. “But… The total destruction… And it’s so dangerous… On the other hand, this is Master Shadow we’re talking about…”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Epsilon?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s nothing. If that is what you would choose, Master Shadow…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, obviously I’m gonna choose to see the black roses.”</p>
<p>She drops to a kneel. “As… As you wish, my lord!”</p>
<p>That’s Epsilon for you. She always makes a huge deal out of everything, even something as simple as going to look at a couple of flowers.</p>
<p>“By the way, do you know where Queen Reina’s room is?”</p>
<p>“The queen? Ah, so that’s your angle.” She smiles meaningfully.</p>
<p>“Yup, that’s my angle.”</p>
<p>“For the queen’s room, you’ll want to go…”</p>
<p>After she tells me where Queen Reina’s room is, I slip out of the music room. On my way there, I keep an eye out for any black roses.</p>
<div class="decoration-rw">

<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break0">I don’t end up spotting any black roses, but I find the queen’s room pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Oddly, it doesn’t look like anyone’s guarding it. I peek in the window and spot Queen Reina and Duke Perv.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>It looks like they’re talking, but something feels off.</p>
<p>“Oh, Perv… Are you sure we can’t make our love public yet?”</p>
<p>“Just a little longer, honey. We have to finish the wedding and get what we need out of Rose first.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes, it feels like you actually <em>want</em> to marry her…”</p>
<p>“No, no, honey. You’re the only one I have eyes for.”</p>
<p>“And you promise you’ll kill Rose right away so we can get married?”</p>
<p>“Of course, honey.”</p>
<p>Perv and the queen exchange a passionate kiss.</p>
<p>OH MY GOD.</p>
<p>“Honey, it’s time. Work calls.”</p>
<p>“It’s always the same with you. You say that, and then you go off to see the girl. Still, I only have to put up with it for a little longer, so I’ll be patient for you. You’ll come and visit me tonight, though, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course, honey. I’ll see you then.”</p>
<p>Queen Reina watches Perv leave the room with a great deal of reluctance.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s not good,” I mutter to myself as I quietly step away from the window.</p>
<p>Perv and Queen Reina are in cahoots.</p>
<p>In other words, saving the queen won’t accomplish squat.</p>
<p>What to do, what to do…? Wait, that’s it!</p>
<p>“I just have to tell Rose!”</p>
<p>When she finds out they’ve been pulling one over on her, flames of rage will stir up within her and rouse her to action. I’m sure of it.</p>
<p>The plan is as follows.</p>
<p>Acting as Shadow, I’ll carry Rose away tonight and take her to watch Perv and Reina’s little rendezvous.</p>
<p>“I can even say something cool like, ‘It’s time for you to see the truth.’”</p>
<p>I’ll get to be “the eminence in shadow who knows everything.”</p>
<p>When Rose finds out her mother betrayed her, her rage will rouse her into assuming her position as monarch.</p>
<p>“Then, I can say something badass like, ‘Awaken, Monarch of Demise.’ Heh-heh-heh… A perfect plan if ever I heard one.”</p>
<p>Now, all I have to do is withdraw for the time being and wait for nightfall.</p>
<p>“Oh hey, it’s Epsilon.”</p>
<p>As I kill time by searching the castle for black roses, I spot Epsilon. That’s odd; I assumed she would still be in the music room.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, it looks like she’s concealing her presence and sneaking around.</p>
<p>I conceal my presence as well and creep up behind her as she picks a door’s lock.</p>
<p>“…There, open.”</p>
<p>The moment the lock pops open, I call out to her. “Stop right there.”</p>
<p>Epsilon immediately braces for battle, but upon seeing my face, she breathes a sigh of relief. “I-impressive as always, Master Shadow… I couldn’t sense you at all. You were practically one with the air itself, like you had become the embodiment of all creation. Your technique awes me, my lord.”</p>
<p>Never change, Epsilon. Never change.</p>
<p>“What were you doing?” I ask.</p>
<p>“I, er…” She awkwardly averts her gaze. I bet she was trying to loot the place. “I can’t find the key anywhere. I assumed Duke Perv would have it, but my investigation revealed that all he had was an empty case. The problem is, I have no idea where he hid it…”</p>
<p>She couldn’t find the key, so she decided to pick the lock?</p>
<p>I guess there’s a certain kind of perverse logic to that.</p>
<p>“We need to at least find out where it is, or we won’t be able to deal with any problems that might arise.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to search for the key anymore, is there?”</p>
<p>“There isn’t? Are you sure?!” she asks. She looks shocked.</p>
<p>“Obviously.”</p>
<p>Why would you need the key when you’ve already picked the lock?</p>
<p>“You never fail to amaze, Master Shadow. I hadn’t realized things had already progressed that far… How far out would you have to have seen to be able to prepare this? Truly, your eyes must hold the spark of divinity. No, even that would fail to account for it… You are by far the noblest man in all of creation, my lord, and being able to serve you makes me the happiest person in all the world!”</p>
<p>I made the most basic observation possible, and you managed to spin it into all that? If anyone never fails to amaze, Epsilon, it’s you.</p>
<p>“So then, the preparations are all complete?” she asks.</p>
<p>“The preparations…? Of course.”</p>
<p>My preparations for tonight are flawless. I’m gonna show Rose the cold, hard truth.</p>
<p>“In that case, I’m going to head back and get ready for work.”</p>
<p>“You do that.”</p>
<p>With that, I leave Epsilon and the royal castle behind and kick up my feet at the hotel until nightfall.</p>

<p class="space-break0">Rose waits nervously for the madder-haired maid to brew her tea.</p>
<p>When she takes a sip, it fills her mouth with a delightful floral flavor.</p>
<p>“This is wonderful. Thank you, Margaret.”</p>
<p>“………”</p>
<p>Margaret doesn’t reply.</p>
<p>She gets through her work dispassionately, ignoring Rose all the while.</p>
<p>Rose stares sadly at her back. “Excuse me…Margaret?”</p>
<p>“If that’s all you need me for, I’m going to take my leave.”</p>
<p>“Um…”</p>
<p>As Rose fumbles over her words, Margaret exits the room.</p>
<p>The door clicks shut, and Rose lets out a sigh.</p>
<p>She and Margaret grew up together. She loves the way Margaret’s smile looks like a flower coming into bloom.</p>
<p>Now, though, Margaret doesn’t smile at her anymore.</p>
<p>But that’s fine.</p>
<p>Rose has decided that’s she’s going to save her mother, no matter what it takes. If nothing else, she owes it to her father.</p>
<p>The cold night wind blows through her lonely room.</p>
<p>“I could have sworn I closed the window…”</p>
<p>Could it be? Is he here again?</p>
<p>Rose’s pulse quickens. She knows she needs to stop seeing him, but she can’t help but hope anyway.</p>
<p>She calls out his name as she walks to the window. “Cid…?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, all the lights in the room go out, and a fierce presence rises up to replace them and announce the advent of someone cut from a different cloth.</p>
<p>She was wrong. It isn’t him.</p>
<p>An ebony longcoat flutters in the moonlight.</p>
<p>“Shadow… M-Master Shadow,” Rose murmurs blankly.</p>
<p>That man is like a god to the Shadow Garden. Sweat beads on her hands from the tension.</p>
<p>“Have you…come to kill me?”</p>
<p>He’s here to put down the traitor, no doubt.</p>
<p>She never imagined that he would actually be the one to do it himself.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>Rose owes the Shadow Garden a great debt. It saved her from countless crises and lifted her up when she needed it most.</p>
<p>She grieves over the fact that, inadvertent as it was, she’s repaid their goodwill with treachery.</p>
<p>However, Shadow says something wholly unexpected.</p>
<p>“It’s time for you to see the truth.”</p>
<p>His voice booms deep as he presents his hand to Rose.</p>
<p>“What truth?”</p>
<p>“Grab hold.”</p>
<p>The gleaming red eyes beneath his mask are fixed straight on her.</p>
<p>She’s unable to refuse.</p>
<div class="decoration-rw">

</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break0">Rose goes with Shadow, and he takes her to one of the castle’s balconies. The nighttime wind is chilly against her skin.</p>
<p>“Wait, this is…”</p>
<p>It’s her mother Queen Reina’s bedroom.</p>
<p>“The truth lies beyond.”</p>
<p>“Again, what truth?”</p>
<p>She doesn’t understand what he means.</p>
<p>Apprehension and anticipation well up inside her. Her eyeballs practically shake as she peers into the room.</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>What she sees inside shocks her to her core.</p>
<p>Illuminated by the dim light from the fireplace, Duke Perv and Queen Reina are locked in an embrace.</p>
<p>Rose stares at them in a petrified daze.</p>
<p>“But…why?”</p>
<p>Queen Reina isn’t resisting Duke Perv. To the contrary, she’s accepting him with open arms.</p>
<p>Rose can just barely make out their voices through the window.</p>
<p>“It won’t be long until the kingdom is ours,” the queen says.</p>
<p>“And it’s all thanks to you, honey.”</p>
<p>“All that work I put into drugging my idiot husband is finally going to pay off. He did make for a good puppet, though, I’ll give him that.”</p>
<p>“It’s a shame he got killed like that. We had so many plans for him…”</p>
<p>“See, this is why I told you we should’ve killed Rose from the get-go. Think of all the extra work we had to do once she became his successor—”</p>
<p>Rose can’t bear to listen anymore.</p>
<p>She shrinks away from the window, though she can still see them passionately making out through the curtains.</p>
<p>“This isn’t happening…”</p>
<p>She trembles from head to toe, and her vision distorts. The whole world seems to be spinning.</p>
<p>“It’s the truth.”</p>
<p>“No, it can’t be… It isn’t… My mother would never…”</p>
<p>She totters unsteadily across the balcony and leans against its guardrail.</p>
<p>“Accept what you know to be true.”</p>
<p>Shadow’s voice sounds like it’s coming from a million miles away.</p>
<p>“No… No, it isn’t…”</p>
<p>“The time has come.”</p>
<p>She can feel her consciousness slipping away.</p>
<p>“Remember what you saw. Remember what you must take.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>“The sword of rebellion must be—”</p>
<p>Amid the haze in her mind, all the pieces click into place. Now, she understands why her mother was going along with the Cult’s orders back then…and why Number 559 was trying to kill her.</p>
<p>The moment it all becomes clear to her, she collapses like a rag doll.</p>
<p>Shadow looks down at her in surprise as her honey-blond hair splays out across the balcony floor.</p>
<p>“Wait…you passed out? Right when things were getting good?”</p>
<p>Rose doesn’t reply.</p>
<p>“Hey, what’s up? You okay?”</p>
<p>He shakes her shoulders. Still nothing.</p>
<p>“The traitor is right there, though! This is your chance to kill her! I’ll even help!”</p>
<p>The wind blows, cold and lifeless.</p>
<p>Shadow tilts his head, looks up at the sky, and lets out a long, cloudy-white sigh. “Maaan… My perfect plan…”</p>
<p>He picks Rose up and, with a dejected slump of his shoulders, leaps down from the balcony.</p>

<p class="space-break0">Did she go wrong somewhere?</p>
<p>Or was everything all messed up from the very beginning?</p>
<p>Images flash back through Rose’s mind. She sees the dead faces of her father and the Oriana soldiers.</p>
<p>What is it she’s even been fighting for?</p>
<p>What was it they even died for?</p>
<p>And as for her father… Why? Just, why?</p>
<p>When Rose saw her mother kissing Perv, she felt like her entire life had been a lie.</p>
<p>When she comes to, she finds herself in her own bed, staring up at the ceiling. Her face is covered with dried tears; fresh ones flow over them and wet her cheeks once more.</p>
<p>“I want to go back…”</p>
<p>She thinks of the days she spent at the Midgar Academy for Dark Knights.</p>
<p>If only she could return to those days of blissful ignorance—those days with him.</p>
<p>“Cid…”</p>
<p>What was it she was even trying to accomplish?</p>
<p>What is it she’s been working toward?</p>
<p>Ever since she killed her father, she feels like her gears have been slowly sliding out of alignment.</p>
<p>It was for the kingdom. It was for her father. For her mother. For herself. All of that is true, and yet it all feels like lies, too.</p>
<p>She doesn’t know what’s true anymore. She doesn’t know anything. She wishes it were all just over.</p>
<p>But then, right as the despair starts sinking in…</p>
<p>…she hears a beautiful piano melody.</p>
<p>“<em>Moonlight Sonata</em>…”</p>
<p>It’s a piece she’ll never forget. She once heard Shadow himself play it underground in Midgar.</p>
<p>This time, however, the person playing <em>Moonlight Sonata</em> on the piano by the window is someone else.</p>
<p>It’s an unremarkable, dark-haired boy.</p>
<p>“Cid…?”</p>
<p>Rose wonders if she’s dreaming again.</p>
<p>She staggers over to him and reaches out to try and touch him.</p>
<p>Her hand brushes his cheek. The music stops.</p>
<p>It’s not a dream. It’s not an illusion. He’s really there.</p>
<p>“Cid…do you want to run away together?”</p>
<p>He’ll take her away from all of this. He’ll take her to some far corner of the world where nobody knows who she is, and the two of them can get married and start a happy family there.</p>
<p>Rose has killed her father. She’s been betrayed by her mother. She’s betrayed the Shadow Garden herself. She’s been forsaken by her people.</p>
<p>But him, he’s the one person who’ll never abandon her. No matter what happens, he’ll always stay by her side…or so she believes.</p>
<p>As long as she has him, she’ll be fine.</p>
<p>“Cid…”</p>
<p>Her fingertips skim his lips, and his dark eyes meet hers.</p>
<p>They’re as black as the darkest night.</p>
<p>The moonlight shines down on him as he softly speaks. “I really like this piece. It makes the world make sense.”</p>
<p>“How so…?”</p>
<p>She doesn’t understand what he’s trying to tell her.</p>
<p>“I see the world in two categories. Things that are important, and things that aren’t.”</p>
<p>“…Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I have a dream that I can’t achieve if I don’t. There’s only so many hours in a day, only so much effort a person can give. That’s why I pour all of mine into what’s important, and I cast everything else aside.”</p>
<p>Now, Rose gets it.</p>
<p>He’s saying that he’s sacrificed everything, all for her.</p>
<p>He crossed the border for her, he poured his sweat and blood into learning the piano for her, and he snuck into the castle for her.</p>
<p>His actions speak volumes.</p>
<p>However, he can’t come out and say it.</p>
<p>He doesn’t want to put that kind of pressure on Rose.</p>
<p>Tears well up in Rose’s eyes at how pure his love is.</p>
<p>“But it turns out, that’s easier said than done. There’s too much static. The world is full of it, and it covers up those important things. It’s so easy for us to lose sight of what matters.”</p>
<p>There’s a strange depth to his eyes. Rose feels almost as though she’s being sucked in.</p>
<p>“The way I see it, the world is a little too bright. It shows you all these things, but it shows you too many of them, and it makes you lose sight of what’s truly precious—just like you’re losing sight right now.”</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>Rose killed her precious father. Her precious mother stabbed her in the back.</p>
<p>What was it that really <em>was</em> precious?</p>
<p>Rose doesn’t know anymore.</p>
<p>“It’s so alarmingly easy for us to forget what our purposes in life are. So, y’know…” He looks up at the moon hanging in the night sky. “…This world is best under the moonlight. It forces us to strain our eyes, and because of that, we’re able to keep our sights fixed on what’s important. Under the moonlight, all we have to look at is what’s precious to us.”</p>
<p>His fingers shift, and he continues playing <em>Moonlight Sonata</em>.</p>
<p>The moon’s gentle light shines down upon the world, and the beautiful notes fill Rose’s ears.</p>
<p>From there, they reverberate through her body and sink deep into her heart.</p>
<p>“What is it you see, in this moonlit world?”</p>
<p>With those final words, he vanishes.</p>
<p>There’s nobody at the piano bench. It’s like he was nothing more than an illusion cast by the moon’s light.</p>
<p>“Cid…?”</p>
<p>But he was no illusion.</p>
<p>A small ring sits on the bench where he just was. It shines in the moonlight.</p>
<p>It’s a wedding ring.</p>
<p>“Cid!”</p>
<p>Rose squeezes the ring tightly against her chest.</p>
<p>It’s an artifact with an artistic design, and she can sense a bit of magic coming from it. She can barely even imagine how expensive it must have been. She can tell he put a lot of thought into choosing it.</p>
<p>He was trying to use it as a desperate attempt to convey his true, irreplaceable love…</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>She looks up at the moon.</p>
<p>“What <em>is</em> it I see…?”</p>
<p>Its light feels impossibly kind.</p>

<p class="space-break0">“I lost the ring!” I lament as I soak in the open-air bath.</p>
<p>Talk about an upset.</p>
<p>I stuck it in my pocket and forgot about it, and before I knew it, it was gone. I shoulda just pawned it as soon as I could. I wonder how much I could’ve gotten for it.</p>
<p>“Eh, oh well.”</p>
<p>Easy come, easy go.</p>
<p>I shake off the loss and look up at the night sky. Snow is starting to fall.</p>
<p>“Man, what a great bath.”</p>
<p>I did what I could to get through to Rose.</p>
<p>Nothing anyone said could’ve stopped me from working to become an eminence in shadow, so if she’s got the heart of a lion, I’m sure she’ll get back on her feet and raise the standard of rebellion.</p>
<p>The rest is up to her.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, if she <em>doesn’t</em> get back on her feet…</p>
<p>“I’d better crash the wedding.”</p>
<p>There’s no two ways about it.</p>
<p>I can be the eminence in shadow who bursts into the wedding, shoots off a couple profound quotes, and whisks the princess away.</p>
<p>“I trust the Mitsugoshi Deluxe Hotel’s special Sky Bath is to your liking?”</p>
<p>Epsilon comes in. She got me an exclusive reservation for the bath, of course.</p>
<p>“The snow adds an elegant touch.”</p>
<p>I wouldn’t know elegance from a hole in the ground, but it sounds cool to say.</p>
<p>“Shall I wash your back for you?”</p>
<p>“I already washed it, but thanks.”</p>
<p>“Ah. What a shame.”</p>
<p>Epsilon sits down next to me with a <em>sploosh</em>.</p>
<p>Seeing her fair skin sends a shiver down my spine.</p>
<p>“No…way.”</p>
<p>She’s developed her slime body to the point where it looks indistinguishable from actual skin.</p>
<p>I can’t help but take another look.</p>
<p>“Tee-hee-hee… That’s a little embarrassing, you know.”</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry.”</p>
<p>As a fellow magic aficionado, though, I can’t let her achievement go unpraised.</p>
<p>The sheer degree of fine magical control, the molding, the secondary texture adjustments… It’s amazing how far she’s pushed her work.</p>
<p>“Incredible stuff, Epsilon.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>I’ve said all that needs saying.</p>
<p>There are some things that simply don’t need to be put into words.</p>
<p>“The snow is beautiful, isn’t it?” she remarks.</p>
<p>“For sure.”</p>
<p>The two of us sit side by side and take in the snowscape.</p>
<p>I decide to make some small talk about my day. “I got caught by surprise today.”</p>
<p>“Oh my. You’re not hurt, I hope?”</p>
<p>“Nah, I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“I should have known. Even if we searched the whole world over, we would never find anyone who stood a chance against you, my lord.”</p>
<p>“If she finds the will to stand back up, I expect her to raise the standard of rebellion.”</p>
<p>“You already know how everything will play out?!”</p>
<p>“The showdown will take place at the wedding.”</p>
<p>I conjure a blade of magic and slice the moon’s reflection on the water’s surface in twain.</p>
<p>A spray of water shoots up from the impact, causing the moonlight to reflect every whichway.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“There…the lion will wake.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">I smile meaningfully. I’m sure of it. She’ll awaken, and she’ll kill that Perv guy dead.</p>
<p>Heh. That’ll be a fun shock for the guests.</p>
<p>“The showdown will be at the wedding, you say? I’ll make the necessary preparations!”</p>
<p>Epsilon hurries out of the bath.</p>
<p>What preparations does she mean? Like, making sure she has some popcorn ready?</p>
<p>“I should probably get out soon, too, huh?”</p>
<p class="space-break1">It isn’t long before the wedding day arrives.</p>
