<p>Finally, it gathers at his obsidian sword, spiraling through the air and drawing an elaborate pattern over the weapon’s blade.</p>
<p>“I AM—”</p>
<p>Shadow’s voice rumbles out deeply, and the bluish-purple magic glows ever brighter.</p>
<p>“WH-WHAT IS THAT MAGIC?! ARE YOU EVEN REALLY HU—?”</p>
<p>“—ATOMIC.”</p>
<p>With that, the bluish-purple light blots out the world.</p>

<p class="space-break0">When the light dies down, the world stands completely altered.</p>
<p>The sky is blue again, and the sun’s rays are streaming down. Rose can see her breath in the crisp, clear winter air.</p>
<p>Shadow stands at the very center of the world, raising his jet-black sword to the sky.</p>
<p>“Are you…? Are you really…?”</p>
<p>Rose starts to say something, but then goes quiet.</p>
<p>For some reason, two piano players are starting to overlap in her mind.</p>
<p>There’s no way. It simply isn’t possible. Yet she finds herself drawn to Shadow’s each and every movement all the same.</p>
<p>“So, that was Master Shadow’s plan for the Black Rose…”</p>
<p>Beta and Epsilon look up at the sky. There, they see the shattered Black Rose.</p>
<p>Not even it survived Shadow’s mighty attack.</p>
<p>As they watch, it slowly crumbles to pieces. As it does, a small mass gets sucked into it.</p>
<p>The mass is covered in blackened skin and red hair. It’s Mordred, now reduced to nothing more than a head.</p>
<p>Then…</p>
<p>“I give myself to the ebony vortex, and vanish into the world of darkness…”</p>
<p>With that, the shadowy figure dives straight into the Black Rose.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Master Shadow?”</p>
<p>The Black Rose swallows Shadow whole.</p>
<p>The girls stare up in shock—</p>
<p>“I-I-I’m coming, too!”</p>
<p>—and Beta, tears in her eyes, dives in as well.</p>
<p>Not a moment later, the Black Rose disappears, gone from the world for good.</p>
<p>Everything is dead silent for a little while.</p>
<p>Epsilon mutters a sort of strange incantation to herself as she stares at the sky. “…I-I’m sure Master Shadow had some grand design in mind. Of course he did. His resourcefulness lets him see through everything. His eyes are like those of a god. His radiant gaze burns incandescent, and his jet-black blade cleaves the skies and parts the seas…”</p>
<p>“Oh no, my ring…”</p>
<p>For some reason, Rose’s wedding ring lies shattered as well.</p>
<p>Rose takes that as a sign of what’s become of her beloved. The blood drains from her face.</p>
<p>And with that, the battle for the Oriana Kingdom comes to a close.</p>
