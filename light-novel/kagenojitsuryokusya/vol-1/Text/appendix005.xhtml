<p class="noindent1"><strong>By Beta</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">To lurk in the darkness and hunt down shadows. That’s the path Master Shadow has chosen. That’s why the fruits of his labor will stay hidden in the shadows and forgotten without recognition.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what evil he slays, how many things he protects, or if he saves the world—no one will praise him. This is the path Master Shadow has chosen.</p>
<p>Which is why I’ll write about his battles, his beliefs, his journey…in hopes that the world will someday acknowledge and reward him.</p>
<p class="space-break1">When Master Shadow was a child, he learned the truth about the Cult of Diablos and trained for years to defeat the powerful enemy himself. After training endlessly, he finally acquired great power and shadow intelligence.</p>
<p>But I wonder how much he had to sacrifice in return. To lose one’s childhood dreams and happy future. To throw away friends and family and lovers and everything else. It must have been a hellish road to travel… He sacrificed his happiness to save others. That’s how Master Shadow saved me. He’s given those of us who were shunned for being possessed, who were left to die on the edge of hopelessness, a new lease on life.</p>
<p>We decided to fight the Cult of Diablos and want to do <a id="page-245"></a>anything we can to assist Master Shadow. We believe that the downfall of this cult will grant him true happiness…</p>
<p class="space-break1">[Contents Omitted]</p>
<p class="space-break1">And now, I will relate two of Master Shadow’s earliest battles.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The first incident happened when a member of the royal family was kidnapped by the wicked Cult of Diablos to resurrect the power of Diablos the demon. The victim was a beautiful princess with silver hair and a cry <img alt="image" src="../Images/Art_1.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle;"/> and then Master Shadow came to the rescue of the princess!</p>
<p>He gallantly appeared on the scene right when the beautiful princess was in danger and slayed the Cult’s assassin, Zenon. Even though the man was the greatest fencing instructor in the country, he couldn’t lay a hand on Master Shadow. That’s the extent of our leader’s frightening power.</p>
<p>Master Shadow brought out the greatest esoteric technique to exterminate that numbskull Zenon. That one strike colored the sky, blew away the rain clouds, and Master Shadow’s almighty majesty was shown to the entire world!</p>
<p class="space-break1">The second incident was when Lutheran, a former member of the Rounds in the Cult of Diablos, foolishly attacked <a id="page-246"></a>Master Shadow’s school. Lutheran used an artifact to seal the magic of all his students, but that would obviously <em>never</em> stop Master Shadow! While the students were taken hostage, Master Shadow plucked off the terrorists from the shadows, one by one.</p>
<p>Using his shadow wisdom, Master Shadow had no trouble freeing the magic sealed in the artifact. I bet Lutheran tipped his hat to him for that heroic deed. They say it’s not his overwhelming might that makes him scary—but his brain. After freeing the hostages, Master Shadow ambushed the ringleader of the operation who tried to flee and destroyed his sinister ambitions. And he bore the burden of Lutheran’s sins, choosing to save a girl on his own…</p>
<p class="space-break1">All right…that’s where I’ll leave off for Volume 1. There aren’t enough pages to describe his splendid battles.</p>
<p>But rest assured, I promise to log two more in Volume 2.</p>
<p class="space-break1">In the next installment, we’ll discover if a guard to the sanctuary actually dares to block Master Shadow!</p>
<p>Upon sneaking into a sanctuary to unravel the mystery of Diablos the demon, Aurora the Calamity Witch appears before him. As they proceed through the sanctuary together, there’s someone blocking their path: the hero who fought the <a id="page-247"></a>demon in the past! What might await them at the end of their battle?!</p>
<p class="space-break1">And we’ll also uncover what malice lurks around the Bushin Festival!</p>
<p>Master Shadow takes the stage at the Bushin Festival as he hides his true identity. What could his motives be…? Will Master Shadow clash with the Cult of Diablos as he pulls the strings behind the scenes?! And at the end of his fight, what will he think? …Who will he rescue?!</p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="font1"><strong>A must-see for die-hard Master Shadow fans!! Bear witness to this spectacular double feature of his outstanding feats!!</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><strong>And stay tuned for the complete version of the <em>Chronicles of Master Shadow</em> in Volume 2!!</strong></span></p>
