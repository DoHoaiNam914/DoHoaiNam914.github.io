      "description": "An ordinary kid by the name of Aikawa Kanami winds up in a fantasy world operated by RPG video game rules—but this isn’t good news. He awakes in the bowels of a gargantuan death trap called the Dungeon. Narrowly escaping thanks to his grit, cunning, and newfound arsenal of magic spells and skills, he wants nothing more than to get back home to Earth and the invalid sister who needs him. His only lead? It’s said that whoever makes it to the hundredth and final level can have any wish granted. In his desperation, Kanami cooks up the most efficient means of clearing the Dungeon and lies his way into a partnership of expediency with an aspiring swordfighter who’s rubbish with the blade but unbelievably skilled at magic. Kanami’s cool determination, however, is soon put to the test when he and his new comrade are faced with a surprise boss fight. How far will he go in order to emerge victorious? Find out in the first volume of this beloved, long-running series!",

He has a Dungeon to clear, and if finding Alty a young girl in love is what it takes to advance, then so be it. Meanwhile, during his misadventures, Kanami encounters a cast of colorful characters, including the slave girl Maria and the enigmatic powerhouse Lastiara, who quickly become his comrades in arms. They begin making progress in the Dungeon, soon reaching undiscovered territory together! The Seven Celestial Knights, however, are all too quick to get in the way. They’re hellbent on recovering Lastiara, who’s fled their stifling clutches. Now Kanami finds himself having to duel them, but can he beat the elite?

So too does his mind—and his memories of his comrades, now in the hour of their direst need. Palinchron used his mental magic to rewrite both Kanami’s and Maria’s memories to a narrative that suited his own agenda. They now think of him as the man who saved their lives.
