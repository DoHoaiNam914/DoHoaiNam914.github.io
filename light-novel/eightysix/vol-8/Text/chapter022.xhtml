<p><a id="page-256"></a>If there was a god, it would likely look upon the world with that sort of gaze.</p>
<p>Before their very eyes, the Musukura suddenly opened it mouth, revealing a shining, crystal-like protrusion. Some part of Lena’s paralyzed mind barely realized that this was the organ that had fired off that laser that scorched the sky earlier.</p>
<p>And then the Musukura howled.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><img alt="image" class="miii" src="../Images/P256.jpg"/></p>
<p class="space-break1">Its howl was a high-frequency screech that made the Stella Maris’s hull shiver. It hit them at a frequency just barely audible to the human ear. It was less of a sound and more of a shock wave.</p>
<p>It said nothing. The leviathans weren’t capable of human speech, and it was unknown if they had a form of language that they used among themselves. But even without words, the warning in its voice was clear.</p>
<p>Lena’s body and mind were frozen with instinctual, primal terror. Humans were a race of powerless creatures that crawled along the earth. They had no business facing such a force of nature, an absolute tyrant of the natural world. Just one of them was all it took to completely break through the murder machines that human knowledge had produced.</p>
<p>Closing its mouth with the same suddenness with which it had opened it, the Musukura turned around. This truly gigantic creature moved with a confidence and pride that showed it feared no one and saw nothing as worthy of its unbelievable length of over three hundred meters. Its head sank beneath the waves up to its snout, but until it swam into the horizon and completely disappeared, not a single human in the area was capable of moving.</p>
<p class="space-break2">Shrinking in place and breathing as little as possible, they passed the time like small animals waiting for a storm to pass. The first to breathe out and start moving was Shin…though it wasn’t a voluntary <a id="page-257"></a>movement. He’d turned down medical treatment to come to the bridge, and it appeared that this effort had finally pushed him over the limit. He crumpled to the floor.</p>
<p>“Shin?!” Lena hurried over to him.</p>
<p>Vika, who had loaned him a shoulder, knelt down to help him but didn’t approach him anymore.</p>
<p>“My God, man… This is why I told you not to push yourself…!”</p>
<p>“Your return left me without a task, so I brought you along like you asked…,” Vika said. “But it’s all right now. Go back and let the doctors take care of you. Marcel, lend us a hand.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I will. Once the fighting’s over. Hang in there a little longer.”</p>
<p>He looked away from Lena, who seemed to be on the verge of tears. Ignoring Vika’s sigh and Marcel, who looked up at the ceiling, Shin properly fixed his RAID Device. It had been removed from him during the treatment, and he’d only crudely put it on along the way here.</p>
<p>Of course, the targets he was Resonating with were…</p>
<p>“Kurena, Theo. I’m sorry I made you worry. The rest are still being retrieved, so I haven’t checked yet, but—”</p>
<p>He could hear Kurena take a long, sharp breath. She then let it out in one long gasp, as if holding back tears.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“………! Shin…!”</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Um, they picked me up, too. I’m still alive, for what it’s worth.”</strong></span> Raiden’s voice joined the Resonance from the operation room or a hospital room. <span class="special"><strong>“Anju and Dustin got picked up together.”</strong></span></p>
<p>The only one who said nothing was Theo. Wiping her tears away, Lena spoke.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Theo. You saved us. If you hadn’t destroyed the railgun, we’d have all been done for.”</p>
<p>Still, no reply. But just as Shin became suspicious, finally…</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“That’s…great, Lena. Shin, Raiden, you too… Thank God… Thank God you’re…safe.”</strong></span></p>
<p>His voice was off. Like he was stifling something. Like he was enduring something…like pain.</p>
<p>“…Theo?”</p>
<p><a id="page-258"></a>Shin’s voice unintentionally tensed up. <em>He’s injured.</em> Shin felt the tension wring his throat. Theo’s voice just now. It was subdued, strained, and unnaturally, frighteningly calm. Something in his tone felt almost…resigned.</p>
<p>He wasn’t just bearing the pain of an injury.</p>
<p>Shin spat out the question, as if coughing it out.</p>
<p>“Are you hurt…? If you can’t come back on your own, we can—”</p>
<p class="space-break2">Theo cut him off. He probably didn’t have much longer to talk. The stimulus was so intense that his senses went numb, and now he couldn’t feel anything. But once his senses returned, he likely wouldn’t be able to speak.</p>
<p>“Yeah… Sorry.”</p>
<p>The 155 mm shell fired the same time he did, at the very last moment. It was a buckshot. Maybe it didn’t have time to properly set up the fuse, but it passed by Laughing Fox’s flank and then self-destructed. It wasn’t a direct hit. It only burst and scattered, and most of the fragments hit the cannon’s rear.</p>
<p>Except…</p>
<p>Sitting on the ruins of the Denebola, the long-distance cruiser that had stalled the Noctiluca, was Laughing Fox. Sitting inside its cockpit, Theo looked at his injury. One normally wouldn’t be able to see anything in the interior of the dark cockpit, but Laughing Fox was damaged, exposing its cockpit block.</p>
<p>The shell fragments that rushed it from behind tore cleanly through both of the unit’s left legs, the armor frame, and some of the cockpit.</p>
<p>From within that gaping hole in the Juggernaut’s frame, Theo could see the color blue. The cerulean skies. The ultramarine sea. Despite its ruined state, the long-distance cruiser’s deck was still high above sea level, so he had an unimpeded view of the sea to the distance—to the open sea’s blue waters, the very color that one naturally associated with the ocean.</p>
<p>Above the water’s level was a place no one could live. No human, <a id="page-259"></a>animal, bird, or insect could survive despite the clear air. With the storm gone, the sky was bright and free of clouds—a vast azure expanse. The horizon stood as if dividing the sky and the ocean. Below it were the waters of the open sea, and above it was the sun, its light glittering along the edges of the waves, granting the ocean a sparkling glow.</p>
<p>It felt like one of them was a mirror of the other. Perhaps they were both mirrors, imposed against each other. Their respective shades of blue spanned as far as the eye could see; both were alight, and they each contained in their womb a vast blackness that would remain forever impenetrable.</p>
<p>The blue was only the thin veneer hanging over everlasting darkness. The surface layer of a bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>So why, oh why, was it so painfully, breathtakingly beautiful…?</p>
<p>Theo never did like the battlefield. He never liked fighting. In the Eighty-Sixth Sector, he was forced to fight as a drone’s component and ordered to go to his death at the very end. Theo resented it to this very moment.</p>
<p>He never wanted to fight; this was simply the only path that had ever been put before him. The only way to survive, to hold on to his pride.</p>
<p>And despite that…</p>
<p><em>Why</em><em>…?</em></p>
<p>…tears spilled from his eyes.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“I can’t…fight with you anymore.”</p>
<p>The shell’s fragments had peppered him from behind, ripping through the sturdy cockpit with intense force. Most of the fragments and their impact hit the cannon’s rear. But the shock wave did penetrate it, shredding the interior and its parts, scattering them into the open air.</p>
<p>And one of them passed through his now-missing left hand…tearing it between the elbow and the wrist.</p>
