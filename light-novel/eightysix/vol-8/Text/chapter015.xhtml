<p><a id="page-187"></a><a id="page-188"></a>It might struggle to operate properly on land, but if it could encroach as far as the shores… That alone was dangerous enough.</p>
<p>“Stella Maris to all units. I hereby designate this new threat the Electromagnetic Gunboat type: Noctiluca.”</p>
<p>This ocean was the territory of the Open Sea clans. Even if this operation would take away the Orphan Fleet’s and the clans’ pride, these were still their waters. These useless pieces of scrap metal had no right to swim through them like they owned the place.</p>
<p>“It is to be treated as a sentient being. We will sink it here and now!”</p>
<p class="space-break2">Suddenly, one more target was added to his Resonance.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“—Your Highness!”</strong></span></p>
<p>One of Vika’s eyes twitched. Zashya. His lieutenant, whom he’d left behind to handle land combat. Unlike her usual bumbling demeanor, when she was on the battlefield, she proved to be quite talented… And she had decided to contact him at a time like this.</p>
<p>“<em>It’s out</em>, is it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The Legion’s ground units are beginning their offensive, and we’ve confirmed the enemy’s gotten reinforcements.”</p>
<p>She then paused for a second, her voice thick with horror.</p>
<p>“The Phönix… They’ve mass-produced the Phönix…”</p>

<p class="space-break">A rain of fire engulfed the Fleet Countries’ boggy battleground. The artillery Juggernauts that stayed behind to reinforce the defensive line with mobile defense pelted the battlefield with 88 mm incendiary bombs.</p>
<p>This wasn’t ordinary ammunition, be it for a tank turret or a gun. Napalm fire was considered largely ineffective against armored weapons. This applied for drones like the Legion as well. Despite that, firebombs kept falling down like rain, spreading fire about the battlefield.</p>
<p>The Eintagsfliege’s brittle wings were weak to flames. They ignited <a id="page-189"></a>easily, losing their capacity to deflect light rays, revealing the units they hid.</p>
<p>And so they showed themselves, shaking the silver, snow-like flakes off them. Nimble limbs that invoked the image of a feline. Silver armor that intersected like a bird’s wings. A pair of high-frequency blades extending from their backs, like a lizard’s spikes.</p>
<p>They revealed themselves, one after another, each of them assuming that detestable form.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“It’s just like Lena said,”</strong></span> admitted Michihi.</p>
<p>“Yeah. ‘They might introduce a mass-produced High Mobility type’… I didn’t think it’d actually be true,” Rito replied.</p>
<p>They were both on the same defensive line, but they were each taking cover in different pillboxes and communicating via the Para-RAID.</p>
<p>The mass-produced model’s fuselage was a bit larger than the one they saw before. It retained the liquid armor it had in the United Kingdom but still didn’t have any firearms to speak of. Its only fixed armaments were the multijointed, highly flexible arms and the high-frequency blades at their tips. Apparently, the chain blade had been omitted, as controlling it was apparently too complicated…</p>
<p>It seemed the Legion decided that any overly complicated features were unnecessary for the mass-produced models. Or maybe there was another reason. The chain blade was meant to swiftly destroy opponents during surprise attacks. But just like firearms, that was deemed to be <em>incompatible with the mass-produced models’ purpose</em>.</p>
<p>“And Lena was right about something else. Its objective really is <em>headhunting</em>, from the looks of it… Though I don’t know how she could figure that out without seeing it.”</p>
<p>Rito couldn’t help but groan. Headhunting. By taking in the brain structures of the war dead, the Legion broke the chains of their programmed life span and improved their features. Headhunting was when the Legion hunted down humans to gain more efficient central processors. It was a common occurrence in the Federacy, the United Kingdom, and most markedly in the Eighty-Sixth Sector. An act of brutality by the mechanical ghosts.</p>
<p><a id="page-190"></a>Behind the ranks of the Phönix stood rows of Tausendfüßler—Recovery Transport types. This type of Legion rarely appeared on the front lines. But since the Phönix lacked a manipulator, the Tausendfüßler were likely present to pick up the heads they left in their wake or drag away anyone they captured alive.</p>
<p>Brain tissue was exceptionally easy to damage, and depending on the temperature, it could decay to the point of being unusable in as little as half a day. As such, the Legion needed to recover bodies quickly.</p>
<p>Rito furrowed his brow unpleasantly.</p>
<p>“…I guess we didn’t give her enough credit.”</p>
<p>Firebombs were an unconventional weapon, both for howitzers and Feldreß. Their flames rapidly tore off the Phönix’s optical camouflage. The fact that they were able to rain such an unconventional weapon on the Legion was because they were prepared for this. Their queen had suspected the possibility of a mass-produced Phönix being introduced and had prepared the battlefield with measures to deal with it. Rito didn’t imagine they would burn off the butterflies that hid them that easily.</p>
<p>“…All right, then.”</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“They’re coming.”</strong></span></p>
<p>The Phönix bent their bodies, like a flock of bizarre animals, and lunged forward in the next moment. As if to meet their challenge, the Reginleifs the two of them led descended upon the burning battlefield.</p>

<p class="space-break">In the distance, a familiar scene unfolded. As the glow of optical sensors illuminated the mothership’s enormous gun barrel, several units charged toward the floating fortress.</p>

<p class="space-break">Shin realized it at once. It didn’t appear on the radar and even fooled the optical sensor. But his ability had always heard the ghosts’ incessant wailing, warning him of their appearance and position.</p>
<p><a id="page-191"></a>“All units, be on guard! Hostiles approaching with optical camouflage! They’re likely Phönix units!”</p>
<p>With the gentle flapping of butterfly wings and refraction of light, something climbed up the outer walls of the Spire. Like a bird of prey swooping up to catch their mark, they vertically raced up the scaffolding. The external panels smashed and fell over, as if marking their trajectory. There were four of them in number.</p>
<p>The Juggernauts along their presumed trajectory turned around, opening fire as soon as they passed. Their 88 mm tank turrets smashed through the panels, followed by barrages of machine-gun and buckshot-cannon fire.</p>
<p>Theo didn’t help intercept them. By the time he heard the warning, the shadows had already reached as high as Level Carla. The Juggernauts previously used their wire anchors to evacuate down to Level Bertha, and now that choice worked against them. As impressive as the enemy’s mobility might have been, they were still sprinting vertically in defiance of gravity. Trying to evade at a time like this would be difficult.</p>
<p>The barrages successfully gunned down three Phönix, but one had broken through. The one that got away left the Juggernauts behind, sprinting farther up. Its aim was…</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Shin again? These things have the biggest crush on you, man!”</strong></span> Raiden remarked.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’d be a good match for anyone <em>that</em> clingy!” Shin quipped back.</p>
<p>Even as they joked, Undertaker and Wehrwolf were on guard. They were on Carla Three, which was currently the highest floor of the Spire, preparing to bombard the enemy as soon as it passed.</p>
<p>The enemy was still invisible, but the wailings told Shin where it was. He hopped away to dodge. Even a Reginleif couldn’t immediately jump up again, and as Undertaker tried to reel itself farther up to the ceiling, it approached him…</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>“…You really thought we wouldn’t predict that?”</p>
<p>Some 88 mm canister shells soared up above him, bursting and <a id="page-192"></a>unleashing a buckshot that rained down on the fortress. As soon as she’d heard Shin announce the Phönix’s arrival and received Vika’s report, Lena had the artillery unit fire a barrage.</p>
<p>Yes, from the start, Lena had included the artillery unit specifically as a countermeasure for the Phönix. The leviathan’s and the Morpho’s bombardment had blown off most of the roof above them, allowing the rain of metal to shower down on the room unimpeded and tear through the Eintagsfliege’s camouflage.</p>
<p>The silver shards crumbled away, revealing the rippling silver armor underneath. The moment it became visible, Wehrwolf bombarded it from the flank, tearing into it and the Eintagsfliege with 40 mm autocannon shells.</p>
<p>The silvery shadow came undone, revealing the nimble form of an animal. Liquid armor like the plumage of a bird, and a pair of high-frequency blades like a lizard’s spikes or a bat’s wings. Right now, it was helplessly being mowed down by the autocannon fire, but…</p>
<p><em>…It really is a Phönix.</em></p>
<p>However, another silver beast was crouched behind it, letting out an artificial howl unlike anything Shin had heard before. It rose to its feet, its optical sensor shining like an azure flame.</p>
<p>“What…?!”</p>
<p>As one unintelligible mechanical howl trickled out, another unit appeared behind it. Shin couldn’t detect Legion that were in a state of stasis until they reactivated.</p>
<p>The Phönix’s winglike back-mounted blades screeched as they swung through the air with incandescent heat. Using the first unit to shield itself from the autocannon’s shells, the second unit lunged forward, utilizing its fallen consort for footing.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Expecting Raiden’s covering fire, Undertaker moved in pursuit of the target, but it couldn’t avoid collision. Bone-like ivory and flowing, liquid silver clashed. Two armored weapons met in frontal collision. As this lethal exchange took place, Theo looked up from Level Bertha. The moment they intersected, Shin twisted Undertaker’s body, protecting <a id="page-193"></a>his cockpit block from the Phönix’s blade while driving his own high-frequency blade into it.</p>
<p>This didn’t dampen his inertia, though. The force of the collision blew Undertaker away. The Phönix grappled with Undertaker, which still had its blade driven into it. Sooner than Undertaker could purge the blade, the liquid armor self-destructed in close range, sending Undertaker plummeting out of the fortress.</p>
<p>It was like an act of revenge—a vicious reversal of how Undertaker slew the original Phönix by knocking it down into a lava pool in the Dragon Fang Mountain base.</p>
<p>Undertaker’s snapped high-frequency blade let out a shrill buzz as it flew through the air.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“…!”</strong></span></p>
<p>Even still, Undertaker barely managed to kick away the Phönix—or rather, its remains—and fired both its anchors to the left and right, coiling them through the broken external panels and around the scaffolding.</p>
<p>But then, right below them, the Noctiluca’s bow-side railgun fired. An 800 mm shell just barely skimmed one of Level Carla’s pillars before flying off into the distance. But that single brush of the shell shook the scaffolding like a tremor. The wire missed, leaving Undertaker to fall powerlessly down, as if echoing the way the Phönix plummeted into that lava pit.</p>
<p>The tremor caused it to miss its shot, and it fell, following a shower of steel beams and shattered panels…</p>
<p>“Shin…”</p>
<p class="space-break1">The Personal Mark of the headless skeleton carrying a shovel sank all too quickly into the depths.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The Para-RAID cut off. Just like it did when those connected to the Resonance went unconscious…or died. The incessant screams of the Legion, which were always mixed into the Resonance whenever Shin was connected, also ceased—leaving a cruel, thundering silence in their absence.</p>
