<p>“A bluff…?!” She swallowed nervously.</p>
<p>She wouldn’t dodge in time. Time screeched to a halt as she expected the impact to come, instinctually shrinking in place.</p>
<p>But the next moment…</p>
<p>…an 88 mm tank shell’s roar boomed through the area as it struck the revolving autocannon’s flank. The autocannon burst into flames, going out of commission. The next moment, the Morpho purged the cannon, like an insect cutting off its own leg. The autocannon fell loudly to the ground, leaving behind a trail of black smoke.</p>
<p>The one who shot it was…Undertaker. Shin.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“You all right, Kurena?”</strong></span> came the familiar voice.</p>
<p>Kurena sighed in relief.</p>
<p><em>What the hell</em><em>…?</em></p>
<p>Tears of relief welled up in her eyes. Yes, she’d be fine. Come what may, things would always work out, just like they did this time. Her Reaper would never…ever abandon her.</p>
<p>So she would be fine.</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p class="space-break2">Shin breathed out in relief as he confirmed he had successfully covered for Gunslinger, who had fallen for the Morpho’s blatant bluff. The wails his ability perceived weren’t physical sound. Unlike radar detection, it couldn’t be shared through data link with the others. At this point, this limitation struck him as irritating.</p>
<p>Even if he could detect the Legion’s positions and the timing of their attacks, that wasn’t enough to save everyone. It frustrated him greatly.</p>
<p>It was the same as the matter with Frederica. He didn’t want to rely on miracles, and he didn’t want to sacrifice her. But at the same time, he didn’t want any choice he made to result in the deaths of those he held dear.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to take the Eighty-Six’s deaths for granted.</p>
<p>He realized how absurd of a demand he was making. In a way, he <a id="page-168"></a>was wishing for a miracle that would fix everything more than anyone else. But he didn’t want to give up and resign himself. If there was any chance of taking a road that would result in no one being sacrificed, he wanted to choose it.</p>
<p>Because, after all…they’d already left the Eighty-Sixth Sector.</p>
<p class="space-break2">After a frustratingly long amount of time, Vika finally reported that he’d completed his analysis. Each Juggernaut’s respective position within the Mirage Spire was transmitted to the integrated bridge’s holo-screen through the data link. After regarding Vika’s report with a glance, Lena nodded.</p>
<p>“Vika, I momentarily leave command over the fire-restriction and area-suppression units in your hands.”</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Roger that. All aforementioned units, adjust your sights according to the instructions I just sent you.”</strong></span></p>
<p>“Shin, Yuuto, keep command of your vanguards as is. I leave the timing for when to charge to you.”</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Roger.”</strong></span></p>
<p>“Artillery squadron, reload and change ammunition over to antipersonnel buckshot shells.”</p>
<p>Those were brought in addition to the incendiary bombs, due to the possibility the Reginleifs, with their fire-sensitive aluminum-alloy armor, might end up in melee battle.</p>
<p>Finally, Lena turned her eyes to the commander of the Orphan Fleet, which wasn’t under her jurisdiction.</p>
<p>“Captain Ishmael.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we’re ready.”</p>
<p>Shin and Yuuto reported they were all in position. Gazing up at the image of the Mirage Spire on the holo-screen, Lena took one deep breath and transmitted two words to everyone.</p>
<p>“Commence operation.”</p>

</div>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-169"></a>While it might have been able to change out a worn-out barrel quickly enough, the Morpho didn’t have time to replace a broken one. And so it hadn’t been able to eliminate the enemy unit yet. All its sensors—with the exception of its antiair radar—as well as its three sets of twenty-four revolving autocannons, were aimed downward.</p>
<p>It directed the Biene and Eintagsfliege under its command while firing barrages of continual gunfire at the enemy, when suddenly, its sensors picked up on a sound whirring through the roar of its rapidly revolving autocannons. Faint noise that it should not have been able to hear.</p>
<p>With the exception of the Ameise, the Legion’s sensors were relatively low-performance. The Morpho was no exception. In contrast to its overwhelming firepower, its sensors were quite weak. The sounds of the battle taking place beneath it pretty much blinded out its auditory sensors.</p>
<p>And yet it could just barely make out the sound of a howl in the distance.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break">Lena’s dignified voice rose as she gazed into the model of the Mirage Spire on the holo-screen.</p>
<p>“All Juggernaut units, evacuate!”</p>
<p>“Fire!” Ishmael ordered.</p>
<p>At that order, the Stella Maris’s main turrets, a set of four 40 cm guns, fired. Shells that would eviscerate anyone they landed in the vicinity of took to the air, shaking up the deck. The roar reached the artillery Juggernauts, which were situated nearby.</p>
<p>The shells flew from the direction of the Stella Maris’s bow, above the Mirage Spire. Traveling at eight hundred meters per second, they rapidly soared above the tower, where their timed fuses triggered. The shells’ exteriors were blown off, the explosion unleashing small depth charges, which were meant for hunting gigantic scaled sea creatures. Though their size was relative, each one was up to a dozen meters long. The depth charges dug into Level Dora’s external panels and then burst, <a id="page-170"></a>unleashing a wave that spanned over a large area and effortlessly smashed everything in its way.</p>
<p>“—They might be able to block 88 mm shells, but not 40 cm explosives. And…”</p>
<p>As the panels shattered to pieces, the destructive wave rushed into the tower’s interior. The panels that blocked the base like a dragon’s scale flew inside, along with the destructive gale that crushed them. And with the panels gone, the violent winds of the storm also blew in.</p>
<p>With the powerful wind coming from the outside all at once, the internal pressure of the Mirage Spire suddenly spiked.</p>
<p>“The wind pressure of this storm can blow everything from the inside out!”</p>
<p>The wind pressure sought an exit, and the next moment, an intense force struck the exterior panels that were still intact on Level Dora from the inside, sending them all away with the force of an explosion!</p>
<p>Blue shards rained around the Spire, falling down into the water. The intense wind blew through Level Dora, which now stood exposed to the elements, blowing upward… The Eintagsfliege’s brittle wings lacked the power to resist this powerful gale. The Eintagsfliege contained high energy reserves, but their mass was small. The beam particles they unleashed lost to the wind, which tore their wings away.</p>
<p>And as if waiting for that momentary gap…!</p>
<p>“Artillery squadron, open fire!”</p>
<p>Sitting upon the Stella Maris’s deck, the artillery Reginleif squadron fired a volley of missiles. Canister shots containing antipersonnel buckshot whizzed into the exposed Level Dora or drew an arc and soared to the top of the tower, approaching the Morpho from both below and above. Bursting in midair, the buckshot fell like hail and formed a shower of metal as a flock of spears soared to the heavens, both of them striking Level Erze.</p>
<p>The canopy above the Morpho protected its large turret from being damaged, but each level of the Spire’s scaffoldings was built identically, so as to not impede the autocannons’ line of fire. The 40 mm rounds could cross through their gaps, and so the smaller antipersonnel buckshot shells could get through them like raindrops.</p>
<p><a id="page-171"></a>However, these shells couldn’t penetrate an armored infantry’s reinforced exoskeleton and were ineffective against the Reginleif’s minimal Feldreß armor. They couldn’t hope to damage the Morpho’s thick armor module.</p>
<p>But they could hurt unarmored targets that weren’t protected in order to make sure they remained lightweight. Like the brittle Eintagsfliege. As they sat trapped within the cage of steel beams, the intense gale of wind having blown off their wings and legs, the Eintagsfliege lost their capacity to hang on to the Legion unit standing above them. As they, along with the Eintagsfliege swarming along the top floor’s underside, were blown away by the wind and pelted by the buckshot rounds, more Eintagsfliege fluttered down from above to block their consort from taking damage.</p>
<p>Countless Biene and sixteen revolving autocannons hidden by optical camouflage were exposed at long last.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><strong>“Fire-restriction and area-suppression units, adjust your sights!”</strong></span></p>
<p>Next up, Vika gave his orders. After the bombardment, they would need to progress the operation from both inside and outside the Spire. Lena alone couldn’t command both forces, so she gave orders to the groups within the fortress, while he directed the ones on the outside. Reginleifs equipped with autocannons, buckshot guns, or multi-rocket launchers each scattered to their respective attack ranges, their sights fixed on the silver wings fluttering in the stormy wind. At the edge of their line of fire, several Biene revealed themselves.</p>
<p>In order to produce heat rays capable of penetrating a Juggernaut, they would require large reserves of energy. But being among the smallest of the Legion’s armaments, the Biene possessed low energy reserves. They couldn’t fire for prolonged periods of time without replenishing their power.</p>
<p>There was no sign of them using disposable energy packs. In which case, they got their energy from an external source—the base itself. The Juggernauts couldn’t see it, but they probably had some kind of wired connection, or maybe they only connected to it when firing. Either way, it seemed that while their firing positions may have seemed random, they were limited.</p>
<p><a id="page-172"></a>This was a conclusion they had reached through Chaika’s analysis. The Biene’s firing positions were far greater than their numbers, which meant that while they didn’t have to be in any one spot to fire, they always had to occupy at least one of the firing spots to shoot their heat rays.</p>
<p>And so each of those firing points’ positions had been distributed between the Juggernauts. Points along the metal beams’ fulcrums, which no longer had any optical or electronic camouflage, as well as the gun barrels set against the pillars, where the Biene stood, were now stripped of their camouflage.</p>
<p>True to the etymology of their names, they were like wingless bees. Six-legged machines, with the metallic color typical of the Legion. In place of a stinger, their abdomens contained mechanisms for firing out heat rays and blue, gleaming optical sensors. A pair of their legs and their insect-like stingers were attached to the fulcrums or pillars, inserted deep into holes set into them to recharge.</p>
<p>These were the firing points’ fixtures—in other words, the power sockets that provided them energy from the base.</p>
<p>Their legs served as terminals that were inserted into the fixture, meaning the Biene couldn’t immediately flee if they were to be attacked while firing. They were small and lightweight, which meant they were more susceptible to the powerful winds. The fact that these Biene were plugged into the fixtures and motionless when the wind blew in effectively saved them.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Fire!”</strong></span></p>
<p>The 40 mm autocannons and the 88 mm buckshot cannons attacked as one, also firing the heavy machine guns mounted onto their grappling arms. All those weapons howled and roared in a chorus that rattled the Mirage Spire.</p>
<p class="space-break2">Lying in anticipation of an opportune moment, Undertaker watched as the Eintagsfliege’s optical camouflage came undone. The silver butterflies’ wings were torn off and blown away, exposing the gun mount arms that held three sets of twenty-four autocannons.</p>
<p>Seeing there were no Biene where the sights had been aimed, the <a id="page-173"></a>fire-restriction Juggernauts rapidly switched their targets. First, they shot two that had extended to shoot. Next, all the Juggernauts equipped for long-distance sniping, including Gunslinger, blew away eight of them hidden in the grid.</p>
<p>High-explosive projectiles burst, and buckshot and machine-gun rounds flew through the air, bringing fire to their targets. The Biene went up in induced explosions.</p>
<p>The entirety of Level Dora flickered red and black with fire, blocking off the Morpho’s sensors. Undertaker sprinted through the rolling flames, making its way up to face it. Two of the fourth level’s floors were missing, so it kicked against the walls, attaching its anchor to the beams’ fulcrums to reel itself up at once.</p>
<p>Reaching the underbelly of the top floor, which was like a grid or a cage, it tore its way through with its high-frequency blade, finally reaching the top floor.</p>
<p>It could hear two booming howls, the roars of the two ghosts. They both came from within the Morpho. One was likely the Morpho’s central processor, and the other was likely a sub-processor, meant to control the revolving autocannons. Those were added after last year’s defeat, due to the Morpho’s increased importance.</p>
<p>Replaying their final moments like broken music boxes, they chanted their malice and hatred again and again.</p>
<p><em>Heil dem Reich. Heil dem Reich. Heil dem Reich. Heil dem Reich…</em></p>
<p>Just as Ernst had predicted and Zelene had said, these were remnants of someone from the old Imperial faction.</p>
<p>As Shin cut his way through and jumped up, he approached the Morpho’s position. The Morpho’s thirty-meter-long barrel couldn’t shoot at this range, even if it hadn’t been damaged. Shin was firmly within the long-distance cannon’s blind spot. Behind the turret were its two cooling wings, turned toward the sky as they crumbled. Undoing the conduction wires it employed for melee combat, it swung their taloned ends down at Undertaker.</p>
<p>The Morpho was much less proficient at melee combat, and this was its last resort. But this was something Shin had already witnessed last <a id="page-174"></a>year. The wings lost their shape, but even so, the conduction wire spread out, rising into the air. It still had some distance from Undertaker. But before it could close it, the artillery’s incendiary bombs landed.</p>
<p>The fire the bombs spewed burned the wires, rendering them powerless. They lost their conductivity, falling down only to be mowed down by Undertaker’s blade. Undertaker then hopped over behind the Morpho’s turret, landing on the maintenance hatch between the Morpho’s first pair of wings.</p>
<p>One year ago, this was where the first Morpho’s central processor, Frederica’s knight, was hidden. And just like back then, the Morpho thrashed like a centipede burning in acid, trying to shake Undertaker off.</p>
<p>Calling up his armament options, Shin selected the 57 mm armor-piercing pile bunkers, triggering all four of them at once. The tremors made his unit’s sights fix on the enemy’s fuselage. Withstanding the shaking that almost made him bite his tongue, he once again switched his armaments, this time selecting the 88 mm tank turret.</p>
<p>He pulled the trigger.</p>
<p class="space-break2">The Morpho reeled back for a moment like it was screaming, then stiffened for a moment. It rotated its broken turret backward, as if attempting to bash Undertaker with it.</p>
<p>“Tch…”</p>
<p>Shin avoided it, purging the piles. With the Juggernaut being as light as it was, a sweeping blow from the heavy turret could be fatal. Shin hopped off the Morpho’s back, avoiding the grid-like floor and firing his anchor into Dora Three’s wall.</p>
<p><em>…I missed.</em></p>
<p>Apparently, he’d destroyed the sub-processor that controlled the autocannons on the gun mount arm. It seemed they’d switched the processor’s position since last year. Looking up, he saw the Morpho regarding him haughtily. It had lost all its armaments and been deprived of all the consort units that guarded it. But even still, it packed the sheer might and dignity that came with possessing the largest turret of any Legion unit.</p>
<p><a id="page-175"></a>Behind it, Shin saw a blue sky. The storm had passed. The swirling winds and the gray curtain that had embroiled the Spire so far hadn’t completely faded away, but the shrill howling of the wind had grown calmer. The clouds had become thin enough that one could see that dawn had broken as they fought.</p>
<p>The Morpho rose with that sky as its backdrop. Liquid metal spewed out from the exterior of its broken barrel, like cold vapor. The wind died down. Apparently, the wind up high was powerful. Little by little, the black clouds began swirling more slowly, dispersing as they lost the force that held them in place. The curtain of the clouds fell, exposing the blue skies as if dramatically marking the shifting of a scene.</p>
<p>A vivid azure sky shone through those clouds, lighting up the leaden sea.</p>
<p class="space-break3">But then those blue skies darkened.</p>
<p class="space-break3">“…?!”</p>
<p>As Raiden looked up, darkness settled over his field of vision, and he reflexively squeezed his eyes shut. That darkness was in fact a <em>bright, blinding light</em>. It was bright enough to make optical screens momentarily go down from the overload—an amount of light radiation so vast, the support computer couldn’t keep producing corrections.</p>
<p>An intense glare burned through the sky, its sheer brightness obscuring one’s vision more intensely than darkness ever could. It moved at the literal speed of light and produced no sound. Following the terrifyingly long yet instantaneous flash of white darkness and silence, the light was gone. His optical screen flickered back to life and displayed his environment with corrections, but everything still seemed a bit darker than it was a moment ago.</p>
<p>The sky appeared as if the bright, summer sun was shining over it, like the filtered light of a daydream. But as he looked up at the azure sky in a daze, Raiden couldn’t help but feel like something was terribly wrong.</p>
<p><a id="page-176"></a>The storm had blotted out the sky until just moment ago, but now that it had subsided, the fragmented firmament visible through the Spire’s scaffolding felt darker than it should be… Yes, the scaffolding. The layered mesh that blocked his field of vision.</p>
<p class="space-break1">A mirage had settled over the top of this steel fortress. The entirety of Level Erze…had been burned to a crisp.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“…What—?”</p>
<p>And at the heart of Level Erze sat a crumbled mass, lacking the awe and menacing aura it had exuded not seconds ago.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“The Morpho… It’s…”</strong></span> Someone gasped.</p>
<p>Its barrel had melted away like charred candy, and its ballistic responsive armor had fallen off and liquified so thoroughly that it couldn’t activate anymore, exposing the armor plates beneath. The coating on it had evaporated, its once silver, metallic luster now a bleached white.</p>
<p>Since the metal that composed its body was thick, it hadn’t completely melted over despite the intense heat. But lying between the beams that now looked like the planks of some dead, malformed tree, the Morpho was still. The light in its optical sensor blinked out, and its footing had visibly collapsed.</p>
<p>They couldn’t hear its wailing anymore.</p>
<p>After a moment of stunned silence, the words finally left Raiden’s lips.</p>
<p>“What…the hell was that…?”</p>
<p class="space-break2">It took only a moment… No more than a single moment…</p>
<p>In that one moment, the Morpho had been destroyed, crushed like an insect. The sight of it left Lena speechless.</p>
<p>“What…?” Ishmael gasped.</p>
<p>He shivered, as if he’d just witnessed some kind of mythical creature.</p>
<p>“Musukura…!”</p>
<p>His emerald eyes were fixed on the top of the screen, on the ocean <a id="page-177"></a>in the distance where that blast of blinding light had come from. Lena looked at him questioningly, and he continued, though she couldn’t tell if he was answering her question or simply muttering to himself in shock.</p>
<p>“The largest species of leviathan out there… It uses that laser to shoot down fighter and bomber planes. Even the Legion can’t take a Musukura head-on. It’s a monster, no doubt about it.”</p>
<p>“A leviathan…did this?”</p>
<p>The rulers of the ocean, which reigned over the depths of the open seas, far beyond the reach of humanity. The species that had forbidden humankind from leaving the continent for thousands of years.</p>
<p>They were territorial creatures. Perhaps they even had the concept of a domain, because they abhorred the idea of anyone intruding on the area they reigned upon, the open seas. Any intruder was removed with lethal force, and all who approached were threatened away. Be they human or Legion.</p>
<p>This fortress was just barely outside the deep-blue open seas that were their territory. Neither the Spire nor the Orphan Fleet encroached on their domain, but there was intense combat taking place near the border. These moody creatures likely found it extremely disconcerting.</p>
<p>Ishmael gritted his teeth as he looked to the horizon they lurked in. The dragon-slaying Fleet Countries’ navy. True to their title of dragon slayers, they had made it their goal to govern the seas, but they had eventually failed to do so. The Open Sea clans suffered thousands of years of defeat, of anger and regret, which were now reflected in his glare.</p>
<p>“…To the very end, we could never beat them.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“The sonar…still can’t spot it. But it’s close by. It came because it thought its territory was being intruded on. The storm’s gone… And the moment the fog cleared…”</p>
<p>Lena thought back to the middle of the mission. A heavy fog had settled over the sea. It was believed to be a secondary effect of the underwater volcano that served as the Mirage Spire’s energy source leaking heat onto the water.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the case. The Legion intentionally used the volcano <a id="page-178"></a>to produce that fog, hiding behind it like a shield. Water could disperse that laser, and so long as that heavy fog hung over the Spire, the Musukura couldn’t attack them.</p>
<p>Without that, nothing would stop the leviathans from attacking this Spire. It stood at the heart of the sea, visible from great distances, where a linear laser could shoot it from a distance. Without that fog, they could never maintain an artillery position in a place like this.</p>
<p>But with the storm subsiding, the blades of the wind blew the mist away…</p>
<p>“They…they were waiting for the storm to end, too.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">As they stood planted in place, shocked by the unexpected sight before their eyes, a few moments of stupefied silence passed by. But Theo soon came to his senses, his face pale with dread.</p>
<p>“…Shin?!”</p>
<p>Undertaker… It was locked in melee combat with the Morpho and close to Level Erze at the moment the attack was fired. Where was Shin? Theo looked around the top floor, but there was no sign of the Reginleif’s white form.</p>
<p>He felt his panic grow deeper. In cases where a comrade’s survival was unclear, the Eighty-Six always checked the Sensory Resonance. The Para-RAID shared their senses, and should one side go unconscious or die, their Resonance would cut off. Seeing if someone was still connected would allow one to confirm if they were at least conscious, but Theo was too rattled to remember to check it.</p>
<p>In fact, he was so shaken up, it was almost strange.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“—If I hadn’t come down from there, I’d have been caught up in the attack. That was close.”</strong></span></p>
<p>And that was why, when he heard that serene—if slightly shaken—voice through the Resonance, Theo sighed with relief. His tone almost sounded cheeky to Theo’s nerve-racked mind. With heavy footsteps, Undertaker landed on Dora One, the floor Raiden and Theo were on.</p>
<p>The moment the laser had fired, he’d reflexively descended to Dora Two, and Laughing Fox happened to miss him.</p>
<p><a id="page-179"></a>“Come on, don’t pull stunts like that… I thought my blood was gonna freeze solid…”</p>
<p>Despite his words of complaint, Theo was overcome with relief. By now, it felt like something that bordered on religious faith. It was fine. Shin wouldn’t die like that. He wouldn’t die like the captain did…</p>
<p class="space-break2">Lena informed him of the reason behind that beam of light via Para-RAID: a leviathan. An attack fired by the greatest species of leviathan, the Musukura.</p>
<p>“So that’s a leviathan…”</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“That’s one hell of a monster… Is this thing for real…?”</strong></span></p>
<p>It was their first time seeing that threat, and it had exceeded their every expectation. Even the Eighty-Six couldn’t help but be stricken with terror and awe. They turned their gazes, at once, to the waters that the beam of light had come from.</p>
<p>Beyond the horizon, at a distance the Juggernaut’s optical sensor—which couldn’t quite perceive the full force of the stars in the sky—couldn’t accurately see. There, an unknown, unseen <em>something</em> eyed them with malice. It was the something that was capable of shooting that burning beam across the sky.</p>
<p>Consciously breathing out, Shin regarded the wreckage of the Morpho above him with a glance. The burned surface was discolored, but the ocean breeze was already causing it to cool down. At this point, it was nothing more than a pile of scrap, the heat haze that hung over it now gone.</p>
<p>There was no voice. It was something he’d experienced enough times to grow used to it after seven years on the battlefield. The silence unique to a “dead” weapon.</p>
<p><em>Extracting its central processor is…probably going to be difficult when it’s this burned. Not much we can do about that, though.</em></p>
<p>“Railgun type: Morpho, confirmed silenced and downed. I hereby conclude that our primary objective is complete… Let’s get out of here.”</p>
<p>“You should hurry,” Yuuto whispered, his voice filled with unusual <a id="page-180"></a>loathing. “We’re up against an animal here. We don’t know what might inspire it to attack again.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded.</p>
<p>But then…</p>

</div>
<p class="space-break">…silver particles flaked off like snow, seeping from the center of the Mirage Spire’s celestial peak. They dripped down to the dark surface of the water. Like moonlight diffusing against a drizzle, like sand trickling down an hourglass.</p>
<p>Those were silver butterflies. A flock of Liquid Micromachines that made up a Legion’s central processor, having splintered off from the whole. Just as the Phönix’s processor would turn to butterflies each time it was driven to near destruction, these liquid silver figures now fluttered through the air.</p>
<p>Flocking together, their voice once again began to echo. <em>Heil dem Reich. Heil dem Reich.</em> Just before the laser hit them, they fled to the skies, hiding among the Eintagsfliege.</p>
<p>“The Morpho…”</p>
<p>Or rather, its central processor.</p>
<p>Shin’s gaze jumped as the howl resumed and the butterflies folded their wings to attain dynamic lift. They plummeted through the stitches in the Mirage Spire’s steel scaffolding like miniature comets. Their <a id="page-181"></a>trajectory drawing a gentle helix due to the air resistance, they converged at the end of their downward spiral, melting together to form a singular argent droplet.</p>
<p>Like a water drop hitting the lake’s surface, they left a splashing crown as they sank into the ocean.</p>
<p>The comet had plummeted down in under a second.</p>
<p>“It fell into the water. Did it crash…? No.”</p>
<p>Right below them, at the bottom of the ocean the comet had fallen into, a rumbling howl began to rise. The other Processors who were connected to Shin via the Para-RAID could hear it through the Resonance.</p>
<p>The agonized thoughts of a mechanical ghost’s final moments. Of someone who had died on a battlefield and been denied a grave, only to be taken away. The copy of their neural network had been assimilated by a Legion unit, which now shouted out their lingering regrets without pause.</p>
<p>A gigantic, metallic shadow rose from the depths. The sharp tips of two lances parted the water’s surface. A large, elongated something, spanning thirty meters, pointing up to the zenith—directly to Dora Three, where the Juggernauts were situated.</p>
<p>The Liquid Micromachine silvery butterflies. The Morpho’s central processor. The voice he heard as the thirty-meter long, dual-speared barrel climbed halfway up the Spire.</p>
<p>It was…</p>
<p>“All units, evacuate Level Dora! Get down, it’s gonna shoot!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">And the next moment, <em>the railgun</em> howled.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The shell flew toward its target at a speed too great to perceive with the naked eye. The electrical discharge blitzed through the water like a fissure. Like a comet soaring upward, from the ocean up to the heavens, the diagonal shot pierced Level Dora.</p>
<p>An 800 mm caliber shell, its impressive mass traveling with an initial velocity of eight thousand meters per second. And there was nothing to curb that speed. It had fired at point-blank range, with none of its kinetic <a id="page-182"></a>energy consumed. All the steel beams in the shot’s way snapped like twigs, reduced to fragments as they left the fortress along with the shell. The beams supporting the walls lost most of their scaffolding, falling apart and plummeting down as well as they lost their fulcrums…descending like an avalanche on the Juggernauts, which escaped at the last second and dispersed down to Level Carla and farther down to Level Bertha.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“…!”</strong></span></p>
<p>The Juggernauts curled up, hiding next to what pillars remained intact as they waited for the lethal avalanche to end. They heard the scaffolding plummet down with an ominous whistling of the wind before it splashed loudly into the ocean.</p>
<p>Anyone with leeway went down to Level Bertha. They scattered without regard for squadron or platoon, prioritizing getting as far as possible from one another to find cover. This was a judgment call that saved everyone present.</p>
<p>In a battlefield raining with explosives shells that had a wide blast radius, crowding together would only mean annihilation. In a battle where a moment’s hesitation could mean the difference between life and death, questioning any warning, no matter how baffling, could result in fatal time loss. This was a lesson the Eighty-Sixth Sector had taught the Processors all too well.</p>
<p>At times of crisis, they knew to scatter, abide by warnings first, and ask questions later.</p>
<p>This unconscious habit ended up saving their lives.</p>
<p>Enemy units continued surfacing from the water. Thundering howls filled the Sensory Resonance, rattling Shin’s skull.</p>
<p>And…</p>

<p class="space-break">…a warship’s bladelike bow finally emerged from out of the waves. Its ascent was so rapid that it had burst out of the water diagonally, its hulking mass towering over the Juggernauts standing several dozen meters above ground level. The bottom of the hull had been exposed to the air, revealing countless folded legs. On both sides near the hull were four optical sensors, glinting blue as they observed the enemy.</p>
<p>A massive vessel that likely weighed over a thousand tonnes crashed down onto the water’s surface with a thundering thud, raising a massive splashing pillar of water in its wake. It was twice the size of the Stella Maris. The armor of its deck and broadside glinted with a dull metallic sheen. The barrels of 40 mm antiaircraft revolving autocannons shone menacingly, situated on the center of the deck and broadside, with a few of them set on the vessel’s stern.</p>
<p>On both sides of the ship were 155 mm rapid-fire railguns. The antiaircraft guns and the cannons were lying over one another in a staircase pattern, so as to secure each other’s lines of fire.</p>
<p>And at the heart of this fortress built of countless cannons and guns lording over all like a castle keep were <em>a pair</em> of turrets. Thirty-meter-long spear-like barrels extended from both of them. A mass so large that even looking at it from above confused one’s sense of perspective.</p>
<p>800 mm caliber railguns.</p>
<p><em>Two</em> of them.</p>
<p>Perhaps to secure their respective lines of fire, the stern-side turret was set higher than the one on the bow, granting this unit’s guns a nearly fifteen-meter height that exceeded the Morpho. The height from the <a id="page-184"></a>ocean’s surface to the deck was in fact shorter than the Stella Maris’s, but the height to the top of the bridge far exceeded it.</p>
<p>Someone gasped. With terror. With shock.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“What…</strong></span><span class="special"><strong><em>is</em></strong></span> <span class="special"><strong>that…?!”</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“It can’t be…</strong></span> <span class="special"><strong><em>This whole ship</em></strong></span> <span class="special"><strong>is a Legion…?!”</strong></span></p>
<p>As torrents of seawater spilled from the deck, silver threads extended from the railguns’ turrets. Within seconds, they came to form wing veins, assuming the shape of butterfly wings. They began shining with a faint, phosphorescent aura as they flapped, as if to blot out the heavens.</p>
<p>Radiation cords deployed. The railguns were operational and combat ready.</p>
<p>And having shown off its full majesty, the dead spirit that possessed the massive warship’s Liquid Micromachine central processor raised its voice in a battle cry. A newborn’s shriek. A death throe.</p>

<p class="space-break2"><span class="special"><strong>“U-ugh…!”</strong></span></p>
<p>Lena could hear groans of suppressed pain from both the Sensory Resonance and the radio, which was crackling with static noise. She wasn’t sure if this was the person’s actual voice, or if the thundering scream was loud enough to actually be heard clearly by everyone connected through the Resonance.</p>
<p>If the others were affected that badly by it, how terrible must it have <a id="page-185"></a>been for Shin, with his ability? Lena plugged her ears, the pain hanging heavy in her heart, as if the sound were physical pressure.</p>
<p>She couldn’t make out what the scream was saying. She could tell there were words within that bellow, but she couldn’t discern their meaning. It was like multiple voices coming from different people all spoke at once, from the same set of vocal cords and mouth. It wasn’t a human voice. It was like several brains had been cut up and stitched back together at random, forming a gruesome amalgamation that had been haphazardly dumped back into the cranium.</p>
<p>Like a mixed chorus formed by the consciousness, personality, and ego of several dead people mashed together.</p>
<p>“What is this…?!”</p>
<p class="space-break2">The technology of the Para-RAID was unfamiliar enough to Ishmael. Now he was exposed to bloodcurdling madness that made even the Eighty-Six, who were accustomed to this, reel in agony. He reflexively tore off the RAID Device and looked up at the integrated bridge’s optical screen as his blood pressure climbed back up and the vertigo passed.</p>
<p>“A battleship…! No…”</p>
<p>No. This wasn’t something as simple as a battleship. Two 800 mm railguns stood imposingly in the center of its deck, aiming diagonally at the heavens. Add to that the twenty-two 155 mm rapid-fire railguns and the fifty-something antiair electromagnetic autocannons.</p>
<p>Its every cannon and armament was equipped with a spear-shaped rail. Both their firepower and their range were greater than ordinary artillery.</p>
<p>Even a single railgun could drive a small country to the brink of ruin. Just one had the firepower to bring the Fleet Countries to their knees.</p>
<p>And worst of all, they saw the bottom of its gigantic hull when it surfaced. This thing had <em>legs</em>. It didn’t just swim. It could walk along the seafloor or on land. In other words, it was likely amphibious.</p>
