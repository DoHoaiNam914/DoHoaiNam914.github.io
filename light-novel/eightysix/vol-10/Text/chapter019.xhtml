<p class="noindent">“—Good work out there, <em>Vice Captain</em> Nouzen.”</p>
<p>Having stopped his Juggernaut at its designated spot at the hangar, Shin heard a voice call out to him. Turning around, he found himself faced with a blond young man with stiff hair, who greeted him with a smile.</p>
<p>“Captain Nunat.”</p>
<p>“Call me Eijyu… Heh, I keep telling you that, but you never listen. You’re stubborn.”</p>
<p>Laughing loudly, this squad captain, Captain Eijyu Nunat, approached Shin. He stood a head taller than him and had cheerful red eyes.</p>
<p>“You really gave them hell out there today. Thanks to you, both me and the rest of the squad were saved.”</p>
<p>“I just told you how the enemy’s going to move.”</p>
<p>“That’s more than enough. Just the fact that they can’t take us by surprise is a lot.”</p>
<p>With that said, Eijyu’s smile deepened. His crimson eyes—the color of the setting sun—were the shade unique to the Spinel.</p>
<p>“You did good by telling me about it. We’d have figured it out eventually when we Resonated with you, but it still took courage to step up and say it. Thank you.”</p>
<p>He believed him.</p>
<p>“…No.” Shin shook his head.</p>
<p>It really wasn’t anything major. Like Eijyu just said, everyone would have found out when they Resonated with him enough times.</p>
<p>“Just take the compliment,” Eijyu said, cracking an ironic smile. “What, are you the type that gets antsy when someone thanks or praises them?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p><em>This isn’t about “antsy.”</em></p>
<p>This wasn’t anything to be thankful about, so it didn’t feel right when people did thank him. Seeing that Shin was adamant about not meeting his gaze, Eijyu deepened his ironic smile as he changed the subject.</p>
<p>“…Speaking of, it’s almost a year since you’ve been sent into the battlefield, right?”</p>
<p>Shin looked at him blankly, unsure as to what he was getting at. This prompted Eijyu to laugh, having apparently achieved his desired result.</p>
<p>“Then it’s about time you think of a Personal Name, isn’t it? And a Personal Mark! You’ve got to come up with those. And you know what? I’ll think of one for you!”</p>
<p>“…Oh…”</p>
<p>Contrary to Eijyu, who was exceedingly excited about this even though this wasn’t about him at all, Shin let out this disinterested utterance.</p>
<p>Processors who survived over a year in the battlefield changed the call signs they used during operations. They went from a call sign consisting of their platoon number and a number to a unique Personal Name. Accordingly, their unit was emblazoned not with their call sign but a Personal Mark.</p>
<p>This was a custom here in the Eighty-Sixth Sector, since most Eighty-Six tended to die within their first year of service. Of course, it wasn’t registered in the Republic’s official documents, but it was tolerated for the most part. Both the Handlers and their superior officers cared little for whatever customs these pigs in human form had.</p>
<p>“Have you thought of something? Like, you know, something that feels right as a name?”</p>
<p>“It’s all just signifiers for the sake of identification. Be it names or call signs or internment numbers,” Shin said, almost huffing the words out in displeasure.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Eijyu narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>“Do you hate your name, Shin?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>For a moment, a voice and a pair of eyes surfaced in his mind in vivid clarity.</p>
<p><em>Shin. Sin. It’s your fault. It’s all your fault.</em></p>
<p>“…Not really,” he said, his voice cracking a bit.</p>
<p>He could tell that his words didn’t give a very confident impression, so Shin lowered his gaze. He could just barely hear the sound of his fists clenching and his nails digging into his skin. Eijyu seemed to pretend to not have noticed that.</p>
<p>“Well, if you don’t have any preferences, I’ll come up with something. Lemme think…” He paused for thought and then raised his index finger, indicating that he’d struck on an idea. “How about Báleygr? It’s a god’s pseudonym. A god of war who guides an army of dead warriors and has burning eyes. It fits you like a glove. You’re as strong as a god or a monster, and you have that promise you told me about…and you’ve got pretty red eyes, after all.”</p>
<p>As Shin stared at him, Eijyu grinned again boastfully. Like he’d just pulled a successful prank on a younger brother. Shin flusteredly averted his gaze. He couldn’t wish for someone to treat him like this. It always reminded him of a person he mustn’t remember. Even though he couldn’t recall his face, or smile, or really anything about him anymore.</p>
<p>“…It doesn’t suit me.”</p>
<p>“You think? I mean, if you’re gonna have a Personal Name, you might as well have a cool one. After all”—Eijyu shrugged as Shin raised his eyes to look at him again—“it’s as you said. It’s just a signifier for identification. It’s a game of pretend that’s only good for making you feel better.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">Watching his short vice captain leave the hangar, Eijyu turned his eyes to the head of the maintenance team, who stood a short distance away.</p>
<p>“We’ll be giving you more work, though, Head Mechanic Seiya.”</p>
<p>“Maintenance and repair are our responsibilities, so it’s not like I mind… But, Eijyu—”</p>
<p>The two of them were in the same school as kids. Seiya directed his bitter gaze at him from afar. He had gold hair that bordered on silver, and faint-violet eyes, the symbol of the bloodline of an immigrant from their northern neighbor.</p>
<p>“—I’m surprised you care so much for that creepy kid.”</p>
<p>“Did something happen?” Eijyu asked.</p>
<p>“How many died today? Ever since he showed up?”</p>
<p>“Oh…” Eijyu sighed.</p>
<p>That again.</p>
<p>Shin joined this squadron two months ago and immediately became vice captain. The chain of command in the Eighty-Sixth Sector was decided only by one’s martial prowess, and there were already eerie rumors going around about this red-eyed boy.</p>
<p>“It’s probably not his fault.” Eijyu wrote Seiya’s suggestion off.</p>
<p>“I dunno about that. There’s that thing with him…and they say that of all the squadrons he’s been in, he’s always the last one alive.”</p>
<p>Eijyu frowned. He knew this best friend of his wasn’t a bad guy, but there was a pretty big gap between how he treated those he considered friends and how he treated everyone else. He cared for his friends a great deal, which made him adamantly reject anything that might hurt them. Eijyu knew this, but…</p>
<p>“Well, that part’s probably true. That boy, he…”</p>
<p>Eijyu moved his eyes in the direction of the barracks, where Shin’s room was behind the hangar’s wall. Shin spent the majority of his free time alone in that room. Eijyu never saw him chat with other kids his age.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t call people by their names. He has that promise of his, so I don’t think he doesn’t want to remember…but he probably wants to keep some distance from people.”</p>
<p>Between himself and these soldiers who are destined to die. This was an attitude all Name Bearers—Eighty-Six who had lived long enough to earn a Personal Mark—adopted at one point or another. Even Eijyu knew how that felt.</p>
<p>Because the more attached you are to someone, the more it hurts when you lose them.</p>
<p>Name Bearers like Eijyu have lost more people than their heart can possibly take. Every year, new Processors enlist to this battlefield, and only one in a thousand of them survives. But that’s exactly why—</p>
<p>“That’s not his fault.”</p>
<p>The Eighty-Six die. Anyone and everyone can die in the Eighty-Sixth Sector, much too easily and without a hint of fanfare. And no one in particular is to blame for that.</p>
<p>“Eijyu—”</p>
<p>“Cassandra was a prophet of ruin whose prophecies were all true. But that didn’t mean…”</p>
<p>…that one had to see the prophet as the cause for the catastrophe they foresaw. Cataclysms can be inevitable, but human society has a tendency to look for a factor they can blame.</p>
<p>Just like how the Republic pinned the blame for their defeat in the war on the Eighty-Six and cast them out into the battlefield.</p>
<p>“Even though Cassandra never wanted those catastrophes to come, much less beckoned them.”</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a002">2</h1>
<p class="noindent">“…That’s what Eijyu says. But what are you, really? A prophet or a plague-bringer?”</p>
<p>Shin had beaten the former vice captain down, despite him being both older and physically larger than him. No one could match him when it came to fighting the Legion. But on the other hand, he had a tendency to push his Juggernaut way over the limits of its performance. This meant he was also at the top of his squad when it came to exhausting and damaging his rig.</p>
<p>He’d break his Juggernaut in spectacular fashion on every single mission, and recently, the repairs hadn’t been able to keep with the rate he wrecked units. The only solution was to set aside a spare specifically for him and constantly alternate between it and his main unit.</p>
<p>And yet somehow, he was never majorly injured. Seiya stared into his pale face, wondering if there was even blood pumping through his veins, as Shin looked back at him. His crimson gaze was bereft of emotion in a way the eyes of a boy in his early teens shouldn’t be.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“What did you just say?”</p>
<p>“Cassandra herself couldn’t tell, either. How am I supposed to know if what I see is an avoidable future or if I’m just imagining catastrophes and willing them into existence?”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t tell if he was a god of pestilence, either.</p>
<p>“…You—” Seiya growled in an animalistic way, narrowing his faint-violet eyes.</p>
<p>“I just don’t want to die. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have told the captain or anyone else about this… It’s not that I like being called a haunted monster.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Shin spoke with an unfeeling voice, without a hint of enthusiasm or hatred. Unsure of how to interpret Shin’s words, Seiya fell silent for a moment. Shin looked down at his Juggernaut, which had all its parts exchanged and had a new suspension system installed, and said:</p>
<p>“Can I make a request, Head Mechanic?”</p>
<p>Seiya cocked an eyebrow. He was both surprised and suspicious. Shin knew he hated him, and he never spoke to him about anything except things relating to his job. And now he was asking for something?</p>
<p>“Depends on what it is. Shoot.”</p>
<p>“Could you teach me how to lift a Juggernaut’s limiters? The engine, control system, maneuvering. Anything that has a limiter placed on it.”</p>
<p>“Who told you?” Seiya asked, narrowing his eyes.</p>
<p>“Second Lieutenant Karen. The mechanic in charge of my Juggernaut.”</p>
<p>“…I’ll kick that idiot’s ass tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Being a chatterbox was fine, but that particular member of the maintenance crew had a horrible tendency to blabber about things they shouldn’t. Seiya sighed and continued speaking with that displeased expression.</p>
<p>“You do know what those safety limiters are there for, right? This isn’t some comic or cartoon where the robot powers up when you lift its limiters. It’s not a nice, convenient little feature you have on your rig. The limiters are there because they’re necessary. Even with the current settings, piloting that thing places a heavy enough burden on a kid like you.”</p>
<p>The Juggernaut’s mobility was by no means high, but its buffering system was even worse. It was slower than the Löwe, the Grauwolf, and even the Dinosauria—the strongest but rarest of the Legion types—but its movements were unbelievably noisy…and the buffering system did little to absorb the shock, meaning each step jolted the pilot.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’ve seen people get broken by piloting this thing in your time here. What, you think you’re special or something just because you almost survived for a year?”</p>
<p>“No.” Shin shook his head coolly.</p>
<p>If nothing else, his emotionless face didn’t seem to have any of the sense of invincibility that kids his age tended to have. He simply spoke on, unfaltering.</p>
<p>“But it’s necessary. Without faster reaction times and my unit being able to make more complicated jumps, using the high-frequency blade…using melee weapons is rough.”</p>
<p>“Then just don’t use melee weapons that give the maintenance team extra work.”</p>
<p>Seiya neglected to mention that these were weapons used exclusively by suicidal Processors. The high-frequency blade was powerful, for sure, but its range—or rather, its reach—was extremely short, making it a very risky weapon. But Shin used it knowingly, so it wasn’t Seiya’s place to tell him what to do.</p>
<p>And it did seem to give Shin an edge on the battlefield. He would cut into the Legion’s lines, disrupt the enemy’s coordination, and distract them. At times, he’d even defeat Löwe all on his own. And this did mean his squad mates were exposed to less danger…</p>
<p>If nothing else…it did seem like he really didn’t want to see his comrades die.</p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p>Shin raised his head in surprise, but Seiya continued speaking without looking him in the eye. Like he said, boosting the Juggernaut’s mobility like that meant sacrificing the pilot’s safety. It put a great deal of strain on both the rider and the rig.</p>
<p>This wasn’t something to be thankful for.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you how to do it after I kick Karen’s ass tomorrow. And I’ll teach you how to service this thing, too. We’ve got some units to break in, so join me for that. And also…about your Personal Mark.”</p>
<p>Shin blinked his bloodred eyes in surprise… That kind of expression was the only time he looked like a boy his age. Seiya sighed.</p>
<p>“It’s about time you decide on one. Eijyu told you, didn’t he? Think of something while you’re in this unit… Well—”</p>
<p>The Juggernaut’s coating was a light brown, like the color of dry bone. The Republic didn’t supply the Eighty-Six with anything else, but they could find paint in other colors from abandoned stockpiles in nearby ruins.</p>
<p>“—we’ll paint the coating in whatever color you want.”</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a003">1</h1>
<p class="noindent">When they died, the Eighty-Six didn’t get any gravestones or leave their names anywhere. This meant Personal Marks were incredibly pointless. At least, that’s how Shin saw it, but people did want to decorate themselves that way. They probably knew this was a meaningless symbol since there would be no one to see or remember them, but they did so anyway.</p>
<p>The city ruins were covered by a layer of snow that had fallen the previous day. In one corner of it was a cathedral with a broken spire. In front of it, Shin found a battered Juggernaut. As he looked down at the Personal Mark emblazoned upon its crushed armor, a thought crossed his mind.</p>
<p>This wasn’t one of his unit’s Juggernauts. Its armor was tattered and ruined from being buried under the snow and exposed to the sun and rain. Within the cockpit’s cheap Bakelite seat was a skeletal corpse covered in a discolored field uniform.</p>
<p>Its skull was nowhere to be seen. There was no silver dog tag dangling from its broken cervical vertebrae, which meant this was an Eighty-Six. Of course, Shin already knew this was an Eighty-Six’s body. He also knew whose body it was.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The Juggernaut’s half-faded Personal Mark was that of a headless skeleton shouldering a sword. Like a ghost wandering the battlefield even after death, in search of its missing head.</p>
<p>Some oddly cold part of Shin’s mind noted that it almost felt like some kind of ironic prank being played on him.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know what he’d had in mind when he drew this Personal Mark on his unit. Maybe this really was his idea of an ironic sting directed at him, but Shin had to doubt if he’d even cared enough to do that.</p>
<p>But even so, at the very end, he’d called for him.</p>
<p><em>Shin</em>.</p>
<p>Hearing that voice linger in his ears, Shin squinted. He soundlessly stepped down from the broken Juggernaut leg he was standing on. He knew there was nothing left here, but he felt like he should at least bury him… No. He wanted to bury him. Even if he couldn’t dig him a grave, he wanted to return him to the soil. And then…</p>
<p>He unconsciously reached out, touching the Personal Mark. He’d promised Alice and his first squadron’s members that he’d carry all those who’d died with him. He would remember them all and carry them until he reached his final destination.</p>
<p>And while he wasn’t one of them, he felt like he should take him, too.</p>
<p>The Juggernaut’s armor was made of flimsy aluminum alloy. It was said that an aircraft’s exterior, which was likewise made from flimsy aluminum, could be cut with a military knife. In which case, once he’d used the knife to remove some of it off, he could use his assault rifle’s bayonet to cut it off, and—</p>
<p>“<em>Pi.</em>”</p>
<p>“…Oh, it’s you.”</p>
<p>Apparently, it’d come looking for him. Upon seeing this old Scavenger—Fido—draw close, Shin put the knife away and stood up. They’d gotten split up during the previous day’s battle, but apparently, it’d found him one way or another.</p>
<p>It approached him with noisy, cluttered steps as Shin looked across the snowy street, where his Juggernaut was sitting, and said:</p>
<p>“Sorry, my Juggernaut’s out of energy. Resupply it. It’s out of ammo, too.”</p>
<p>“<em>Pi.</em>”</p>
<p>The fighting had ended the previous day, but they were still in the contested zones. Being stuck in a situation where he couldn’t fight was a situation he wanted to escape as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“And when you’re done—” Shin was about to give more orders, but then he blinked in surprise as he realized something.</p>
<p>Scavengers were garbage-collecting units meant to gather the ruins of Legion and Juggernauts after battle. And they had burners and cutters for slicing metals so they could round up large pieces of wreckage.</p>
<p>Most Scavengers simply cut them into pieces and carried them back to recycling reactors, but this oddly smart, old-model one might just be capable of…</p>
<p>“Fido. Can you cut this off? I just want to take this bit back with me,” Shin asked, poking his thumb in the direction of the Personal Mark.</p>
<p>He’d promised Alice he’d etch the dead’s names on shards of their units. But the truth was those were hard to come by after battles, so he usually made do with scraps of wood or metal he found.</p>
<p>But maybe, if Fido could cut off pieces of their armor for him…</p>
<p>“<em>Pi!</em>” Fido flashed its optical sensor.</p>
<p>“Go ahead, then.”</p>
<p>“<em>Pi.</em>”</p>
<p>There were no Legion nearby, and the animals wouldn’t take any interest in such a dried corpse. It was winter; the herbivores were feeble from lack of food and served as easy prey for carnivores. A skeleton that had lost all its flesh had no value to a hungry predator.</p>
<p>First, Shin had Fido resupply his unit. He stomped through the snow under the broken Juggernaut, followed by his faithful Scavenger. Fido cut off the optical mark easily enough, but burying the body took longer than he expected. Digging up the frozen soil with his bayonet was quite difficult.</p>
<p class="space-break1">In the end, Fido couldn’t stand to see him toil any longer (or so it seemed) and helped him out, and the two of them covered up the hole with a small, unimpressive mound. The snow had finished falling last night, and the sky was clear, but the wind was still chillingly cold.</p>
<p>Shin leaned against Fido’s container, which it had positioned so as to protect him from the wind. He sipped on some hot water he’d made from boiling some snow as he took a break, and then he got to his feet as the sun set early into the winter sky.</p>
<p>“<em>Pi.</em>”</p>
<p>After confirming that Shin had gotten enough rest, Fido got to its feet.</p>
<p>“Yeah, let’s get moving,” Shin said, gazing into its round optical sensor.</p>
<p>Even though it was only a handful of bleached bones, he didn’t have the stamina or strength of will to get back in the swing of things after digging a grave, but…</p>
<p>“It’ll be trouble if we don’t get back before sundown… If we find any fragments of the captain’s and the rest of the squad’s rigs, we should bring them back, too.”</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a004">0</h1>
<p class="noindent">Only Shin and a single Scavenger returned, carrying a bundle of aluminum fragments that were supposedly from Eijyu and the others’ units.</p>
<p>“…I knew you were a god of pestilence,” Seiya growled.</p>
<p>“Maybe I am,” Shin said, not looking him in the eye.</p>
<p>None of the others survived, but Shin only had a few bruises and scratches. And that was despite him serving as the vanguard, the role with the highest mortality rate, in this mission, too. His devil’s luck and absurd combat skills seemed cheeky now.</p>
<p>No one else returned, but he did. As if he’d stolen all their luck, sacrificed them so he could survive.</p>
<p>“He survived four years…” Seiya clenched his teeth. “So why now…?!”</p>
<p>But he bit his lip before he finished that sentence. That’s right. It’s <em>because</em> he’d survived for four years in this hell. The Eighty-Six were all fated to die. The Legion outnumbered and outmatched them, and this was a ward where the fighting was especially savage.</p>
<p>So even if it did happen soon after Shin came here…that wasn’t why Eijyu had died. That wasn’t why at all.</p>
<p>The sensible part of Seiya’s mind knew this, but his emotions couldn’t come to terms with that. It wasn’t just Eijyu. Everyone else had died all at once in this battle. Even if the Eighty-Six all die sooner or later, squadrons don’t get entirely wiped out that often.</p>
<p>And not to mention every single squadron Shin’s ever been a part of. That makes no sense.</p>
<p>If you can’t call him a god of pestilence, what is he?</p>
<p>A grim reaper, perhaps. A grim reaper who ruthlessly cuts down both friend and foe without distinction—</p>
<p>Shin parted his lips indifferently, not knowing the anger brewing in Seiya’s heart or the jeering he was struggling to keep himself from saying aloud.</p>
<p>“Head Mechanic. Captain Nunat told me to decide on a Personal Name and Mark, remember?”</p>
<p>Seiya let out a long sigh, as if trying to vent out the pressure building up inside him. He’s saying that now?</p>
<p>“Yeah… He did. Though, I think he wanted to think of one for you.”</p>
<p>He likely expected Shin to be the first one under his command to survive a year. He perhaps saw him as something of a younger brother.</p>
<p>But Eijyu’s gone now. He’s gone and nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>“Yes… So I’ll decide them for myself.”</p>
<p>With that said, Shin handed Seiya a small aluminum plate. Seiya froze and blinked in surprise. It was a fragment of a Juggernaut’s armor. It looked pretty old, and it had a faded, unfamiliar Personal Mark drawn on it. It didn’t belong to any of the members of this base. But then whose unit was this? Where did Shin find this?</p>
<p>“I’m not good at drawing. Could you help me with this?”</p>
<p>So he was asking him to draw this?</p>
<p>Seiya found himself taking the plate and examining the Personal Mark. A headless skeletal knight shouldering a long sword. Name Bearers were seen as those who survived by stepping over the bodies of their dead comrades, and so their Personal Names were generally menacing, unpleasant titles. But this skeletal-knight design was especially ominous.</p>
<p>It was like…</p>
<p>“…It’s like a grim reaper. Or an undertaker. If it had a shovel, it would fit perfectly. A monstrous undertaker who survives alone to dig the graves of his peers.”</p>
<p>Yes. It almost felt like an ironic sting directed at Shin.</p>
<p class="space-break2">The comment made Shin crack a thin smile. A chilling grin that made the head of the maintenance team—a man ten years his elder—take a frightened step back.</p>
<p>“—Yeah. I don’t mind the sound of that.”</p>
<p>All his squad mates had died in the previous day’s operation. And in his last squadron, and the one before, and the one before that, no one survived but him. All of them, everyone who fought by his side, perished. Without exception. Every single one.</p>
<p>In which case, he didn’t mind this name. If he could just finally acknowledge himself for what he was, he could handle it better.</p>
<p>A god of pestilence. Or a grim reaper. If he could admit that, he’d be fine.</p>
<p>Being loathed as a monster haunted by ghosts would even be convenient. Let everyone else stare at him from a distance. It would make it so that when someone died, his heart wouldn’t waver from his self-levied goal of bringing everyone to his final destination. He had to survive, even if it meant fighting all alone. He had a wish he needed to see granted. So he might as well not rely on others to grant it for him.</p>
<p>And the one who’d made him realize that was—</p>
<p>He narrowed his crimson eyes and curled his lips into a cold smile. Seiya’s expression stiffened in terror. Or perhaps awe. Fido trembled next to them. Shin couldn’t see how gruesome, how ghastly the expression on his face was.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll make that my Personal Name. Yeah. It does suit me.”</p>
<p>The name signifying the grim reaper who was most familiar, most beloved, and most feared on this battlefield of certain death. He who stands closest to death but never dies and only buries others. He who places his dead comrades into graves that don’t exist. Who would bury all his future comrades. Who would survive to the very end, until whatever awaits at the end of the road buries him in turn.</p>
