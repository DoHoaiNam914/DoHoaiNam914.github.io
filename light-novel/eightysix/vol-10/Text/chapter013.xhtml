<p>“…You’re still alive?” Shin asked in surprise.</p>
<p>It felt like the Scavenger’s optical sensor suddenly swerved to look at him. Shin unconsciously reached out to it, touching its sooty body. It had a thin metallic surface that was both unarmed and unarmored.</p>
<p>The fact that he’d asked a cold, lifeless garbage-collecting device a question like that was probably a product of Shin’s heart being as weak as it was in that moment. Scavengers had no personalities. The Republic could only produce an artificial intelligence that was too feeble to handle autonomous combat. Instead, they cast the Eighty-Six out into the field of battle to act like disposable parts.</p>
<p>So no matter what he said, this machine—this <em>thing</em> couldn’t really understand. The only thing it could do was obey simple verbal commands. And even knowing this, he kept on speaking.</p>
<p>“There’s no one left. The squadron, all your friends, they’re all dead. Will you go back with me anyway…?”</p>
<p>Shin had to experience walking back to base completely on his own over and over. But even so… No, for that exact reason, he didn’t want to go through it again. Shin’s weak heart spurred him to cling to this connection.</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a001">3</h1>
<p class="noindent">“I see. But that’s just the way it is. That’s the fate of the Eighty-Six.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing from Shin, the sole survivor, that the rest of his squadron had been wiped out, the chief of the maintenance crew, Touka Keisha, sighed. She was a mixed Sapphira with golden hair and sky-blue eyes. She wore coveralls that had the constant scent of machine oil on it, which clashed with the fair, beautiful features of her face.</p>
<p>Brushing a lock of hair back, she turned to the rear of the hangar, where containers were lined up. Every one of them was emblazoned with the Republic’s five-hued flag, which by now felt like a despicable symbol to her. She was appalled by the fact that after all the Republic had done, they still had the nerve to claim that their national policy was one of freedom, equality, brotherhood, justice, and nobility.</p>
<p>Those fools could never hope to embody such values while oppressing the Eighty-Six, whom they didn’t even consider human.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t on time for this operation, but the order for that armament finally got approved. There’s still a surplus from when they were initially produced, so they sent us plenty of spares. Use them in your next squadron.”</p>
<p>High-frequency blades. Touka had even forgotten they existed until the taciturn boy by her side found them in the Juggernaut’s manual and asked her about them. They were optional armaments that could be placed on the grappling arms instead of the 12.7 mm heavy machine guns.</p>
<p>They had enough force to even cut into the armor of the Dinosauria, the toughest and largest of all observed Legion types, like it was made of butter. But in the end, they were only swords. Anachronistic, absurd melee weapons. Utterly useless in a battlefield where heavy machine guns and tank turrets, which could fire projectiles several kilometers away, reigned supreme.</p>
<p>Any weapon, no matter how potent, was useless unless it hit the enemy. And so no Eighty-Six used this weapon, which required sprinting through gunfire and bombardment to close in on the enemy. They were seen as useless weight and nothing more.</p>
<p>As a result, Touka didn’t know of any Processors who used them, and when the Handler received the request to order them, their reaction went from mocking to outright eerie disgust. Apparently, they questioned if the one who asked for it had completely lost his mind.</p>
<p>Touka herself tried to talk Shin out of it, but he insisted, and she had to give in. After all, he would be the one to put his life on the line in battle with this weapon. As a member of the maintenance crew, Touka didn’t have the right to change his mind.</p>
<p>She could only hope that stubbornness didn’t stem from desperation. She couldn’t remember him looking her in the eye even once since he was stationed here. And so as she tried to meet his lowered gaze, she continued her words.</p>
<p>“Just don’t do anything reckless. You’re the only one who survived, so you should stay alive for as long as you can. In your next squadron and the one after that, too.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Shin remained silent. He was ten years younger than Touka, and he already lacked emotion to an extent one would never imagine from a boy in his early teens. Despite Touka somehow managing to smile at him, he didn’t return the gesture. Instead, he walked away from the container of high-frequency blades to another corner of the hangar.</p>
<p>“…Can you fix this?” he asked in a dry voice, his gaze set on a heavily damaged, old-model Scavenger.</p>
<p>Its legs were in critical condition, and it could hardly move. She was shocked when he’d towed it back to base with his Juggernaut. Even if the battle was over, he’d returned with it from the depths of the contested zones, where the Legion could be hiding anywhere. And it was just a Scavenger, a burden, an unnecessary drone that wasn’t even worth protecting.</p>
<p>What spurred him to perform such an insane act? Everyone there had the feeling that they understood, and so neither Touka nor the rest of the maintenance crew said anything.</p>
<p>“Well…” Touka trailed off and shrugged.</p>
<p>Normally, repairing a Scavenger would be put off, but they didn’t have any Juggernauts to fix that day.</p>
<p>“Well, yes. If it’s just patching up its legs, it’s not a problem. Its core unit isn’t damaged, so we can probably fix it in no time. Right, we’ll have it ready today… Maybe tomorrow. That’s all thanks to you bringing it back… Good job.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Touka herself thought her attempt at cheering him up came across as unnatural, and Shin didn’t say anything. In his place, the Scavenger sitting in the empty hangar beeped out a strange, electronic “<em>Pi.</em>”</p>
<p class="space-break2">The frontline bases’ power supply was operated from far behind the Republic’s fortress walls. The Republic upheld a blackout during nighttime. It was done to ensure the base wasn’t subjected to night raids from the Legion and also to avoid wasting energy on subhuman pigs.</p>
<p>To the Republic’s citizens, the Eighty-Six were just disposable tools used in the name of their national defense. Anything that wasn’t necessary for combat, be it for comfort or recreational purposes, or any kind of indulgence that would help keep up morale, wasn’t delivered to the Eighty-Sixth Sector.</p>
<p>Slightly before the lights went out, Touka patrolled the base in place of the dead captain. She stopped in the hangar, which was empty after the crew finished servicing Shin’s Juggernaut and the Scavenger.</p>
<p>Normally, Scavengers spent the night in a designated waiting area near the base’s automatic factory. But despite that, the Scavenger’s large, squarish form was still visible in a corner of the closed hangar. Touka didn’t really mind seeing it there. Scavengers were tools produced and used by the Republic. She didn’t know and honestly didn’t care what programming operated them or how they decided how to act. After all, even if the Eighty-Six could decide the scavengers’ work orders or the range they operated in, they didn’t have authority to assign them tasks.</p>
<p>But then she saw Shin huddled next to its stained body, asleep. He was there even though the maintenance crew had told him to get some rest. Looking closely, she saw he had his thin blanket from his room, so apparently, he had returned to the barracks once. But then why was he sleeping here in the hangar? It wasn’t a place one should spend the night in.</p>
<p>She reached out to him, thinking to shake him awake, but then she came to a realization and bit her lip.</p>
<p>The barracks. It was now empty of all the squad mates who’d been there until just the previous day, and he probably didn’t want to sleep there by himself. It would be going back to a place that served as a reminder that everyone but him had passed away.</p>
<p>So he’d gone to the hangar. A place that would always be empty at night. Or maybe…</p>
<p>The boy sat in place, asleep and huddled against the cold body of the Scavenger, which was now in stasis mode.</p>
<p class="space-break1">To Touka, he looked like a small child clinging to a stray puppy he’d found.</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a002">4</h1>
<p class="noindent">The Republic treated the Eighty-Six like machine parts, but even they knew better than to give combat orders to a squadron that had been reduced to a single Juggernaut. And so for the period until a new squadron was assigned, the Processor for that single Juggernaut—Shin—was left with nothing to do.</p>
<p>For the first few days, he hung around the maintenance crew since he’d decided that handling simple repairs for his rig wouldn’t be a bad skill to learn.</p>
<p>But then the Juggernauts for the next squadron showed up, and the maintenance crew became too busy with tuning and applying final touches to them. These were, after all, the Processors’ partners, which would function as their weapons and lifelines. So even if the Processors weren’t there yet, they couldn’t cut corners.</p>
<p>Touka told Shin to think of this as a vacation and just relax, but doing nothing made him restless. And so as a way of distracting himself, Shin went on a walk and stopped by an abandoned Republic base a good distance away.</p>
<p>Early on in the Legion War, the Republic military was wiped out, and the Republic evacuated into the eighty-five administrative Sectors. This base was abandoned at the time and overrun by lush foliage. Roosters that had long forgotten their fear and deference toward humans strutted around like they owned the place. Shin went through a gate that past Eighty-Six had busted open, and he entered the base’s concrete building.</p>
<p>He walked down the corridor that was by now familiar to him, with mice squeaking and skittering away as they fled from his approach. The place had been abandoned, but it served as a useful site for collecting preserved foods and small firearms… Places like these were where the Eighty-Six obtained pistols and rifles, which they were usually forbidden from possessing. But since the Republic soldiers didn’t do their jobs properly, they never checked or knew about this clear transgression.</p>
<p>Of course, the piles of rations had been whittled down after years of the war, but Shin soon found the ammunition box he was looking for and made to drag it out of its corner. But just then, he heard something metallic and heavy—no lighter than ten tonnes—noisily step through the warehouse.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Shin held his breath nervously and spun around. This had never happened before—the Legion never sneaked up on him or took him from behind like that! He slipped on the strap of his assault rifle and grasped its grip. He loaded the first bullet and prepared to aim the weapon…</p>
<p>…when he recalled that the Legion didn’t make footsteps.</p>
<p>Their high-fidelity actuators and shock absorbers allowed even Dinosauria, with their colossal weight of over one hundred tonnes, to move with the faint fluttering sound of bones rubbing against one another. In which case, the thing behind him…the thing he saw as he turned around was…</p>
<p>“<em>Pi.</em>”</p>
<p>…a charred, old-style Juggernaut.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>An awkward silence settled over the place as the boy and the machine gawked at each other in the abandoned warehouse. Shin stood frozen and unsure of how to react as he stared into the round optical sensor.</p>
<p>He felt both relieved and tired all at once as he heaved a sigh.</p>
<p>“It’s you.”</p>
<p>The Scavenger he’d found and brought back from the last battle. It wobbled over to him with loud, clumsy footsteps, but Shin knew it couldn’t possibly answer him.</p>
<p>“There’s no sortie today, so you’re not ordered to follow me around. What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“<em>Pi.</em>”</p>
<p>Scavengers weren’t equipped with a verbal-output feature, but apparently, that electronic beeping was its way of answering. It’d followed him here while disregarding its garbage-collection duties.</p>
<p>It turned its optical sensor about, looking restlessly around the warehouse with artificial yet somehow adorable movements, before settling its gaze on the crate of pistol bullets Shin had dropped when he’d held up his assault rifle. It then extended its crane arm, capable of picking up heavy 57 mm shells, and lifted the ammunition crate with ease.</p>
<p>The Scavengers’ role was to pick up shell fragments and machine wreckage from the battlefield and return them for recycling in the base’s automatic factory. Shin nearly raised his hand to stop it, but he paused halfway through and looked up at the large machine.</p>
<p>Apparently, it was thinking of bringing the crate back.</p>
<p>“<em>Pi!</em>”</p>
<p>It put the crate into its container with what felt like an enthusiastic, humorous sequence of movements.</p>
<p>“…Heh.” Shin was smiling before he knew it.</p>
<p>As he gazed into the optical sensor, he chuckled. The laughter just bubbled up within him, and as he let it surface, Shin wondered—how long had it been since the last time he’d laughed? It felt like it had been an eternity.</p>
<p>As he laughed aloud, he felt the corners of his eyes grow hot, and yet he pretended not to notice all the other emotions that wouldn’t run down his cheeks.</p>
<p>The Scavenger gazed at him wordlessly, like a faithful hound—which, again, made sense since it didn’t have a verbal-output feature—and Shin patted his hand on the machine’s flank, as one might do to a dog or a horse.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to carry stuff, I’ve got a lot of things I need to bring back. Help me out for a while.”</p>
<p>“<em>Pi!</em>”</p>
<p>As emotionless as it was, the Scavenger seemed to nod happily. Or at least, it moved its body up and down in an approximation of a nod. And once again, without him even noticing it, Shin curled his lips into a smile.</p>
<p class="space-break2">On top of the pistol and assault-rifle ammunition and spare parts, Shin stocked up on living ware, emergency rations, and canned food. Shin’s small body could only carry so much, but his reliable Scavenger loaded them into its container.</p>
<p>Shin returned to base while moving a bit more slowly so as to keep up with the sluggish Scavenger. He made his way back feeling slightly better than he did when he left, and he found Touka waiting for him in front of the hangar.</p>
<p>Seeing her fair features contorted in anger, Shin pursed his lips, feeling a bad premonition settle in. It looked like the Scavenger following him was shivering with fear somehow. He opened his canopy, and once he touched down on the ground, Touka parted her lips. Her pale features were stern, frightening, and indignant.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Your change-of-ward order just came in.”</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a003">5</h1>
<p class="noindent">Each ward and internment camp in the Eighty-Sixth Sector was separated by antipersonnel and anti-tank minefields. Needless to say, the Eighty-Six generally weren’t allowed to move outside the wards they were appointed to, to say nothing of entering the eighty-five administrative Sectors. The only means of transportation between them were military transports that crossed the hundred kilometers from the eighty-five Sectors. The Legion had aerial superiority over the contested zones thanks to the Eintagsfliege and the Stachelschwein, and so the Republic’s unsightly metallic birds could only fly in their own limited airspace.</p>
<p>The transport plane’s four jet engines were currently turned off, and the hatch for its hold was hanging open. Shin was guided onto the plane by the Republic officer in charge of the flight.</p>
<p>He hardly had any personal belongings to take with him. He’d kept the assault rifle he carried for self-defense and the pistol he carried for suicide purposes, as well as the aluminum grave markers, which had only piled up since his first squadron, hidden in his Juggernaut. That way, they wouldn’t be confiscated.</p>
<p>On paper, the Processors were only Juggernaut parts, and so they and their units were treated as a set during transports. Usually, the planes carried multiple Juggernauts, but this time, the transport’s hold was excessively empty.</p>
<p>As he got to the ramp, Touka and the rest of the maintenance crew came to see him off. He bowed his head without looking them in the eye. Whether the crew treated him cordially like Touka did or scorned him as a god of death like others did, he would bid them farewell just the same once he changed wards and would likely never see them again.</p>
<p>He was used to the fact that he’d say good-bye and likely never find out if they went on to live or die. Just like he was used to being carried to his next battlefield in an unusually spacious cargo area.</p>
<p>Regardless of if people scorned him or were kind to him, nothing ever really changed. He’d be all alone in the end just the same.</p>
<p>He pursed his lips tightly. The memories of the last few days he spent here surfaced in his mind, but he silenced them. Scavengers were autonomous machines attached to each base, and just like the maintenance crew, they were considered as the property of the base. They couldn’t move outside their assigned wards.</p>
<p>So it couldn’t come along.</p>
<p>As Shin sat in the cargo hold, a Republic officer confirmed the Juggernaut was fixed in place. Neither of them spared the other a look. As weak as its armor was, the Juggernaut weighed over ten tonnes. Letting an amateur Processor handle its coupling could lead to it being poorly attached. If it came loose, it could disturb the plane’s center of gravity during takeoff. As such, the Eighty-Six weren’t trusted to handle that.</p>
<p>Of course, if the Eighty-Six were to do it intentionally, they’d be going down with the plane, but they were fated to die on the battlefield either way. Some were satisfied just taking some Republic soldiers down with them, so a few likely considered doing that. Meaning even the Republic soldiers, who hardly ever did their job, had to be diligent when it came to this.</p>
<p>The officer then raised his head and knit his brows, jerking his chin toward the open hatch behind them.</p>
<p>“—Hey. You’re not thinking of taking that thing along, are you?”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Turning around, Shin saw a Scavenger standing there, its massive body blocking off the sunlight. It was an old model with soot-covered plating, but its legs alone were new. The round lens of its optical sensor flickered as if blinking.</p>
<p>It was that Scavenger.</p>
<p>“<em>Pi.</em>”</p>
<p>“…Why?”</p>
<p>As mentioned, Scavengers were considered the property of their base and couldn’t move to other bases. So they couldn’t follow any squadrons or Processors who were being reorganized.</p>
<p>As Shin gazed at it, confused, the Scavenger climbed onto the ramp and folded its four legs in one of the hold’s corners, as if making a statement that it wouldn’t move. It ignored the officer, who’d ordered it to stop and now angrily turned on Shin.</p>
<p>“What orders did you give it…? Don’t do anything suspicious, you damn Eighty-Six. Tell it to get off.”</p>
<p>But Shin was at as much of a loss as the officer was. He…or rather, the Eighty-Six as a whole didn’t have any authority over the Scavengers to begin with. And so Shin kept his gaze moving between the angry officer and the seated Scavenger.</p>
<p>Touka peered into the plane and said with a mocking smile, “Oh, but I thought these Scavengers were the product of your great Republic’s cutting-edge technology?”</p>
<p>The officer glared at her venomously as Touka raised her chin and laughed. Her blue eyes were narrowed elegantly, and her naturally red lips were curled into a smirk.</p>
<p>A sweet, arrogant smirk.</p>
<p>“I mean, we subhuman pigs could operate your superior machines. These drones were made by the most advanced technology developed by the Republic’s people, members of the superior species. Surely, you could change any orders we filthy Eighty-Six gave it. It’d be easy enough for you…right?”</p>
<p><em>Go ahead</em>, she goaded him. <em>Do it yourself.</em></p>
<p>“Ugh…” The officer fell silent, his face going red with humiliation and anger.</p>
<p>He couldn’t do it. He didn’t have that kind of authority. And maybe he even lacked the knowledge and techniques to handle a Scavenger that was acting irregularly.</p>
<p>But admitting he was powerless and helpless in front of Eighty-Six? In front of subhuman pigs? His pride wouldn’t allow it.</p>
<p>“…Fine. Do whatever you want.”</p>
<p>Shin looked up at the officer in surprise, who didn’t look back at him. The man bitterly approached the Scavenger and began fixing it in place, too. As the Scavenger flickered its optical sensor at the same tempo a dog might wag its tail happily with, Touka regarded Shin with a soft smile and waved good-bye.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The officer returned to the transport plane’s cockpit, leaving the Juggernaut, the child soldier who served as its Processor unit, and the Scavenger behind in the hold. A military aircraft’s hold could ferry people, but no Republic soldier wanted to share a room with an Eighty-Six.</p>
<p>“There’s been a change in the cargo weight. Recalculate it,” he told the copilot bitterly without sparing him a glance.</p>
<p>“Roger that.”</p>
<p>Just thinking back to that argument in the hold pissed him off.</p>
<p>“Those pigs, I swear to God. Fucking animals making my job harder…”</p>
<p>This plane could easily carry an extra ten tonnes without a problem, but that wasn’t to say it didn’t add extra work.</p>
<p>“This is why I can’t stand Eighty-Six. They just keep complicating our job for no reason. Those imbeciles don’t know how hard we humans work. Goddamn pigs. Livestock.”</p>
<p>As the officer muttered in irritation, the copilot threw a sidelong glance at him.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to say it over and over; we all know they’re pigs in human form… Listening to you is getting annoying,” he said.</p>
<p>“I know,” the officer replied ruefully, contrary to his words.</p>
<p>Yes, he knew, but if he didn’t say this, he wouldn’t calm down. The top brass of the military. His colleagues. The irresponsible Handlers. The ignorant citizens. His homeland had decided that the Eighty-Six were pigs in human form. Lowly, stupid, and savage. Subhumans that were an evolutionary cul-de-sac. He had to think of them that way.</p>
<p><em>God dammit</em>, he mouthed under his breath.</p>
<p>He couldn’t keep up this job if he didn’t think that way. His thoughts wandered back to the child soldier. A boy in his early teens, far too young to be a soldier. And the expression he made the moment he gave him permission to keep the Scavenger on board.</p>
<p><em>He’s just a weapon’s component. Why couldn’t he just act the part and keep his emotions dead?</em></p>
<p>It was the expression of a small child, the kind you could see anywhere.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The expression of a small boy who’d been told he could keep the puppy he’d found and raised in secret.</p>
