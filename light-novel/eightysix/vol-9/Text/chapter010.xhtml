<p>“Excuse me?! If anyone here is brazen, I daresay it would be you!”</p>
<p>Shin let out a weary sigh.</p>
<p class="space-break2">She’d chided Rito about this, but Michihi herself found the Theocracy to be a bit eerie. Faceless soldiers clad in shining pearl-gray, unfamiliar Feldreß accompanied by countless small drones… But strangest of all was the way the Theocracy military conducted themselves. They were solemn, full of piety. Rather than seeming ruthless, they looked like they were marching on a pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Something about it struck Michihi as helpless and flimsy. Maybe it was because the Eighty-Six didn’t believe in God or heaven.</p>
<p>The intercom crackled to life, and she heard a voice that didn’t reach her through the Sensory Resonance.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Are you nervous, miss? Not to worry, the Myrmecoleo Regiment will equally protect the weak Theocracy’s people as well as you helpless children of the Strike Package.”</span></strong></p>
<p>The voice’s velvety caress carried the unpleasantly smooth intonation unique to old Giadian nobility. The Giadian Empire had been a nation with more nobles and princes than any other on the continent, and apparently, there were multiple noble dialects.</p>
<p>This particular dialect was different from the one used by Richard, who was technically Michihi’s adoptive parent, and that of the chief of staff, Willem. It was unfamiliar, which perhaps made it more unpleasant to the ear.</p>
<p>Michihi sighed quietly, in a manner that wouldn’t be picked up by this young man. She could tell that he was trying to be considerate of her in his own way. She glanced around, finding that aside from the white form of her Reginleif, Hualien, there was one more unit inside the hangar. It stood on eight powerful legs, its imposing frame covered with thick composite armor. It was equipped with two heavy machine guns and a 120 mm smoothbore gun capable of taking down even a Löwe or a Dinosauria.</p>
<p><a id="page-78"></a>Its coating wasn’t the steel-colored plating of the Federacy, but rather, a vivid cinnabar color.</p>
<p>This was the Federacy’s primary Feldreß—the M4A3 Vánagandr. A unit affiliated with the force that had been dispatched with them on this operation.</p>
<p>“The Myrmecoleo Free Armored Regiment…right?”</p>
<p>She wasn’t very curious about them, but Grethe did explain the circumstances ahead of time. They were once a private army under the command of a major noble, and now they had been integrated into the Federacy army. The cinnabar plating had been applied not only to their Vánagandrs, but also to the Úlfhéðnar—the exoskeletons worn by the armored infantry who served as their consorts.</p>
<p>Indeed, nobles seemed to have a tendency for theatrical pretense. This plating was a showy, vivid color that wouldn’t serve to camouflage their units in either the ashen battlefield of the Theocracy or the urban and forested terrains of the Federacy’s western front.</p>
<p>In fact, there was likely no battlefield at all where such a gaudy color would do anything but make these units stand out. Modern warfare was ruled by rationality. There was no place for anything as anachronistic as knights sauntering about in shiny armor.</p>
<p>The red armor keenly reflected the hangar’s faint light like a mirror. This was because the armor was completely untarnished. Perhaps, the coating had been reapplied and polished for its first true battle. It was a stark contrast to the Reginleif, which bore countless scars and scratches from its endless battles without so much as caring about it.</p>
<p>This Vánagandr was untouched because it had never known battle.</p>
<p>“I realize you spoke out of kindness, but I don’t need a rookie on his first battle to treat me like a child… I’d appreciate it if you wouldn’t patronize me, please and thanks.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">The five divisions of the Theocracy’s 3rd Army Corps each launched and entered combat. Heaving a sigh, Hilnå looked up at Lena and cocked her head inquisitively.</p>
<p><a id="page-79"></a>“How would you describe the people of the Free Armored Regiment? I haven’t gotten much of a chance to speak with them…”</p>
<p><em>Had she spoken with the Eighty-Six, then?</em> Lena wondered. The Expedition Brigade was given a separate barracks from the Theocracy military’s.</p>
<p>“The Eighty-Six were quite friendly when they greeted me in the hangar, the meeting rooms, or the corridors. We’ve played a bit, too,” Hilnå said.</p>
<p>So she had spoken with them.</p>
<p>Hilnå beamed as she boasted of her skill at the card-matching game.</p>
<p>“I’d heard they were elites who made the battlefield their home, but I was pleasantly surprised by their friendly demeanor. It seems the Eighty-Six get along quite well among themselves, too.”</p>
<p>“They are comrades who survived the Eighty-Sixth Sector’s battlefield, after all.” Lena smiled as she replied, a hint of pride in her voice. “But regarding your question… I’m sorry, but I’m a Republic officer. I’m not privy to matters pertaining to the Federacy military.”</p>
<p>A few of the staff officers urged Marcel to answer in her place, and he parted his lips to explain.</p>
<p>“They were originally the remains of the regiments that were set up to defend the territory of the old nobles…” Marcel’s gaze darted about, as if seeking refuge from the curious look in Hilnå’s large, clear, golden eyes. “Back in the days of the Empire, governors had their own regiments. When the Empire fell, most of them were integrated into the Federacy’s military, but some of the more influential nobles kept a few of those regiments as private armies. Most of them are made up of young nobles or the children of family branches that draw blood from those noble houses.”</p>
<p>In the Empire, the nobility had been those of the warrior class. Conscription wasn’t the duty of the commoners but a privilege afforded only to the ruling class.</p>
<p>“So the Myrmecoleo people are most likely the children of former nobles. Their lord is House Brantolote, a powerful Pyrope family, so I’d guess they’re probably young Pyrope nobles.”</p>
<p><a id="page-80"></a>“I see…,” Lena said pensively.</p>
<p>“Oh, is that so…?!” Hilnå reacted excitedly.</p>
<p>They both nodded, impressed with the fluid explanation. Indeed, the Myrmecoleo regimental commander and officers they’d seen in the briefing were all handsome and refined, as one might expect of young nobles. However, Marcel, who had offered the explanation, wore a rather dissatisfied expression.</p>
<p>“But… About that… They…”</p>
<p class="space-break2">Restlessly running through the pearl-gray temporary hangar was a small girl from the Theocracy. She was a six- to seven-year-old girl—young even by the standards of Bernholdt and the Vargus soldiers, who were used to seeing Mascots.</p>
<p>She carried on her a staff with an incense burner chiseled out of what looked like crystal pillars. Brandishing it over the Theocracy soldiers’ heads, she chanted some kind of prayer before the soldiers sortied. She then ran over to Bernholdt and his men. The incense burner at the tip of her staff swung about as she moved, so the Vargus had to duck their heads every now and then. A young Theocracy military interpreter hurried over to them, wearing a nervous expression.</p>
<p>“My deepest apologies, noncommissioned Federacy officer. It is customary in our country to receive these blessings before we depart to battle. I hope you did not find it unpleasant—”</p>
<p>“Ah, no, it’s all good. Thank you, miss.”</p>
<p>The girl couldn’t understand the Federacy’s language, so she timidly looked between the interpreter and Bernholdt. Bernholdt instead squatted down and spoke with her at eye level. Realizing he was thanking her, her eyes lit up, and she beamed back at him.</p>
<p>It was then that Bernholdt noticed a group clad in striking colors pass through the corridor connecting to the hangar. The Myrmecoleo Regiment.</p>
<p>“How about it?” he called out to them. “They could bless you before your first battle.”</p>
<p><a id="page-81"></a>But they didn’t so much as spare a glance in his direction, much less say anything. They simply passed by, their physiques as well-bred and developed as one might expect of a model officer. But the way they walked past Bernholdt and his fellow Vargus gave the impression that they were ignoring them as if they were stray dogs.</p>
<p>The Vargus soldiers scoffed.</p>
<p>“We’re used to them already. They’ve been that way ever since they were deployed here. Creepy guys, though.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s nobles for you. Governors never treat anyone else with basic human decency.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t so much that they regarded the people of the combat territories like beasts, as the people of the Empire had done. It was more that Imperial nobles didn’t see <em>anyone</em> other than their fellow nobles as human. Be they former subjects of the Empire or animals, they were equally unworthy to even be looked upon by a noble, much less spoken to.</p>
<p>Because they treated everyone equally poorly to an extent, Bernholdt knew better than to take particular offense. Thankfully, the girl didn’t seem overly offended, either, instead running over to the Scythe squadron’s Processors to offer them a blessing.</p>
<p>“I don’t get it, though. Back when we served nobles, they always gave us a keg of ale whenever we got married, had a kid, or when one of our fathers died in battle,” one of the Vargus soldiers said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, ’cause we served an Onyx warrior,” Bernholdt said.</p>
<p>“Oh… Well, that’s probably it, then.”</p>
<p>Bernholdt and his fellow Vargus were born into an Onyx noble’s territory. Since they were once an Onyx’s soldiers, the Pyrope nobles’ children saw them as even more of an eyesore. The Pyrope officers continued to walk away silently, not turning their scarlet heads or sparing them a crimson glance.</p>
<p>The officer leading them was the very image of a noble female knight, her golden hair tightly done up into braids. The young male officers following her had perfectly combed hair and meticulously manicured fingernails, and they wore flight suits that fit their bodies perfectly.</p>
<p><a id="page-82"></a>They were shining examples of what one might expect nobles to look like.</p>
<p>But it was then that Bernholdt suddenly turned around.</p>
<p><em>Wait…</em></p>
<p>Something was off. These Pyropes had crimson hair <em>or</em> eyes. And they were led by a <em>golden-haired</em> officer.</p>
<p>“…Hmm.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">The two girls’ high-pitched squabbling dragged on, much to Shin’s distress.</p>
<p>“To begin with, <em>your</em> black swan? Whatever do you mean by that? That bird, the Trauerschwan, was developed by the research institute and entrusted to the Strike Package! Do not appropriate it as your own, you insolent girl.”</p>
<p>“But it was the brave soldiers of our Myrmecoleo Regiment who were entrusted with ferrying it to the Theocracy! You crude Eighty-Six could not handle transporting such a delicate weapon!”</p>
<p>“That much I will grant you, because acting as pack mules is the one job that fits your sluggish Vánagandrs.”</p>
<p>“Y-you say that when your cowardly Reginleifs are only good for skittering about…! And how dare you profess to be a Mascot, a goddess of victory, when you wear such a stuffy uniform!”</p>
<p>“I suppose a girl who views the battlefield as some sort of ballroom would say that. What do you hope to achieve with that gaudy, impractical dress of yours? Do you mean to entrance the Legion with song and dance?”</p>
<p>Deciding he had nothing to do with the current situation, Raiden hunkered down in Wehrwolf’s cockpit, while Shin remained caught in the cross fire of the two girls’ bickering. To be specific, Frederica had grabbed onto the sleeve of his flight suit, preventing his escape.</p>
<p>“Enough! This is shameful!” The girl in the dress stomped in frustration, her high heels clicking against the floor. “Hiding behind your brother’s back like, are you? Coward!”</p>
<p><a id="page-83"></a>“Green with envy, are you? Useless lout!”</p>
<p>“Y-you…you…washboard!”</p>
<p>“Pint-size pygmy!”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t put up with it any longer.</p>
<p>“Cut it out. You’re being immature,” he said to Frederica.</p>
<p>“And this isn’t very ladylike of you, Princess,” another voice cut into the argument.</p>
<p>Both girls instantly clammed up. But even though they had gone quiet, they still glared at each other with visible enmity, like two kittens on the verge of hissing. Shin turned to face the person who had stopped the other girl.</p>
<p>This was a familiar voice, in fact. He’d met them before dispatching here and had seen them a few times in the Theocracy during meetings and joint training sessions.</p>
<p>“I apologize if our Mascot said anything rude, Captain. You too, little Mascot.”</p>
<p>The man had the slender physique and refined features characteristic of the Empire’s old nobility. His armored flight suit was identical in design to the Federacy military standard, but it had cinnabar colors applied to it. His unit medal was the symbol of a grotesque monster that was a cross between a lion and a gigantic ant.</p>
<p>The commander of the former Brantolote archduchess’s Free Armored Regiment—</p>
<p>“…Major Günter.”</p>
<p>“As I’ve told you countless times before, you may call me Gilwiese…,” the man said, approaching him with his shoulders dropped.</p>
<p>He looked to be as young as twenty years old. He had bright, scarlet hair and the crimson eyes of a Pyrope, just like Frederica and Shin. The girl turned around and ran over to Gilwiese in tears. He was far taller than she was, and he had to squat down to accept her embrace.</p>
<p>“Ah, Brother! This is unacceptable! We cannot let these vulgar Eighty-Six savages be the main force! Can we not reconsider?!”</p>
<p>“Again with this…?” he said, contorting his pleasant, handsome face into his best look of admonishment. “That’s beyond rude, Princess. <a id="page-84"></a>It’s your first time meeting the captain and the Strike Package’s Mascot, isn’t it? You should give them a proper greeting.”</p>
<p>The girl he called “Princess” puffed up her cheeks in a pout, but he didn’t relent. Eventually, she pinched up the hem of her dress in a sullen curtsy.</p>
<p>“…The Myrmecoleo Free Regiment’s Goddess of Victory, Svenja Brantolote. A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Captain Shinei <em>Nouzen</em>, and his cheeky sycophant.”</p>
<p>She said Shin’s last name, <em>Nouzen</em>, with an odd sort of accent. House Brantolote were the masters of the Myrmecoleo Regiment and a Pyrope family that opposed House Nouzen, which was the pillar of the Onyx families in the Giadian Empire.</p>
<p>Frederica parted her lips to retort against this blatant provocation, but Shin silenced her by pulling her soldier’s cap down under her nose.</p>
<p><em>You’ll just complicate things. Keep quiet.</em></p>
<p>Incidentally…</p>
<p>“…I thought your people were stationed at the Expedition Brigade’s headquarters. Shouldn’t you be on the front lines with Second Lieutenant Michihi, Major?” Shin asked.</p>
<p>“Well, you see…” Gilwiese averted his gaze, awkwardly scratching his temple with a perfectly cut fingernail. “Ashamed as I am to admit it, the little princess here overslept. Pre-battle nerves kept her up.”</p>
<p>“Brother!” Svenja shouted, her cheeks red.</p>
<p>“And though waiting for a lady to finish dressing up is a knight’s duty, I couldn’t possibly prioritize that over an operation. So I left my vice commander to handle the main force and told him to go on ahead. It shouldn’t take long to catch up to a platoon of Vánagandrs, so I’ll regroup with them before it’s time to begin in earnest… And besides, I did want to exchange a few words with you before the operation starts, Captain Nouzen.”</p>
<p>Shin gazed fixedly at Gilwiese, who simply shrugged.</p>
<p>“The Reaper who leads the Eighty-Six, the mixed-blood Nouzen. I’ve always wondered what goes through your mind as you fight. <em>Could he be the same as us?</em> I thought.”</p>
<p><a id="page-85"></a>“…?”</p>
<p>It was then that Shin noticed. He had received the black Onyx hair from his father, but his brother, Rei, got their mother’s crimson Pyrope hair. Gilwiese’s red hair was a different shade compared with his brother’s and his mother’s, however. Having Svenja and her crimson hair, which was the natural shade for a Pyrope, to reference made clear the artificiality of Gilwiese’s particular shade of red.</p>
<p>His hair was dyed. And Svenja’s eyes were golden—likely the mark of one mixed with Heliodor blood. Shin hadn’t paid it much mind until now, but looking back, he’d gotten the impression that all the Myrmecoleo Regiment’s officers were Pyropes mixed with some other bloodline.</p>
<p>Imperial nobles abhorred the mixing of bloodlines. And in the ten years since the Empire became the Federacy, those values hadn’t faded away.</p>
<p><em>That explains it</em>, Shin thought bitterly.</p>
<p>Their unit’s symbol was an antlion. A monster with a lion’s head and an ant’s body. Two separate species mixed into one. A unit made up by those noble children who, while drawing on the blood of the aristocracy, could not be fully accepted into it because of their mixed heritage.</p>
<p>“But I suppose I was wrong. Marquis Nouzen is a kind grandfather to you, is he not? Except… If that’s the case, why are you fighting?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Shin heaved a brief sigh… Eugene had asked him the same question once upon a time.</p>
<p>“…Major Günter, the operation’s already underway. We don’t have much time to—”</p>
<p>Gilwiese regarded him with an awkward smile.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s why that’s all I want to ask you… I’d appreciate it if you could answer.”</p>
<p>He wanted Shin, who was a child of mixed Imperial blood and, at the same time, who wasn’t being used as a pawn by the noble houses, to answer that question.</p>
<p>“…It’s because of the war.”</p>
<p>It’d taken away his family and so many of his brothers and sisters in <a id="page-86"></a>arms. The Eighty-Sixth Sector deprived him of his future and freedom. It was sheer catastrophe. Just like the metallic maelstrom of violence that severed part of Theo’s arm and a portion of his future along with it.</p>
<p>“I want to end it. Though it might seem strange to you, Major.”</p>
<p>“It does. After all, once this war ends, no one will treat you and your friends like heroes anymore. You’ll go back to being children. You’re all skilled warriors, but you have nothing more than that. And even still, you want to end the war?”</p>
<p>“Because I don’t want to be a hero.”</p>
<p>Gilwiese cracked a faint, bitter smile.</p>
<p>“I see… I envy you. I… We can’t be that strong. I wish we would, if we only could. Even now.”</p>
<p>Become heroes.</p>
<p>The old nobility of the Empire held on to its pride as warriors. At being those who governed, by virtue of reigning supreme on the field of battle. And this regiment was made of those who couldn’t be accepted into those families, because of their mixed blood.</p>
<p>Perhaps, it was <em>exactly because they wouldn’t be accepted</em> that they were desperate to prove their status as nobles.</p>
<p>As Gilwiese spoke with such a solemn face, Svenja tugged on the sleeve of his cinnabar-colored flight suit in complaint.</p>
<p>“And that is precisely why I said that, Brother!”</p>
<p>“Princess, I already told you: It can’t be done.”</p>
<p>“Are you siblings?”</p>
<p>Their family names were different, but since their roots were supposedly similar, it was entirely possible that they really were siblings.</p>
<p>“That’s the first time you’ve actually asked me anything,” Gilwiese said, cocking an eyebrow impishly.</p>
<p>Shin looked a bit taken aback by this, to which Gilwiese laughed before continuing:</p>
<p>“Not siblings, but close enough. It’s not just the Princess here, but all of us at Myrmecoleo are comrades and brethren. Some of us are connected by blood, yes, but some aren’t. I’d imagine it’s much the same for you.”</p>
<p><a id="page-87"></a>The Strike Package. The Eighty-Six who lived and died together on the Eighty-Sixth Sector’s battlefield. After a moment’s thought, Shin nodded. In that regard, Gilwiese was right. The Myrmecoleo Regiment and the Eighty-Six were similar in that relationship. They weren’t bound by blood, but they were brethren by virtue of making the same battlefield their home and the same pride their bond.</p>
<p>“…Yes, it is,” Shin said. “In that case, I leave my ‘younger sister’ in your care, Major.”</p>
<p>“Second Lieutenant Kukumila, yes?” Gilwiese nodded firmly. “She’ll be safe with me, Captain.”</p>
<p>He then cracked a more relaxed, sarcastic smile.</p>
<p>“And so will that problematic black swan.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The Senior Research Institute’s 1,720th draft plan, the Black Swan of Death—Trauerschwan.</p>
<p>It’d been under development but hadn’t been completed in time to stop the Morpho during the large-scale offensive. Its introduction to the battlefield was decided due to the discovery of the Noctiluca and the Halcyon.</p>
<p>It was the Federacy’s own <em>railgun</em>.</p>
<p>The Halcyon was far too large to be challenged with only Feldreß. And so the Trauerschwan was their linchpin for destroying it in this operation. Michihi and Rito were deployed with the main force ahead of them. They were tasked with guarding it as they advanced into the Legion’s territories. It was, for all intents and purposes, the Federacy Expedition Brigade’s trump card.</p>
<p>The Legion’s railgun was developed to both attack and counterattack from an absurd range of four hundred kilometers, downing enemies with a single destructive shot. And now they had their own absurd long-range, high-caliber railgun to counter it.</p>
<p>But at present…</p>
<p>“I understand that it’s still an incomplete prototype, but I think it’s too soon to bring in that railgun.”</p>
<p>It was supposed to be an absurdly long-range, high-caliber railgun, <a id="page-88"></a>except that it was still a prototype in development. Its initial velocity of two thousand three hundred meters per second exceeded the maximal velocity of an artillery cannon, but it was a far cry from the Morpho’s initial velocity of eight thousand meters per second.</p>
<p>The same applied for the weight of the warheads it could propel. It could destroy Löwe from hundreds of kilometers away, but the preliminary calculations indicated that to destroy the Halcyon reliably, it would need to fire from twelve kilometers away—a pitifully short range, unworthy of the title of <em>long-distance cannon</em>.</p>
<p>A group clad in cinnabar flight suits approached them, their military boots stomping over the floor. The blond female officer at the lead, a captain, saluted while noticeably regarding Shin and Frederica with the slightest of glances.</p>
<p>“Major, it’s nearly time to depart.”</p>
<p>“Understood, Tilda. Princess, let’s go. Thank you for the conversation, Captain Nouzen.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Brother.” Svenja nodded.</p>
<p>Not feeling the slightest bit interested about the female captain’s attitude, Shin felt something suspicious about Gilwiese and Svenja’s exchange.</p>
<p>“You take your Mascot to the front lines?”</p>
<p>Unlike the Reginleif, which was a one-seater, the Vánagandr featured a two-seater cockpit and was a Feldreß meant to be piloted by a pair. Both the gunner and pilot seat had controls for operating the Vánagandr single-handedly in case of emergencies, though.</p>
<p>As such, a Vánagandr could carry a Mascot—who shouldn’t have been capable of either piloting or shooting as a gunner—into the battlefield by having her occupy one of the seats, but…</p>
<p>Gilwiese’s nod was accompanied by an honest, amicable smile.</p>
<p>“Of course—she <em>is</em> our Goddess of Victory.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">Watching the cinnabar-clad group walk off, Frederica glanced up at Shin.</p>
<p><a id="page-89"></a>“You deployed me with the Trauerschwan and then delayed my departure for as long as possible so as to prevent them from seeing me, did you not, Shinei?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>But that only ended up forcing the hand of fate. The fact that she’d asked him that question implied that Frederica understood. When Svenja introduced herself, Shin didn’t give Frederica a chance to announce her name, and the conversation with Gilwiese was to prevent her from getting a word in.</p>
<p>“I know not what the generals have told you about the Brantolotes, but you needn’t be so alarmed. The Günter family is a branch of the Brantolote family and rear vassals to the Imperial house. So much like wolves protecting their young, you shall be safe so long as you do not mean them any harm.”</p>
<p>“…They did warn me, yes.”</p>
<p>Before they dispatched, Major General Richard told Shin that while the Strike Package was allowed to speak with the Myrmecoleo’s people, he should be cautious around them. He’d informed him about the rivalry they had with the Pyrope nobles during the final days of the Empire—the rivalry between the Imperial faction, which abided by the Imperial house, and the New Dynasty faction, which sought to usurp the hegemony.</p>
<p>Archduchess Brantolote was the leader of the New Dynasty faction. This made her an enemy to the Giadian Empire’s final empress, Augusta—known to precious few as Frederica.</p>
<p>Even with the Empire having fallen and the Federacy rising in its place, that had not changed. And one of the usurpers’ methods of establishing their legitimacy for the throne would be by wedding a woman of the old Imperial house. That meant that with Frederica being the empress, the New Dynasty faction had value in stealing her away.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the only reason Shin was so cautious around Gilwiese.</p>
<p>“His faction aside, I can’t bring myself to trust that man personally… I can’t really put my finger on it, but…”</p>
<p><a id="page-90"></a>Shin narrowed his eyes, thinking back on it. It’d happened during first meeting, back in the Federacy… He’d sensed something ominous from Gilwiese that dredged up undesired memories. It could perhaps be described as a sort of possession. As if the man moved in the name of his objective and nothing else, and so long as he could accomplish that, he wouldn’t mind dying.</p>
<p>“He reminds me of myself… Of the way I used to be in the Eighty-Sixth Sector…”</p>

</div>
<p class="space-break">As soon as <em>it</em> became apparent, Shiden approached Shin.</p>
<p>It was on their very first day in the Theocracy, the very day Shin heard <em>it</em>.</p>
<p>“Take me with you. It has to be me—I have to be the one to put <em>her</em> down.”</p>
<p>Shin’s ability had once been able to perceive every Legion unit across all battlefields of the Republic’s Eighty-Sixth Sector. His range was incredibly vast. Until they’d gone farther west from the Republic and reached the Theocracy’s land, he couldn’t hear the voices of the Legion here. But upon arriving, it became clear whether the Noctiluca had taken refuge from the Strike Package’s pursuit here or not.</p>
<p>“Shiden,” he said.</p>
<p>“Don’t bother hidin’ it from me. If that’s yer idea of being considerate, you should know it’s none of your business.”</p>
<p>Shiden was taller than most women, meaning her eyes met Shin’s on roughly the same level. She’d grabbed him by the collar and fixed him with a stern glare. His eyes were like frozen blood. During their first <a id="page-91"></a>meeting, she’d found the apathy behind his expression irritating, but now she outright hated it.</p>
<p>“I ain’t letting anyone take away the right to put her to rest. Not even you—”</p>
<p>Her odd eyes tore into him with the indignant rage of an injured animal. Coolly returning her stare, Shin spoke again.</p>
<p><em>“Shiden.”</em></p>
<p>It was the voice of the warrior god who once reigned over the Eighty-Sixth Sector’s battlefield—a sonorous, commanding voice. Shiden fell silent, like a child who had just been scolded. Using that moment of surprise, Shin shook free from her grasp, catching her own necktie and pulling her closer to him.</p>
<p>“Calm down. You said it yourself. I can’t let you join the operation the way you are now.”</p>
<p><em>The way you are now, we can’t let you be part of the attack force in the next operation,</em> Operations Commander.</p>
<p>Shiden had told Shin this before the Dragon Fang Mountain operation.</p>
<p>“You’ll defeat <em>her</em>, and then what? If you think you can just die after putting her to rest, I’m not taking you along. Because it’s not that you think it’s <em>fine</em> to die that way—you <em>want</em> to die that way. And I won’t bring someone with that kind of attitude along with me. All it takes is one idiot with a death wish to expose everyone else to danger.”</p>
<p><em>You’re a liability.</em></p>
<p>Shiden gritted her teeth. She understood what Shin was getting at. It frustrated her to admit it, but it was obvious. It was the right choice for a captain to make, for a commander. He couldn’t bring anyone whom he felt would jeopardize the mission. Any indignation or rage she might be feeling wasn’t something he could afford to take into consideration.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t because this operation in particular was some kind of difficult balancing act that bringing her along was a bad idea. Shin held the lives of everyone else in his hands no matter which battle they were headed for. He had to stay levelheaded.</p>
<p><a id="page-92"></a>But even if she realized it was the sensible choice, her feelings didn’t conform to that.</p>
<p><em>Who…the hell are you…to talk to me like you know anything about this…?</em></p>
<p>“Die while putting her to rest…? What the hell would <em>you</em> know about how that feels?!” she snarled at him.</p>
<p>“Everything,” Shin replied coldly. “I wanted to put my brother to rest during the Special Reconnaissance mission.”</p>
<p>Shiden widened her eyes in surprise. The Special Reconnaissance mission. An operation with a 0 percent survival rate, ordered by the Republic to ensure an Eighty-Six definitely died. A thinly veiled execution order that had been forced onto Shin two years ago.</p>
<p>The fact that he’d said he wanted to “put his brother to rest” meant that his brother, a fellow Eighty-Six, must have been assimilated by the Legion.</p>
<p>“I fought through the Eighty-Sixth Sector just to do that. And I intended to die as soon as I put him to rest… But I cheated death. I survived. And after that…well…you saw what I was like after the battle with the Morpho.”</p>
<p>A year ago, at dawn, after the battle where they hunted that gigantic dragon. He stood like a lost child in the midst of those azure metal butterflies, his pale-white Reginleif tattered and broken.</p>
<p>At the time, Shiden thought he looked unsightly.</p>
<p>“You called me pathetic. And if Lena hadn’t come to help, I’d have died a pitiful death back there. And that’s where you’re headed now… I’m not taking you with me. I won’t let someone like you march to your death.”</p>
<p>The moment this sort of person defeated their target, they would lose their reason to fight and their reason to live…and plummet to their deaths. He wouldn’t let that happen to her.</p>
<p>Shiden gritted her teeth. She then exhaled loudly, as if venting her emotions.</p>
<p>“…You love to talk shit even at times like these, don’t you? ‘Someone like me’? You coulda left that part out.”</p>
<p><a id="page-93"></a>Shin scoffed at her.</p>
<p>“The fact that it took you so long to mention that is exactly what I’m talking about. You’re not acting like yourself right now.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, sure, whatever you say. You’re always fucking right, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>She looked away from him with sarcasm in her eyes, scratching her head roughly. She’d gone back to being as thorny toward him as ever.</p>
<p>“…You’re right. I’m not myself right now. So I’ll fix that. I’ll go back to my usual self before the operation starts. So…”</p>
<p>She let the words out in a subdued voice, as if she was aware of the resentment billowing in the pit of her stomach, but she actively pushed it all away.</p>
<p>“…gimme a little more time before you decide to leave me behind, would ya?”</p>

<p class="space-break"><strong><span class="special">“Well, one way or another, I made it in time to join the advance battalion, but…”</span></strong></p>
<p>Having lost her squadron, Shiden’s Cyclops was currently accompanying the Nordlicht squadron. She was with the first group to dispatch, along with Shin and half the Spearhead squadron. Receiving that unexpected call from Shiden, Shin regarded Cyclops with a glance from inside Undertaker’s cockpit. He was in the midst of having the Armée Furieuse attached to his unit. An announcement in the Federacy’s language and then in the Theocracy’s language informed them that the advance battalion was about to depart. The hangar’s shutter opened, and the Processors confirmed that their canopies were sealed. Personnel without protective clothing evacuated to safe rooms.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“But what about Kurena? You sure about leaving her behind?”</span></strong></p>
<p>Her voice wasn’t teasing. It was concerned. Shin blinked. With a blaring buzz, the hangar’s frontal shutter opened sideways, and the ceiling folded back, revealing an ashen sky. Looking up at it through the optical screen, he replied:</p>
<p><a id="page-94"></a>“I’m not leaving her behind, and I don’t intend to, either. Kurena’s a sniper. She has a role to play elsewhere.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">Gunslinger’s familiar cockpit was full of console extensions and sub-windows. Conversion cords and nonstandard cables were roughly fixed into place with duct tape. But as cramped as the cockpit was, Kurena excitedly awaited the moment she’d set out.</p>
<p>As the Theocracy’s army carried out its diversion, the advance force was preparing to set out. Behind the advance force and further down the start-up order was the main force of the Federacy Expedition Brigade, lying hidden in a temporary hangar. There stood the familiar contours of the Reginleifs, as well as the crimson frames of the Free Myrmecoleo Regiment’s Vánagandrs.</p>
<p>Along with them was also the Federacy’s prototype railgun, the Trauerschwan. And fixed on the top of its frame was Gunslinger, with Kurena sitting inside it.</p>
<p>The Trauerschwan was built with the Morpho as its theoretical enemy, and so it was as massive as the Morpho itself, being over ten meters tall and with an overall length of over thirty meters. But unlike the Morpho and its resemblance to an evil dragon of legend, the Trauerschwan looked like a gigantic, crouching swan—if one were to look upon it so favorably.</p>
<p>It was, after all, a prototype pulled straight out of the lab. It wasn’t meant to be in real combat and was covered with dust shields that looked as if they’d been hurriedly applied to it. Its legs looked like a collection of random parts had been jumbled together, each with different coatings and degrees of discoloration. The control chambers for the legs stood asymmetrically on both parts, as if to show how hurriedly they’d been built after the fact. Multiple cords dangled out of them like blood vessels, which crawled up and connected into Gunslinger.</p>
<p>Since its combat-fire control system was incomplete, Gunslinger had to serve as its substitute.</p>
