<p>“…I might’ve gone too far,” Mika muttered.</p>
<p>She didn’t feel the slightest bit guilty about telling Kurena off, but Theo didn’t deserve that. Though she’d said he’d gotten off easy because he wasn’t dead…that was not true for him.</p>
<p>To the Eighty-Six, being rendered unable to battle was no better than death. It could even be worse. After all, fighting until one’s last breath was the pride of the Eighty-Six. To lose that was to lose the one thing that defined them above all else.</p>
<p>So yes, coming to this conclusion would make one stop talking altogether. After a moment of reflection, Mika realized she had crossed a line with Kurena.</p>
<p>“Hey, squirt, you wanna eat this instead?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not!”</p>
<p class="space-break2">Running out of the hangar, as if to escape Mika, Kurena felt her legs naturally carry her to the Stella Maris’s hospital block. To Shin. She wanted to hear his voice. To see his face.</p>
<p><em>…Kurena.</em></p>
<p>Just like those old times in the Eighty-Sixth Sector, when Kurena would be consumed by her rage and resentment toward the white pigs. He would always be there next to her, silently soothing her with his calm, serene voice.</p>
<p>Taking the last turn, Kurena stopped in her tracks. There was already someone else standing in front of the hospital room she was heading for. They had the bluish-silver locks of an Adularia and striking argent eyes. Their physique was large and burly, and they had a military chaplain’s armband on their sleeve.</p>
<p>“Ah, Reverend…”</p>
<p>The tall priest turned his large, bearlike head to face her. He was taller than Raiden, dwarfing even Daiya and Kujo. Kurena stood at an <a id="page-35"></a>average height for a girl, and he had to look down to meet her eyes. It was…</p>
<p>…just like the group of Alba who had looked down at Kurena and her older sister, sneering at them and their parents’ corpses.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>She could still feel them towering over her. At the time, she was small and young, and all adults felt like giants. But those men were like the tyrannical giants of myth. She stood frozen, the scene playing out in her mind. Muzzle flashes ripping through the dark of night. The air, thick with the scent of blood. Maddened, demonic laughter and glints of silver.</p>
<p>She felt all the blood drain from her face. Turning on her heel, Kurena fled.</p>
<p class="space-break2">After receiving a status report on the severely injured Processors, like Theo and Yuuto, Lena returned to the Stella Maris to pay a visit to the wounded. She was walking through the cramped corridors of the supercarrier. Just as she was about to enter the medical block, she almost bumped into Kurena, who was running out of it, and hurriedly evaded her.</p>
<p>Looking at her sprint away like a frightened rabbit, Lena saw her off with a dubious glance. Setting her gaze ahead again, she spotted the priest standing there silently.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” Lena hurried over to him. “That was impolite of her. My apologies, as her commander…”</p>
<p>“…No, it’s fine.” The priest shook his head and turned to face her. “Considering what those children had been put through, it wasn’t the least bit rude. It makes sense that she would fear my silver hair and eyes.”</p>
<p>Lena blinked a few times in surprise.</p>
<p>“She was…afraid of you?”</p>
<p>The Eighty-Six, Kurena included, always called the Alba white pigs and treated them with naked contempt, but she’d never seen them display fear.</p>
<p><a id="page-36"></a>“I think she was afraid of me, yes. A girl like her was forced into the internment camps when she was young… Seven years old, at my best guess. A child that small had been dragged and shouted at by grown adults. It must have been terrifying. She was exposed to overwhelming violence at that age and had no means of defending herself.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Lena fell into silence, ashamed of her ignorance. She had been raised in the First Sector, an area that, even long before the Legion War, had been primarily populated by Alba. She’d never seen the way the Eighty-Six were ferried to the internment camps. She’d imagined what it must have been like, but she never truly realized the intensity of the situation.</p>
<p>“…I think I see. It’s my height. It must have reminded her of when she was a child being looked down upon by an adult, and that was the trigger. I should make it a point not to look down on them like that again.”</p>
<p>“Reverend…”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t worry. I’m used to children being afraid of me. I mean, considering how large I am… When I first met the moody fellow asleep in this very room, he was just a little kitten. And let me tell you, he was scared for his life.”</p>
<p>He gave an exaggerated shrug, as if to make it clear he was joking. Between that gesture and the mental image of a younger Shin cowering before him, Lena found her smile again. The man had likely joked around because he’d sensed her shame, and she appreciated the gesture.</p>
<p>Speaking of…</p>
<p>“Is Shin…? Is Captain Nouzen asleep? This early?”</p>
<p>Given that both Lena and Kurena were walking around, it was clearly too soon for lights-out. The priest wordlessly stepped away from the door, allowing her to glance inside the room. And indeed, she could hear Shin’s faint, rhythmic breathing.</p>
<p>The lights were still on. He was in the back of the room, but the bed was hidden from sight by a curtain… Though, he did truly seem to be asleep.</p>
<p>“His injuries took their toll on him, and he had a whole discussion <a id="page-37"></a>with the other group commanders about pursuing the new Legion unit. It must have drained him.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Shin wasn’t just exhausted because of his injury. What happened to Theo put a lot of emotional strain on him as well. And still, Shin forced himself to fulfill his duty for the Strike Package. She knew he was prone to doing that, and that was why she came to check on him… But she couldn’t help feeling that he was pushing himself too hard.</p>
<p>“The military physician asked him to stay put today. Could you tell him off for me tomorrow?”</p>
<p>The request made Lena blink in surprise. She could do that, yes… But wouldn’t it hold more weight coming from his father figure?</p>
<p>“I think you should be the one to tell him that, Reverend…,” she said gently.</p>
<p>“He’s too old to listen to what the man who raised him has to say. And besides, having you of all people scold him would be the most effective.”</p>
<p>Seeing the meaningful, sidelong glance the priest directed at her, Lena felt her cheeks flush.</p>
<p><em>…Well, yes.</em></p>
<p>Raiden did say just about everyone knew already, so she realized it only made sense that the priest would know, too. It was still embarrassing, though. Seeing her eyes dart about, the priest softened his gaze.</p>
<p>“When I saw him leave the internment camp, that boy had forgotten how to laugh…or cry.”</p>
<p>Lena looked back at him, but he’d already turned toward the hospital room. His silver hair was fading into white, and his eyes were the color of the moon.</p>
<p>“I think your presence…is a big part of the reason he learned how to smile again.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">Kurena returned to her room. Anju, her roommate, was out. The adjacent room was Frederica’s, and the opposite room was Shiden’s.</p>
<p><a id="page-38"></a>…And Shiden’s roommate was Shana, who would never return.</p>
<p>TP, the black cat, had been loitering by the entrance and got to its feet upon noticing her. It tottered over to her, rubbed its head against her boots, and meowed. Kurena felt a small smile creep to her lips for the first time in a while.</p>
<p>“…Hey. I’m back.”</p>
<p>Scratching its head gently, she picked the cat up. Years ago, Daiya had discovered it in the Eighty-Sixth Sector. It was just a kitten at the time, and despite Daiya being the one who found it, it seemed to latch on to Shin instead for some reason. Whenever Shin took a break from his routine tasks between their days spent fighting the Legion, the kitten would sit in its fixed position next to him. It would playfully paw at the pages of any book Shin was reading, but he never shooed it away.</p>
<p>Looking after the cat naturally meant being next to Shin, so Kurena was always near the two of them. The captain’s room was a bit larger since it served as an office, and before long, everyone else came over to hang out.</p>
<p>“But now we…we hardly do anything like that anymore,” she told TP, not directing the words directly at the cat.</p>
<p>The black cat looked up at her, its eyes transparent in a way a human’s could never be. The base’s bedrooms and offices didn’t make the best hangouts. Instead, they had cafeterias, joint establishments, cafés, lounges, and recreation rooms. They were all more spacious than the captain’s small room back in the day, allowing them to accommodate so many more people</p>
<p>Each squadron naturally gathered in their own spot, but even still, it wasn’t the same as having a place reserved just for them. There were too many eyes around, and she’d be too embarrassed to play with a kitten with that many people looking at her.</p>
<p>Most of the time, Shin was with Kurena and the other Spearhead members in their reserved seats at the back of the lounge, but he’d started using the base’s study room more often. And before long, Raiden and Anju began doing the same, too. So did other Spearhead Processors.</p>
<p>“…Yeah, I know. I could just go with them.”</p>
<p><a id="page-39"></a>If she was that lonely, she could simply follow after them and join in. If she was refusing to let go of her pride, then that was all the more reason to head to that room, which signified a place outside the battlefield.</p>
<p>It wasn’t as if Shin, Raiden, or Anju had found anything particular to do outside of fighting. They were still only beginning to prepare, their eyes set on something vague that might exist beyond the scope of combat.</p>
<p>She could decide her future course so much later down the line. But still, she was scared. Every time she thought to go to the study room, her legs froze up. She was afraid she’d become aware of a future beyond the war. She didn’t want to think about it.</p>
<p>It was possible many Eighty-Six shared this same emotion. A fixation on the battlefield, and an ardent, obstinate rejection of the future looming outside it. For all they knew, the moment they stepped past the boundaries of that familiar place, they could find that they had no solid ground to tread on.</p>
<p>They could never count on the future to be there. They could have died on any given day. They might not even live to see the next day. Having spent so long on the battlefield with no support to rely on, the resignation that had nestled so deeply within them couldn’t be uprooted that easily.</p>
<p>They couldn’t bring themselves to believe it—that if they simply wished for it, a future of happiness could come as soon as the next day.</p>
<p>The cat meowed in her arms. Kurena hugged it, burying her face in its fur.</p>

<p class="space-break">Having concluded their duties, it was time for them to leave the Fleet Countries. But even on the day of their departure, the Strike Package’s Processors remained gloomy. They’d completed the initial operational objective given to them when they were first deployed here. The Noctiluca had escaped, yes, but that was an unexpected development. As such, driving it away was commendable in its own right.</p>
<p>Supposedly.</p>
<p><a id="page-40"></a>The seabirds cried, unaware of the storms and wars that had raged across the ocean. Their voices echoed off the Stella Maris. It was moored just off the coast, like a ghost ship. From a distance, it didn’t seem to be in bad shape, but it had sustained heavy internal damage that compromised its cruising capabilities.</p>
<p>After a decade of fighting, the diminutive Fleet Countries had depleted their already lacking national power and technological strength. They could no longer repair it.</p>
<p>The supercarrier had completed its secret voyage and final operation. There was no point to hiding it from the Legion’s sights in some covert port. And so it stood exposed off the shore. Its former crew, what few survivors remained from the Orphan Fleet, and even the townsfolk—they all looked as if the fire that had burned in them was snuffed out. The same fire they showed in the tumult of the festival before the voyage was gone, as if it had never been there.</p>
<p>“What are they gonna call themselves now? I mean, they can’t call themselves the Fleet Countries anymore.”</p>
<p>“Cut it out… You shouldn’t say that.”</p>
<p>“But I mean, what if—?”</p>
<p>What would we do if this had happened to us?</p>
<p>The young soldiers couldn’t help but ask themselves that question. They couldn’t simply see it as another country’s problem. After all, they’d once had everything taken away from them. When they were led to the internment camps, their very identities—all that they used to be was stripped away. All the precious things they managed to hold on to, the lives they could have lived…</p>
<p>And the takers didn’t care an ounce for any of it. So who was to say it wouldn’t happen again?</p>
<p>No one could promise that it wouldn’t.</p>
<p class="space-break2">Even back in the Eighty-Sixth Sector, Shin would often get hurt when he pulled crazy stunts in battle. So after years of being his lieutenant, Raiden had gotten used to handling paperwork out of necessity.</p>
<p><a id="page-41"></a>But unlike the Eighty-Sixth Sector, where they were treated as disposable parts, the Federacy saw them as valued soldiers. So Raiden wasn’t allowed to half-ass a report. Even with some of the staff officers taking over some of this work, there was still much to do.</p>
<p>Giving up on filling out a transport checklist, Raiden threw up his hands, ready to beg for assistance.</p>
<p>“Hey, sorry, could you give me a hand, Theo—?”</p>
<p>His eyes settled on Anju, who happened to be there. Holding back the urge to click his tongue, he simply looked up at the ceiling.</p>
<p><em>Right. He’s not here anymore.</em></p>
<p>He could see Anju smiling at him. There was a certain darkness behind her eyes that made it feel as if she could see that he was pushing himself.</p>
<p>“I’ll help, Raiden.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it.”</p>
<p>She reached out and took half the list. But as soon as she skimmed the first page with her sky-blue eyes, the final traces of light disappeared from her expression.</p>
<p>“…It ain’t easy to deal with. It’s harder than I thought,” Raiden said.</p>
<p>For both him and Anju, as well as Kurena, who wasn’t around at the moment…and, of course, Shin. The death of a friend was not an uncommon occurrence in the Eighty-Sixth Sector, and that fact hadn’t changed much since coming to the Federacy.</p>
<p>However, a friend surviving but being rendered unable to fight—that was new. It was an unbearable pain almost equal to death, and they couldn’t get used to it.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of his eye, Raiden could spot Anju biting down on her lip. A while back, Grethe had encouraged the ladies of the Strike Package to get into the habit of makeup, and many of them wound up enjoying it. By now, Raiden had gotten used to seeing them like this. Anju had applied a faint rouge to her pale-pink lips.</p>
<p>“Yeah… At some point, I’d stopped considering the possibility that we’d lose any of the five of us,” she admitted.</p>
<p class="space-break2"><a id="page-42"></a>Kurena hadn’t been willing to see it before the operation. But now that it was over, she found herself standing at the water’s edge. In an odd sort of role reversal, all her comrades had decided to abstain from coming here after returning. And so the shore was empty.</p>
<p>The day following the operation, the supercarrier’s crew and the townsfolk had all brought flowers to the shore to sympathize with the Processors, to the banks of the same sea that had swallowed up so many people—and Theo’s hand.</p>
<p>“…Kurena.”</p>
<p>Hearing a voice call her name, she turned around to find Shin standing there.</p>
<p>“I just barely managed to get permission to see Theo. I’m on my way there now… Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah!” She nodded hurriedly. “I’m fine now!”</p>
<p>Her voice was so cheery that it sounded off, even to her. Shin seemed to realize she was trying to gloss things over, but before he could say anything, Kurena spoke while looking into his considerate, bloodred eyes.</p>
<p>“Er, could you tell him I said I’m sorry…? When it happened, I was no help at all…”</p>
<p>She’d frozen up and couldn’t shoot. Both when they were fighting the Phönix and when they were trying to stop the Noctiluca. Even though assisting her comrades was her reason for being.</p>
<p>“If only I could’ve gotten it together back then, Theo would have—”</p>
<p>“Kurena.” Shin’s somber tone cut her off.</p>
<p>As she looked back, she noticed he was grimacing, as if enduring an unseen agony.</p>
<p>“It’s not your fault. It’s no one’s fault.”</p>
<p>The fact that Shana died. The fact that Shana had to fight.</p>
<p><em>Yeah…</em></p>
<p>“…Yeah. But I definitely didn’t have my act together.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t perform, and because of that, Theo, and Shana…even <a id="page-43"></a>Shin… If only she had been better, things would have turned out differently. At least, that was how she felt.</p>
<p>Because if that wasn’t true, it meant that she couldn’t have saved anyone to begin with. And she desperately didn’t want that to be the case… The realization filled her mind like a chill running through her body.</p>
<p>If she was useless in battle…then that would mean she had no place standing beside the man facing her now.</p>
<p>“I’ll do it right next time. I’ll fight. I won’t fail again, so…”</p>
<p>“Kurena.”</p>
<p>“…don’t abandon me.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">The sunlight filtered through the curtains and into the hallway of the military hospital, casting a stripe of faint light onto the floor. Walking through the parquet corridor, Shin thought back to Kurena’s words.</p>
<p><em>If only I could have gotten it together back then, Theo would have—</em></p>
<p><em>But I definitely didn’t have my act together.</em></p>
<p>She’d tried to hide it, but her expression was that of an abandoned child on the verge of bursting into tears.</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t help feeling the same way. What if he hadn’t fallen off the Mirage Spire when he engaged the Phönix? If one were to ask who was to <em>blame</em> for what happened in that battle, he would say that responsibility rested solely with the squad captain. Lena and Ishmael would each insist that the blunder was on their end, but Shin couldn’t agree with that.</p>
<p>But while his heart wanted to shout out and admit it was all his fault, some sober part of his mind reasoned that he wasn’t really to blame. Regardless of whether he fell or not, the end result probably wouldn’t have been much different. Undertaker would have been just as helpless as everyone else in the face of the Noctiluca.</p>
<p>If he’d been there, the one thing that would have changed is that they wouldn’t have had to waste time figuring out the position of the <a id="page-44"></a>control core, but the Stella Maris would have still needed to get closer and fire its main gun. That would have required taking out the railguns, meaning a battle on the Noctiluca’s deck would have been unavoidable.</p>
<p>But more than anything, Shin wouldn’t have predicted the Noctiluca’s final shot. Using Liquid Micromachines to revive the silenced barrel was something he couldn’t have guessed. Either way, someone would have had to jump into the line of fire to prevent the Stella Maris from taking a hit.</p>
<p>And so the only difference was that he might have taken up that role instead. And thinking that his presence would have been the one thing to tip the scales…would have been arrogant of him, to say the least.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the hospital room number he’d been given, he saw a person leaning against the door. The figure had blond hair, which had been faded by the salt air of the ocean, and wore the Fleet Countries’ indigo-navy uniform.</p>
<p>“Hey.” He greeted Shin with a raised hand.</p>
<p>Shin simply nodded. Ishmael threw a glance at the door behind him.</p>
<p>“The Fleet Countries will take responsibility for the badly injured until they’ve healed enough to be transported. That includes the kid… He can’t exactly move, but he’s used to pain by now. He should be able to hear you, at any rate.”</p>
<p>“Yeah… Look after him for us,” Shin said, bowing his head deeply.</p>
<p>He could tell that Ishmael had nodded gravely in response. Watching his indigo-navy silhouette walk down the corridor, Shin opened the door to the hospital room.</p>
<p>The place was small, but still spacious. The windows were open just a crack, allowing a bit of the sea breeze to roll in. Theo was seated on the bed, looking outside. Hearing the creaking of the door, he turned toward it. Upon seeing Shin, the somewhat faraway, distant gaze in his jade-green eyes seemed to regain its focus, and he blinked once.</p>
<p>“Shin… Are you okay to walk already?”</p>
<p>“I think <em>I</em> should be the one asking you how <em>you</em> feel… But yes. I can move, if nothing else.”</p>
<p><a id="page-45"></a>“Yeah? That’s good to hear.”</p>
<p>Despite being so injured that he wasn’t allowed to check out of the hospital yet, Theo seemed relatively relaxed. Realizing that Shin was deliberately not returning the question, he carried on as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“For now, they’re saying there’s no risk of infection,” Theo said.</p>
<p>His jade eyes had an emptiness to them that conveyed a sense of apathy. It was as if he wasn’t looking at anything at all.</p>
<p>“It was a pretty clean cut, I guess. So it closed up really easily and doesn’t hurt that much anymore. It just feels weird, y’know? Something feels off even when I sit down, but it’s especially bad when I stand. It’s like my balance is off. Even though…”</p>
<p>He looked down at his left side, where his now-bandaged arm had been severed between the wrist and the elbow, and he flashed a feeble, self-deprecating grin.</p>
<p>“…I didn’t lose a whole lot. Just one little hand, heh.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Turns out arms are pretty heavy. You don’t really think about it when they’re attached, but our bodies weigh a few dozen kilos, and our arms count for around ten percent of that total weight. So yeah, it’s a lot.”</p>
<p>His jade eyes remained fixed on where his missing hand should have been.</p>
<p>“You know, once… Back in the Eighty-Sixth Sector, before I even met you, one of my squad mates had their whole arm blown off in battle. And I had to pick it up. I should have remembered how heavy an arm could be, because I had to pick one up once… But I forgot.”</p>
<p>He’d forgotten the weight because the past event had never fully registered for him. Or perhaps, he’d simply forgotten the ease with which one could suffer such a loss. Whether it was the loss of a hand or the loss of one’s will to fight, misfortune picked its victims indiscriminately.</p>
<p>“…And that squad mate of mine—he died after that. He was no longer able to fight, so he wasn’t given any treatment… He just bled out.”</p>
<p>That was what medical treatment in the Eighty-Sixth Sector <a id="page-46"></a>amounted to. After all, the Eighty-Six weren’t seen as human. Light injuries were treated just so that anyone who could return to active duty did. But those who had suffered grave wounds and would require hospitalization were left unattended. Even in cases where proper medical treatment would have saved their lives. The Republic hated nothing more than wasting resources to mend broken tools.</p>
<p>“I…can’t fight anymore,” Theo said, staring fixedly at a wound so similar to the one suffered by an old comrade Shin never knew.</p>
<p>A wound that would have been disregarded. A wound that, outside the Eighty-Sixth Sector, had been treated as if it was a matter of course.</p>
<p>“But I don’t have to die. I was saved, and no one’s telling me to finish myself off, either… This really isn’t the Eighty-Sixth Sector. I’ve really left that battlefield behind. It took me this long to realize it, but now…it finally feels real.”</p>
<p>At long last, they had been freed from the prison where they’d waited out their five-year sentence, having nothing to look forward to but the release of a warrior’s death. No matter how much control over their fates they tried to grasp, the stage of their deaths had all but been decided—yet still, they made it out. The immutable fate of the Eighty-Six had been challenged and defeated.</p>
<p>“All that’s left is for me to break the chains that bind me to that place.”</p>
<p>To free themselves from the burden…from the belief that the only path they could walk was one of pain and death. That was the final hurdle.</p>
<p>“…It’s fine. I’ll keep living, and I’ll definitely find happiness. If I don’t, I’d never be able to face the captain, not to mention everyone who died before us.”</p>
<p>“That’s—”</p>
<p>“I know. It sounds like I’m cursing myself, right? But it’s the only thing I can hold on to now.”</p>
<p>Fighting to the very end was the pride of the Eighty-Six. It was how they left their mark, their proof of existence. But this was no longer possible for Theo. So all he had left was…</p>
<p><a id="page-47"></a>“If I let this feeling shackle me, it really will become a curse. But if I only hold on to it until I find my own something…my own someone…like you did…then it’ll be a dream. I’m sure the captain would grant me that much…because I think that he would have wanted me to be happy.”</p>
<p>“…Theo.” Shin parted his lips, unable to endure it any longer.</p>
<p>He knew that he probably should have just stood there and listened, but…it was too much.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to strain yourself like this… You don’t have to pretend everything’s fine.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Theo contorted his expression into a tearful smile. He knew Shin didn’t come here for <em>this</em>.</p>
<p>“I know… Let me bluff, though. I’ve been leaning on you for so long… From now on…”</p>
<p><em>…don’t let me rely on you any longer. Don’t tell me I can depend on you.</em></p>
<p>“…I’m sorry. For having you be our Reaper… It must have been such a heavy burden to bear.”</p>
<p>To carry the names and hearts of all his fallen comrades until he reached his final destination. For Theo and everyone else who fought alongside Shin, this was precious salvation. But for Shin, who was relied upon by all his comrades, it was an indescribable burden.</p>
<p>“Thank you. For everything. And I’m sorry. Really.”</p>
<p>Shin reflexively made to deny his words, but he reconsidered for a moment and fell silent. He wanted to deny the existence of any burden. But that wasn’t true.</p>
<p>“Yeah… It was a lot to carry. It really was. From beginning to end.”</p>
<p>Being relied upon, entrusted with all those feelings.</p>
<p>“And because of how heavy it was, I felt like I couldn’t simply let myself die and throw it all away. I didn’t break down along the way because so many people trusted me… I’ve been relying on you in the same way. Feeling like I could be that person for everyone made everything easier.”</p>
<p>Being relied upon was what kept him going. He felt as if the comfort and relief he offered others was his own salvation. This sort of <a id="page-48"></a>relationship was a difficult one to maintain. Each and every one of them was a heavy burden, because they were all that dear to him.</p>
<p>After a long silence, as if scrutinizing Shin’s answer, Theo finally nodded.</p>
<p>“…I see.” He nodded a second time, deeply and profoundly. “So even that was helpful for something. In that case…”</p>
<p>He looked up, his green eyes once again helpless and lost but ever so slightly relieved and bright.</p>
<p>“…then you’ll be fine without me, right?”</p>
<p>“We won’t be fine. But yeah…we’ll manage.”</p>
<p>“I think I can manage now, too. I’m…just the tiniest bit relieved. The pride of the Eighty-Six won’t become my curse.”</p>
<p>He didn’t have to let the pride of the Eighty-Six guide him to a future where all that awaited him as a reward for his efforts was death. Instead, he would let the captain’s prayer become his curse, so that the battlefield would not become his grave.</p>
<p>“For now, let’s try our hardest… So that when the going gets tough, we can ask each other for support.”</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be a one-sided relationship, like they’d had until now, with only one of them relying on the other. This time, they’d be equals.</p>
<p>“Until that day comes, I hope I’ll be able to say you can trust me during the hard times.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">Leaving the military hospital, Shin knew he had to begin preparations for his return to duty as operations commander. And still, one way or another, he found himself wandering through the halls of the base, before stopping in front of the leviathan-skeleton model. When he first saw it as a child, it was as if he was admiring the bones of a mythical creature.</p>
<p>Over a decade had passed since that day, but even now, looking up at it made him feel like he was looking at a dragon’s skeleton. Even now, when he’d seen a true tyrant of the seas, large enough to make this skeleton seem like a baby by comparison.</p>
<p><a id="page-49"></a><em>Then you’ll be fine without me, right?</em></p>
<p>“…Will we?”</p>
<p>He’d told Theo they’d manage, but honestly, he wasn’t even sure that was true. He couldn’t show that kind of weakness to Theo, so he said what he said, but he wasn’t confident in the answer.</p>
<p>Because there was nothing he could do. The ending that Theo faced, the loss that he had suffered in his final battle, was one that Shin couldn’t do anything about. There was no changing the past. Some things were beyond even Shin, and this was something he could do nothing about.</p>
<p>Not now, and not ever.</p>
<p>The dragon skeleton above him didn’t answer, of course. Letting out a sigh, Shin turned around when he suddenly found Lena standing opposite him. Taken by surprise, he blinked a few times.</p>
<p>“…What’s wrong?” he asked.</p>
<p>“What do you mean…? You were late, so I got worried,” Lena replied.</p>
<p>She walked over to him with a strained smile, but her expression was clearly a facade. Lena had known Theo long enough. True, she’d only known him by his voice for much of it, but they’d still held a connection for several months. His leaving the line of battle weighed heavily on Lena, too.</p>
<p>“How was Theo…?”</p>
<p>“He’s putting on a brave face… He said he’d be okay and that I shouldn’t let him rely on me.”</p>
<p>Theo said that, even though no one would fault him for lashing out. Shin had gone to see him to give him a chance to let out all those pent-up, unresolved emotions—but Theo wouldn’t allow it.</p>
<p>“That’s…what he said, hmm?” Lena said, standing next to him.</p>
<p>With her silver eyes, she followed Shin’s gaze up to the skeleton specimen.</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine the pain…”</p>
<p>She didn’t specify who or what she meant. She was likely talking about both of them. The pain of Theo’s loss… The pain of Shin’s helplessness…</p>
<p><a id="page-50"></a>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>If not for the source of comfort and warmth at his side, he might have been unable to nod at these words. And once he acknowledged them, reality became too much to bear.</p>
<p>“I thought maybe…I could do something for him.</p>
<p>This was the sentiment of the Reaper…who put his loved ones above all else…</p>
<p>“If nothing else, I wanted to protect his heart. But when the time really came, I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t find a single word to comfort him. I tried to think, <em>What should I do? What could I do to help him…?</em>”</p>
<p>But nothing came to mind.</p>
<p>“…I’m sorry. I ended up venting to you.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be… That’s why I came.”</p>
<p>Lena looked up into his bloodred eyes, which were so unusually fragile. As if to silently affirm that he was safe with her.</p>
<p><em>You can’t save everyone. You can’t shoulder every single burden.</em></p>
<p>Shin probably knew this better than anyone. Theo’s choices and outcomes were his alone to bear. And Shin understood that, too. But still, he couldn’t help feeling that this should never have happened. That this outcome was one that filled him with sorrow. And those feelings weren’t mistaken.</p>
<p>The fact that he could openly confess his pain, and the fact that his own powerlessness was crushing him—this just served as proof of how much Theo meant to Shin. And that emotion could never be invalidated.</p>
<p>That was why expressing it wasn’t pitiful. She wouldn’t think any less of him for it.</p>
<p>“Depend on me. If you’re suffering, lean on me. I’ll support you. We can shoulder every burden together. Whenever you’re sad or in pain, I’ll…I’ll protect you.”</p>
<p>He was a kind person. A person pained by the misfortune of others. But that kindness wore him down. It ate away at him until he could no longer bear it.</p>
<p><a id="page-51"></a>“Shin, from now on, I’ll be by your side in those hard times. I’ll always be with you.</p>
<p><em>I’ll never leave you behind. I won’t make you sad. I’ll be the one person you can trust to never hurt you. And…</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">“I love you, too.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“I want to spend my life with you. I want to see the sea again, and this time, I want it to be with you. I want us to see the sea you spoke of, together.”</p>
<p>The unforgiving northern sea, glowing a soft blue. The southern sea in summer, its waters lit with myriad colors. The fireworks of the Revolution Festival. The autumn and winter sceneries of the Federacy, which Lena hadn’t experienced yet. Touring the United Kingdom and witnessing the northern lights, as they said they would. Viewing the Alliance’s picturesque scenery. The countless cities and countries they’d never visited, which lay beyond the Legion’s territories.</p>
<p>To visit the Eighty-Sixth Sector one more time and see its flowers bloom.</p>
<p>To see everything he’d wished to show her far beyond the battlefield.</p>
<p>“I want to see things I’ve never seen before with you. I want to admire your smile as you show them to me. I want to share all those emotions. All the joy, all the sorrow. Forever… If possible.”</p>
<p><em>So you can tell me of the pain you’re harboring now. So you can, one day, share with me the story behind that scar around your neck.</em></p>
<p>She ran both hands along his scar, standing on tiptoe to bring her lips to his. Despite her touching the scar he’d always hidden with his uniform’s collar, Shin didn’t reject her. Instead, he wrapped his hands around her waist with all the delicacy in the world and drew her in closer.</p>
<p>His lips, which he had bitten down on far too often, tasted faintly of blood. For a moment, she thought she detected the bitter taste of tears. The tears he had refused to shed in front of her. The tears he would not let anyone see. So as if to wipe them away, she kissed him.</p>
<p><a id="page-52"></a>Like the kiss of an oath, a promise made before God. Like the kiss of a prince, which was said to bring about miracles.</p>
<p>Hers was the oath’s kiss, a promise made to the Reaper. Hers was the Bloodstained Queen’s kiss, to bring forth a miracle.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, together, beyond this battlefield. Let’s outlast this bloody war. Let’s see this through to the end. Together.”</p>
<p>Until death did they part?</p>
<p>No. They would not wish for such finite happiness. The winds of war, upon which traveled death itself, were persistent and spiteful and would scatter so weak a wish all too easily.</p>
<p>No, not even death could keep them apart.</p>
<p>“I’ll always wait for your return. I’ll never leave you behind…”</p>
<p>It would be nothing short of a miracle to keep such a promise on this battlefield of certain death. But because this was a wish that they were determined to grant for each other, it became an oath.</p>
<p>“…so I need you to always return to my side.”</p>
<p>No matter how tumultuous the battles ahead of them might be, he would have to escape the verge of death.</p>
<p>“I need you to come back to me. Safe and sound.”</p>
