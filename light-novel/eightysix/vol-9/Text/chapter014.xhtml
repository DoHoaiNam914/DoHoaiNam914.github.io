<p><a id="page-109"></a><a id="page-110"></a>The warrior deity who led that army of ghosts also doubled as a soul reaper who governed over the souls of dead soldiers. The war dead gathered under that god, offering up their souls to march in glorious battle under his service forevermore.</p>
<p><em>But how did the warrior deity feel about that?</em></p>
<p>Shaking his head once, Gilwiese got his Vánagandr to rise to its feet. It was a unit dyed in the Myrmecoleo Regiment’s unique cinnabar coating, as opposed to the Federacy’s usual metallic color. The Personal Mark on its side was that of a sea turtle with the head of a calf—identifier: Mock Turtle.</p>
<p>“Mock Turtle to all units—we’re heading out, too.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">The silver flakes covering the Mantle of Frigga and the Juggernaut’s exterior were, in fact, Eintagsfliege wings. Or to be exact, they were imitations modeled after them. The Strike Package had successfully raided and conquered Legion production bases in the past. One among them was the Dragon Fang Mountain base, where they’d taken custody of Zelene. During that time, they’d also taken some samples, which then were used to create this device.</p>
<p>Metallic-foil hawk feathers that disturbed, refracted, and absorbed all manner of electromagnetic waves, including light. During their development in the Alliance, they were given the moniker <em>Whitehawk Plumes</em>.</p>
<p>The Mantle’s electromagnetic-disruption capabilities allowed it to hide the Reginleifs both from the Rabe, which flew high above them and was equipped with an antiair radar, and the earthbound Stachelschwein’s radar.</p>
<p>But an aircraft’s jet-engine intake would still suck up the feathers, which would destroy the engine much like the Eintagsfliege did. Instead, the Mantle used rocket boosters, which didn’t need to take in air for its combustion and could fly through these clouds of silver feathers. However, it was too ineffective to fill in for a jet engine. The only thing it could do was launch things that were lighter than a fighter jet, propelling them in a one-way trip.</p>
<p><a id="page-111"></a>As the Reginleifs soared through the air, the temperatures outside their units were low enough to freeze one’s lungs at this altitude. Shin inspected his altimeter. The rocket engine finished its combustion and, with its task done, was jettisoned from the Mantle.</p>
<p>In its place, a pair of wings and propellers meant for gliding unfolded and deployed. The rocket engine was highly inefficient for actual flight. Even the Federacy military rarely used it for its aircraft, only utilizing them to achieve the needed altitude and gather kinetic energy, which would be used for gliding down. And so the Reginleifs would descend from the air, like an army of ghosts.</p>
<p>The artificial wings caught the wind, turning the units’ trajectory from an ascent to a lax descent. Shin felt his blood and organs shift upward, which induced an odd, unfamiliar sense of floating. He tensed up—humans were flightless creatures, and being at such altitudes filled them with an instinctual fear of falling and crashing from a great height.</p>
<p>They swooped diagonally down the frigid sky. The airborne units began their rapid descent into the depths of enemy territory.</p>

<p class="space-break">Even on this far-northern battlefield, reports from Legion patrol units that had engaged enemy forces were swiftly picked up by the Rabe soaring in the heavens. Upon receiving one such report from a Tausendfüßler moving swiftly through the front lines for resupplying purposes, the Rabe didn’t panic. It simply paused for a moment before deciding on a directive.</p>
<div class="ecom_a2">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Remains of a unit not registered in the database detected. Presumed to be a rocket engine.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>And yet there were no reports of any enemies infiltrating the relevant sector. Neither the Ameise keeping watch over the front lines nor the Stachelschwein watching over the skies of the rear areas noticed anything. And the Rabe’s own radar didn’t pick up anything, either.</p>
<p>But given the temperature of the discovered engine, it hadn’t been long since it’d been ignited and fell. It couldn’t have been an undiscovered <a id="page-112"></a>engine belonging to some unknown, downed unit. Which meant it was likely discarded en route.</p>
<p>This came from an airborne attack that used some kind of electromagnetic-interference mechanism to deceive the radar.</p>
<p>It was likely similar to the Legion’s own tactic of attaching rocket boosters and gliders to the Ameise to allow them to soar in from above. In which case, the objective of the enemy unit would be…</p>
<div class="ecom_a2">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Eagle Five to Plan Ferdinand. Enemy-unit infiltration confirmed.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>The Rabe sent an alert to their trump card, which was positioned in the back of the Legion’s lines, rather than being on the offensive. This was an airborne advance on the depths of the Legion’s territories. It couldn’t have been done simply in the name of disturbing the front lines.</p>
<div class="ecom_a2">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Enemy objective presumed to be the destruction or capture of Plan Ferdinand. Remain alert.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Plan Ferdinand to Eagle Five. Acknowledged.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Integrated features activated. Colare Synthesis, activation standby.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;<em>Melusine</em> One, combat activation standby.&gt;&gt;</p>

<p class="space-break">“They noticed us.”</p>
<p>Shin squinted as he heard the Halcyon’s howl, revealing that it was combat operational. Still, it didn’t appear that its optical sensors or indeed any antiair units seemed to have fixed on them. The Legion likely had found a jettisoned engine. The Whitehawk Plumes should have kept the Reginleifs concealed even at this short distance. Meanwhile, a large, metallic shadow was coming into view. They were above their planned landing position.</p>
<p>Of course, Shin’s ability to hear the ghosts had been faintly detecting the Halcyon’s howling for a good while now.</p>
<p>“…If I knew this was going to happen, I’d have mastered using <a id="page-113"></a>this thing sooner,” Shin whispered. He spoke silently enough so that it wouldn’t be picked by the Para-RAID as he regarded Shiden’s Cyclops with a glance.</p>
<p>Their descent continued as the Halcyon’s massive frame grew closer beneath them. Much like how the Phönix used the Eintagsfliege for optical camouflage, the Mantle of Frigga deceived even the rays of visible light given off by radar. The Legion’s blue optical sensors still couldn’t detect the Reginleifs. Under the Mantle’s protection, the Feldreß veered toward the adjacent high-rise buildings.</p>
<p>Their touchdown point was the ruins of a former Theocracy military base, which had been built over what was once a city. The buildings were like gigantic grave markers, and they hid Undertaker and the other Reginleifs from the Halcyon’s sight. The ashen ground grew closer and closer. Coupled with Shin’s altimeter, a pair of deceleration wings flapped open, rapidly curbing the unit’s falling speed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Mantle of Frigga, disengaged.”</span></strong></p>
<p>A holo-window’s display lit up, and the unit’s gliding wings and fairings closed. Immediately after, a powerful force shook the Reginleif. The intense impact of the landing ran through the fuselage as it kicked up a cloud of volcanic ash.</p>
<p>The snow-white Valkyries had descended upon the battlefield of ash and silver.</p>
