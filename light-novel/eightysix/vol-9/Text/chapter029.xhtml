<p>She loved him, like a brother.</p>
<p><em>My…kind, precious Reaper.</em></p>
<p>“So that’s why…”</p>
<p>She wanted the path of her comrade, her family, the person she cared about most in the world to be blessed. It was, perhaps, the single most natural, obvious wish one could harbor for another. Even with the world being what it was, wishing for this was to be expected.</p>
<p>“…you have to be happy. You have to find happiness,” Kurena told him with a smile.</p>
<p>Shin remained silent for a brief moment. He was torn between the answer he wanted to give her and the words he could direct at himself. And after remaining silent and coming to terms with those conflicting feelings, he eventually said one thing.</p>
<p>No matter what he wanted to tell her, he couldn’t answer Kurena’s feelings, so he said the one thing he was allowed to say.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be. After all, up until now…”</p>
<p>And even now. And probably always.</p>
<p>“…I’ve never once regretted loving you.”</p>
