<p><a id="page-95"></a><a id="page-96"></a>It was even more unsightly than the Republic’s Juggernaut, which was often referred to as an aluminum coffin. But Kurena was satisfied at the prospect of handling this ugly weapon. She found herself humming a happy little tune. She dangled her legs cheerfully, like a small child excited to go out on a trip.</p>
<p>Because she was happy. Kurena was glad to have been entrusted with this.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Kurena.”</p>
<p>When Shin handed her the manual for the Trauerschwan, Kurena felt as if he’d just given her an invitation to a fairy-tale ball. A charming evening party at a moonlit castle, magical enough to pull her out of her cinder-covered rags. An enchanted ball where, for one night, only she could wear a silver dress and glass slippers.</p>
<p>The manual was a bundle of files and had no binding; indeed, it was an impromptu manual made up on the spot. But it didn’t matter. Her heart leaped with joy as she accepted it.</p>
<p>“As discussed at the briefing, we’re letting you serve as the Trauerschwan’s gunner.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…!”</p>
<p>They were in the corridor of a residential block in the Theocracy; it had been assigned to the Strike Package and was located in an army base on the rear of the Theocracy’s northern front. The corridor was also a pearl-gray color. The passageways were octagonally shaped, and the fragrance of burned incense seemed to linger in the air. The smell of eaglewood filled the area, as if to drown out the stench of blood and steel.</p>
<p>The prototype railgun, Trauerschwan. The overall factors and unresolved problems surrounding its features were explored during the briefing. It was, when all was said and done, a prototype that wasn’t meant for live combat. It could fire, but its fire-control system was incomplete. It also lacked a cooling system, which was essential for enduring prolonged combat.</p>
<p>It did have an automatic-reload mechanism, but that was also a <a id="page-97"></a>prototype and required two hundred seconds to successfully reload. As sluggish as the enemy’s movement speed was, the most the Trauerschwan could fire was one or two shots. And with a human handling the sight correction, it was absolutely necessary that the shots be accurate.</p>
<p>And he was leaving this crucial duty solely in her hands.</p>
<p>Shin still trusted her. Shin still needed her. This proved it, and it made her happy.</p>
<p>Her heart fluttered with excitement. She felt like right now, she could hit the smallest possible target at the longest possible distance right on the bull’s-eye.</p>
<p>But at the same time, though her heart was full to bursting, some icy corner of it warned her that she couldn’t afford to fail this time. This thought lurked in the back of her mind like an ominous glacier.</p>
<p>That glacier was her unease. In truth, she was incredibly anxious. After all, he trusted her to the point where he’d place this immense responsibility squarely on her shoulders. He believed she was good enough. She couldn’t let him down, no matter what.</p>
<p>She couldn’t betray his trust.</p>
<p>This time for sure, she would be useful to Shin and the others.</p>
<p>“I can do this.”</p>
<p>She said the words as if reaffirming her oath to fight to her last breath alongside everyone else. She hugged the manual, clutching it to her chest as if she feared someone might take it from her.</p>
<p>In a way, it was all she had. Other than her pride and the skills she’d honed for the sake of remaining by his side, she had nothing else.</p>
<p>“This time, I won’t miss, no matter what. So you can rest easy. I got this.”</p>
<p>Shin furrowed his brow, concerned.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. I trust you… I won’t abandon you.”</p>
<p><em>Don’t abandon me.</em></p>
<p>Those words had left Kurena’s lips just as they retreated from the Fleet Countries. She had voiced her deep desire to cling to him.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know that.” Kurena nodded with a smile, like she’d expected him to say that. “I really do. But I’m an Eighty-Six, too.”</p>
<p><a id="page-98"></a>She was someone who would fight to the very end.</p>
<p>“Fighting to the death is our pride, and I want to protect that pride, too.”</p>
<p>But when she said this, Shin’s expression became racked with pain. She had said those words to him when they left the Fleet Countries behind, and he had responded with a similar look. After a moment of contemplation, unsure of whether or not to speak his mind this time, he parted his lips.</p>
<p>“You said we didn’t have to change, right?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p><em>If it’s hard on you, you don’t have to force yourself to change.</em></p>
<p>“If you don’t want to change, you can stay the way you are. That’s fine. But if you think you <em>can’t</em> change… If you hold on to that pride like a curse—”</p>
<p>Shin’s eyes seemed to be more alive than they had been in the Eighty-Sixth Sector or on the United Kingdom’s battlefield. In the United Kingdom, it felt like he was spurred by fragile unease to walk on a tightrope, to teeter on the razor’s edge. And in the Eighty-Sixth Sector, his bloodred eyes were as cold as the surface of a frozen sea.</p>
<p>But at some point, that ice had thawed, and he’d become like the serene surface of a lake. Kurena could see herself reflected in those eyes. They looked upon her with concern, as if enduring a deep pain.</p>
<p>He was right in front of her, so why…why did he feel so far away?</p>
<p>“—then that’s a burden you don’t need to force yourself to carry.”</p>

<p class="space-break"><strong><span class="special">“Catapult-rail cooling complete. All joints confirmed locked. Final checklist complete.”</span></strong></p>
<p>The legs let out a loud, metallic screech as they rotated. They carried the weight of two elongated, ninety-meter-long rails and their plow-shaped recoil absorbers.</p>
<p>Back in the hangar, the rails had been folded back like wings, but now they were deployed and thrust upward, like spearheads pointing at <a id="page-99"></a>the heavens. Even without accounting for the rails, the machine’s overall length was forty meters, standing toe to toe with the Morpho’s impressive stature.</p>
<p>Its coating was neither the Federacy’s typical metallic coloring, nor the dark brown of its home nation, the Alliance. It was gunmetal black, the color of the Ghost Riders, the spectral soldiers who marched in the dead of night.</p>
<p>The Eighty-Six had seen similar sights several times before. This was like the mechanism that’d been used to launch the Federacy’s ground-effect winged vehicle, the Nachzehrer, during the Morpho pursuit operation, as well as the Legion support unit they’d pillaged during the United Kingdom operation, the Zentaurs. And finally, a similar mechanism was used in the catapult on the Stella Maris’s flight deck to launch shipborne planes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Mk. 1 Armée Furieuse launching preparations complete.”</span></strong></p>
<p>The Reginleifs, resembling twenty-four pitch-black wyverns, stood slowly upon the rails.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“It might be a little too late in the game to ask this, but you were dispatched to the Strike Package as an instructor, right, Captain Olivia?”</p>
<p>Because Raiden had to take over the chain of command in case the captain was out of commission, he couldn’t launch at the same time as Shin. The latter led the 1st Platoon, while Raiden led the 2nd Platoon of the advance force.</p>
<p>The Juggernauts in Shin’s platoon sat upon the Armée Furieuse’s catapult, awaiting the order to deploy. They stood over ten meters above the ground, where Raiden was. As he looked up, he shifted his focus to the 3rd Platoon, where a single brown Stollenwurm stood among the white units.</p>
<p>Theo had served as the 3rd Platoon’s vanguard, and someone had to fill the void left in his absence. To that end, Olivia, who was a melee-combat specialist, joined the fold. It was a welcome contribution, but…</p>
<p>“Should you be part of a live combat unit? And the advance group, at that…”</p>
<p><a id="page-100"></a><strong><span class="special">“…Well, is there a rule that states that an instructor can’t fight on the front lines?”</span></strong></p>
<p>Olivia replied while braiding up his hair inside Anna Maria. Raiden could hear the sound of his hair shuffling around as he tied it behind his head, and the sound of the string straining against his fingers. It sounded awfully close to the sound of an ancient swordsman unsheathing their blade or an archer pulling the string of their bow.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“This is the Armée Furieuse’s inaugural battle, and the advance unit will be the first to make use of the Mantle in live combat. As an experienced operator of the Mantle, as well as your instructor, it only makes sense that I join you.”</span></strong></p>
<p class="space-break2">In the militaristic United Kingdom, martial prowess was the pride of royalty, and even princes piloted Feldreß. The same held true for Vika’s lieutenant and representative in this mission, Zashya. If need be, it was the duty of a noble daughter of Roa Gracia to protect her liege’s heir and territory. Learning how to pilot a Feldreß or wield a firearm in the same way as the most common foot soldier was not seen as shameful, but as a virtue to be praised.</p>
<p>“Ma’am. We’ve applied as much armor as weight limitations would allow, but Alkonosts are lightly armored units. Please keep that in mind as you fight.”</p>
<p>“I am aware. Thank you, Captain.”</p>
<p>Zashya had replied to her subordinate’s respectful warning from her position in the advance force. Her hair was tied into two braids, and her violet eyes were hidden behind a pair of glasses. She usually used her own unique Barushka Matushka, which was specialized for communication disruption and electronic warfare.</p>
<p>But a Barushka Matushka was too heavy a unit to be part of the advance force. So instead, she joined the front in an Alkonost that had electronic-warfare tools hurriedly applied to it. The advance force was a small-scale unit that would effectively be isolated within enemy territory. <a id="page-101"></a>During that time, the Eintagsfliege’s electromagnetic interference would disrupt the airwaves, impeding the advance force from receiving information support from Vanadis.</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, the advance battalion’s internal data links could be severed. So in place of the main force, Zashya and her unit, Królik, would provide that support for the advance battalion. Normally, the Sirins would be the ones ordered to function as communications relays, but this was the first time the Strike Package would be using the Armée Furieuse. And instances where new weapons were used for the first time were situations that were prone to unexpected developments. The inflexible Sirins couldn’t be relied on to handle this. And so Zashya stepped up.</p>
<p>All in the name of her sovereign, for whom she would offer up her flesh and blood.</p>
<p>“We go forth in the name of Prince Viktor. Królik, deploying to achieve the mission. I leave command over the ground forces in your hands.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">Despite being part of the Strike Package, Dustin was the least proficient among the Processors. Rather than being stationed with the advance battalion, he was placed in the Expedition Brigade’s main force, which was to launch alongside the Trauerschwan.</p>
<p>His normal assignment had been temporarily changed, and he was stationed on the front lines—leaving the Spearhead squadron behind. But it was then that he heard a voice over the Para-RAID.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Dustin.”</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Anju?</em></p>
<p>He checked the Resonance setting and found that it had been set to be the only target of this exchange. Dustin sat up. Just like the rest of the Spearhead squadron members, she was part of the advance battalion. What would prompt her to contact him at a time like this?</p>
<p>“What’s wro—?”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“You said you wouldn’t die and leave me behind, right?”</span></strong></p>
<p class="space-break2"><a id="page-102"></a>Even as she spoke, Anju thought back to the past six months. To the days they’d spent in the Strike Package together and the countless conversations she’d had with Dustin. To the Fleet Countries’ people, who had been forced to discard their pride. To Theo, who had his path to purpose severed halfway through.</p>
<p>Just the other day, she’d passed Shin and Kurena and overheard their conversation. She had heard what Shin told Kurena upon entrusting her with the role of being the Trauerschwan’s gunner.</p>
<p>Turning one’s pride—which should have been a wish or a dream—into a curse.</p>
<p>It had been on Anju’s mind ever since. She couldn’t help but wonder if that applied to her, too.</p>
<p><em>I still have feelings for Daiya…</em></p>
<p>That wasn’t a lie. And yet—</p>
<p><em>I can’t think about you the same way I thought about him.</em></p>
<p><em>That</em> was, in fact, a lie.</p>
<p>If she didn’t feel anything at all, she wouldn’t have taken his hand during that party. She wouldn’t have explored that cave with him… She wouldn’t have watched the sea, aglow with the phosphorescent light of the Noctiluca, with him. Not as friends, but as something…more?</p>
<p>Yet she still couldn’t answer his feelings, because doing so still felt like a betrayal. It would mean forgetting Daiya.</p>
<p>It felt like she was using the memory of Daiya as an excuse not to move forward…</p>
<p><em>Daiya…wouldn’t be happy with how cowardly I’m being, would he?</em></p>
<p>She took one long breath and exhaled silently, so Dustin wouldn’t hear. For some reason, she felt very…afraid. But she choked down the feeling and spoke.</p>
<p class="space-break2"><strong><span class="special">“Can I trust in those words? Because I’ll be sure to return to your side, too.”</span></strong></p>
<p><a id="page-103"></a>For a moment, Dustin widened his eyes. But then he nodded resolutely.</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p class="space-break2"><span class="special">“To the entirety of the Federacy Expedition Brigade, its Federacy soldiers, and the Eighty-Six. This is the Theocracy’s 3rd Army Corps commander, Himmelnåde Rèze, speaking. I will be counting on your aid in the annihilation of the Offensive Factory type, Halcyon.”</span></p>
<p>As the Federacy’s forces connected to their intended frequency, the voice of a girl spoke to them through the wireless communicator. Kurena raised her head in surprise.</p>
<p><em>It’s her, the petite Theocracy general.</em> She was only two or three years older than Frederica and a few years younger than Kurena. She had appeared every now and then in the Strike Package’s barracks, so Kurena was familiar with her. They’d even spoken, albeit briefly. Just a few days ago… Yes, right around the time Shin told her to act as the Trauerschwan’s gunner.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break"><em>…then that’s a burden you don’t need to force yourself to carry.</em></p>
<p>Their pride. Their way of being, to fight until their lives flickered out.</p>
<p>“That’s…!”</p>
<p>These were words Kurena couldn’t accept. She’d desperately thought to talk back and argue, but Shin raised a hand to cut her off. Sensing the sharpness in his gaze, she followed his line of sight while swallowing her indignation.</p>
<p>Around the corner was a pillar sculpture shaped after a goddess, made of pearly-white glass. The light shining through it refracted into a prismatic glow. It was a winged, headless goddess, said to respect the continent itself.</p>
<p><a id="page-104"></a>Standing in the shadow of that pillar was a short girl with long blond hair. She vaguely resembled a fay creature.</p>
<p>“I—I’m sorry…! I didn’t mean to interrupt, or rather, to peek or eavesdrop…!” she said in a flustered manner, going red up to her ears.</p>
<p>It was then that Kurena understood that the girl in front of them was misunderstanding what was going on between her and Shin.</p>
<p>“N-no! We’re not like that!” Kurena blurted out, but as soon as she realized what she’d just said, she only became all the more panicked.</p>
<p>She’d denied her feelings plenty of times, but never right in front of Shin. But while Kurena was visibly out of sorts, Shin looked at the girl, taken aback in another way.</p>
<p>“You’re the Theocracy’s corps commander, right? Second General Rèze… What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“The corps commander?!” Kurena exclaimed.</p>
<p>“N-no, I simply adopted my parents’ role…,” Hilnå said nervously.</p>
<p>And then after seemingly calming down, she spoke again—her eyes sincere, and golden like the setting sun.</p>
<p>“I thought I would come and greet you, Eighty-Six. As you’ve said, I am the corps commander, and as such, I’ve come as a representative of my corps to welcome you as our saviors.”</p>
<p>A smile blossomed over her cherubic, pure face.</p>
<p>“…As those who, like me, have known war since infancy.”</p>
<div class="decoration-rw">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break">It was the same voice, but somehow, it came across as sonorous and clear, even through the wireless communicator’s rough static noise.</p>
<p>“Save us from our plight, heroes of a foreign land… May the blessings of the earth goddess keep you safe. May the fangs of your steel mounts never dull, and may your shields stand firm.”</p>
<p>She’d probably strained her innocent face into her fiercest scowl and stood as straight and firm as she could.</p>
<p><em>Save us from our plight</em>, she said.</p>
<p>“I will.”</p>
<p><a id="page-105"></a>She’d said these words before.</p>
<p>With her right hand, she unconsciously touched the handgun holstered on her thigh. It was a 9 mm automatic pistol with an internal firing pin. A gun supplied to her by the Federacy, like many of the Eighty-Six, to kill herself in the worst-case scenario and to end the life of her fallen comrades.</p>
<p>She’d never fired a gun for this purpose. Because ever since her time in the Eighty-Sixth Sector, someone else had always shouldered that burden for her.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“Captain Nouzen, the advance battalion is about to set out. This will be our first operational utilization of the Armée Furieuse. Please…remain cautious.”</p>
<p>The advance battalion would be encroaching deep into the Legion territory. There would be nowhere to run. A single mistake could result in Shin and his group being stranded in the middle of enemy territory. The fear of that happening had constantly, throughout the entirety of the operation, run cold through Lena’s heart.</p>
<p>Worse yet, there was the possibility of the Rabe or the Stachelschwein detecting them, and if that were to happen, the advance battalion would be defenseless. This operation was that much more dangerous than their previous excursions.</p>
<p>In the operation just before this one, Shin had fallen from the Mirage Spire and plummeted into the sea. What if he hadn’t come back from that? She shivered; it felt like an icicle had run down her spine. Lena couldn’t suppress her fear, despite her best attempt…</p>
<p>But Shin simply regarded her with a sardonic smile.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“I haven’t forgotten the order you gave me when we returned from the Fleet Countries, Lena… I don’t think I could forget it even if I wanted to.”</span></strong></p>
<p>“Shin…!” Lena raised her voice at him, flustered by the teasing attitude in his voice.</p>
<p>Because at that moment, Shin had touched his lips. She could feel <a id="page-106"></a>it through the Resonance. When they made that promise, he had kissed her… They had also kissed a few times before that, too. This was only acceptable because the two of them alone were Resonated, but…</p>
<p>No, the Reginleif’s mission recorder kept a note of everything the pilot said during an operation. Those recordings had resulted in Shin being embarrassed a few times, so he’d learned his lesson and kept his verbal expressions to things that wouldn’t be clear without proper context.</p>
<p>But Lena was privy to the context, and it still embarrassed her. What if Grethe asked her what he meant by that during the debriefing?</p>
<p><em>…Nothing will happen. I’ll just have Shin explain it.</em></p>
<p>“Is this your idea of getting back at me? Because if something happens, I’ll be taking you down with me.”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Oh, so you’re aware you’ve done something that justifies retaliation. I’ve been wondering if I’m allowed to start sulking about that month you left me hanging before we went to the Fleet Countries.”</span></strong></p>
<p>“Well, yes… But I mean… This’ll sound like an excuse, but there’s no physical communications line into the training center, and they didn’t allow us to send any mail. And the fact that I left this up in the air for a whole month made me feel awkward… Hmm…”</p>
<p>The more she spoke, the more she realized she was in the wrong.</p>
<p>“…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>She heard him chuckle.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“I can’t die right after you finally gave me your answer, can I?”</span></strong></p>
<p><em>So don’t worry. I’ll be fine.</em></p>
<p>Lena smiled at those implicit words. That was why Lena had made that oath back then, wishing for a miracle. It was then that she thought of a way to get back at him.</p>
<p>“Yes… Also, Shin? I actually still have your coat, for when I have to wear the Cicada… You usually put on cologne, right? It smells like you. Sometimes…putting your coat on calms me down.”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“—?!”</span></strong></p>
<p>She could hear Shin suddenly break into a cough. Apparently, this <a id="page-107"></a>had taken him by surprise. It was a bit indecent of her, but she did feel like he got what he deserved, and so she continued smoothly.</p>
<p>“I’ll probably borrow it for every operation from now on. I can hug it tight whenever I feel anxious.”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“…”</span></strong></p>
<p>He fell silent, apparently imagining something… Lena decided to stop at that. She shouldn’t tease him any more before an operation.</p>
<p>“I’ll return it when the operation’s over… I’ll personally bring it back each time. So please…let me have the opportunity.”</p>
<p><em>Please…stay safe.</em></p>
<p>“Take care of yourself.”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“I—,”</span></strong> Shin said, trailed off, and then corrected himself. <strong><span class="special">“<em>See you then.</em>”</span></strong></p>
<p>Lena widened her eyes at those three short words. He didn’t say, <em>I’m off</em>. A smile played on her lips. As inappropriate as it may have been, he spoke to her not as a superior officer, but as a comrade. Or perhaps…as someone he’d sworn his life to. That turn of phrase made her happy.</p>
<p>“Yes—be careful!”</p>
<p class="space-break2">“Course clear! Armée Furieuse, commencing launch!”</p>
<p>Their course actually wasn’t clear in the slightest, what with the Eintagsfliege filling their path. On top of that, one wouldn’t normally fling a piloted Feldreß into the air. But in truth, no one was in the state of mind to make jokes.</p>
<p>A shuttle similar to a starting block towed the Reginleifs as they blitzed across the rails. The feeling of being launched was granted by the intense acceleration of an electromagnetic catapult. Shin had experienced it before in simulators and during the Nachzehrer’s launch, but he couldn’t get used to it. In the blink of an eye, the catapult had gone from one end of the rails to the other. It then broke at the end of the rails with a loud sound, and the lock was undone.</p>
<p>The Reginleif was a lightweight Feldreß, but it still weighed ten <a id="page-108"></a>tonnes. And that weight was being thrown into the air at full force into the far reaches of the northern sky.</p>
<p>The Mk. 1 Armée Furieuse, produced by the Alliance of Wald.</p>
<p>An electromagnetic catapult meant for launching Feldreß into the sky, so that they could march across the heavens like the war maiden they were named after and descend upon the battlefield.</p>
<p>A system to allow the Reginleifs to take off, much like the Nachzehrer or a ship’s fighter jet, rendering them into airborne armaments.</p>
<p>Shaking off gravity’s hold, the Reginleifs gained altitude, their frames clad with yet another airborne armament—a propulsion device designated the Mantle of Frigga.</p>
<p>A mythical mantle that would turn any who wore it into a hawk. As its name implied, it allowed the Reginleifs to fly through the air while obfuscating their appearance.</p>
<p>Since surface weapons didn’t have an aerodynamic shape that would allow them to maintain balance and altitude, it enveloped them and gave them fairings. It was also equipped with two rocket boosters to lift its ten tonnes into the air. As soon as the fairings left the shuttle, the rockets ignited, and its stabilization wings deployed.</p>
<p>Upon achieving thrust, the Mantle of Frigga rushed up into the skies. True to its name as a mantle, it was covered by thin silver flakes the size of bird feathers, which deflected light and radio waves, flickering all the while.</p>
<p>Having gained wings of flame and hidden behind argent plumes, the Reginleifs soared.</p>
<p class="space-break2">As Gilwiese looked up from the front lines, he couldn’t properly see the Juggernauts as they sailed through the sky. They flew at altitudes and speeds that weren’t visible to people on the ground. He simply stared, knowing they must be up there in this cloudy sky of ash, and muttered to himself.</p>
<p>“An army of ghosts flying through the sky, led by a war deity, the god of death. These were the Ghost Riders.”</p>
