<p>“You really love them, don’t you? Your Reaper and your Queen.”</p>
<p>“We do. Especially Shin. We’re a bit overprotective of him whenever possible, I think.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">Although the cave was a tourist attraction, and the visitors’ safety was guaranteed, it still lived up to its name as a labyrinth. There wasn’t anything to light the place up, which made it quite dim, and the path was winding and full of branches. The oddly smooth rock surface had chalcedony mixed into it, which gave it a strange, translucent quality.</p>
<p>Even though Lena checked the map they were given at every turn, she soon got the feeling that she was gradually getting lost. As they advanced into the tunnels, the Eighty-Six around them were disappearing. Sometimes, it was one of them; another time, it was a pair… And before she knew it, it was just her and Shin.</p>
<p>“…? Where did everyone go?” Lena cocked her head curiously.</p>
<p>“They kept branching off, saying they saw something interesting or that they’d race to see who got out first…” Shin shook his head, as if to call this inconsequential. “It feels pretty forced, to be honest.”</p>
<p>“Apparently, the throne room and the dome are up ahead. You can see the fossil of the behemoth’s skeleton there. We can turn back once we get that far.”</p>
<p>“Right… We can’t stay here for too long. It feels like we won’t be able to find our way out once it gets dark.”</p>
<p>There were no lights, and the tunnel felt oddly claustrophobic and scary with its exposed rock walls. Noticing that Lena was trying to hide her anxiety, Shin snuck a glance at her and offered his hand.</p>
<p>“It’s dark, so watch your step.”</p>
<p>“Ah… Thank you.”</p>
<p>Realizing that Shin had seen through her fears, Lena gratefully accepted his hand. He walked ahead, and she followed half a step behind him. This made her realize they both smelled of the same soap. It was <a id="page-142"></a>the hotel’s original soap, made from uniquely produced oil, and was placed in the bath for all the guests to use.</p>
<p>The aroma of the soap they used when bathing or when washing up in the mornings was oddly fresh, and she didn’t put on her usual, violet-scented perfume that day. So they both smelled the same.</p>
<p>They carried each other’s lingering scent.</p>
<p>And the train of thought kept jumping from one association to another. A lingering scent meant…<em>the morning after</em>.</p>
<p>Lena felt her face heat up. It was a term she’d only heard of, but the mere mental image of it was too provocative for her. Shin, on the other hand, didn’t seem to notice the fact that they shared the same scent, or perhaps he simply didn’t think it was that important, because when she looked up at his face, it was as placid as ever.</p>
<p>Lena frowned. True, her imagination was running wild on its own and conjuring up all sorts of exciting images, but the fact that she was the only one feeling giddy over this made her feel silly.</p>
<p>But she was so giddy that she didn’t notice Shin’s own tension over the sound of her heart beating like a drum nor the coldness of his palms. She wanted him to feel the same way she did, and unable to repress those feelings, the words spilled from her lips.</p>
<p>“Er… I’m sorry about…the way I’ve been acting lately. I made you worry about me.”</p>
<p>They’d entered the throne room’s dome, which Shin had mentioned earlier. They’d reached their destination before they knew it. The polished rock face was decorated with what appeared to be pleats, which extended up to the dome’s canopy and converged like a spider’s web. It was a grand sight, and just looking up at it made Lena feel like it might pluck her soul away.</p>
<p>And sunk into the back wall was a massive, sharp, skeletal eye socket, so large that it was hard to believe it truly belonged to a living creature. It gazed into the throne room with a suffocating sort of solemnity, as if lording over them, like a malevolent god in its ancient temple.</p>
<p>Lena hung her head, as if refusing to meet the bloodred eyes gazing down at her head-on. But without realizing it, she squeezed hard on the hand gripping her.</p>
<p><a id="page-143"></a>“But… It made me happy…knowing you were worried about me. Because…”</p>
<p><em>Because…</em></p>
<p>He looked down at her with his red eyes. And she realized just how happy being reflected in those crimson depths made her.</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p class="space-break2">As the two had their exchange…</p>
<p>“My, could this be…?”</p>
<p>“This is going better than expected.”</p>
<p>“What a lovely atmosphere…”</p>
<p>Anju, Theo, and Frederica looked on from another corridor, whispering to one another. They were hidden behind the rocks of the arched exit, peeking their heads out stealthily. Raiden, Kurena, Shiden, Marcel, Vika, and Annette were in the same spot, divided into camps of boys on the left and girls on the right and looking into what happened under the dome.</p>
<p>“We gave them all that time, and Lena ends up being the one to say it first? That damn moron.”</p>
<p>“C’mon, it’s fine, Raiden. You know what they say: All’s well that ends well.”</p>
<p>“You know what? I don’t like this, after all,” Kurena spat out bitterly.</p>
<p>“What a coincidence, Kurena. The very same thought crossed my mind not a moment ago.” Frederica nodded gravely.</p>
<p>“I thought you were adamant about denying your infatuation with Nouzen, Kukumila. Isn’t it about time you come clean?” Vika asked her.</p>
<p>“Infatu—?! What?! No, I—I don’t feel that way!”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s what he meant, Kukumila.”</p>
<p>“…Your Highness, I, er, think your behavior right now is unbefitting a prince of the lofty United Kingdom.”</p>
<p>“Kurena, Marcel, Lerche, be quiet. If you don’t, they might hear us.”</p>
<p>“What?! I merely admonished you, Your Highness! I did not peek, as the others did!” Lerche said in self-defense.</p>
<p>“Be quiet!” “Shut up, you seven-year-old.”</p>
<p><a id="page-144"></a>“…My shame knows no bounds…”</p>
<p class="space-break2">Apparently, their conversation the other day had allowed Lena to sort out her concerns. Shin used the darkness as an excuse to hold her hand, resolving to express the feelings he’d kept on hold until she’d gotten over her anxieties. He’d intended to tell her as soon as he took her hand, but an uncharacteristic bout of suspense silenced him.</p>
<p>After all, they both had the scent of the same soap.</p>
<p>Perhaps owing to the darkness blocking out his field of vision, his other senses became keener. This made him acutely aware that she smelled of the same soap he had used. And since he didn’t make any footsteps as he walked, he could make out the sound of her silver, silken hair as it brushed against him. The slender palm sitting in his hand felt so much warmer than his today.</p>
<p>He had decided he would say it when they reached their destination: the domed throne room. He realized he was stalling, but he’d somehow silenced the fear in his mind and steeled his resolve. But before he could do it, she called out to him, he turned to face her, and his mind ground to halt as her eyes locked on his.</p>
<p>“Because I…”</p>
<p>Shin stood stock-still as he waited for her next words. Her argent eyes looked up at him, and he realized that seeing himself reflected in them made him happy.</p>
<p class="space-break2">Suddenly realizing something, Annette spoke up.</p>
<p>“By the way, Anju, where’s Dustin? I thought he was with you.”</p>
<p>Those words made Anju bite her lip. He <em>was</em> with her, at least until halfway through the tunnel, but…</p>
<p>“Dustin, well, er… I was really into exploring the cave, and he might have, er, gotten lost…”</p>
<p>Anju really did enjoy exploring the cave. She did. So it just…happened…</p>
<p class="space-break2"><a id="page-145"></a>The moment the words spilled from her lips, there would be no stopping them, and she strung them together without any fear or resistance. The only thing on her mind was the person before her eyes now.</p>
<p>“Shin, I…”</p>
<p><em>I…</em></p>
<p>But just then, the sound of a large stone being stepped on scrambled the atmosphere.</p>
<p>“Aaaah?!” Lena jolted.</p>
<p>Even Shin became agitated. Both of them reflexively jerked and tensed up, their eyes turning toward one of the tunnels leading into the throne room.</p>
<p>“…Is someone there…?” Lena asked shakily.</p>
<p>Of course, no matter how out of sorts they were, they weren’t going to assume it was a legendary monster said to make its home there. Someone in the shadows was trying to chirp like a cricket or meow like a cat, before eventually appearing from the shadows. It was a tall, silver-haired figure, with hands held in the air for some reason.</p>
<p>“Sorry. It’s me.”</p>
<p>Dustin.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Lena and Shin regarded him with silence for one long moment. Shin seldom showed emotions to begin with, but the glare of Lena’s wide emotionless eyes made Dustin flinch outright.</p>
<p>Put simply, Lena and Shin instinctively froze up, like a pair of deer in headlights, and their mute expressions were terrifying.</p>
<p>“………D-don’t mind me… Please continue…”</p>
<p>As Dustin staggered back, multiple sets of hands extended from behind him, grabbing him by the nape of his neck and clothes, and yanked him into the corridor. Without leaving so much as a yelp, Dustin’s tall form was swallowed by the darkness.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Of course, Lena was by no means brash enough to act as if nothing <a id="page-146"></a>had happened, and Shin wasn’t thickheaded enough to spur her to continue.</p>
<p>“Um…”</p>
<p>A heavy silence settled over the two of them, so thick that the only thing Lena could hear was the thunderous beating of her heartbeat in her ears.</p>
<p class="space-break2">The many hands that had grabbed Dustin pulled him back into a dark, narrow tunnel, where Raiden nearly throttled him.</p>
<p>“Dustin, you idiot!”</p>
<p>“The mood was perfect, and you ruined it!”</p>
<p>“What’s the big idea, you moron?! Why’d you have to show up right at that moment?!”</p>
<p>“And how could you tell them that, Jaeger?! ‘Don’t mind me… Please continue…’?! Are you dense?!”</p>
<p>Everyone was understandably infuriated with Dustin for barging onto the scene right before the ultimate payoff. Even Vika, who was often far more eloquent than most, lost his temper.</p>
<p>Dustin looked around, searching for an ally, but when he saw Anju regard him with a murderous smile…</p>
<p><em>…Well…I guess I’m dead.</em></p>
<p>…That was the only conclusion he could come to. She was absolutely livid.</p>
<p>“………Sorry.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">Despite the rude interruption, Lena’s heart was still beating out of her chest, so some part of her was toying with the idea of simply saying it anyway. Suppressing the bashfulness that would surely overtake her if she was the least bit careless, she steeled her heart.</p>
<p>“Hmm!”</p>
<p>Her voice came out louder than she had intended. So much so that it surprised her, and that surprise made her newfound determination <a id="page-147"></a>crumble away. The words she wanted to say rose up into her throat but refused to go any further. Lena simply opened and closed her mouth fearfully for a few moments before she finally said something else.</p>
<p>“The, um, Alliance’s captain, Olivia. I see you two talk, well, a lot…”</p>
<p>Some calm part in her mind whispered in denial. That made her sound like she was jealous. It was shameful, embarrassing…</p>
<p><em>No.</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t because it was shameful or that it looked like she was jealous. It was because she <em>really was</em> jealous.</p>
<p>She was jealous of Olivia—and not just her. She was really jealous of so many other people. She was jealous of Anju, Kurena, and the other girls, who, unlike her, were comrades he could rely on when they were out on the front lines. She was jealous of Frederica, whom he treated like a little sister. Of Annette, who was his childhood friend. Of Grethe, who was his trustworthy superior officer.</p>
<p>She was jealous of Raiden and Theo, who were his closest friends. Oddly enough, she was even jealous of Vika and Marcel, who could speak to him so freely, and Fido, who wasn’t even human.</p>
<p>She wanted him to rely on her. To be the first person he turned to when he needed someone to speak to. She didn’t want him to look at other people… At other women.</p>
<p>“Is, um… Is Olivia your type?”</p>
<p>And what if he said yes? Just imagining it tore at her heart. She was terrified of the answer. And so Lena looked up at Shin fearfully. But in response…</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>…Shin simply looked back at her, astonished. It was as if she’d asked him <em>Which of these sweets is your favorite?</em> and then opened a toolbox instead of candy. He couldn’t understand the meaning behind her question on the most fundamental level.</p>
<p>Lena expected a simple yes or no and had hoped to hear the latter. But what she didn’t expect was his complete and utter confusion.</p>
<p>“Wh-what do you—? Er…,” Shin mumbled, clearly frazzled. “I mean, I’m aware that many people have those preferences. I knew some <a id="page-148"></a>people back in the Eighty-Sixth Sector who were—But I’m not… Um… What made you think I am?”</p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>
<p>It suddenly felt like they were having two completely different conversations—as if there was a fork in the road at a critical juncture, and they had traveled down separate paths. And while they both understood that much, they didn’t quite realize who went off track—and where.</p>
<p>Shin was the first to put two and two together, though.</p>
<p>“Lena, I think you may have gotten the wrong impression somewhere along the way.”</p>
<p>“A-about what?”</p>
<p>“Captain <em>Olivier</em> is engaged. And, um, he’s a man.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">“I thought something was off about the way you were looking at me, but I didn’t think you’d misunderstand <em>that</em>, of all things.”</p>
<p>When he heard what had happened, Olivier didn’t get mad, but he chuckled instead. Lena still couldn’t look him in the eye, though.</p>
<p>The other Eighty-Six returned to the cave’s entrance hall, where they found Olivier reading a book to pass the time. This exchange happened after that. And now when she really put more thought into it, she realized Olivier did look a bit masculine…so long as one didn’t assume he was a woman right off the bat.</p>
<p>His face was quite androgynous, yes, but his voice was too deep to come across as immediately feminine. His bone structure and musculature seemed masculine as well. And now that her preconceived notions had been shattered, she realized he didn’t have any visible breasts, either.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry… It’s just that, er, your hair is so long and luxurious, and your perfume smells so nice, so I just assumed…”</p>
<p>“Right.” Olivier smirked as he ran his fingers through his luscious locks.</p>
<p>As he did, the scent of roses—the symbols of June—tickled Lena’s nostrils.</p>
<p>“This perfume was my fiancée’s favorite, so I decided I’d take after <a id="page-149"></a>her and use it. Operators aren’t allowed to wear rings, so I figured I’d put this on instead. And this hair is my oath to her… You can laugh over how stubborn I’m being.”</p>
<p>All Feldreß Operators across all countries were forbidden from wearing any manner of rings—wedding and engagement rings included—since they could get in the way of piloting and ultimately lead to injury.</p>
<p>Still, the idea of donning matching perfumes was one Lena had never considered. But it did strike her as charming, and for a moment, she thought he must truly love his fiancée…before the realization dawned on her.</p>
<p>It <em>was</em> his fiancée’s favorite perfume. Past tense. He refused to cut his hair as an oath to her. The way he smiled when he called himself stubborn.</p>
<p>“Captain Olivier, um… Your fiancée…”</p>
<p>“It was three years ago… The Legion took her away.”</p>
<p>Lena averted her eyes. The shame suffocated her. She had been so jealous of Olivier’s exchanges with Shin, but…</p>
<p>“Did you talk to Shin so often because…?”</p>
<p>Olivier cracked a thin smile. As if an old wound had just been torn open. A ghastly, obsessive smile.</p>
<p>“Is she still out there? If so, where? I wanted to see if he could find her for me. But I believed asking him during our first meeting would be rude, so I talked to him often and tried to establish a rapport.”</p>
<p>Lena realized something. It was not his Esper ability that made him so strong, but rather, this obsession. The hair he refused to cut. His beloved’s perfume. A feminine Personal Name: Anna Maria, which likely was not actually inspired by the tale of the warrior princess.</p>
<p>Shin looked away. The reason he opened his heart to Olivier so easily was because he was once just as obsessed over his brother.</p>
<p>“If she has been assimilated by the Legion, then it has to be me who puts her to rest.”</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Shinei Nouzen. It has already been stated that all further queries would be rejected.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p><a id="page-150"></a>“I heard what you said… But that doesn’t mean I was satisfied with that.”</p>
<p>Shin stood before the final unresolved question. Zelene’s golden optical sensor gazed at him through the glass of the confinement room’s window. And it was there, Shin thought, that her final craving rested. The optical sensor was artificial and should not have harbored any emotion…but there was a light to it.</p>
<p>He’d finally realized that, from the very beginning, she was waiting for something—waiting for someone. Ever since she left the message <em>Come find me</em>, not knowing when her words might reach someone or whom they might find.</p>
<p>“Once before, I asked you why you created the Legion. And I still want to hear the answer to that.”</p>
<p>But even as he posed the question, Shin believed he already knew the answer. And if he was right, all her silences, the way she seemed to probe and test him, her strange sense of caution…would make sense.</p>
<p>Had Fido—the AI his father developed—been completed, the Republic may truly have achieved a battlefield of zero casualties. But Shin didn’t like that idea. Even if they did find Fido now and use it to fight the Legion in place of the Federacy’s, Republic’s, and United Kingdom’s soldiers, Shin wasn’t happy about that idea.</p>
<p>But someone who didn’t know Fido, who wasn’t attached to it, might make a different choice. Had his father, who developed the AI for the sake of befriending people, been forced to pick between mass-producing Fido and sending it out to the battlefield or sending people out to fight, perhaps he would have chosen the former, too.</p>
<p>And the same held true for Zelene. Or at least, it held true for her when she was still alive and developed the Legion.</p>
<p><em>I…wanted you to come back to me.</em></p>
<p>Even now, he could hear her final words. The person she called to in her final moments. The brother she lost to friendly fire. The sibling she wished to see returned to her, even as she drew her last breath.</p>
<p>“You created the Legion to fight in our place…so that war would never again claim a human life.”</p>
<p><a id="page-151"></a>The golden lunar optical sensor focused on Shin intently. The Legion didn’t fear destruction. They didn’t fear death. They were unflinching, obedient machines, bred for war—created to fight in place of soldiers who would otherwise die by the thousands.</p>
<p>She didn’t create them to kill people. They were never meant to be harbingers of death.</p>
<p>“And you don’t want anyone to die, even now. That’s why you won’t carelessly relinquish the information you possess. You don’t want another country to try to develop technology comparable to the Legion and use it invade other nations.”</p>
<p>When he was young, Vika’s one wish was to bring his mother back to life. Shin’s father, though he could hardly remember what he looked like, attempted to develop artificial intelligence that would live alongside humankind. And Zelene, who had befriended them both, likely felt the same way. All she ever wanted…</p>
<p>“From the very beginning, you were trying to protect people, weren’t you?”</p>
<p>She didn’t want to see anyone die… Just like Shin. For a long moment, Zelene remained silent. And then…</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Query.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>Her voice cracked. It was as if she’d attempted to fill it with scorn but failed miserably.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Let us assume you are correct. What will you do then? Forgive us? Will you forgive the Legion, Eighty-Six? After we have slain so many of your fragile comrades? We, who have robbed you of your homeland, your family, and your friends? It could have been us who turned your loved ones against you.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>For a moment, Shin was at a loss for words. An emotion bubbled up <a id="page-152"></a>within him. It had been seven years since he learned that his brother was made into a mechanical ghost—and two years since he’d defeated him. But even now, he didn’t know what to call this emotion.</p>
<p>“…Yes. That…might be true.”</p>
<p>He didn’t quite spit out the words. They simply left his lips. He didn’t want to fight him. But he was a Legion. He had been turned into a Legion unit, and if Shin didn’t destroy the mechanical monstrosity that served as his prison, his brother’s soul would likely weep and howl until the end of time.</p>
<p>This was why Shin couldn’t leave him behind. He had to fight him.</p>
<p>And the underlying cause was, without a doubt, the restrained Ameise in front of him. It wasn’t a question of possibility. This woman was the one who turned his brother against him.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Resubmitting query. Why do you not harbor enmity toward us? Why do you not harbor hatred? Why do you not resent us? Why do you…insist on forgiving me?&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>Shin narrowed his eyes. Forgive her?</p>
<p>“I’m not forgiving you… I never resented you in the first place, and I don’t want to resent you. Doing that would achieve nothing.”</p>
<p>If one was to ask if he was a broken, maddened man, perhaps he would say that he was. He had lost his family and been denied a homeland, but he didn’t hate the one who took them from him. No normal person could feel this way.</p>
<p>But even still, he didn’t hate her… He didn’t want to hate her and couldn’t bring himself to. Because he knew. Hating the Alba, resenting the world, loathing the Legion… None of it would bring back what he lost. Hating someone wouldn’t make the Alba, the world, nor the Legion suddenly care about the pain and suffering he’d endured.</p>
<p>So he didn’t feel any hatred or resentment. Because he knew. He knew those feelings were pointless. Wallowing in them wouldn’t result in anything of substance.</p>
<p><a id="page-153"></a>And besides…</p>
<p>“Hatred… Resentment… If I chose to hold on to those feelings, I would be no better than the ones who made me what I am.”</p>
<p>That was his—the Eighty-Six’s—pride. It was the only thing they had to their names since they couldn’t even afford to embrace their negative emotions. At the edge of his field of vision, he could see Lena watching over him, her hands clasped before her chest reverently.</p>
<p>And it was then that he realized, ever so slightly, the meaning behind her wish. The world and its people aren’t necessarily kind. The world can be cold and cruel. But in that moment, Shin thought that the nightmare he had lived through might not be an accurate reflection of humankind’s true nature.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to believe that it was.</p>
<p>He knew all too well just how vulgar people could be, more than he could have ever hoped to know. And the examples of truly admirable human nobility were too few and far between. But if he had to choose between one or the other to be the true nature of humanity, he much preferred to pick nobility.</p>
<p>And it was because of that wish that Lena posited that the world ought to be a beautiful place. She knew how ugly the world was but refused to acknowledge this ugliness as the natural order. She refused to give up on the world—not as a simple idea she pursued but as a declaration of her pride.</p>
<p>The worlds they knew may have been different altogether. Perhaps they couldn’t believe in people or in the world the same way just yet. But their desire to never give up—to never grow complacent—was likely one and the same.</p>
<p>And so this was another thing they couldn’t relinquish.</p>
<p>“And you’re not looking to be forgiven, either… You just can’t accept the world as it is right now. You couldn’t accept it, and you wanted to change it.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t accept a world where people had to throw their lives away on the battlefield. Nor could she accept a world in which the Legion she created were the leading contributors to unparalleled bloodshed.</p>
<p>“You don’t want people to die. You didn’t want that when you were alive, and you don’t want it now. And since that was your earnest wish, you want to stop the war—to stop the Legion. Am I right?”</p>
<p class="space-break2"><a id="page-154"></a>A long, heavy silence descended upon the room. But eventually, Zelene, the Merciless Queen, gave her answer.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;<em>Yes.</em>&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>Her voice felt like a long, lamenting sigh. For the first time, her voice struck Shin as truly human.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Yes, you´re right. By now, this all feels like nothing more than a series of terrible mistakes, but… All I wanted was to save people.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>Her words of penitence echoed heavily within the partitioned, closed space. The confinement room and observation rooms were demarcated by a borderline of reinforced acrylic plates. And they stood on both sides of this confessional, like a sinner and a priest, as if she was begging for forgiveness.</p>
<p>And then she said them. The words the Federacy, United Kingdom, and Alliance soldiers had all been waiting to hear.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Very well… I will answer your questions. I will tell you all that I know, as well as the information I sought to relay… But only under one condition. Shinei Nouzen. And Viktor Idinarohk. I will speak only to you two. Everyone else must leave. All recordings—all methods of observation and communication must end. Turn everything off.&gt;&gt;</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break">Given the importance of the information Zelene offered, her request was far too simple. But upon hearing what she had to say, Vika could only sigh. A <a id="page-155"></a>long sigh, uncharacteristic of this cold-blooded serpent who rarely betrayed any sign of emotion, if at all. As if what he was feeling was too much to bear.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it…”</p>
<p>He temporarily cut off the microphone to the confinement room and shook his head. Abiding by her demands, everyone but Shin and Vika left the observation room.</p>
<p>“There really is a way to shut down all the Legion. But…”</p>
<p>Yes. The Merciless Queen, Zelene, revealed to them the shutdown code for all Legion units deployed across the continent—and the triggering procedure for this code. And yet… Vika shook his head in frustration.</p>
<p>“Triggering it wouldn’t do anything… Worse yet, if we reveal this to the public, human society could fall apart from the inside.”</p>
<p>There was only one position from which the shutdown code could be transmitted… An Imperial fortress that was currently nestled deep within Legion territory.</p>
<p>That wasn’t a critical problem. Even if it was seized by the Legion, they could still retake it. The Strike Package was made explicitly for such purposes, and it would put a definitive end to the Legion War. They could draw forces from other fronts for a concentrated strike.</p>
<p>The problem lay with the one who would transmit the shutdown code. The only one who could do so was a person with command rights over all the Legion. And to register someone as having that right, they would need to be recognized as being descended from the Giadian Imperial bloodline.</p>
<p>Specifically, it would require a genetic match. Only those of royal blood could be acknowledged as commanding authorities over the Legion…and six years ago, the Federacy’s military wiped that bloodline out, leaving not a single member of that family alive. The blood of the Imperial family that ruled over the Empire that died ten years ago. The blue blood of the emperor no longer ran through any living human’s veins.</p>
<p>“If someone could be registered as having the authority to control the Legion, they could very likely control the Legion to do their bidding… This shutdown method is a farce. The Federacy killing the Empire means we’ve lost the means of stopping the Legion, forever.”</p>
<p><a id="page-156"></a>Even Vika felt that this was truly a terrible turn of events. His expression was clearly bitter, and he heaved a sigh as he turned a pensive look on Shin.</p>
<p>“We’ll disclose the rest of the information Zelene gave us to the three countries’ intelligence bureaus, but we’ll exclude this. Their latest scheme of operations and the location of their production facilities should be enough to tide them over… Agreed, Nouzen?”</p>
<p>“Agreed.” Shin nodded curtly, steeling his expression and tone.</p>
<p>He knew his emotions rarely showed on his face. His feelings were somewhat deadened ever since that day ten years ago, when his brother nearly killed him. But in this very moment, Shin was grateful for that. Because he couldn’t afford to let even Vika know the truth.</p>
<p><em>The Legion</em> could <em>be stopped.</em></p>
<p>It could even be done right now if they were to seize control of the transmission point.</p>
<p>Shin wished he could clear away all the people around them, as there was no telling what anyone might do. Because Vika didn’t know. Neither did Lena, Annette, nor the other Eighty-Six with the exception of Raiden, Theo, Anju, and Kurena.</p>
<p>But at least some of the western front’s officers knew. Those who took custody of her and spared her life alongside Ernst. They knew she had survived. How would they react once the information got out? Shin couldn’t predict that… Just as he couldn’t predict what would become of her once all was said and done.</p>
<p>Frederica.</p>
