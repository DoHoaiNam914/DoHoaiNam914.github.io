<p><a id="page-41"></a>The door to her room swung open with a clank.</p>
<p>“I’m back, Lena. They handed out some lemon water. You want some? I’m pretty sure the lemon is synthesized, but the mint is the real thing. Wait…”</p>
<p>Looking down at her, Annette gazed at Lena dubiously.</p>
<p>“…What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Annette…!” Lena peered up at her friend, desperate.</p>
<p>Her bed was a mess, and the silver, lustrous locks she’d thoroughly combed earlier were awfully frayed.</p>
<p>“Annette, I… How do you think Shin feels about me…?”</p>
<p>Annette fell silent for a long moment before eventually heaving out a long, deep sigh. As if to release some inner pressure that had built up inside her.</p>
<p>“…Lena.”</p>
<p>“Urgh…”</p>
<p>“Knowing you for as long as I have, I get that you’re a total ditz, but I think I’m entitled to smack you this time. Don’t you?”</p>
<p>“………I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>TP meowed shrilly in what was a cry that came off as both affirming and utterly indifferent.</p>
<p class="space-break2">Shin returned to his room, feeling a bit dizzy. Some part of him also felt that he couldn’t afford to become too complacent. As soon as he entered the room, a certain recollection surfaced vaguely in his mind. Staring up at the artistically arranged wooden ceiling, Shin pursued that memory.</p>
<p>It was a conversation he had a few days ago with his comrades, during their time at the special officer academy. It was over mundane, trivial things, and it was odd that the memory had crept up on him in the first place. It was an altogether unremarkable scene.</p>
<p>But eventually, it was Lena who occupied the majority of that recollection. Their exchange a month ago in the United Kingdom. The words he’d uttered.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>…Don’t leave me behind.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-42"></a>He had to own up to the facts… He had to stop turning a blind eye to the truth. He had to admit that he’d faced his true desires head-on… That he’d realized what would allow him to keep living, even if it was a lie.</p>
<p>His feelings for Lena.</p>
<p>The thought made Shin feel awkward, and he let his head crash against the pillow. It wasn’t an emotion he was familiar with, and that made it much harder to deal with. It put him in a fidgety, restless sort of mood. He didn’t know what to do with himself.</p>
<p>He was afraid—no doubt about it—and couldn’t bring himself to take the next step. If someone were to call him a coward for it, he would have no choice but to agree. Over the days they spent studying during their time off, he’d intended to talk to Lena about it several times, but in the end, he couldn’t say anything. Recalling his inaction only served to make him more depressed.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t quite know when he started feeling that way. Before he knew it, she had taken up permanent residence in his heart. And when they reunited and started fighting together on the same battlefield, the spot she occupied gradually grew larger. To the point where he couldn’t delude himself anymore.</p>
<p>And once he’d become aware of this emotion, he couldn’t go back to being ignorant of it any longer. Searching his memories, he realized that all he had ever done was selfishly shove his wishes into her hands. <em>Remember us. Live on. Don’t leave me behind.</em></p>
<p>She’d granted all those wishes, and he felt like he couldn’t allow himself to take advantage of her kindness any longer.</p>
<p><em>I want to show you the sea. I want to see the sea, with you.</em></p>
<p>And now that he realized who he truly made that wish for…</p>
<p>“—n.”</p>
<p>But even still, that wish was Shin’s selfish desire. Lena had answered all his wishes so far, but there was no reason she would have to answer this one, too.</p>
<p>“…Shin.”</p>
<p>She could reject him, after all.</p>
<p><a id="page-43"></a>“Yo, Shin.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">And besides, for how much she’d supported him so far, he had nothing to offer in return. That being the case…</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Hey, dumbass, I’m talking to you.”</p>
<p>Shin jolted and looked around, only for his eyes to settle on Raiden, who’d apparently returned to his room at some point. He was standing in front of the door, making a face Shin had never seen before. He looked exasperated and fed up all at once. As if he’d been forced to swallow some kind of dessert he deeply detested.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“You know…,” Raiden said, heaving a heavy sigh. “You’ve really changed, man.”</p>

<p class="space-break">The Alliance’s food industry was supplemented with synthetic substitutes and vegetables raised on artificial growth accelerants. But given that they’d had to rely on the production plants to compensate for their food supply even before the war, its quality was comparatively quite good.</p>
<p>Since the state had relied on trade to feed its people since time immemorial, their cuisine had a mixture of styles. This resulted in flavors that were a combo of the north-central regions of the continent as well as the south. The Eighty-Six and Lena were all quite taken with the unusual dishes they were given and happily dug into their dinners. The waiters at each table regarded them with satisfied smiles.</p>
<p>Much like the Federacy (and in contrast to the Republic and the United Kingdom), the Alliance preferred coffee over tea. And so they sipped cups of coffee substitute—which bore a different aroma from the one they knew in the Federacy—along with their dessert and let out content sighs.</p>
<p>It was then that a silver shadow stood at the entrance of the great hall where they ate.</p>
<p>“It’s time, everyone.”</p>
<p><a id="page-44"></a>Short blond hair and lips painted a brilliant shade of red. Contrasting the teenagers filling the room, Grethe wore a distinctive silver uniform. The atmosphere immediately grew strained as a few people stood in response to her call. Lena was one of them. Regarding the table with a nod, she left her seat.</p>
<p>As they walked, Anju, Kurena, and Frederica called out to her. <em>Good luck out there. Do your best. Do not strain yourself too much.</em> She went back to her room, opened the closet, and found her trunk. Unlocking it, she took out a certain set of clothes and put them on. Ultramarine with golden rims—the uniform of the Republic. The soldier’s outfit she hadn’t worn for over a month, ever since her time off began.</p>
<p>Putting it on for the first time in so long made her switch gears naturally. Brushing her argent locks back, she left the room with Annette, who wore the same uniform. They went down to the hotel lobby, where they met Grethe, who awaited them with Shin, Vika, and Lerche. Each of them was clad in their respective uniforms. Steel blue, dark violet, and rouge.</p>
<p>“Sorry for the wait.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it… Let’s go, then.”</p>
<p>Curling her famously crimson lips into a smile, Grethe turned around and led the group outside. Lena and Annette followed closely behind her, with Shin and Vika behind them and Lerche bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>They stopped before a pair of double doors. A doorman who also doubled as a porter stood there, dressed in an elegant, antiquated uniform. He regarded them with an exemplary salute that contrasted his outfit before opening the doors for them. This was yet another reminder of how the Alliance was a state of universal conscription, where men and women were all equally recruited to the military.</p>
<p>At the porch, they found a large vehicle waiting for them. It was painted in a drab olive and sooty brown, forestlike camouflage colors. On both the front and rear doors was the emblem of a mountain goat, its horns pointing up proudly toward the heavens. The driver and his assistant got off the vehicle and opened the doors to the back seat, inviting Lena and the others inside.</p>
<p>This was a vehicle for transporting personnel and supplies along the <a id="page-45"></a>rear, beyond the reach of enemy fire. It easily had room for at least ten people. The doors closed, and the engine soon roared to life. The vehicle smoothly cruised away.</p>
<p>Looking outside, they saw Theo shift away the curtain of the window to wave good-bye to them from the other side of the tinted glass.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“My apologies for calling you here to help, Lieutenant Colonel Idinarohk, Captain Nouzen. Normally, we wouldn’t have combat personnel help us here…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>As most of the Alliance’s cities were built along what little flatland was nestled between its mountains, a short drive was all it took for their field of vision to be obstructed by greenery. With the exception of the moonlight, there was nothing to brighten up the trees, whose spear-like tops pointed up into the night sky.</p>
<p>When that darkness enveloped the vehicle, Grethe parted her lips to speak, and Shin simply shook his head lightly. Lena and Annette were only coming along as witnesses, but the ones who were actually called in to play a role in what was to come were Shin and Vika.</p>
<p>“Normally, the 1st Armored Division would have finished its vacation by now, and we’d be entering training. But that prototype equipment is still being tuned, so if it wasn’t for this matter, you’d essentially be on standby for no reason. It ends up working out conveniently for us.”</p>
<p>The two thousand Processors who made up the Strike Package were broken up into four groups. Two of the groups were in charge of operational activity. One was in training, and the remaining group was on leave and given time to focus on their studies. Following the operation in the United Kingdom, it was Shin’s 1st Armored Division that entered their time off. That month was about to end, which would mean they would be going into their training period.</p>
<p>Or they should have, but since the training schedule revolved around using a new type of equipment, and since its development began only recently, that equipment’s final tests were still underway.</p>
<p><a id="page-46"></a>This was the Alliance’s part of the technological exchange with its neighbors. It wasn’t an entirely new invention—but a piece of equipment used by the Alliance’s Feldreß, retrofitted for use by Reginleifs of the Federacy and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Even still, development had only begun over the course of this month and was already this close to completion. The Alliance’s reputation as a technological giant was well deserved. But since they obviously couldn’t begin training with equipment that wasn’t ready yet, the training phase of their schedule had to be postponed.</p>
<p>With the exception of Shin and Vika, all commanders and their respective squadrons were brought to the Alliance to visit while also assisting with the training. As a favor from the Alliance, all the squadrons—not just Shin’s and Vika’s—were given permission to use the health resort, which was usually reserved for the Alliance army.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the boisterous fun he’d seen earlier, Shin shrugged. Yes, after all, this was…</p>
<p>“It just means our time off was extended a little. And everyone else is having fun. Myself included.”</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear… The 1st Armored Division and your six squadrons, which form the core of the unit, have seen too many horrible things—and far too often. The top brass has decided you’re in need of some special care, and you had business here in the United Kingdom as it is.”</p>
<p>The mountain of decomposed corpses they found in the Charité Underground Labyrinth. The siege road made from the mechanical corpses of Sirins and Alkonosts in the Revich Citadel Base. The discrimination and disproportionate hatred they were subjected to ever since they were children. The mental health unit had reported that the Processors urgently required some form of stress relief.</p>
<p>Normally, soldiers were given periods of leave to relieve stress that built up during operational activity. But in the case of the Eighty-Six, they had no hometowns or families to return to. The closest place they could call home was the city across the river from the Strike Package’s home base at Rüstkammer, where their schooling facilities were.</p>
<p>True, they were across the river, and they could live in the school’s <a id="page-47"></a>dormitory facilities for the duration of their leave, but the place felt like an extension of the base, and the sounds of training and blank shots could still be heard in the air.</p>
<p>For years, the Eighty-Six were immersed in combat. They were more used to the sounds of war than they were to peaceful silence. So if they couldn’t shake off the presence of war during their leave, it wouldn’t truly undo the burden on their psyches.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’ve heard, but the other kids from the 1st Armored Division were sent to recreation facilities throughout the Federacy. Master Sergeant Bernholdt and the Nordlicht squadron turned down the offer, however, and preferred to spend time in their hometowns.”</p>
<p>“That makes sense,” Lena said.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the Processors who weren’t here all stayed in tourist attractions and health resorts that once belonged to their legal guardians. Those past nobles still possessed some latent power over those places and used it to ensure the unit received preferential treatment.</p>
<p>“…Once the war ends, I’d like to take the entire unit to a resort,” Grethe said. “There’s one near the south sea. It wouldn’t be fair otherwise. It wouldn’t feel like the war ended.”</p>
<p>The sea. Shin, who sat next to Lena, jolted at the sound of that word. Grethe didn’t say it deliberately, but…</p>
<p><em>I want to show you the sea.</em></p>
<p>That vast expanse of blue Lena had never seen. Once the war ended. Together, just the two of them.</p>
<p><em>…Just the two of us?</em></p>
<p>Lena shook off that sudden thought. This was work. She was on duty. Now wasn’t the time.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the Reginleif’s mission recorder preserved everything the Processor boarding it said. And that was why Grethe, the brigade commander, actually heard what Shin said during that exchange. Lena didn’t know that, though. Having made that implicit comment, Grethe eyed Shin meaningfully, but he bluntly and deliberately looked away.</p>
<p>The corporal who drove their vehicle held his tongue so far, as he <a id="page-48"></a>had to focus on driving through the dark night. But now he spoke to them without taking his eyes off the road.</p>
<p>“Once the war ends, do come visit the Alliance again. Just for sightseeing. We have many wonderful spots that have not been overrun by those infernal contraptions. We would love for you to see them.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Corporal.” Grethe smiled.</p>
<p>Their car soon pulled over. The Alliance wasn’t as cold and received more sunlight than the Federacy and the United Kingdom, so it was blessed with dense forests. The woods served as natural cover and formed a thick canopy of foliage if left to grow. Beneath them was a single facility that seemed to have been built into the ground.</p>
<p>The place was probably designed to function as a headquarters camouflaged by the elevated land. It was heavily guarded by double layers of barbed wire and two sentries. Lena and the Eighty-Six had seen something like this in their home base in the Federacy.</p>
<p>This was the level of vigilance one would expect from a military facility that guarded highly confidential information. Entering and of course looking inside was incredibly restricted. It was a cage that guarded the secrets of a nation’s defense.</p>
<p>The driver held up his ID card, which opened the gate to the base. They went down a winding road before eventually stopping in front of a building. There they had to leave the car and show their individual IDs for the metal door to open.</p>
<p>After closing the door, Grethe asked:</p>
<p>“Now, then. What do you know about the current situation?”</p>
<p>The two drivers weren’t allowed to enter this building. They lacked the clearance to access the information inside. As such, they simply saluted them and returned to the car. This was a question Grethe wasn’t allowed to ask until now.</p>
<p>“A joint interrogation performed by the intelligence sections of the Federacy, the United Kingdom, and the Alliance, though the Alliance wasn’t part of the previous operation.”</p>
<p>“They’re considered a friendly nation, and we have no reason to <a id="page-49"></a>exclude them from the interrogation. As compensation for taking part in it, they took over developing the new gear for us.”</p>
<p>The Alliance of Wald developed the world’s first Feldreß in the past in order to defend its mountainous territory with its uneven terrain. Since the Alliance had very little pastures and farmlands, many people didn’t have the option of working in food production. For years, those spare hands were relegated to trade, military, research, and industry, and as a result, the Alliance had a great edge when it came to its industrial forces and technological developments.</p>
<p>That said, they weren’t quite a match for the Giadian Empire in its heyday. With their large territories and a considerable amount of harvest and tax income from their many subjects, the great noble houses of the Empire could sink all their wealth, industrial forces, and spare time into research. Each noble house competed against the others, and the Empire eventually came to possess transcendent technological prowess.</p>
<p>“But in this case, the Alliance’s true value lies in its neutrality… The Federal Republic of Giad stands on the same land as the Empire, which created the Legion. And the United Kingdom developed the Mariana Model. When the time comes to disclose everything to the other countries, having the Alliance of Wald—a neutral nation—on our side would help improve our credibility. Even if ever so slightly.”</p>
<p>Much like the United Kingdom’s Revich Citadel Base and reserve formation encampment, this base housed its central facilities underground. They took an elevator several levels down and exited into a cold, artificial-looking corridor.</p>
<p>“A common interrogation between the three countries’ intelligence branches…” Vika, who’d held his tongue until now, finally parted his lips to speak. “And after a whole month of interrogation, they still have nothing?”</p>
<p>Lena’s eyes widened in surprise. Grethe turned around and narrowed her eyes at him. He said those words as blankly as someone reciting the contents of a book from memory. To him, this was more than mere conjecture.</p>
<p>“Otherwise, intelligence officers could never bring themselves to ask combat personnel like Nouzen and myself for help. They have their pride <a id="page-50"></a>to consider. They see themselves as those who fight a war of information, unlike barbarians who wield violence. Calling combat personnel to their battlefield? In most cases, their dignity would never allow it.”</p>
<p>Grethe heaved a short sigh.</p>
<p>“Yes. You’re right… They couldn’t get anything out of it. Not even its name from when it was still alive.”</p>
<p>One’s name, rank, date of birth, and identification number: These were the details a captive soldier was required to divulge to their captors, as agreed upon in the war treaties. Assuming, of course, that said countries conformed to those treaties.</p>
<p>The Legion didn’t take prisoners, nor did they distinguish between soldiers and civilians when they slaughtered people. They were not programmed to acknowledge peace treaties that forbade taking prisoners and killing civilians.</p>
<p>Even still, the intelligence branch had to pursue that basic information. It would put their name to shame if they didn’t. But the Legion weren’t affected by drugs or sera. They had no sense of pain, so they couldn’t be tortured.</p>
<p>Interrogation officers had ways of squeezing information out of a prisoner even without resorting to those measures. It was said that the truly skilled could get the information they needed without so much as laying a finger on their target.</p>
<p>“Apparently, it’s completely unresponsive to any and all communications. Speech, text… Nothing seems to get a reaction out of it.”</p>
<p>“…I see. What a bother,” Vika said.</p>
<p>In that case, it was clear why even the most experienced of interrogation officers would yield no results.</p>
<p>“Is it even possible to converse with it? Is that unit really her? Does she still retain the memories and personality she had as a human? They’re all starting to have doubts.”</p>
<p>“…And that’s why they called us.”</p>
<p>Much like on the surface, the long corridor was built in a winding manner, so as to curb the enemy’s marching speed in case of an invasion. And at the end of this corridor was a sturdy metallic door with three locks. The door opened, and upon entering, a voice with the Federacy’s <a id="page-51"></a>accent began instructing them through the speakers. They did as they were told and entered the next room.</p>
<p>There, they were met with soldiers who turned to face them. Some wore the steel-gray Federacy uniforms. Others had the United Kingdom’s dark violet. And some of them had the yellow-brown uniform of the Alliance.</p>
<p>Among the Federacy soldiers was a young female officer with scarlet hair and bloodred eyes, who regarded Shin with a glance. She cracked a thin smile only he would notice. Shin could tell she was a special operative for the Federacy who made use of her extrasensory powers.</p>
<p>She likely descended from the Maika bloodline—his mother’s clan, which possessed the power of telepathy. Marquis Gelda Maika had told them that the Maika clan had branch families capable of reading the minds of people who weren’t related to them.</p>
<p>If even she couldn’t sense <em>the target’</em>s thoughts… It only made sense they would start doubting if the thing they were handling was at all sentient.</p>
<p>The room they were in was originally meant for testing weapons in developmental stages. The walls were covered in metal plates, likely as a means of preventing electromagnetic disturbance. An armored wall separated the part of the room they were in from the back, which housed a large containment cell and a cramped observation chamber right beside it.</p>
<p>The window was likely bulletproof and blast proof. A polarized light was set up to shine into the constraint chamber, making it so the observation chamber wouldn’t be visible through the thick acrylic window from the inside.</p>
<p>And beyond that window…</p>
<p class="space-break1">Sitting with its legs removed, confined in place by multiple bolts fixing it to the floor, was a single Ameise unit.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Lunar-white armor. A golden optical sensor unique to this unit. Its armaments were missing long before it was captured, and it bore the Personal Mark of a goddess leaning against the crescent moon.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The Merciless Queen.</p>
