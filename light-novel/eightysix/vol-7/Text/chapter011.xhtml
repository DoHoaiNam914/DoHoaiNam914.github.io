<p><a id="page-74"></a>“I’m sorry, but that’s classified information. I could expose it to you, but it would only be when and if you become my opponent. When you lose to me and die in battle.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I’m joking… It’s the same reason as you. I’m what they call an Esper.”</p>
<p>Olivia’s blue eyes regarded him with an amused gaze. A uniquely deep shade—a Sapphira’s blue. They were a noble bloodline trait of the Adularia. In other words, a bloodline that had a supernatural ability running in its veins for generations. It was possible that Olivia’s ink-black hair denoted some Jet blood as well.</p>
<p>“My father’s clan was once a warrior clan in the Rinka region. They had the power of future sight. Over time, the bloodline mixed and thinned. I can only see three seconds into the future.”</p>
<p>“And that’s how…”</p>
<p>Olivia’s Stollenwurm, Anna Maria, was a model modified and optimized for melee combat. <em>A fighting style that wasn’t common in present warfare</em>, Shin thought, somewhat blind to his own shortcomings.</p>
<p>But three seconds in the middle of combat granted a huge advantage. Especially in close-range melee combat, being able to see three seconds ahead could make all the difference.</p>
<p>As Shin was beginning to consider what he’d do if he had to face this opponent in combat again, Olivia smiled, as if seeing through him.</p>
<p>“Your face tells me that you’re considering how to beat me next time, Captain. At a glance, you appear stoic and collected, but you’re surprisingly competitive, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“…Being on the losing side doesn’t sit well with me.”</p>
<p>He didn’t harbor any childish illusions of being stronger than anyone else, but…ever since he achieved the position of captain, he’d never relinquished it to anyone.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe our little sparring match ended in a loss for either side. It was a mutual kill… But maybe that stubbornness is what made you develop that much skill and achieve all that you have. I hear that, in the end, you single-handedly felled that new Legion unit, the Phönix.”</p>
<p><a id="page-75"></a>Shin looked at Olivia sharply, and the Alliance’s captain simply shrugged.</p>
<p>“The Alliance gathers information on all the other countries,” Olivia said with a smile, and yet there was a hint of annoyance to those words.</p>
<p>It was as if they were restraining a deep-seated rage.</p>
<p>“We’re finally beginning to return the debt with the development of the Armée Furieuse, but until now, we’ve been one-sidedly receiving information and technology from the Federacy and the United Kingdom. And though we’re grateful, we’re also honestly a bit irritated by this… There is no honor in receiving handouts.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">“Goodness gracious, my apologies for intruding while you’re on leave, Colonel Milizé. And thank you for making time despite my sudden request for a meeting.”</p>
<p>“…Don’t mention it.”</p>
<p>They were in the bathhouse’s lounge, which was located away from the main building of the resort. The place was furnished in a florid style reminiscent of ancient architecture. With a table colored in Tyrian purple made from synthetic dye between them, Lena exchanged pleasantries with her not-at-all welcome guest.</p>
<p>A guest wearing the same Prussian-blue uniform she wore. The Republic’s uniform.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of your many feats, Colonel. How you helped liberate Republic territories occupied by those metal monsters—and the aid you’ve extended to the Federacy. Wonderful, splendid. You are indeed the warrior goddess our Republic takes pride in. The second coming of the Saint Magnolia.”</p>
<p>“Those were all thanks to the power of the Federacy and their Strike Package—and the aid from the United Kingdom. And most importantly of all, the credit goes to the Strike Package’s Processors. This isn’t about me, Lieutenant Colonel.”</p>
<p>“What are you saying? Everyone in the motherland, myself included, knows the truth of it.”</p>
<p><a id="page-76"></a>This middle-aged man with the rank insignia of lieutenant colonel bowed his corpulent form at Lena, who was young enough to pass as his daughter. Apparently, he was a teacher before the Legion War. His round face was fixed in an amicable, sincere smile meant to calm children.</p>
<p>“The Patriotic Knights were right, after all. So long as they are properly managed by the Republic’s capable officers, even the inferior Eighty-Six can become a viable method for opposing the Legion.”</p>
<p>Lena’s expression contorted slightly. <em>Again. They’re doing it again.</em> The words kept coming out—words that crushed Lena under the weight of disgust and loathing. Not toward herself but toward others.</p>
<p>“You are the <em>very personification</em> of it, Colonel Vladilena Milizé. The fact <em>that this unit of Eighty-Six</em> is making unparalleled strides in the Legion War under <em>your</em> command is irrefutable evidence of this.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The words impacted her like a blow to the head. This was the ideology of the Patriotic Knights—or the Bleachers, as the Eighty-Six mockingly called that faction. The Republic’s Alba were the superior race, and San Magnolia would not lose so long as they were allowed dominion over the inferior Eighty-Six.</p>
<p>It filled her with shame and disgust. But the truly horrible part was that she<em>…Lena, of all people…</em>was being propped up as proof of this unrealistic, bigoted nonsense…</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>The shock and outrage of it all made her jaw stiffen, but she somehow managed to speak.</p>
<p>“I will say this as many times as I need to. The Eighty-Sixth Strike Package is a unit that belongs to the Federacy’s military. The child soldiers you call Eighty-Six are citizens of the Federacy and soldiers enlisted in the Federacy military. Me being a Republic soldier doesn’t mean—”</p>
<p>“Thousands die to make one hero, as they say, Colonel Milizé. Merit goes not to the soldiers but to their commander. The Strike Package has distinguished itself under your command, and so its achievements are naturally yours—and by extension, the Republic’s. We cannot let <a id="page-77"></a>the Federacy continue to take everything from us. The credit…and the Eighty-Six…will be with us again before long.”</p>
<p>“The Federacy offered the Eighty-Six asylum from the Republic’s persecution!”</p>
<p>“The word <em>asylum</em> has a pleasant ring to it, but it does not justify appropriating another country’s property! They can call us inhumane for treating pigs like pigs. But does that mean they can freely take what is rightfully ours?! What an absurd notion!!”</p>
<p>“The Eighty-Six… They’re not livestock, and they’re not property. They’re human beings! You can’t—”</p>
<p>Slamming his hand against the desk, he silenced Lena. The lieutenant colonel leaned forward, fixing his glacial stare on her. Desperately.</p>
<p>“…Please do away with this libel. Everything you’ve just said is propaganda, drummed up by the Federacy to humiliate us. These are not things that ought to leave the lips of a Republic citizen such as yourself.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p><em>I…I am…</em></p>
<p>“Please, Colonel. We ask for your cooperation. I do not wish to send my students onto the battlefield. I don’t want to see any of them die.”</p>
<p>Even at the cost of sending the Eighty-Six to their deaths. Again.</p>
<p><em>Aaah…</em> Lena realized, sorrow filling her heart.</p>
<p>Even now, after all this time, after everything that had happened, the Republic’s citizens did not acknowledge the Eighty-Six’s basic human rights. And she finally realized why they were siding with the Bleachers.</p>
<p>It was because if they didn’t get the Eighty-Six back, <em>they</em> would have to be the ones to take to the battlefield.</p>
<p>The system of the Eighty-Sixth Sector was meant to safeguard the Republic’s peace and public order, and they wanted to see it restored. Because if they didn’t, this time it would be them who had to step onto a battlefield of certain death to oppose the Legion.</p>
<p><em>And they’ve been using me…</em>me <em>of all people…as proof that this terrible, morally bankrupt system works…?</em></p>
<p>Lena sank into the sofa, speechless. Despondence, disappointment, and a sense of vertigo overcame her all at once.</p>
<p><a id="page-78"></a><em>It’s all because of me. I’m so…shallow. Because of me, those proud warriors are being called pigs in human form again.</em></p>
<p>“Colonel, you’re a citizen of the Republic, too. Do you not love your homeland? You can’t possibly suggest we send our innocent children onto the battlefield!”</p>
<p>The sound of military boots squeaking against the floor disrupted their argument as someone advanced on the lieutenant colonel, close enough to the point where it bordered on impolite.</p>
<p>“I might not have a homeland, but even I can understand that people feel loyalty to their country. Even if I don’t feel that way myself.”</p>
<p>Lena stiffened at the sound of that voice. She didn’t think it’d be him. Normally, his footsteps were silent, and she thought he was out in the nearby base.</p>
<p>“But I do think that sending other people to die for your country and calling it patriotism is too big of a leap in logic.”</p>
<p>It was Shin, with his usual collected tone and serene gaze.</p>
<p>“Shi… <em>Captain.</em> Er, I thought you were out training…”</p>
<p>“We completed our exercise… And when I came back, our Mascot told us you had a strange guest. So I thought I’d introduce myself.”</p>
<p>Rather than feel relieved, Lena was so ashamed, she wished the ground would open up and swallow her. How much had Shin heard? Did he hear why the man before her, clad in the same uniform as her, was continuing to mock and disparage the Eighty-Six?</p>
<p>And if he did hear all that, how was he feeling now?</p>
<p>The lieutenant colonel, by contrast, looked at Shin in puzzlement. He had the expression of a man who had just been barked at by what he thought was an obedient dog.</p>
<p>“Are you one of the Eighty-Six the Colonel is <em>herding</em>? Seeing you dressed like a human is misleading… This is a conversation between <em>people</em>. Know your place and leave.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s as you said. I’m an Eighty-Six. But… No, <em>because</em> I’m an Eighty-Six…”</p>
<p>Shin spoke composedly. There was no anger in his words. He spoke as if he was simply stating the obvious.</p>
<p><a id="page-79"></a>“…there’s no reason I should stand by and let you mock me, Republic citizen. Not you nor anyone else.”</p>
<p>Lena looked at Shin in awe. This was something he had never said before. Up until now, he had simply disregarded all the scorn directed toward him, acting as if he wasn’t bothered by any of it. He would say there was no point in taking offense or responding to anything the white pigs said. Because no matter what he might say, they wouldn’t understand. Because no amount of explaining would make them understand they were wrong.</p>
<p>Those ignorant pigs may have pretended to be capable of language, but the truth was that they didn’t understand anything they were told. And to an extent, Shin still believed this. But despite that, he wouldn’t put up with these insults any longer. His calm voice and tranquil eyes grimly communicated this.</p>
<p>“Know your—”</p>
<p>“I’m well aware of my place, and that’s why I’m talking to you. I’m not livestock, and I’m not a drone component, either… Same as how you people aren’t some superior species. You’re just the ignorant citizens of a republic that died in the large-scale offensive.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">The lieutenant colonel walked off, spouting vitriol and swearing he’d issue a complaint to the Federacy for this insult. Shin simply watched him walk off, his eyes utterly apathetic to it all.</p>
<p>“Complaining about a ‘filthy <em>stain’</em> to a Federacy made up of people representing all hues. Does that man think before he opens his mouth?”</p>
<p>“…Shin, I’m sorry,” Lena said, hanging her head.</p>
<p>“No need to apologize. I’ve told you before: The words of people like him don’t get to me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Lena’s hands, which rested on her waist, firmly grabbed the hem of the skirt of her Prussian-blue Republic uniform. In this moment, the fact that it was a different color from Shin’s was especially hard to ignore.</p>
<p>“Still… I’m sorry.”</p>
<p><a id="page-80"></a>“…I won’t stop you if you want to apologize that much, and if you insist you’re no different from the rest of the Republic, I won’t argue… But…”</p>
<p>Lena looked up, only for her gaze to meet his bloodred eyes. Her crestfallen form was reflected in them, and there was a tinge of sadness and concern in his eyes. They were earnest.</p>
<p>“You might be a woman of the Republic, but at the same time, you’re the queen of the Eighty-Six. Please don’t deny that. Not now.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">“My, Shinei… You truly are becoming the image of dauntless masculinity, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think that’s rude? I’d stop if I were you.”</p>
<p>Sitting atop a lion-legged sofa was Frederica, nodding sagely as her crimson eyes glimmered. Next to her, Vika cut into her words, utterly exasperated. The monitor of the mobile terminal in his hands detected his eyes had moved away from it and automatically turned off the hologram it was projecting.</p>
<p>“I can understand being concerned for Nouzen, especially given what happened in the United Kingdom. But isn’t it about time you stop clinging to your brother so much?”</p>
<p>“I am merely watching over him!” Frederica retorted grumpily.</p>
<p>Vika looked at her with slight irritation. He was surprised that Shin could put up with this cheeky Mascot’s whims. They may have had the same bloodred eyes and black hair, but they weren’t actually siblings.</p>
<p>…And that made Vika wonder. What circumstances brought this girl to the Strike Package in the first place? Vika knew the Imperial army once employed Mascots as well and assumed this girl was the result of some high-ranking noble’s unbridled lust. But why send her to <em>this</em> unit?</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose eavesdropping any longer would indeed be boorish of me…,” Frederica said, sullenly closing her eyes. “What of Shion and the others? Did our Strike Package emerge safe and victorious?”</p>
<p>First Lieutenant Siri Shion of the 2nd Armored Division was currently filling in for Shin as operations commander of the Strike Package. <a id="page-81"></a>Under their command, the Strike Package’s 2nd and 3rd Armored Divisions were dispatched to the northern coast’s basin countries. Vika had been watching the reports of their fighting on his information terminal’s news program until now.</p>
<p>“Eighty percent of their initial objective is complete, by the looks of it. They had to break through enemy lines again, but… Well, given how much of a show the news is making of it, I don’t think there were many losses.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“At least as far as the public is concerned, the Strike Package is the Federacy’s trump card for opposing the threat of the Legion. And seeing as the end of the war isn’t even on the horizon, the people would never be allowed to hear anything about them struggling, to say nothing of losing. The Federacy would never be able to maintain morale if they let that kind of news come out.”</p>
<p>Frederica furrowed her brows, picking up on Vika’s implications. A unit that couldn’t afford to lose—to fail in its duty. In other words…</p>
<p>“…They must continue being a company of heroes, you say…”</p>
<p>“The Eighty-Six have multiple factors that make it easy to prop them up as heroes.”</p>
<p>A history that drew on one’s attention and the strength of the elite. And…tragedy. Even the savior’s name itself would not have gone down in history had he not been sentenced to crucifixion.</p>
<p>“And what of your unit? Are they doing well?” Frederica asked.</p>
<p>“The news didn’t report on them, but they’re probably fine. Despite appearances, that woman’s reliable when it comes to completing her objectives… If only she was that capable <em>off</em> the battlefield.”</p>
<p>“Zashya, was it? I can certainly understand your concerns regarding that one.”</p>
<p>Zashya was a major of the United Kingdom military who was dispatched to the Strike Package alongside Vika and served as his deputy in running the regiment. With Vika in the Alliance, she took over command in his place.</p>
<p>She was a petite girl with large, unfashionable glasses. She would <a id="page-82"></a>trip over herself whenever walking down the corridor and often drop all the documents she was carrying. A timid, unreliable girl who always broke into tears when Vika chewed her out for her blunders.</p>
<p>Incidentally, <em>Zashya</em> wasn’t her actual name but a nickname he gave her. It meant <em>little rabbit girl</em>, but the Eighty-Six assumed it was her actual name, and so the name <em>Major Zashya</em> remained, even after that misunderstanding was corrected.</p>
<p>“Still, she did graduate from the special officer academy at the top of her class, one way or another. Practical courses included… But that aside…”</p>
<p>“…What?” Frederica asked, shuddering at the image of that girl going through officer’s training.</p>
<p>Vika ignored her and carried on.</p>
<p>“Worrying over her work after I’d entrusted her with my duties is bad manners for a ruler. I trust her to handle things, one way or other.”</p>
<p>Frederica fell silent for a moment. <em>Bad manners for a ruler.</em> For a <em>king</em>.</p>
<p>“But I thought you did not intend to inherit the throne.”</p>
<p>Frederica was an empress without any territory or subjects. But even so, she intended to act as a ruler would. Until now, she’d fulfilled none of the duties of an empress—and that filled her with regret. A regret she shared with no one.</p>
<p>“And despite insisting that you won’t be king, you still act as a royal would?”</p>
<p>Vika cocked his head, puzzled. Why would a girl who wasn’t royalty herself ask him that question?</p>
<p>“I do. Because I believe that’s how I ought to act.”</p>

<p class="space-break">Despite being the busiest of them all, even Shin’s schedule was surprisingly open. Halfway through breakfast, he suddenly remembered he had free time that day and proposed to Lena that the two of them head into town.</p>
<p>“Assuming you’re free, that is. As a change of pace.”</p>
<p><a id="page-83"></a>“Yes, I’m free; let’s go!” Lena nodded enthusiastically. The gloom that had hung over her head ever since the lieutenant colonel’s visit went flying out the window.</p>
<p>To reach the town closest to the hotel, they needed to cross the lake. They got on one of the ferries that shuttled passengers, not unlike a tram or a metro, and watched as the red rooftops characteristic of the Alliance’s cities came into view.</p>
<p>Neither Shin nor Lena chose this city for any particular reason. They bought some sort of cold confection from one of the stalls set up along the main plaza and watched a street performer make his tamed cats dance around. Lena spent a good while staring at a strange, handcrafted doll.</p>
<p>“…Do you think I could teach TP to do those kinds of tricks? Jump and somersault like that?”</p>
<p>“TP might be able to do that, but I don’t think you’d be able to train it regularly. You spoil it,” Shin said teasingly.</p>
<p>“…Hmph,” Lena scoffed. “I do <em>not</em> spoil him. You’re just cold to him. And he <em>still</em> likes you better. It’s not fair, if you ask me.”</p>
<p>Lena’s miffed reaction made Shin chuckle. Hearing him laugh made her exceedingly happy, and before long, she was giggling, too. There were other Processors who would come to town to relax, and every now and then, the two of them spotted a familiar face in the crowd.</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s Shin and Lena,” they said. “Check out the fried sweets they’re selling over there.”</p>
<p>Being a land of trade and commerce, the Alliance’s culture had mingled over many years with the small countries to the south of the mountains. And so the town was quite new and unusual for Lena and Shin, who had grown up and lived in the cities of the Republic and the Federacy.</p>
<p>Lena in particular was used to the flat terrain of Liberté et Égalité, and so the uneven territories of the Alliance and the city being built on a steep slope was quite the exciting difference for her.</p>
<p>Many of the people passing by were Caerulea with silver and golden hair and blue eyes. This reminded her of Daiya, a boy whom she never <a id="page-84"></a>met, who was also apparently a Caerulea. It was he who had adopted TP first.</p>
<p>“Even back in the Eighty-Sixth Sector, they said TP was the most attached to you… He wasn’t called that back then, though. And we didn’t know each other’s names or faces.”</p>
<p>“At the time, I was wondering when you’d get tired of talking to us and stop Resonating.”</p>
<p>Looking ahead, she saw Shin put a few picture postcards he bought at a souvenir shop into his bag. Apparently, he was going to give them to his grandparents. His paternal grandfather, Marquis Nouzen, and his maternal grandmother, Marquis Maika. He was keeping in touch with them, but since they’d only been introduced last month, things were still a bit awkward between them. Still, they were all trying to forge a familial bond.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Shin thought Lena was a naive girl with a bleeding heart who was pretending to be a saint. And as such, he simply called her Handler One. But now things were different. In much the same way, he had avoided meeting his grandparents, and now he was trying to grow closer to them.</p>
<p>It was a big adjustment for Shin. And seeing him change for the better made Lena happy. But…it also made her feel a bit lonely.</p>
<p>“Especially after you heard Kaie’s voice, I was…pretty sure you wouldn’t Resonate again.”</p>
<p>“Honestly…I was a bit scared, and that’s why it took me so long to muster up the courage.”</p>
<p>“I was surprised. Not by how long it took you, but by the fact that you were the only Handler who Resonated with me again after being exposed to so many of the Legion’s voices from that close.”</p>
<p>Shin took in the view of the summer skyline, which was as cool as it was radiant.</p>
<p>“…Looking back on it now, I think it’s a good thing we didn’t push you away.”</p>
<p>The tone in which he said those words made Lena’s heart skip a beat. Some part of her felt she couldn’t hear the rest of whatever he had <a id="page-86"></a>to say right at this moment. She wasn’t prepared yet… Her heart wasn’t ready.</p>
