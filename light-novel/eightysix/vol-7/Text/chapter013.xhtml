<p>“E-er…”</p>
<p>“Huh, Nouzen.” A voice suddenly interrupted their exchange.</p>
<p>It was Marcel. Shin stopped in his tracks, and Lena, whom Marcel apparently didn’t see, came into view.</p>
<p>“…And Lena. Uh, looks like you were in the middle of something. I’ll, uh, make myself scarce.”</p>
<p>“…No, it’s fine… Don’t worry about it,” Shin said, cocking his head as he looked at the red-roofed, wooden-framework shop behind Marcel. “That’s a strange store for you to be in.”</p>
<p>Adorable stuffed animals lined the shop window. Apparently, it was a toy store that focused on the Alliance’s traditional crafts. Marcel, with his sharp eyes and prickly hair, stood out rather oddly between the fluffy plushies of wildcats lining the shelves.</p>
<p>“Oh, this? I just figured since we got the chance to go abroad, I’d buy Nina a gift. Not like I have any taste for this…,” he grumpily appended, looking around at the various plushies.</p>
<p>He was apparently torn between buying a few small ones that could sit in the palm of her hand or one of the bigger ones sitting on the shelf—that were as large as several stuffed animals combined but not too unwieldy for a child to carry around.</p>
<p>After a moment of contemplation, Shin took a bill from his wallet and presented it to Marcel.</p>
<p>“Let me pitch in, too.”</p>
<p>Marcel eyed him with surprise for a second, then cracked a smile.</p>
<p>“Sure. I’ll say it’s from her big brother’s friend… I won’t be specific, so she won’t piece it together.”</p>
<p>He added that last part in a hurry, recalling certain events. Lena didn’t understand what it meant.</p>
<p>“…Someday, when things settle down, you should meet her. Eugene kept writing about you in his letters, so their grandma wants to meet you, too. And I’m sure Nina will want to know about you, once she’s old <a id="page-87"></a>enough to remember. Though, I think it’d be better if you didn’t tell them how it all ended.”</p>
<p>“Right.” Shin smiled bitterly and shrugged. “I’d like it if she didn’t hear any more bad stories about me.”</p>
<p>“C’mon… I apologized, didn’t I…? Anyway, sorry for interrupting.”</p>
<p>Pulling down one of the larger stuffed animals from the shelf, Marcel headed for the cash register. He opened the store’s glass door, and as a bell rang, they heard the clerk’s greeting.</p>
<p>Lena, who had kept silent…or rather, was forced to stay silent throughout the exchange, asked a question as she watched Marcel leave.</p>
<p>“Who were you talking about?”</p>
<p>Nina and Eugene. Those were both unfamiliar names to her.</p>
<p>“A friend of ours from the special officer academy—and his little sister… Ernst insisted that the Spearhead squadron members all go to different special officer academies, and that’s when I met him.”</p>
<p>Thinking back, Lena did recall how Shin, Raiden, Kurena, and the rest all seemed to have acquaintances among the soldiers in Rüstkammer and varied Federacy bases. Some of them were soldiers similar in age, and others were older noncommissioned officers who would thank them for saving their lives at one point or another. Lena didn’t know any of those people.</p>
<p>“Eugene died before the large-scale offensive, and Marcel seemed to know him even before that, so he knew Nina, his sister. I happened to know her, too.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>This was a story she didn’t know, of people she’d never heard of. And once she thought about it, it seemed painfully obvious. It’d been two years since Shin went out on the Special Reconnaissance mission and found his way to the Federacy. He’d spent two years of his life in the Federacy, two years of experiences and human relations.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Grethe and Marcel. He had formed bonds with many people Lena didn’t know… Even outside the Eighty-Sixth Sector’s battlefield, he’d tried to live his life.</p>
<p><a id="page-88"></a>A life in the Federacy… A life without Lena.</p>
<p>And once again, for whatever reason…that feeling filled her with the slightest bit of loneliness.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“…Why did you come here personally? You’re the chief of staff.”</p>
<p>“Are you seriously asking me that, Grethe? It was you who reported a Republic officer visiting this place, without informing the Federacy ahead of time.”</p>
<p>Grethe’s gaze fell on the chief of staff, Willem Ehrenfried, who was seated alone on the sofa with an air of leisurely composure and a thin smile. One of the hotel’s rooms was hurriedly prepared for his visit.</p>
<p>“I am the one who organized this trip if you recall. Having a cheeky weißhaare trudge into this place would only cause the Eighty-Six undue distress. And so I, in my gracious concern, came all this way to check on the matter.”</p>
<p>His wording made Grethe raise an eyebrow. A Republic citizen or two wouldn’t bother the Eighty-Six at this point, and Willem knew this ever since the Charité Underground Labyrinth operation. The only one really bothered by it was Lena.</p>
<p>“So that’s your pretense.”</p>
<p>“This room’s been swept clean. You can speak freely.”</p>
<p>In other words, even though this was another country’s facility, they didn’t need to worry about walking into a trap.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you know this already, but your presence here is classified information. That includes Colonel Milizé’s whereabouts,” Willem said.</p>
<p>A unit’s assignment and activities were a state secret. An outsider should have had no way of knowing that the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package’s 1st Armored Division was on leave or how long they’d be on leave. To say nothing of the fact that some of them were sent to the Alliance.</p>
<p><em>In other words…</em> Grethe narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>That lieutenant colonel visited Lena based on information he should not have had access to. Same as how the Legion kept ambushing and attacking the Strike Package, despite its activities being kept under wraps.</p>
<p><a id="page-89"></a>“The lieutenant colonel’s visit proves he has access to this leaked information,” Grethe concluded.</p>
<p>“And revealing that to us is quite careless of both him and whoever’s backing him. Well, it doesn’t come as a surprise. The Republic’s actual soldiers died ten years ago in defense of their countries. The people running their military now are effectively inexperienced novices.”</p>
<p>Willem shrugged.</p>
<p>His aide, who was always at his back like a shadow, wasn’t in this room.</p>
<p>“Captain Nouzen did a good job of driving the lieutenant colonel away. He left the same day he came… Still, if we pursue him quickly enough, we could catch up to him before he gets home. It’s a long way to the Republic from here.”</p>

<p class="space-break">“Talking to it didn’t help any. I don’t get what that queen wants, exactly.”</p>
<p>As Annette angrily fired off the same complaints the interrogation officers had been repeating for the last two weeks, Shin, who was seated across the table from her, looked at her. They were in a lounge in the same underground base as the interrogation room.</p>
<p>Also present were Vika and Lena, who were equally bewildered.</p>
<p>“It told us to come find it because it had something to say, right? So we came on over and caught it, and now it’s giving us the silent treatment? At this point, we might as well pry its central processor open and see if we can pull out its memories that way. This is stupid.”</p>
<p>“As odd as it may sound coming from me, you’re quite the frightening one,” Vika commented dryly.</p>
<p>“Its memories don’t lie behind an encrypted program within its central processor but inside its neural network. There’s no telling if we can actually output its memories anyway.” Annette bitterly poked a hole into her own suggestion.</p>
<p>“What about her mother…? I mean, couldn’t they bring her over to try to convince her?” Lena suggested meekly.</p>
<p><a id="page-90"></a>“She’s bedridden in a hospital.” Vika shook his head. “Disturbing her even a little could kill her. We can’t use someone like that as a hostage.”</p>
<p>“I…see.”</p>
<p>“Don’t force yourself to say things that don’t sit well with you, Lena,” Annette told her. “I can tell how hard it was for you to suggest that.”</p>
<p>Lena dropped her shoulders, and Shin suppressed the urge to sigh. He could tell she wanted to be of use in this conversation, but he didn’t want her to say cruel things while her expression was riddled with guilt.</p>
<p>…And Lena had been acting strange as of late. At first, he thought it was because of that Bleacher’s visit, but even when he took her to town in an attempt to cheer her up, her anxiety didn’t subside.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, do you have any idea why the queen’s not talking?” Annette asked him.</p>
<p>“That’s a difficult question to answer. I’d only spoken to her a handful of times when she was still alive. That message she sent could have just been a trap to lure Nouzen and me in…”</p>
<p>And there was always the chance that the Merciless Queen wasn’t Zelene to begin with, but they willingly pushed that possibility to the back of their minds. If that was true, it would mean they’d gone to the trouble of capturing it for nothing.</p>
<p>With that said, Vika furrowed his brows.</p>
<p>“Or perhaps she intended to share information initially but refuses to share it <em>with us</em>. Her homeland was the Empire, and the Federacy is effectively the country that destroyed it. Even if that’s not the case, Zelene was a soldier. She didn’t favor war.”</p>
<p>“But she was a soldier…” Shin cocked an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Let me ask you, then. You’re a soldier. Do <em>you</em> like war?”</p>
<p><em>…Ah.</em></p>
<p>“Major Birkenbaum was a soldier, yes… But she only became one out of her hatred for war. Her older brother was a soldier as well, and he lost his life in combat. She said that was her impetus for creating the Legion… And for as cold and reclusive as she was, her face was that of a witch, cursing the world.”</p>
<p><a id="page-91"></a>Turning a glance to Lerche, who stood behind him, Vika shrugged in self-derision.</p>
<p>“Zelene herself was injured and nearing death at the time, so she was likely quite pressed to act. I can’t imagine she would bring herself to create something like the Legion unless she was fully consumed by the idea… For example, have you realized that none of the Legion’s aerial units are weaponized? That prohibition doesn’t stem from a problem in IFF recognition, if you ask me. It’s because Zelene <em>hated</em> armed aircrafts. That older brother of hers died when a friendly craft accidently fired on him.”</p>
<p>She probably thought there could be no trusting armed aircrafts or the people piloting them. And she likely hated war because it destroyed her family—and even cut away at her own life.</p>
<p>“…If she was so opposed to war, then why create the Legion?”</p>
<p>“Far be it from me to know… Wanting to destroy something out of hatred may not be the most sensible approach, but it happens all too often.”</p>
<p>Wanting to destroy the world she cursed and reviled, not unlike a witch.</p>
<p>“That’s the extent of what I understand about her… But perhaps you picked up some kind of clue, Nouzen? If nothing else, your father knew Zelene far better than I did.”</p>
<p>“No… I don’t think I ever met her.”</p>
<p>“Nothing, then…,” Vika lamented.</p>
<p>Annette shrugged grandly, as if to shake up the mood.</p>
<p>“Well, here’s a weird thought to chew on. Had things happened a bit differently, the two of you could have been childhood friends… And that applies to me, too, come to think of it… Whoa, creepy…”</p>
<p>“Speaking of friends… Nouzen, what of Fido? I thought it strange when I heard of the one drone the Republic actually did develop, but was it not completed?”</p>
<p>An odd pause hung between them.</p>
<p>“…Fido?” Shin repeated the name dubiously.</p>
<p>He cocked his head at Vika, as if wondering why that name left his lips.</p>
<p><a id="page-92"></a>“Do you not remember that, either? It was the prototype for the artificial-intelligence model your father was researching. I recall him complaining that his youngest son…that is to say, you…named it Fido and wouldn’t agree to have its name changed.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t the Scavenger Fido but some other Fido. Yet…sadly, Shin couldn’t remember anything of the sort. The most he could eventually uncover in his memory was the faint feeling that there might have been something like it in the past, but he couldn’t remember its name. Maybe it <em>was</em> called Fido, Shin thought, as Annette groaned next to him.</p>
<p>“Ugh, you mean that weird robot dog, right? I think Shin’s dad called it…Prototype 008… Wait.” Annette suddenly regarded Shin with half-lidded eyes. “You gave your Scavenger the same name? You really haven’t grown out of that crappy naming sense, have you? You’re giving Lena a run for her money.”</p>
<p>“If you’re talking about TP, I can’t say I appreciate the comparison.”</p>
<p>“You guys are mean,” Lena muttered to herself sullenly, which both Shin and Annette tacitly ignored.</p>
<p>“My naming sense is at least better than the way you named things in the Eighty-Sixth Sector,” Annette said, keeping up her argument. “You were going to call it Remarque, right? Maybe you were trying to be cynical, but it’s so roundabout, it just doesn’t make sense.”</p>
<p>“You say that, Rita, but why did you try to raise a chicken back then? It was a hen, but for some reason, it chased you around like a rooster.”</p>
<p>“What, are you trying to say it was weird? Chickens are cute. And I enjoyed its eggs up until the large-scale offensive.”</p>
<p>“………Oh.”</p>
<p>“What’s with that face?! I’m a better cook than I was back then! Oh, and I didn’t forget about that one time I made you a batch of cookies, and you asked if they were monsters!”</p>
<p>“…They were sweets, yes, but they were charred black and had three eyes apiece.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?! Well, at least you recognized them as baked goods! It’s not like you can accurately identify a food after it’s been burned black, right?! You can’t, can you?! Dummy! Idiot! Moron!”</p>
<p><a id="page-93"></a>“…Ahem!” Lena loudly cut their argument short.</p>
<p>At some point, they’d regressed to the petty squabbles they had as children, but her exclamation made them come to their senses. Shin suddenly realized, in a rush of incomprehensible guilt, that he’d never called Annette Rita in front of Lena before.</p>
<p>“So what happened to that…Prototype 008, Annette?”</p>
<p>“…Well, they took Shin and his family to the internment camps, and I never saw it again, no matter how much I looked for it.”</p>
<p>She assumed it was broken. Either as part of the pillaging or out of some kind of half-hearted game.</p>
<p>“So it was lost in vain, you say… A pity.”</p>
<p>Vika shook his head, half in disappointment, half in amusement. Annette looked at him questioningly, to which he shrugged.</p>
<p>“That one was a different kind of AI compared with the Sirins and the Legion. One developed entirely to be a companion pet. To that end, if it was ordered to fight to defend someone, it would do so. The Legion aren’t human. They cannot fulfill a wish to be friends and companions to humankind. The only ones who would have had the duty to defend people, who could find our place…are those who would see us as friends.”</p>
<p>“So you’re saying…,” Annette said, her eyes wide with shock, “…we dug our own graves…?”</p>
<p>“Annette? What do you…?” Lena asked.</p>
<p>“I mean, that’s what it means! If Shin’s dad had been allowed the time to complete the Fido project… If the Eighty-Six hadn’t been persecuted, the Republic <em>really could have had a war with zero casualties</em>!”</p>
<p><em>Ah…</em></p>
<p>Lena felt her blood freeze.</p>
<p>The Republic “loaded” the Processors onto their drones with the pretense of them being information-processing units, and they did it because they couldn’t develop an AI advanced enough to perform fully autonomous combat. Because they couldn’t maintain their defensive front without stripping the Eighty-Six of their human rights and casting them out into the battlefield.</p>
<p><a id="page-94"></a>But if Fido had been completed… If it’d been established as an artificial intelligence capable of autonomous combat…</p>
<p>“We said we did it because we had to. We turned a blind eye to injustice while knowing we were committing a grave sin. We let millions die only for it all to be exposed, for every other country in the world to denounce us. But all that persecution wasn’t even necessary in the first place. If we’d only done what was right, neither the Eighty-Six nor the Republic’s people would have had to die… It’s… Just what kind…?”</p>
<p>Annette gritted her teeth bitterly at Lena’s words. Shin kept quiet, worried that anything he might say would come across as an accusation. Even though none of it was Lena’s fault.</p>
<p>But the two of them couldn’t see it that way.</p>
<p>“What kind of cruel irony is this…?!”</p>
<p class="space-break2">The hotel’s guest rooms were all doubles. Raiden roomed with Shin. He was out at a meeting regarding the Merciless Queen but came back a bit sooner than planned, just as Raiden poured himself a fresh cup of coffee from the room’s kettle.</p>
<p>“Oh, hey, welcome back.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Thanks,” Shin said, accepting the mug he handed him and narrowing his eyes in amusement. “You know, Kujo and Daiya, they always used to call you our squad’s mom.”</p>
<p>“Oh…? Give that mug back; I’ll put a few spoons of mustard in your coffee.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got mustard handy? You really are the squad mom, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“The hell?”</p>
<p>The two of them wrestled over the mug for a while, albeit carefully enough so as to not spill the coffee.</p>
<p>“…What are you even doing here this early? There’s still a while before dinner,” Shin asked.</p>
<p>“I just figured I’d wash my clothes before that shindig on the last <a id="page-95"></a>day… You should probably do some laundry, too. Wouldn’t want your clothes to be all dirty and wrinkled when it’s go time, right?”</p>
<p>“Okay, Mom…”</p>
<p>“Fuck off.”</p>
<p>Having finished their coffee, the two of them took playful jabs at each other a while longer. The fact that Shin could easily dispatch him in a mock sparring match left Raiden very unamused.</p>
<p>“…Speaking of, you’ve definitely shaken off that Reaper atmosphere you always had going on.”</p>
<p>Shin only replied with a questioning glance, to which Raiden responded, sitting cross-legged on his bed with his chin resting on his hands.</p>
<p>“Especially when it comes to Lena. You’d always call her Handler One, but now you call her by her name. And when you said <em>I’m off</em> and spoke of how you’d show her the sea… I didn’t think the eastern front’s Reaper was capable of it… Oh yeah,” Raiden appended with a smirk. “Don’t use the interrogation as an excuse to run away. Just tell her already.”</p>
<p>“…Shut up.”</p>
<p>“If ya need a situation to set the mood, we can back you up. How about a spot with a nice night view…? I guess the last day we’re here would be the best time, though.”</p>
<p>“Shut up… I was gonna say it last time, but Marcel interrupted.”</p>
<p>“Still, you’d better do it in a way that makes her happy. Even a blockhead like you can figure that out, right?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Shin fell silent, which caused Raiden to realize he’d probably played with fire long enough, so he clammed up, too. Shin was…clearly displeased. Like a carefree child who didn’t need to bottle up his emotions.</p>
<p>“…And now you can even make that sort of face,” Raiden whispered to himself, so Shin wouldn’t hear it.</p>
<p>He carefully looked up at Shin.</p>
<p>“What?” Shin asked him grumpily.</p>
<p><a id="page-96"></a>“Nothing.”</p>
<p><em>I was just thinking that you really have changed.</em></p>
<p>Raiden shooed him out of the room, telling him that the bath was still open so he should go clean himself off. Shin left with a dubious expression.</p>
<p>Raiden watched the door shut and pondered things. When they first met, he really thought he’d run into the Grim Reaper occupying the body of a boy his age. His expressions, his gaze, the heart beating within him—they had all frozen over. Ground to dust. Chipped.</p>
<p>But now, that very same boy knew how to smile naturally. Especially since meeting that kindhearted crybaby of a Handler.</p>
<p>“…Guess it’s not all bad, huh?”</p>
<p>The country that was supposedly his homeland had ordered him to die. The brother he once cherished nearly murdered him. The battlefield he stood on was closed off by the Legion, and he was forced to bury his beloved comrades time and again. After weathering all of it and more, the only thing he had left was the cold, dead heart of a reaper.</p>
<p>The malice of humankind and the cruelty of the world had made Shin what he was.</p>
<p>But at the very end, he was still able to learn that it was okay for him to seek salvation. It was okay for him to dream. He learned that there was still the slightest speck of something that might be called hope within him. That this fetid shithole of a world wasn’t completely irredeemable.</p>
<p>For the first time in his life, the Reaper had something to live for.</p>
<p>That name was a curse of sorts. It was a shackle that bound him to the cross he carried—but that cross also fixed him in place. The drive to gun down his brother’s ghost was both a curse and a blessing: an objective that spurred him forward.</p>
<p>To take all their dead comrades to their final destination. Having that role was what kept Shin from collapsing on the wayside. What kept him going, one step at a time, even one step forward, until the very end.</p>
<p>But even so… They were the ones who were being saved and supported by him.</p>
<p><a id="page-97"></a>“You’ve saved us plenty of times already… It’s time we let you live your life, man.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">On his way to the bathhouse, Shin ran into Captain Aegis, who was speaking to the Processors who weren’t participating in the test. Watching the captain’s long black hair sway like a tail, Shin thought of TP, the black kitten Daiya picked up once upon a time. Only its paws were white, like socks.</p>
<p>At the time, they didn’t give it a name and just called it whatever came to mind. Back then, they thought Lena was just an irresponsible handler of livestock, living smugly in the safety of the walls.</p>
<p>When had he decided to give her a formal good-bye…? Why had he thought that entrusting her with that wish would be right? Why was it that he placed so much faith in her back then?</p>
<p>Shin’s eyes suddenly widened.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“Captain Nouzen. We’re currently considering disassembling it. Its uncooperative nature is only making the option seem that much more viable. Perhaps letting it know of our intent could serve as a bargaining chip…”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Shin curtly cut off the intelligence section chief’s words. They were speaking in Shin’s room.</p>
<p>Doing that would be meaningless. The Legion don’t fear death, and threats don’t faze them.</p>
<p>“Forget that, Section Chief… Let me into the confinement room.”</p>
<p>Everyone present was rendered speechless by Shin’s suggestion.</p>
<p>“What are you…?” Lena reflexively started saying, but Shin cut her words short with a look.</p>
<p>His eyes communicated that he had no intention of doing anything careless. He wasn’t like before, when he thought little of his own death. The section chief exchanged glances with the other people in charge <a id="page-98"></a>of the room—one in a violet uniform and another in olive drab—before agreeing.</p>
<p>“Check that the restraints are working as intended. And keep the machine guns primed and ready in case we need to dispose of it. What do you think your chances of getting it to talk are, Captain?”</p>
<p>“The Merciless Queen went out of its way to reveal itself to me in the Dragon Fang Mountain. It didn’t try to kill me, and it even led Raiden and the others to me. So if my guess as to why it did that is correct…”</p>
<p>The lock to the confinement room’s gate, which was sealed off by reinforced alloy bolts, came undone. The two-layered doors opened, leaving only the door on the observation room’s side.</p>
<p>“Leave the Para-RAID on…,” the section chief said. “And don’t get too close. The moment we feel it poses a danger to you, we will gun it down.”</p>
<p>The gate was made up of thick metal walls and was essentially a long passageway. Shin passed through the door without another word. It closed behind him, after which the door to the confinement room finally opened. He stood at the boundary between the confinement room and the corridor, at a point where the floor’s material changed, as if to demarcate a borderline.</p>
<p>Noticing his presence, the Merciless Queen stirred like an insect reacting to prey, trying to rise to its feet. But the constraints prevented it from doing so. It was an almost reflexive sort of movement, a mechanical reaction.</p>
<p>Because, yes, the Legion slaughter all that stand before them. Be they people, cities, countries, or armies, they trample anything in their path without distinction. Such were their instincts. It was the same as how a land mine cared little for the identity of whomever triggered it. They were weapons that killed indiscriminately.</p>
<p>But in the magma lake of the Dragon Fang Mountain, this Merciless Queen rebelled against those instincts and made no attempt to kill him. It simply crept closer, as if to toy with him. Or perhaps appraise him. But of course, there was always the chance things would have gone <a id="page-99"></a>another way had he faced it any longer. Had Raiden and the others not gone after it, and had no one been there to stop it, things might have played out differently.</p>
<p>“I know you can hear my voice, Queen of the Legion.”</p>
<p>Shin realized bitterly that not having a name to address it by was inconvenient. He couldn’t call it Zelene, because if it wasn’t her, the queen could try to impersonate her. And calling it the Merciless Queen wasn’t right, either. So only being able to give it this moniker struck Shin as irritating.</p>
<p>Back in the Eighty-Sixth Sector, he always viewed names as nothing more than symbols used for the sake of designation. And he always hated his own name for sounding so close to the word <em>sin…</em></p>
<p>But two years ago, he didn’t give Lena his name until she asked to hear it. And looking back on it now, he had to wonder how he ever led such a life.</p>
<p>“You were the one who called for me, weren’t you? <em>Come find me</em>, you said. And I did. So if you have anything to say, I’ll listen. Right here, right now. And if you won’t answer, I’ll leave.”</p>
<p>It was hard to say they were occupying the same room, since there was a good ten meters between them. But as the Merciless Queen’s moonlike optical sensor stared fixedly at him without blinking, Shin thought he could see a hint of panic in its gaze.</p>
<p>He’d felt it for seven years. The mechanical monstrosities’ bloodlust. He could sense it seeping through the Ameise’s armor. The constraints creaked heavily.</p>
<p>Two years ago, he could believe in Lena. A girl he’d never met from within the walls. And he could trust her because he chose to get to know her. To speak to her, to listen to what she had to say… Because they could learn to know each other.</p>
<p>Had they not conversed, they never would have grown closer. And one can’t trust in someone or something they don’t know. And so he decided to do this, one-sidedly, without trying to test her.</p>
<p>The creaking of the constraints died down. It raised its white armor <a id="page-100"></a>ever so slightly, and a faint silvery glow began to seep out of it. Liquid Micromachines. Searching his memory, Shin knew that the Phönix was the only Legion unit confirmed to possess the ability of turning them into butterflies and flying away.</p>
<p>But there was another unit that he recalled making use of them in some fashion. His brother—the Dinosauria Shepherd. The “hands” that extended from it. The hands that gently reached out to him at the very end… Hands that, like a person’s, could no doubt strangle just as easily as they could caress.</p>
<p>“I know nothing about you. I don’t know why you called me or even why you’re silent right now. So I want you to tell me, with your own words.”</p>
<p>The Liquid Micromachines continued seeping out. But just as Shin began to dread they would take a physical form…</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Leave this confinement room. Evacuation to observation room advised.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break1">It was like audio being played from an old record. Like the sound of a sentient, inhuman being forcing itself to speak in the human tongue. It was a mechanical voice that was incredibly difficult to make out.</p>
<p>The voice came from an information terminal that allowed for audio communications, which was set inside the confinement room. It had been activated without anyone touching it, opening a holo-screen full of static noise. The stressing and volume of this static noise was used to produce human words.</p>
<p>Shin could hear the surprised tumult filling the observation room through the Sensory Resonance coming from the RAID Device sitting on his uniform’s collar. He couldn’t blame them for being shocked. This was probably the first dialogue between a human and a Legion unit in all recorded history.</p>
<p>He could hear Vika mutter to himself, saying he could see now that it dreaded the idea of killing Shin, even by accident.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara"><a id="page-101"></a>&lt;&lt;Once evacuation is complete, response to queries will commence. Evacuate to observation room. This is a warning.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>Shepherds were made by assimilating the neural networks of humans, but there could be no telling how much of their human consciousness and emotions remained. But in that moment, Shin believed he had felt it.</p>
<p>The Merciless Queen’s indignant rage.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Your resolve to negotiate at the risk of death is remarkable. However, any further attempts to do so will be met with rejection. Remember this.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break2">Lena watched that sight unfold in stunned silence. He wasn’t intentionally exposing himself because he’d expected to die. Lena understood this. But there were hardly any reports of a Legion unit exposing its Liquid Micromachines outside its body and operating them independently. Not in the Republic, Federacy, United Kingdom, Alliance, nor any of the other small countries.</p>
<p>There were only a handful of similar cases, including the case of the Dinosauria, Shin, and Raiden, and the other reported was Rei. Apparently, this ability wasn’t common to all Shepherds. It was possible that only Legion who were explicitly programmed with the ability, like the Phönix, were capable of this.</p>
<p>And to that end, they weren’t wary of the possibility of it using its Liquid Micromachines as a means to attack. Perhaps the Merciless Queen just happened to have the ability to use them that way. But normally, Liquid Micromachines weren’t used as weapons, but rather, components of their control system. They didn’t move with the irrational speed the Legion normally had, to begin with.</p>
<p><a id="page-102"></a>It couldn’t see Shin through the light the Liquid Micromachines gave off, but it could tell he was standing on guard. Speaking while carefully trying to ascertain the right moment to get away if need be. And he hadn’t taken one step out of the corridor even before the silvery glow appeared, so he could quickly move to the other end of the corridor if need be.</p>
<p>He was willing to brave risks for the sake of this discussion, but he wasn’t throwing himself away. He did this for the sake of the future he wished for—to find the means to grasp it.</p>
<p>And seeing him do it left Lena in blank amazement. It made her realize something. He really…did change.</p>
<p class="space-break2">Just as Shin returned to the observation room, Liquid Micromachine arms slithered out of the gaps in the Merciless Queen’s armor, as if unable to wait any longer. They weren’t long enough to reach the walls from the Merciless Queen’s position in the center of the confinement room, but as if to compensate for their length, there was a startling number of them.</p>
<p>Returning to the observation room made Shin’s tense nerves ease up a bit. Maybe that was why the memory of his brother’s hands strangling him—and not just his hands as a Shepherd, but his real hands, too—rose to the surface in all its vivid, chilling horror. It made the color drain from his face for a moment.</p>
<p>“Are you all right, Nouzen?” Vika asked, noticing the change.</p>
<p>“Yeah… I’m fine. I just remembered something.”</p>
<p>Vika likely realized he’d probably suffered some injuries relating to hands, or perhaps he was injured by a Shepherd.</p>
<p>“You stood before her, knowing she could pry open an old wound. You forced yourself to get her to talk… Even though it was you who insisted there could be no conversing with the dead.”</p>
<p>“I still think so, even now…”</p>
<p>The living can never mingle with the dead. That was a rule of nature. No matter how much one wished to speak to them, the rules this world operated on would remain cold and unyielding.</p>
<p><a id="page-103"></a>But at the end of the Special Reconnaissance mission, when he was defeated in the depths of the Legion’s territories… His brother probably saved him. They couldn’t converse, but their voices did reach each other.</p>
<p>Shin could hear the voices of the ghosts, which implied the opposite could possibly be true, too. But what if conversing with ghosts actually was feasible…but the ghosts simply didn’t transmit their thoughts in a manner Shin could understand?</p>
<p>The living can never mingle with the dead. But perhaps the ghosts who lingered between life and death, who hadn’t yet crossed the river Lethe, could still reach out to him, who remained tethered to the far shore.</p>
<p>It was a theory that struck Shin as slightly disturbing, but he wasn’t going to run away from it anymore.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to do everything I could… If we can get even the slightest bit of beneficial information, we could be one step closer to ending the war.”</p>
<p>Vika regarded his words with an amused smile for some reason.</p>
<p>“You want to show her the sea, hmm? I see. So you would spare no effort to that end.”</p>
<p>“Why do you know about that, too…?”</p>
<p>“Why would you assume I didn’t know about it…? But never mind that.”</p>
<p>Upon seeing that the color had returned to Shin’s face, Vika turned in the Merciless Queen’s direction.</p>
<p>“Are those hands something all Legion who’ve assimilated the neural network of a dead person possess?”</p>
<p>The microphone was on, of course, and the window was set to transparent. But the queen didn’t answer his question. Vika signaled to Shin with his eyes, who repeated the question. This time, it replied.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Only those who have, even in their final moments, extended their hands in maddened despair, possess this.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p><a id="page-104"></a><em>It’s like the Legion’s screams</em>, Shin thought.</p>
<p>Their brains echoed those screams. Their minds twisted into the shapes of their final words, repeating the emotions they felt on the brink of death. Their desires would not die even as their bodies perished and, instead, would manifest themselves as those hands.</p>
<p>Unsure if it could only hear Shin or if it consciously chose to answer just his questions, the intelligence officers whispered among themselves, so as to be heard over the microphone. The section chief stressed they would need to take precautions against the arms coming out of its armor next time.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;One question has been answered. Answer a question in turn,  .&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>The final word it said was exceptionally hard to make out. It was as if mechanical language had been forcibly rendered into sound. But the recorder terminal just barely picked up what it had said.</p>
<p><em>Báleygr.</em></p>
<p>That was the Legion’s identifier for Shin.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Your name.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>Shin shot a gaze at the intelligence staff, one of whom nodded.</p>
<p>“Shinei Nouzen.”</p>
<p>He didn’t add his rank and affiliation. The room was shielded from electromagnetic interference. Even if an Eintagsfliege had somehow wandered into the room and tried to function as a relay, the Merciless Queen would not have been able to transmit any information to the Legion. But Shin decided to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>The Merciless Queen fell silent for a moment, as if swallowing its breath.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Nouzen. Nouzen. Descendant of the destroyers. Progeny of the Empire´s Ebony General. <a id="page-105"></a>Query. Why did a Nouzen betray his homeland and defect to the Federacy´s military? Is it because you are a rotegig? Answer.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>Rotegig. Red eye. A derogatory term that pureblood Onyxes of noble descent used to refer to children mixed with Pyrope blood. Hearing the Merciless Queen speak that word made the Pyrope information officers in the room harden their expressions in displeasure. But Shin was born in the Republic and raised in the Eighty-Sixth Sector, so the slur didn’t register as offensive to him.</p>
<p>“I’m not of the Empire.”</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Then you are an Eighty-Six.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>“…How do you know that?”</p>
<p>If it was Zelene Birkenbaum, it should have had no way of knowing what an Eighty-Six was. That derogatory term didn’t exist in her lifetime.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;For they were weak. For they were brittle. For they were the inferior race expelled from the Republic. Seizing them was simple. Obtaining information from them was simple.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>They had means of drawing out information from a seized brain. No… Even a Shepherd couldn’t resist the Legion’s instincts, and perhaps higher directives sent out by commander units. The fact that the Merciless Queen was conversing with them could have very well only been possible because it was cut off from the rest of the Legion’s network.</p>
<p>“And what’s your name?”</p>
<p>He’d estimated he understood the principle it was working on. It issued a query, and he answered. Thus, it was his turn to ask a question. And so he asked what he should have opened with.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, that question made the Merciless Queen tilt its <a id="page-106"></a>body somewhat. As if confused or perhaps disappointed that its provocation fell on deaf ears.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;It is presumed you already know.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>“I answered your question… Please answer mine.”</p>
<p>Upon being asked again, the Merciless Queen swerved its gaze to Vika, who stood beside Shin.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Affirmative. Albeit, unnecessary. Confirm it with the Innocent Olden Serpent.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>Vika grimaced for a moment, then heaved a long sigh.</p>
<p>“So it really is you, Zelene.”</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Affirmative.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>The Merciless Queen, Zelene Birkenbaum, nodded ever so slightly. Haughtily. With the cruelty of the ice-white moon—a cruelty that befit her identifier.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;My name… The name I was known by when I yet lived…was Zelene Birkenbaum. Ranked Major. Researcher. Affiliated with the Imperial Research Institute.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>She stressed that it was her name when she was still alive. As if to implicitly emphasize the fact that she was no longer human.</p>
<p class="space-break2">Slipping out of the loud, boisterous interrogation room, Lena went into the corridor to escape the noise and looked up. This was an underground base, and the sky naturally wasn’t in sight. All she could see was the cold, artificial gray of the ceiling.</p>
<p><a id="page-107"></a>Shin really had changed. When he faced the Republic’s lieutenant colonel, he showed a clear contempt for his malice. He’d fostered bonds with his newly rediscovered family and the people who were by his side and made efforts to maintain those bonds. He went back to calling Annette Rita. He was starting to pick up the bits and pieces of the joy he once knew from the depths of his memories.</p>
<p>Even with the world being so cold and unwelcoming, even as he had nothing to expect from it… He still looked to the future, seeking to make his dreams come true.</p>
<p>And Lena thought that was a good thing. She was happy for him, but…she also felt a certain loneliness, as if she was being left behind. And anxiety, as if the ground she was standing on were fading away.</p>
<p>She thought he was weak, but…in the end, he really was a strong person. Even with all those weak points, and even though he couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel, he still had the strength to keep on walking—to reach out and grasp his one desire.</p>
<p>But that meant a time might come when Shin wouldn’t need her anymore. And the moment she thought of that, a heavy, overwhelming sense of fear came over her. Even if he didn’t yet, he’d definitely realize it someday. That the person he wanted to show the sea to…<em>didn’t have to be her</em>.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like this before. Two years ago, Shin was still trapped in the Eighty-Sixth Sector. He was fated to die within six months, and all around him were other Eighty-Six, who shared that fate. The only person he had to ask to remember him was Lena. It wasn’t because she was special in some way. She just happened to be the one person Shin knew would live on.</p>
<p>But now that wasn’t the case anymore. He’d survived the Eighty-Sixth Sector and was freed from that fate of certain death. So were Raiden and the others. He’d lived in the Federacy for two years, forging new bonds with people who wouldn’t leave him behind.</p>
<p>And so Lena was no longer the only person he could live with.</p>
<p>But the same couldn’t be said for Lena. She’d only come this far because Shin told her to catch up to him. She could only fight on <a id="page-108"></a>because she could chase after his shadow. Without Shin, she couldn’t fight. Without him relying on her…she couldn’t pretend she was strong.</p>
<p>She wanted him to rely on her. She desperately clung to the role of being the one he needed, the one he begged to not leave him behind. She wanted to support him, to guide him… To continue acting out the role of a saint for him, even if it was just a lie.</p>
<p><em>The pride I take in fighting at his side is all I have. My precious role of being the one who holds him up. If I lose that… If Shin leaves me… I won’t be able to keep going… And when he does, I won’t be able to do the same… I won’t be allowed to cling to him, to beg that he not leave me behind…</em></p>
<p>But so long as Lena was part of the Strike Package, it would keep serving as proof of the validity of the Republic’s “progressive, humane defense system.” Of the idea that the Republic citizens didn’t need to fight. Of the Eighty-Sixth Sector’s battlefield of zero casualties.</p>
<p>Shin had finally shaken off that illusion, and Lena was worried about becoming the shackle that tethered him to it once more. So she couldn’t cling to him. She didn’t want to hurt him—to weigh him down.</p>
<p><em>Because…I’m one of the Republic’s white pigs, after all…</em></p>
