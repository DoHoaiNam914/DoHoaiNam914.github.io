<p><a id="page-130"></a>Lerche, who was trying to wake the boys up from the corner of the room, noticed Lena and rose to meet her. Next to her was someone else, who looked at Lena with sapphire-blue eyes.</p>
<p>“My, if it isn’t Lady Bloody Reina…! Sir Reaper has certainly been caught in a most vulnerable state.”</p>
<p>“Bloody Reina… Oh, so you’re the famous Strike Package’s commander… My apologies. I am—” The other person attempted to give a self-introduction.</p>
<p>“—Captain Olivia…!”</p>
<p>Faced with the one person she wanted to see the least, Lena was only barely able to withstand the urge to take a step back. It would be terribly rude but also quite pathetic. Captain Aegis blinked once, puzzled, but soon regained the composed smile of a mature adult and continued speaking.</p>
<p>“Yes, Captain Olivia Aegis of the Alliance Military. A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Colonel.”</p>
<p>“Colonel Vladilena Milizé, tactical commander for the Strike Package… Er, there’s no need to stand on ceremony, Captain. You’re not assigned to our unit yet, and you’re older than me. Besides, we’re still in the middle of our scheduled leave, so…”</p>
<p>Of all the Eighty-Six, only Shin seemed to insist on speaking to Lena formally, which made her dislike it all the more. Yet, while Lena may have been nearly ten years younger than Captain Aegis, she was still a colonel. The captain blinked, taken aback, and then nodded candidly.</p>
<p>“Very well… Then we can dispense with the formalities. No need to call me Captain.”</p>
<p>“Yes… Well, um. What happened here, exactly…?”</p>
<p>Captain Aegis also seemed to be fresh from the bath, gorgeous black locks tied up in the back. The sight of it brushing against the toned neck of a Feldreß Operator struck even Lena as vividly attractive.</p>
<p>Just then, a startling thought crossed Lena’s mind.</p>
<p><em>Olivia didn’t go into the bath with the boys, did she…?</em></p>
<p>Lena couldn’t bring herself to voice the question.</p>
<p>“Well… You see, today’s laundry day.”</p>
<p><em>…What?</em></p>
<p class="space-break2"><a id="page-131"></a>It all started when the pillows in the guest rooms were rounded up to be washed. Having spent plenty of time in this luxurious, lakeside hotel and its hot baths, the boys were relaxed but were also starting to show signs of boredom. The hotel’s employees noticed this, of course.</p>
<p>And so they allowed the boys to do something that they normally wouldn’t have let anyone do with the laundry. The people in charge of the hotel gave their approval, and they let the boys use the courtyard in front of the bathhouse—which had a tall ceiling and no windows—as the arena for this friendly showdown.</p>
<p>And so the boys’ pillow fight grand melee began, all too suddenly.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“…And that’s the long and short of it. The hotel staff approved, and the boys knew not to go any further than throwing the pillows. I hope you won’t be too hard on them, Colonel.”</p>
<p>The pillows were light and had high air resistance, so if they were simply thrown as opposed to being grabbed and waved around, there was little chance of the fabric tearing or the contents of the pillows spilling out. And of course, even a direct hit to the face wouldn’t knock anyone out.</p>
<p>The boys were lying down like that simply because they’d fallen asleep. The fatigue of the pillow fight compounded with the grogginess that followed them out of the bath, and they were at the point where their body heat was settling down from the steam. Those who grew sleepy left the fray, and before long, all participants in the pillow fight lay defeated.</p>
<p>Apparently, there were indeed two camps fighting in this contest. Having served as a commander for two years, Lena could tell that much from a glance. Of course, the distinction didn’t make the situation any clearer.</p>
<p>Realizing the downed boys were in Lena’s way, Captain Aegis went back to waking them up. Each boy was grabbed by the shoulder or the arm and shaken with a casual gesture Lena could never imitate. The moment her hand extended toward Shin, who was lying down at the center of the hall, Lena raised her voice in an uncharacteristic fashion.</p>
<p><a id="page-132"></a>“I-I’ll handle the rest!”</p>
<p>She was loud enough to wake up a few of the boys sleeping next to her. Captain Aegis paused, visibly surprised, and then gave a relaxed smile. The other boys were one thing, but Lena couldn’t let Captain Aegis act so friendly and unreserved toward Shin.</p>
<p><em>Get your hands off him.</em></p>
<p>“I’ll wake the rest of them up, so you can head out if you’d like, Captain. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Lena made a shooing motion, and thankfully, the captain did as suggested. Lena then looked over the chaos of the courtyard. Gingerly stepping between the “corpses,” she carefully approached the sleeping Shin.</p>
<p>What counted as sleep for Shin was closer to a typical person’s nap, which meant normally he would wake up just by having someone walk near him. As the boys came to, the ones sleeping next to them also stirred, creating a sort of chain reaction.</p>
<p>Shin, however, was in an unusually deep slumber and wasn’t opening his eyes. Lena sat down next to him and shook him excitedly.</p>
<p>“Sh-Shin. Wake up. You’ll catch a cold if you sleep here.”</p>
<p>Some part of her secretly hoped he would stay asleep, though. That way, he’d remain hers. He wouldn’t go anywhere. He’d stay with her.</p>
<p><em>Don’t wake up. That way, we can stay together.</em></p>
<p>Lena pursed her lips. She’d finally admitted it to herself. She wanted to be with him. Forever, if possible.</p>
<p>But now Shin was taking steps toward the future, and Lena was afraid he might leave her behind. So many other people loved him, and someday, he might not need her anymore. The shame of what the Republic did weighed on her, and she couldn’t deny that anxiety she felt.</p>
<p>What if today was the day? The fear of rejection haunted her, and she was on the verge of giving up on her confession. If Shin rejected her, she would lose the will to fight. Her very identity would unravel.</p>
<p>But even so, she didn’t want to give up. She didn’t want to pretend she didn’t know what her feelings meant, only for someone else to snatch Shin away while she remained complacent. She realized she wanted that least of all. And once she did…she couldn’t lie to herself any longer.</p>
<p><a id="page-133"></a><em>I don’t want anyone to take him from me. I want him to be mine. So…</em></p>
<p>Lena pursed her lips tightly.</p>

<p class="space-break">Unable to sleep properly that night, Lena woke up early. She refrained from waking Annette up and quietly snuck out of her room before dawn. Even in the wee hours, there was someone at the hotel’s front desk, and Lena exited the lobby and entered the rose garden, where a carpet of velvety flowers greeted her.</p>
<p>From there, she went to the courtyard, then down a staircase with a brass-colored railing. At the bottom of the stairs was a vast lake of snowmelt. It was chilly even during the summer, and when there was no wind, it brilliantly reflected the moonlight.</p>
<p>The ferry that functioned in place of a tram wasn’t working this early. A gentle silence, as if everything had died away, hung between the water’s surface and the starry sky it reflected.</p>
<p>As Lena stood at the water’s edge, she imagined that the sea might look something like this. But there were no waves since the wind wasn’t blowing. All that moved was starlight—a primordial sea of celestial bodies or perhaps the sea at the end of all things.</p>
<p>But just as the thought crossed her mind, someone stood at the edge of her field of vision.</p>
<p>“…Lena?”</p>
<p>That voice.</p>
<p>Lena turned around, surprised.</p>
<p>“Shin…? What are you doing out here at a time like this?”</p>
<p>“I fell asleep at an odd time yesterday, so I just woke up.”</p>
<p>Lena took a seat next to Shin on a log bench and then consciously scooted closer to him. She’d somehow stifled her bashful urge to keep her distance. She fumbled for something to say and eventually asked a question that came to mind. She assumed this wouldn’t come across as awkward.</p>
<p>“Any developments in the Zelene situation?”</p>
<p><a id="page-134"></a>“She hasn’t said anything substantial yet… Honestly, it’s something of a stalemate. She refuses to answer any more of my questions.”</p>
<p>Shin then paused, as if something had occurred to him.</p>
<p>“…Actually, yesterday’s pillow fight might have given me an idea about how to move forward with that.”</p>
<p>“That’s definitely a lie,” Lena jabbed at him, giggling.</p>
<p>For the first time in a while, she could speak with him naturally. Shin probably told this uncharacteristic joke to break the ice between them. Lena decided to tell a joke of her own.</p>
<p>“Why not bring Fido along to your meetings with her? Maybe it could communicate better with her somehow. Like, with gestures.”</p>
<p>“Maybe, but first, he’d need to learn how to stop being so needy,” Shin said with an air of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Fido threw (what Lena presumed to be) a tantrum when Shin refused to take it on this trip, too. Shin then looked to the ridgelines, where early sunlight was beginning to peek in from beyond the faint mist.</p>
<p>“…About the Fido my father was researching…”</p>
<p>The AI, Prototype 008. A mechanical intelligence that was neither Legion nor Sirin.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s because they happen to have the same name, but the idea of Fido being the same as that AI got me thinking. Maybe the reason it’s been following me around and obeying me for these past seven years was because it was <em>that</em> Fido all along.”</p>
<p>According to Vika and Annette, Shin was the one who gave Prototype 008 the name Fido. If that was the case, them sharing the same name wasn’t a coincidence at all. But Shin’s tone wasn’t that of someone stating a theory, but more like that of a child describing what they’d be when they grew up. An insubstantial wish put into words despite the improbability.</p>
<p>In spite of all the Republic’s faults, the Scavengers’ production plant was still a military facility. There was no way an experimental AI could have found its way there. So Shin could only cling to that wish, describing it as if it was some kind of joke.</p>
<p>“If we examine Fido’s core, we might actually find that little one,” he <a id="page-135"></a>said, smiling faintly. “Who knows? Maybe it’ll recognize me, and we’ll talk about how we haven’t seen each other in so long. And if that happens…”</p>
<p>Shin trailed off, as if hesitating to finish that sentence. The smile left his lips, and his contemplative crimson eyes narrowed momentarily.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Lena asked.</p>
<p>“…Nothing. I just thought that if that was to happen, it’d be pretty sad.”</p>
<p>Lena blinked dubiously. It felt like the direction of what he was trying to say had changed entirely. If he still felt some kind of attachment to that AI, despite not remembering much about it, then the idea that the Fido he knew might have actually been an old friend from his childhood should have been a good one.</p>
<p>“If Fido is still in there, he’d be completed and sent to fight in place of humans. And that doesn’t sit well with me. Even if the Fido we have now could be improved and retrofitted to combat, I wouldn’t want to make him do that. If something wasn’t made for the express purpose of combat, I don’t want to turn it into an instrument of war.”</p>
<p>Maybe it wasn’t alive. Maybe it wasn’t human. But that didn’t mean he wanted to send it out to battle in his place. In Lena’s eyes, Fido was the potential key for a true battlefield with zero casualties. But for Shin, it would be sending another comrade—and possibly a childhood friend—to their death on the battlefield.</p>
<p>“Remember how we left Fido’s remains in the Juggernaut centograph memorial? It was because at the end of the Special Reconnaissance mission, he was destroyed while trying to protect me in battle. I don’t want to see that happen again. I don’t…want to see him die again.”</p>
<p>Even if he was an awkward, clumsy drone without a shred of human life.</p>
<p>But it was then that the anxiety once again bubbled up in Lena’s heart, rearing its ugly head.</p>
<p><em>Does that apply to me, too? Are you afraid of seeing me die? Or maybe not die, but disappear? Do you still feel that way?</em></p>
<p>“Does that apply not just to Fido…? And not just to the Eighty-Six…?”</p>
<p>His crimson eyes found Lena’s.</p>
<p><a id="page-136"></a>“Is that what’s been bothering you?” he asked.</p>
<p>Lena stiffened all of a sudden. She froze in place, looking back at him with fear in her eyes. Shin’s lips curled into a clear, sardonic smile.</p>
<p>“I told you already. If you want to talk, I’m always there to listen… And everyone’s noticed, honestly. Our one and only queen is in a funk.”</p>
<p>As Lena raised her head in surprise, the first rays of sunlight shone through. The light of daybreak scattered the dark of night and the stars blinking out of the blue sky of dawn.</p>
<p>And with that sky as his backdrop…</p>
<p>“As for your question… No, I don’t want any of my allies to die. Nothing would be okay if even a single one disappeared. That’s why I carry them with me. Always. And if possible, I want everyone to be with me until the very end. So if you weren’t around, I… Er. I wouldn’t like it.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">Those words seeped into Lena’s heart like a gentle rain falling on an arid wasteland. Yes, Shin had said that from the very beginning. Lena was from the Republic, but she was also the Eighty-Six’s queen. She belonged with them.</p>
<p>Maybe it wasn’t a spot that was reserved for her, but it was still a place she could return to. He said she was allowed to be there. With that same calm, comforting voice that had saved her time and again.</p>
<p><em>Aaah.</em></p>
<p><em>I knew it. I really do…</em></p>
<p class="space-break2">Shin, on the other hand, felt a tinge of sadness overtake him as he stared at the horizon. Now was, without a doubt, the time to say it. But he still wavered, was overcome with embarrassment, and only managed to blurt out some vague words.</p>
<p>The thought of Raiden or Theo hearing about this and pestering him was slightly irritating. And the part about him not wanting anyone to die? He would have to take that with him to the grave.</p>
<p><a id="page-137"></a>He’d stumbled over his own words. He’d told her that he didn’t want anyone to die. So <em>she…</em></p>
<p class="space-break2">When Annette woke up, she saw that Lena wasn’t in their room. She was exasperated, however, to see Lena join her table during breakfast. That is to say, she didn’t choose Shin’s table. She was still indecisive.</p>
<p>Or so Annette thought, until Lena spoke up.</p>
<p>“Annette, I think I’ve finally decided.”</p>
<p>Seeing Annette’s newly inquisitive expression, Lena fidgeted a little and then continued in a meek whisper.</p>
<p>“I’m going to…um…tell Shin that I…like him.”</p>
<p>Annette’s eyes grew wide. She then got to her feet and placed her hands on her friend’s shoulders.</p>
<p>“That’s great! You finally worked up the courage! Good for you!”</p>
<p>Lena panicked at Annette’s loud encouragement, but Shin had long since finished his breakfast and gone off somewhere, while everyone else already knew.</p>

</div>
<p class="space-break">But despite Lena making up her mind, Captain Aegis once again visited the hotel.</p>
<p>“Now then, children, are you still bored after yesterday?”</p>
<p>As always, the captain’s voice was as clear as a bell—the voice of someone accustomed to giving orders, who was capable of charming people.</p>
<p><em>I wish she hadn’t come</em>, Lena thought, not daring to say that aloud.</p>
<p>“If so, how about a little underground exploration?”</p>
<p class="space-break2">“Our holy site, Mount Wyrmnest. And the natural fortress of the United Kingdom, the Dragon Fang Mountain. Both of those names actually stem from the same source.”</p>
<p><a id="page-138"></a>Captain Aegis commentated as they walked through the tunnel, the sound of their military boots echoing against the sleek surface of the cave walls. It was clearly different from a natural cave, but it also clearly wasn’t dug using machinery. It was like walking within the bowels of some massive creature.</p>
<p>Halfway up Mount Wyrmnest was the entrance to this rock tunnel. Since they were a group of teenagers with more energy to spare than places to expend it, their column soon broke up into groups. Thankfully, the cave was vast enough to accommodate.</p>
<p>Appending that the prince probably knew of this, Captain Aegis continued the songlike explanation.</p>
<p>“It was said that the last of the behemoths escaped to what would become the Dragon Corpse mountain range, where the royal house of the unicorns hunted them down. That was why the place was named after the remains of a dragon. The same holds true for Mount Wyrmnest. It was said that the last wyrms made their home in this mountain—hence, Wyrmnest. The wyrm’s nest. Legends say that the remaining wyrms still nest somewhere in these depths.”</p>
<p>Captain Aegis turned around, heels clicking, and looked up at a tall rock dome and a vast space that were far too large to accommodate a person. The Alliance called this chamber the Hall. No one alive knew for what purpose this place was dug out.</p>
<p>“Perhaps this vast, underground labyrinth was left behind by those wyrms. Feel free to explore, children. Who knows? You might discover something new.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">“Not to be a stick-in-the-mud, but there’s no way we’d find anything new here. That story is thousands of years old.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s to set the mood for the exploration. I think it’s fun in its own way.”</p>
<p>With that said, Anju excitedly pulled Dustin by the arm as she went ahead. Dustin was a bit flustered by this, as this was the first time he’d seen her act so assertively. Since they returned from the United Kingdom <a id="page-139"></a>to the Federacy, he’d taken her out around the Federacy’s cities. Anju wasn’t as familiar with the streets, and he had escorted her as a member of the same unit.</p>
<p>It wasn’t, well, a date.</p>
<p>And he got the impression that while Anju didn’t hate him, she didn’t like him, either. So the reason she pulled him away from the column of boys and girls, tugging at him as if to tear him away from the group, couldn’t have been that she wanted to be alone with him.</p>
<p>He turned around, watching as the row gradually fell apart. Pairs walked off, whispering about the reason for their actions. Raiden, who was escorting Frederica, shot Anju some kind of casual eye signal. That was when Dustin finally realized.</p>
<p>Raiden, Theo, Shiden, Anju, and the others decided to do this ahead of time, all out of consideration for their sluggish Reaper and Queen. Deciding to play along, Dustin looked around and said casually:</p>
<p>“Yuuto, if you go that way, there’s a waterfall.”</p>
<p>“I’ll check it out… Let’s go, Michihi.”</p>
<p>“All right!”</p>
<p>As Dustin and Anju were about to go on a branch of the road themselves, Michihi gave a thumbs-up, and Yuuto nodded as they went off. Anju turned around and pumped a fist victoriously, which made him sigh in relief. It went well.</p>
<p>The two of them broke off from the row and went down a branch in the tunnel, and eventually, they both stopped in place.</p>
<p>“That was a nice excuse, Dustin.”</p>
<p>“Glad to hear it… But you know, those two… They were pretty awkward around each other until recently. You think they’ll be all right?”</p>
<p>“Well, this time, Lena was the one who was acting kind of weird… But I think fussing over every little thing they do is only gonna come off as tactless.”</p>
<p>Dustin thought he could sense a bit of bitterness to her voice, too. As if to say <em>We’re not that nice, either.</em></p>
<p>“I mean, Shin wouldn’t spare poor Kurena a glance even after all this time, so I feel like he needs to earn this. But at times like this, he <a id="page-141"></a>can be too cautious… Or well, too shy. And then you have Lena getting cold feet…” Anju frowned, as if anxious or frustrated.</p>
