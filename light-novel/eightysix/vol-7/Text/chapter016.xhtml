<p><a id="page-116"></a>Silver eyes, the same as their oppressors’. Even during peacetime, their mismatched colors would make them tether on the verge of being cast out as outsiders who didn’t belong on either side. And she was sent into the Eighty-Sixth Sector with those eyes, where everyone built up indignation and stress that were always on the verge of erupting.</p>
<p>“The same Eighty-Six that the Republic called animals called <em>us</em> monsters in human skin. They called us witches. My sister <em>didn’t live long enough to become a Processor…</em> If I could lose those memories, believe me, I would.”</p>
<p>Those memories… That very past.</p>
<p>“But I can’t. It’s in the past. All of it. All my mistakes, the times I was helpless, the moments I regret—and the choices I made. So you can’t lose any of those things, either. You can’t undo the fact that you’re a Republic soldier who fought with us. You can’t ignore the fact that you’re not a white pig. You can’t deny that you’re Bloody Reina, our Bloodstained Queen!”</p>
<p>Even if she was to lose strength tomorrow. Even if she was to part ways with everyone. The battles she fought to get to where she was today belonged to a past she could never overwrite, not even if she wanted to.</p>
<p>“Listen, Lena. You might be from the Republic, but you’re not a white pig… You’re our queen.”</p>
<p>Those words made Lena jerk. It felt like someone told her the same thing before. Those sincere, slightly sorrowful words… As if directed at her, tormented and bound as she was by guilt for never trying to cross the wall between them. When had she heard the sentiment before?</p>
<p><em>Please stop making that tragic face.</em></p>
<p>“Maybe in the beginning, our relationship was that of a white pig and a bunch of livestock. But we’ve already moved past that, and we want you to move on, too. I’m sure Shin feels the same way… So just go ahead bury that mindset already.”</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-117"></a>“Zelene, I’m asking you one more time. Why did you call me?”</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;The appeal for investigation was directed at any hostile element that would eliminate the High Mobility type. Special Protocol Omega´s activation trigger was the High Mobility type´s destruction. As such, the recipient of Special Protocol Omega would inevitably be whoever eliminated the High Mobility type.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>Having decided that not responding after she’d reacted once would be meaningless now, Zelene began consistently answering Shin’s questions. But she only answered Shin—and ever so rarely, Vika. As such it was still hard to discern what her objective was and whether she actually was willing to share any intelligence with them.</p>
<p>Lena wasn’t here today, either. Her absence worried Shin, but he decided to swallow that anxiety.</p>
<p>“…Then why did you call whoever defeated the Phönix?”</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Because whoever defeated the High Mobility type would have to be inhuman.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>There was a hint of mockery in her tone. As if to say Shin wasn’t human.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;For whoever was capable of matching the Legion, who were machines made for slaughter, could not be human. And that is all the truer for anyone who could drive an enhanced unit like the High Mobility type to destruction. Henceforth, they would have great value as a subject of research. A target to be seized. They would hold great value for the fulfillment of the Legion´s—of <em>our</em>—objectives.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p><a id="page-118"></a>And her voice was also full of sinister greed and craving—the desires of a monster who had strayed from the path of humankind. A true killing machine.</p>
<p>“<em>Lunatic</em>,” someone whispered in a voice thick with contempt. Hearing that word, Shin continued questioning her calmly.</p>
<p>“To what end?”</p>
<p>Zelene’s optical sensor swerved toward him. As if drawn by the tone of his voice.</p>
<p>“Why are you trying to enhance the Legion further? Is it to destroy humankind…? If that’s your reason, why didn’t you kill me back then? Why are you speaking with me right now?”</p>
<p>There was no enmity in his voice. No hatred. He simply asked that question, with no other emotion behind it.</p>
<p>“For what purpose did you create the Legion?”</p>
<p>There was a stark contradiction between Zelene’s words and actions, and Shin assumed it was because she was trying to hide the truth. They had almost forcefully managed to get her to part her tight lips and speak, and they wouldn’t be able to do this again in the future.</p>
<p>Even if they could repeatedly force her to speak, they wouldn’t be able to trust her. And seeing that she refused to give a straight answer, Shin decided not to give her his complete trust in turn. So he simply asked the more pressing question. The one he most wanted to know the answer to.</p>
<p>Zelene was silent for a moment. It was as if she was confused, but at the same time, she betrayed a tinge of fear and anxiety.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;…Do you…&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>She was a Legion. And while the Ameise were among the weakest Legion units, they were still killing machines that could mercilessly crush a person under their weight. And even so, she still seemed afraid.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Do you not hate me, Eighty-Six? The Legion has slaughtered your comrades. Made sport of your comrades. Violated your comrades. <a id="page-119"></a>Butchered your comrades. Does that not inspire hatred within you?&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>Shin was speechless. She was speaking of his fellow Eighty-Six from the Eighty-Sixth Sector. Yes, to her, they likely seemed to be fragile victims. They all died one after another, as if it was their gruesome, inescapable fate. Cast aside by their country, left without proper command or support, and forced to fight in defective Feldreß.</p>
<p>All too many of them, more than Shin could count… They died far too quickly, far too easily. And each and every one of them was a precious comrade of his. But…</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>That didn’t mean he hated Zelene—or the Legion. He didn’t.</p>
<p>Zelene slowly lowered her moonlike optical sensor, as if hanging her head. As if to show her rejection. Her fear… Her regret.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;…Terminating responses. All further queries will be rejected.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break1">And from that point forward, the Merciless Queen stopped responding to Shin’s words.</p>

</div>
<p class="space-break2">“Hey, Lena. Shin’s coming over today.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Lena looked up from her paperwork. It was morning, and she was in the base preparing for the final stages of the new equipment’s testing. Kurena stood imposingly in front of her, wearing her panzer jacket, both fists poised at her waist.</p>
<p>“Apparently, he had some kind of argument with Zelene, so he said he’d leave her alone for a while and come help us with the Furieuse testing… Don’t you wanna see him? Lena, all you’ve been doing is hiding from Shin in the hotel. Which is fine by me, to be honest. Gives me more time to spend with him.”</p>
<p><a id="page-120"></a>“…But—”</p>
<p>Lena met her eyes, and Kurena responded with a challenging glare.</p>
<p>“Hey. Get ahold of yourself… Ugh, listen. I don’t like that you’re taking him away from me.”</p>
<p>Kurena advanced on her. Lena was naturally the taller of the two, and this fact was exacerbated by her high heels. But that didn’t matter one bit to Kurena.</p>
<p><em>God, this girl is a piece of work. She’s drop-dead gorgeous and doesn’t feel like she belongs on the battlefield at all. She forced herself into our lives and swiped Shin from me in the blink of an eye. I can’t stand her.</em></p>
<p>“But I <em>hate</em> the idea of someone other than you stealing him from me. If it’s you, Lena, I…I can accept it. So…”</p>
<p><em>He never once looked at me the way he looks at you. He only ever saw me as a comrade, as a little sister. I couldn’t save him, so you have to do that in my place.</em></p>
<p>“…pull yourself together already.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">She kept running from him for fear of being rejected, but when she found out he was nearby, she couldn’t help but seek him out. She wanted to go to him, to cling to him. Realizing this made Lena bite her unpainted lips.</p>
<p><em>But I’m from the Republic… I don’t have the right to be by his side.</em></p>
<p>Catching sight of the black hair and bloodred eyes she would never mistake, she almost called out for Shin but stopped herself. Thankfully, there was considerable distance between them, and Shin wouldn’t have noticed her unless she yelled for him.</p>
<p>But then Lena froze in place.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the massive steel frame of the Armée Furieuse were Shin and an officer with long black hair, wearing the uniform of the Alliance. The two of them were chatting and laughing. They were so close, they were almost touching—a distance that came across as improper for a man and a woman who weren’t lovers.</p>
<p>The officer chuckled, playfully smacking Shin on the shoulder. One of them had told a joke, apparently. Shin’s back was halfway turned <a id="page-121"></a>to her, but Lena could still see that he was smiling. A carefree, boyish smile.</p>
<p><em>…Shin…has never looked as comfortable with me as he does with her… We’ve never stood so close together… He’s never smiled at me like that… So why does he smile for that…that</em> stranger<em>…? I…I don’t like it…</em></p>
<p>At some point, Lena was approached by Guren and Touka from the maintenance crew. Witnessing the same scene as Lena, Guren spoke up.</p>
<p>“It’s like he’s talking to Alice again… She was a mixed Jet, too, so they look alike.”</p>
<p>That was an unfamiliar name.</p>
<p>“Alice?” Lena asked, blinking in confusion.</p>
<p>“Whoa, Colonel.” Guren took a step back, apparently realizing Lena was there. “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Who’s Alice?”</p>
<p>“Oh… Uh. A squad captain from the base I served in, back in the Eighty-Sixth Sector. Well, that was years ago, back when Captain Nouzen was a novice who’d just been drafted. When he only around yea high.”</p>
<p>Guren held up a palm horizontally to his waist, as if to illustrate his height. It seemed too short, even given Shin’s age at the time.</p>
<p>“So yeah, Captain Aegis looks similar to Captain Alice. It might just be because they both have Jet blood, but they also <em>feel</em> kinda similar—and talk the same way, too. She had long black hair, just like Captain Aegis, and she was beautiful. Thinking back on it, Captain Nouzen was pretty attached to her…”</p>
<p>“Way to go, genius,” said Touka, driving her elbow into Guren’s ribs.</p>
<p>She’d probably noticed the color gradually drain from Lena’s face with every word he spoke. Apparently, Touka put a lot of force to the jab, because Guren let out a little groan before falling silent.</p>
<p>But to Lena, Guren and Touka weren’t even there anymore.</p>
<p><em>No…</em></p>
<p>A black emotion swirled in Lena’s stomach, but her mind, in contrast, was whited out. Shin’s captain from when he was first drafted probably came across as a very reliable person. He was attached to her, so she must have been a very kind, sweet person. And this lady was similar to her, so <a id="page-122"></a>maybe Shin saw some of his old captain in her. They were close enough to chat, to joke around, to be casual and relaxed around each other.</p>
<p>But even so, Lena didn’t want this. Not <em>this</em>. Even if it was the captain he relied on, or someone who looked like that captain, she didn’t want to see Shin look at another woman with an expression he kept from her.</p>
<p>She didn’t want someone else to snatch him away. And the moment she realized this, she gasped.</p>
<p><em>I don’t want someone to snatch him away…?</em></p>
<p>She had convinced herself that she didn’t need to be the one to stand at his side. That someday, she would lose her position. And she felt like she didn’t have the right to cling to him and beg not to be left behind.</p>
<p>So yes, the moment she dreaded was finally upon her. It was time for her to accept reality with dignity and grace. Why, then? Why did this selfish emotion—this desire not to let him slip through her fingers—take root <em>now</em>?</p>
<p class="space-break2">Watching Lena walk away with the gait of a newborn fawn, Touka glared up at Guren, who stood a head taller than her.</p>
<p>“I must say, I’m impressed, Guren. I don’t think a single word you told her was something she needed to hear.”</p>
<p>“Well, sorry…”</p>
<p>“The colonel isn’t stupid, but even the smartest person can lose their way when it comes to matters of the heart. So knock off the spiteful jokes.”</p>
<p>“I said I’m sorry… I wasn’t trying to make a joke, y’know.”</p>
<p>Guren was avoiding eye contact with Touka. He was clearly aware that he’d messed up. The two of them then kept looking at Shin and the Alliance captain as they spoke in front of the Armée Furieuse. Before long, Theo and Raiden joined in, and Shin continued laughing just as he did back then. His expression when he was talking to Captain Aegis and Raiden greatly contrasted the one Lena wore as she walked away.</p>
<p>“…That little squirt’s already old enough for <em>this</em>, huh?” Guren uttered.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have imagined that awkward kid from seven years ago turning out like this,” Touka agreed.</p>
<p><a id="page-123"></a>He was so sweet and innocent at the time that just looking at him could give you cavities.</p>
<p>“…I wish Alice could have been here to see this,” Guren muttered.</p>
<p>“Well, you just told Colonel Milizé that Captain Aegis looks like a lady Shin used to be close to. I can see why she’d feel pressured.”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, Nouzen was attached to Alice like she was his big sister or something… But just because they look alike…”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>Lena was already gone, and the two of them looked in the direction she wobbled off. Honestly, this wasn’t something Lena should have felt even remotely intimidated by. But well… Love has a way of robbing people of sound judgment.</p>
<p class="space-break2">Lena insisted on going out to check on the new armament despite having no work obligations that day, so when Annette saw her enter the hotel’s lounge with unsteady steps, she was shocked and set down the poetry anthology she’d been reading.</p>
<p>“Lena, what’s wrong? You’re as pale as a sheet.”</p>
<p>“Annette…,” said Lena, approaching like a wraith.</p>
<p>A nearby attendant pulled over a chair, and Lena wilted into it.</p>
<p>“Shin was speaking to someone from the Alliance… A person named Olivia… He looked like he was…having fun…”</p>
<p>“Oh… You mean Captain Aegis, the Strike Package’s Armeö Furieuse instructor—not to mention an Alliance ace, a melee-combat specialist, and an Esper who can see the future… I’ve heard it all.”</p>
<p>Captain Aegis was scheduled to be assigned to the Armored Division, but being an instructor for the new armament meant close involvement with the research teams and, consequently, Annette. The captain also visited the hotel every now and then with packs of candy to give out.</p>
<p>“I figure they’d have a lot to talk about. Shin’s an ace, a master tactician, and a melee-combat specialist, too, after all… And maybe you haven’t noticed, but Shin isn’t the only person Captain Aegis has been <a id="page-124"></a>talking to. Raiden, Theo, and even the prince are on that list as well, and they all seem to be getting along quite famously.”</p>
<p>“Apparently, Olivia looks a lot like Shin’s captain from the first unit he was assigned to back in the Eighty-Sixth Sector. Shin’s <em>female</em> captain.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh…”</p>
<p>That was news to Annette, but she felt that bringing up the sex of Shin’s old captain was a little odd.</p>
<p>“And?” Annette asked, unsure as to what Lena was getting at.</p>
<p>“What am I going to do…?!”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“Shin’s talking to that captain. He’s having fun.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you said that already.”</p>
<p>“What am I going to do?!”</p>
<p>“About <em>what</em>?”</p>
<p>Lena withered, and she looked like the world was about to end.</p>
<p>“Olivia’s going to snatch him away from me…!”</p>
<p>“…Oh.”</p>
<p>Annette was somehow able to hold back the sigh. She wasn’t sure what Lena would say, but she didn’t think it would be <em>that</em>, of all things…</p>
<p><em>Oh, Lena… You don’t even realize how big of a misunderstanding this is…</em></p>
<p>But what Lena said next made Annette raise her eyebrows in apprehension.</p>
<p>“Annette, what do I do? I don’t want her to take him away. I can’t stand seeing them together… But I shouldn’t feel this way. But I don’t want her to steal him!”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, you ‘<em>shouldn’t</em> feel this way’?”</p>
<p>“I’m…I’m the reason the Republic still won’t recognize the Eighty-Six’s humanity… I’m the reason they still believe the Eighty-Six belong to the Republic… Me being in the Strike Package is only going to burden Shin, so I don’t have any right to feel that way!”</p>
<p>“Those bigots can talk all they want. Even without you around, they’d come up with some other asinine reason. The Eighty-Six don’t <a id="page-125"></a>care about that at all. You’re overthinking this anyway. Burdens? Rights? What the hell, Lena?”</p>
<p>“Shin would be fine even without me…”</p>
<p>“But he’d be even better <em>with</em> you. Besides, remember what Shin told you back in the United Kingdom?”</p>
<p>Annette knew about it since the mission recorder preserved audio. Lena was finally on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>“…But I’m…I’m from the Republic…”</p>
<p>Someone had already scolded her for saying this before, and that only made Lena feel worse. Annette knew the guilt Lena was feeling all too well but shrugged it off.</p>
<p>“That’s right. You’re from the Republic. And? What does that matter? Did Shin say he hated you for it?”</p>
<p>“…I’m his superior officer.”</p>
<p>“So what?”</p>
<p>If their unit was even remotely like a normal military unit, a romantic affair between an officer and her subordinate might have been a sticky situation. But they were an armed squadron of child soldiers who didn’t even undergo official training, and their commanding officer was teenage girl. The Eighty-Sixth Strike Package was anything but “normal.”</p>
<p>The Eighty-Six never had any sense of a chain of command that distinguished between captains, vice captains, and ordinary members to begin with. They had romantic relationships without regard for any of that, and no one seemed to mind.</p>
<p>“So…”</p>
<p>Lena hesitated to finish that sentence, her two hands resting on her lap clenching into fists. Sensing the next sentiment, Annette finally lost her temper and rose to her feet.</p>
<p>“So what?! Are you going to start looking for excuses to abandon him now? He told you not to leave him behind, and you said you wouldn’t. And now you decide to give up <em>anyway</em>?!”</p>
<p>Lena was taken aback. It was clear from her pallid expression that her heart had never once given up.</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant…!”</p>
<p><a id="page-126"></a>“Maybe you didn’t, but it’s all the same. Stop running around and looking for excuses. If you actually give up on him because of this, then you really will have left him behind!”</p>
<p><em>He picked you, so stop being so pathetic.</em></p>
<p>That thought burned in Annette’s mind, but she held her tongue. Saying it out loud would have been pathetic in its own right. Still, seeing Lena take Shin away did make her feel like she was the one abandoned. Her own missteps had severed her bond with Shin once before, and the war only drove them further apart…</p>
<p>But the Shin she grew up with and the Shin she knew now were two different people. They might have been the same person in body and mind, but he had changed too much. Back then, Annette felt something akin to a first love toward her childhood friend, but she didn’t feel that same emotion toward the Shin of today. Still, she couldn’t completely ignore the fact that someone new was occupying the space that used to be hers alone.</p>
<p>Trace embers flickered in the recesses of her heart. She stared at Lena’s back—at her long silver hair—and couldn’t help but feel that <em>she</em> was the one who belonged at his side.</p>
<p>“Listen. If you don’t want someone else to snatch him away… If you still feel that way, despite thinking you don’t deserve to be with him… You <em>have</em> to work through your feelings.”</p>
<p>“I…” Lena opened her lips to speak, then shut them tightly again.</p>
<p>Some part of her felt she was forbidden from saying the words, but Annette knew. Lena’s truth was written all over her face. But putting it into words would mean admitting it, so Lena couldn’t bring herself to say it. Not yet.</p>
<p>Annette could sympathize. Taking ownership of those feelings was terrifying. The prospect of rejection was intimidating. To bare your soul, only to be turned away… Lena had every right to be afraid. She had pursued him for so long, had finally gotten close to him. A rejection at this point would be devastating. The mere possibility of it was enough to paralyze her.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>“Allow me to remind you of something you once told me. If you <a id="page-127"></a>take your time, the roosters will start to crow. And once they do, any tears you shed will come too late.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">“She was disappointed with my answer and cut me off. That’s the impression I got.”</p>
<p>“I agree with that assessment. It was certainly different from her previous provocations. I can only assume those were her true feelings.”</p>
<p><em>Poof. Poof.</em></p>
<p>The sounds of something whizzing through the air and then impacting the wall filled the room, but it was way too soft and nonsensical to come across as gunfire. Shin and Vika, however, ignored the objects flying across the room and continued their conversation.</p>
<p>The courtyard in front of the bathhouse had all its sofas moved against the wall by the employees ahead of time, leaving a spacious open area in the middle of the hall, which was now full of aggressive, excited cries of “Go, go!” and “I’ll get you!”</p>
<p>“Between her message and her attitude, it feels like she’s testing us. Her conditions are destroying the Phönix, and…hating the Legion, I guess? I don’t understand what she wants.”</p>
<p>“In my opinion, you not hating the Legion wasn’t the problem… Oh.”</p>
<p>A pair of pillows flying through the air blew away the heavy mood of their conversation. Had the two of them not bent out of the way, the pillows would have hit them square in the face.</p>
<p>“…Tch, a miss.”</p>
<p>“Our surprise attack was a dud, huh…? I thought the operations commander and the prince were wide open.”</p>
<p>Two relatively young members of the Strike Package still stood in a throwing position as they booed in disappointment. They then looked at their silent operations commander and the United Kingdom’s prince before beaming at them.</p>
<p>“C’mon, you two, play along! …Unless you’re chicken!”</p>
<p>“Chickens!”</p>
<p>““…””</p>
<p><a id="page-128"></a>Shin and Vika looked back at those innocent, reckless boys. Shin was known as the Headless Reaper of the eastern front, while Vika was the infamous Serpent of Shackles and Decay. Both were experienced Processors.</p>
<p>Excusing this kind of taunt with silence was below them.</p>
<p>“All right, you asked for it.”</p>
<p>“Give me your best shot, peasants.”</p>
<p>And so all hell broke loose.</p>
<p class="space-break2">“—Wha…?”</p>
<p>How did Lena feel about Shin? Annette’s question was one Lena didn’t want to think about, but she tortured herself with it anyway. She had to think about it, lest he slip right through her fingers.</p>
<p>She promised him she wouldn’t leave him behind. That was one promise she could never run away from. Shin silenced his doubts and depended on her, and she couldn’t betray that.</p>
<p>She’d assumed that nobody would be in the bathhouse at that time of day, which meant there’d be a good chance for some self-reflection. She made her way to the bath, steeling her nerves…</p>
<p>…only to find herself standing stock-still at the entrance to the courtyard. The reason? She found Shin, Raiden, Theo, and the other Eighty-Six boys collapsed on the marble floor, sunken between small mountains of pillows.</p>
<p>That wasn’t an exaggeration, either. There were a large number of pillows piled atop one another and strewn across the floor. In addition to the Eighty-Six, Vika, Dustin, and Marcel were also lying motionless on the floor.</p>
<p>Apparently, they were all fresh out of the bath, since they were dressed lightly and had towels with them. Her eyes traveled across the boys lying in pools of white blood—Er, no, the pillows didn’t look remotely like blood.</p>
<p>Coming from a house of strict nobles, playtime was at a premium for young Lena, and she had never seen anything like this before. However, it did register as the aftermath of a Far Eastern phenomenon she’d heard about once before: the time-honored tradition of pillow fighting.</p>
