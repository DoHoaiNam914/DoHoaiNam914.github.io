<p>“I think the problem is that Lena isn’t aware of it yet,” said Anju as she plopped a slice of roasted apple into her mouth.</p>
<p>“If y’ask me, the fact that Her Majesty still hasn’t noticed is almost impressive,” Shiden said, skewering a still-sizzling piece of bacon with her fork.</p>
<p>“Especially because Shin’s, well… He’s pretty transparent, too…” Annette sighed as she crunched on a spoonful of cereal served with dried fruit.</p>
<p>“So,” said Michihi, who sat next to Annette, cocking her head. “What do we do?”</p>
<p>Shana frowned as the strawberry she bit into turned out to be sourer than she thought and smeared jam over a baguette to soothe her palate.</p>
<p>“I’d say we just support them, but Lena not making up her mind on how she feels is a problem,” she said.</p>
<p>“Yeah… But having her run away now would just leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be honest: Their back-and-forth is starting to get pretty annoying.”</p>
<p>Everyone present, with the exception of Kurena and Frederica, sighed in unison.</p>
<p>“We should keep an eye on Lena so she doesn’t run away this time.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">“—My word. All this insistence on romance and desire… Commoners lead such carefree lives.”</p>
<p>Vika uttered this fed up comment as he watched over both the pair of Shin and Lena and the Eighty-Six cheering them on from the sidelines. He disliked crowded places, so he had his breakfast in his room and came to the cafeteria only to get some coffee afterward.</p>
<p>At first, it seemed like he was gracefully enjoying the sight, but his words lacked elegance and made clear his distaste for it all.</p>
<p><a id="page-61"></a>His succession rights were revoked. He was feared as the coldhearted Serpent of Shackles and Decay who toyed with the departed. But even still, Vika was royalty. And more importantly, he was the Amethystus—the heir to the Idinarohk extrasensory ability. Regardless of whether he intended to pass on his blood to the next generation, he was forbidden from mingling with those of a different color.</p>
<p>For as long as he could remember, and before he was even born, his legal wife and several concubine candidates were already decided for him. And that didn’t just apply to him but for all members of the Idinarohk bloodline.</p>
<p>For the bloodline of the unicorns, something as selfish as one’s romantic feelings held no weight when it came to selecting a spouse. To begin with, romance wasn’t a trait that humanity possessed since antiquity. It was a contemporary concept, borne of modernity, and the United Kingdom valued the old ways.</p>
<p>And so this bittersweet image of cherubic youth unfolding before his eyes only struck him as dull and irritating… He wasn’t the slightest bit envious of them.</p>
<p>On the seat opposite him was Lerche. Her hands were cupped around a mug of coffee she’d received. She couldn’t drink it, of course, and only took it out of courtesy. Gazing at him, she parted her lips.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, should you not, um, finalize your marriage with your fiancée, Princess Yaroslava…?”</p>
<p>“Shut up, you seven-year-old.”</p>
<p>“But!” Lerche leaned forward, her hands still grasping the mug. “The fact that you’ve put off the wedding rites for so long torments the princess, Your Highness. She has even come to me, a mere mechanical doll, for advice! She asked me if you find her useless or lacking in any way. She shed bitter tears, like morning dew dripping from an immature rose… I cannot bear to see it, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Vika fell silent. He knew. His irritation at this unwanted admonishment and a hint of regret left him speechless.</p>
<p>That girl had been chosen for no reason other than that she possessed the blood of a powerful family within the United Kingdom, a <a id="page-62"></a>branch of the bloodline of unicorns. She was raised into a wife who would not bring shame to the prince she hoped to marry. Nurtured to be a meek, obedient spouse who would not interfere in matters of government. Bred to be a healthy woman who could brave the challenges of childbirth.</p>
<p>A seedbed to cultivate the next generation of the Idinarohk bloodline.</p>
<p>She was not a disagreeable young woman. Quite the contrary. She never uttered a single word of complaint to Vika and was well dispositioned and kind to an almost foolish degree. So much so that she didn’t even find fault with Lerche, who was not only far below her in the pecking order but wasn’t even human.</p>
<p>But even so…</p>
<p>“…Shut up.”</p>
<p>To have <em>her</em>, of all people, tell him to choose another. To have a girl who was identical to Lerchenlied say those words to him…was still too much to bear.</p>
<p class="space-break2">As he watched over the boys’ and girls’ tranquil breakfast, Sergeant Guren Akino of the Strike Package’s 27th Maintenance Company—the company charged with Reginleif maintenance—heaved a sigh.</p>
<p><em>Honestly…</em></p>
<p>The maintenance crew aside, this was supposed to be a fun vacation for the brats.</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to break the news…? <em>Sorry to drop this on ya, but it’s time to get to work, Processors</em>?”</p>

<p>Closing the sub-window was meant to communicate that the additional armament had activated properly. Shin let out a single, sharp breath. He was seated in his dark, cramped cockpit, with the optical screen before his eyes being the only source of light.</p>
<p>The order to sortie had been given. Letters flickered on the additional armament’s holo-window, forming words.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">

</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break">“The Valkyries take flight.”</p>
<p>The Operator smiled faintly as they watched the machine move, graced with fresh mobility by the new armament dubbed the Mantle of Fr ja. That cold, ferocious form of the Federal Republic of Giad’s Feldreß, crafted in the color of polished bone, exhibited performance suited to its namesake—Reginleif, the Valkyrie that heralds death.</p>
<p>But even so, they would overcome them. For this flock of griffins, this battlefield of mountain and stone was their turf, and they would not be beaten here.</p>
<p>“Now, then.” The Operator smiled, their faint lips curling up with glee. “Let us be off, comrades. Sprint down our fortress with the nimbleness of a mountain goat and the ferocity of a swooping eagle!”</p>
<div class="decoration-rw">

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Operation: Phase One, complete.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">&lt;&lt;Commencing Phase Two. Mantle of Frīja, disconnect.&gt;&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>After that message, the sub-window flickered out. An explosive bolt triggered, jettisoning the armament that wasn’t visible from within the cockpit.</p>
<p>And in the next moment, a shock jolted him.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>An impact that was far stronger than Shin had expected—stronger than his unit had ever experienced in a single instant—sent Undertaker reeling. As Shin gritted his teeth over the vibrations that almost made him bite his tongue, a question filled his mind.</p>
<p><em>Phase Two?</em></p>
<p>Just then, a couple of blips representing two of his unit’s Juggernauts went dark on his status screen. They belonged to…</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Shana?!”</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Are those hostiles?!”</span></strong></p>
<p>Shin scanned the forest around them with Undertaker’s optical sensor, but there was no sign of any enemy units. However, his consort units’ radars and optical sensors did perceive an enemy unit’s presence, transmitting it to Undertaker’s radar through the data link.</p>
<p>It was unregistered in the database. An unidentified unit.</p>
<p><em>An enemy unit… No, an enemy force.</em></p>
<p>This operation was a simple patrol, set to end as soon as they entered enemy territory. According to their premission briefing, no enemy forces had been deployed nearby, and no engagements were predicted.</p>
<p>Shin racked his brain, then shook his head. The situation on the battlefield was dynamic, ever in flux. Especially on such misty terrain, where the thick fog obfuscated enemy movements.</p>
<p>At the edge of his vision, he saw a shadow settle between the woods. The moment he noticed it, that shadow shifted its bearings and took cover between the trees, but Undertaker fired a shot after it.</p>
<p><a id="page-65"></a>Converting its velocity of 1,600 meters per second into piercing force, a tungsten spear 30 meters in diameter blasted into the trees the enemy took cover behind, crushing whatever was hiding behind it with a cold rumble. The impact of the warhead was dampened by the trees, but it still resonated with all who witnessed it.</p>
<p>The enemy’s armor likely wasn’t thick. It was probably similar to the Juggernaut’s and the Reginleif’s.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, the blips of Shin’s consort units were going out one after another. Over ten had already lost their signal. He squinted as, to his surprise, even Shiden’s Cyclops went out. This may have been an ambush, but the enemy’s force must have been considerable to have done this much damage.</p>
<p>“—All units.”</p>
<p>He <em>couldn’t hear these enemies’ howls</em>. So he spoke as he kept a careful eye on the optical screen.</p>
<p>“The enemy moves at high speeds, but their armor is thin. Don’t worry about their cover and shoot. Don’t count on my scouting, either. Maintain your formation and continue the search—”</p>
<p>A shadow crossed Undertaker’s feet. It wasn’t in the shape of a headless prowling spider like the Juggernauts. It was that of a large quadrupedal animal—a different sort of unit.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>A moment after Undertaker hopped away, a tremor ran through the ground. A spear of metal that looked like a steel stake stabbed into the spot Undertaker had occupied less than a second ago, sending up a spray of dirt as if the area had been stomped on by a giant.</p>
<p>A high-frequency lance.</p>
<p>Similar to the Reginleif’s pile drivers, it was equipped with a detonation mechanism that would drive it into the enemy at close range using explosives.</p>
<p><span class="special">“—Ooh!”</span> A voice filled Undertaker’s cockpit.</p>
<p>Shin narrowed his eyes. The voice belonged to the person in the enemy unit. The Operator spoke with their external speaker on, intentionally so Shin would hear them. It was a beautiful voice, an alto like the ringing of a musical instrument.</p>
<p><a id="page-66"></a>The enemy unit landed, its form dark brown like a wolf’s. The database still displayed it as an unidentified unit. Its exterior was reminiscent of a griffin. On its right shoulder sat a high-frequency lance, glinting like a beast’s fang. Its launching rail reeled back, and the lance returned to its percussion point with a heavy metallic thud.</p>
<p>It had likely hopped down the cliffs behind the trees. This was a maneuver the Reginleif couldn’t imitate. The Reginleif was a unit that prioritized high mobility, but it was designed for combat on flat terrain, forests, and urban areas. This unit, on the other hand, prided itself on vertical mobility.</p>
<p>Its two optical sensors—like an animal’s eyes—glinted mockingly at Undertaker.</p>
<div class="ecom_a">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara"><span class="special">“Ooh, you even dodged an attack launched at <em>that</em> timing! I´d heard you can only hear the Legion´s voices, though!”</span></p>
</div>
<p>Shin narrowed his eyes. Unlike his allies, who hardly knew anything about their opponents, the enemy was well-informed, it seemed. But that didn’t mean much.</p>
<p>“…Did you think that, just because I can’t hear you, I wouldn’t be able to read your patterns?”</p>
<p>As instructed during his briefing, Shin shut off his radio communications and remained connected to the other Processors only through the Para-RAID. As such, what he’d just said didn’t reach the enemy’s ears. This wasn’t a response; he’d only muttered to himself.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Don’t underestimate me.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">The Eighty-Six watched the battle unfold in blank amazement. Within the green forested battlefield displayed on their optical screens, two armored weapons were engaged in an almost even battle.</p>
<p>Yes, they were equally matched.</p>
<p><a id="page-67"></a>And that was what rendered the Eighty-Six speechless. They were all Name Bearers, but Shin stood head and shoulders above them all. By now, their Reaper was capable of single-handedly overwhelming a Dinosauria.</p>
<p>And someone was matching <em>him</em>. In melee combat, his area of expertise, no less. It was the first time they’d ever seen such a thing.</p>
<p class="space-break1">And the same held true for the ones aboard the enemy units. They couldn’t believe there was someone capable of matching their heroic princess, Anna Maria, and her spear dance.</p>
<p class="space-break2">Similar to the Reginleif, the enemy’s unit’s design concept was based around high-mobility combat. It fought with an agility that matched the Reginleif, which boasted combat speeds that would injure any inexperienced Operator.</p>
<p><em>The Phönix was faster</em>, Shin thought through his sober consciousness.</p>
<p>He was operating a Reginleif now, but for most of his seven years of combat experience, Shin piloted a Juggernaut. A slow, clunky unit with performance so pitiful, the Eighty-Six mockingly dubbed it a walking coffin. And Shin was used to engaging the absurdly agile Legion in that weak, sluggish rig.</p>
<p>So now that he used a unit with performance that matched his opponent’s, he wouldn’t be caught off guard.</p>
<p>The moment the high-frequency lance was fired at him, Shin charged forward from a squatting position, resulting in the weapon only piercing empty air. As it intersected with the enemy unit, Undertaker swung its high-frequency blade, cutting the firing rail down the middle. Without pausing, he changed the blade’s bearing and slashed at the enemy unit’s torso.</p>
<p>The griffin dodged by jumping away, only for Shin to pursue it and close the gap. The griffin kicked off the ground again, shooting a wire anchor and reeling it back to supplement its speed.</p>
<p>The Juggernaut’s long-caliber 88 mm turret was well within firing <a id="page-68"></a>range, and the pile drivers in its legs meant that just being stepped on by it was a powerful attack. And when Feldreß landed, they needed a moment for their buffering systems and their joints to absorb the impact. As such, despite seeing Undertaker’s charge, the griffin shouldn’t have been able to move at once.</p>
<p>It <em>shouldn’t</em> have been able to move.</p>
<p>The griffin sneered at Undertaker fiercely. As it jumped away, it lifted one of its hind legs, which was caught on a tight, extended wire before any of the other legs landed. This made it rotate in place, with that leg as its axis. The wire reached Undertaker and coiled itself around its legs.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Undertaker was pulled forward, losing its balance. The other unit had its acceleration curbed by pulling Undertaker in, and the two units collided slightly earlier than expected. Sooner than Shin could react, the enemy stomped down on the blunt back of his high-frequency blade, halting its swing.</p>
<p>But still, Undertaker’s two front legs caught against the enemy’s curved cockpit block, their tips just barely touching the armor.</p>
<p>Armament selection, switch. Trigger.</p>
<p>The pile drivers in Undertaker’s two front legs accurately pierced into the enemy’s cockpit block. And as they did, the enemy’s short-barreled turret, which was pressed against Undertaker’s white armor, howled.</p>

</div>
<p><a id="page-69"></a>Watching as the final score was displayed before him, Shin opened the simulator’s canopy. It didn’t list the result of that last enemy he fought, but it probably ended in a mutual kill. Or rather, he was driven to bring their clash to a mutual kill… Or perhaps drove the enemy to it.</p>
<p>Either way, he left the simulator designed after a Reginleif’s cockpit and leaned against its streamlined chassis, letting out a deep breath. This was a simulator for the Armée Furieuse—the newly completed armament designed for the Reginleif. Putting aside Phase Two—the mock battle they were thrust into—Shin thought.</p>
<p><em>It’s gonna be hell until I get used to this…</em></p>
<p>He wasn’t accustomed to such intense acceleration. It made him feel like all the blood and organs in his body were being siphoned out, and it was the first time he was exposed to this sort of sensation for such a long time. His five senses were so thrown out of balance that he couldn’t even tell which direction he was facing.</p>
<p>In the virtual training room adjacent to the simulator, a capsule Shin thought was empty opened its canopy, and another Operator rose from within it. Perhaps in the name of increasing their units’ operability, the Alliance’s Feldreß had control systems that were augmented by being directly linked to the Operator’s nervous systems.</p>
<p>The cords connected along the Operator’s spinal column and all the way up to their neck were unplugged, their serpentine edges twisting like snakes as they fell limply into the cockpit’s interior. As if following suit, the Operator undid their hair, letting their long black locks flow down to their waist.</p>
<p>“…I’ve heard you were skilled, but…”</p>
<p class="space-break2">“The queen is as silent as ever, but it seems bringing him to meet it did have some effect.”</p>
<p>They looked down at the virtual training room through the glass walls of the meeting room above it. The elderly woman standing next to Grethe spoke. Her long hair was dyed red, and she had the blue eyes of <a id="page-70"></a>a Sapphira. Her stance was stalwart, as if she were made of steel down to her very core.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Bel Aegis. Supreme commander of the Alliance military’s northern defensive forces. She was the woman who had attended the Morpho subjugation council as the Alliance’s representative.</p>
<p>“The footage from yesterday’s interrogation has been analyzed, and the results show that it moved slightly after Captain Nouzen called out to it. Maybe we can see it as it reacting to him.”</p>
<p>Ever since the Alliance was formed, it practiced universal conscription. It had never based its army strictly on men, and as such, there was relatively little difference between the mannerisms of men and women in the Alliance. Soldiers, in particular, chose to use brief, concise wording, so as to not overcomplicate delivery of orders. And so it was hard to tell a male soldier from a female soldier just by the way they spoke.</p>
<p>“…He’s a valuable target for the Legion. That might have been why it reacted.”</p>
<p>“I’m not telling you to order him to stand right in front of it.”</p>
<p>“And I don’t plan on ordering him to do that… But if he volunteers, I see no reason to stop him.”</p>
<p>For a moment, a thread of tension—so strained that it could break with a single touch—hung between the two female officers.</p>
<p>“Lieutenant General Aegis… Regarding <em>that</em> matter… I find it problematic. She is my subordinate, so I ask that you inform me before any meetings are arranged.”</p>
<p>“<em>They</em> only came to the Alliance because you Federacy officers insist on saying that… The Alliance is a neutral nation. We don’t support any one side.”</p>
<p>The sole exception was when it came to fighting the Legion, a common enemy to all humanity. But that wasn’t to say they didn’t have their own opinions. Looking down at the Eighty-Six, Lieutenant General Aegis spoke without even looking at Grethe. Her expression was like that of a strict grandmother looking down at her grandchildren playing in the yard.</p>
<p>“Colonel, I’m merely speaking to myself right now, but… A few <a id="page-71"></a>days ago, you confirmed the survival of some small countries to the west of the Republic, yes?”</p>
<p>The Federacy’s aid expeditionary force was still stationed in the Republic, fighting to retake its northern regions. The United Kingdom’s was likewise stationed in the Republic’s west. Both of them successfully communicated with those countries and were maintaining a steady exchange of information.</p>
<p>“That country truly is vile. But should we treat them too coldly, they might yield to that mad country in the far west.”</p>
<p><em>…So that’s your angle.</em></p>
<p>“We’re grateful for your sympathy, Lieutenant General Aegis.”</p>
<p class="space-break2">A person approached, their military boots clicking against the floor. As they walked, they smoothly undid their hair ribbon with a practiced motion, letting their hair flow down their back like a dark waterfall.</p>
<p>“I didn’t imagine the most I could do was bring this battle to a mutual kill… You’re quite something.”</p>
<p>Their fair, alto-like voice had something of an echo to it, perhaps because of the material the walls were made out of. A clear, charming voice that was accustomed to giving orders. The scent of June roses wafted up from their autumn-colored Alliance uniform, which matched their androgynous face. It bore a striking resemblance to Anna Maria, the heroic princess of the Alliance’s independence war, who took to the battlefield clad in male clothing.</p>
<p>Shin knew the face. When they were briefed on the simulator, this person joined as part of the personnel dispatched to the Strike Package, so he had seen them before. If he remembered correctly, their name was…</p>
<p>“Allow me to reintroduce myself. I’m Captain Olivia Aegis, your academic adviser with regards to operating the Armée Furieuse… That was a magnificent match just now.”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of you, Captain Aegis. I’m Captain Shinei Nouzen of the Strike Package’s 1st Armored Division.”</p>
<p><a id="page-72"></a>“A pleasure to make your acquaintance… Oh, and you can call me Olivia. No need for formalities. I might be older than you, but we’re both the same rank,” Captain Olivia said with a slight head tilt. “Or maybe you’re actually more experienced than I am? I hear the Eighty-Six were drafted at young ages, and you’re treated as a captain since you’re their leader. If I may, how old were you…?”</p>
<p>“True, ranks didn’t mean anything in the Eighty-Sixth Sector. Truthfully, I’m not sure if it actually counts as part of my active duty.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be so stiff… So how old were you?”</p>
<p>“…I was twelve. It’s been about six years since I was drafted.”</p>
<p>“I see… That was rude of me, Captain Nouzen, sir.”</p>
<p>Olivia saluted in a jesting manner. Looking up at them, Shin cracked a wry smile. Even he could tell Olivia was trying to break the ice.</p>
<p>“I’ll admit, when they told us we’d be going into simulator training to experience the Mantle’s mobility, I didn’t expect it to turn into a mock battle,” Shin said.</p>
<p>“Oh? Didn’t they explain it during briefing? In real combat, you’ll likely always have engagements with the Legion after deploying the Mantle. So during this simulation, my Anna Maria and our Alliance’s Stollenwurm assumed the roles of your aggressors.”</p>
<p>“No, we’ve heard nothing of the sort.”</p>
<p>“My… What a blunder on my behalf. It seems I neglected to inform you of that part.”</p>
<p>Olivia turned their eyes slightly, their tone and expression making it clear it was a blatant lie. They were planning to launch a surprise attack to begin with.</p>
<p>“That final maneuver Anna Maria pulled. You couldn’t have done that if you weren’t perfectly confident that you knew what I’d do. Could you reveal your trick?”</p>
<p>The way Anna Maria used its wire anchors while landing to entangle Undertaker and close the distance. Adrenaline was said to sometimes give one the impression that time was moving slowly, but this was a judgment call that was put into action within less than a second. It was as if Olivia predicted everything before shooting the anchor.</p>
