<p class="noindent">Leonis and Sakuya crossed a coupling bridge built over a river and reached a quieter part of Old Town. At the end of the road was a thick forest of artificial trees.</p>
<p>“The shrine where the enshrinement ritual will be held is past these woods,” Sakuya told Leonis.</p>
<p>“Hm…”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Do the Sakura Orchid’s guardian deities <em>really exist</em>?” Leonis inquired, trying his best to play the part of an innocent child.</p>
<p>Was it just a legend, or did the ceremony really involve divine beings? That distinction was crucial for Leonis. He had to find out.</p>
<p>Sakuya fell silent for a moment, long enough to make Leonis wonder if his question had offended her.</p>
<p>“The Sakura Orchid’s guardian deities exist, yes,” she answered, gazing into the woods. “Fuujinki and Raijinki. They have guarded over the Sakura Orchid for its entire three-hundred-year history.”</p>
<p>“Two? The Sakura Orchid has a pair of gods?”</p>
<p>“…Yes. Though there’s only one of them now.”</p>
<p>“Huh…?” Leonis asked dubiously.</p>
<p><a id="page-100"/>Sakuya stopped in her tracks in front of a large estate with an impressive gate.</p>
<p>“Where are we?” Leonis questioned.</p>
<p>“This estate is where Raiou, my legal guardian, lives.”</p>
<p>A magical apparatus authenticated their biometric data, after which the gate opened. Ahead was a large garden dotted with well-tended trees and a sizable pond. It was the kind of place one would’ve never found in the Central Garden, with its many laminated buildings. Leonis couldn’t disguise his admiration as he beheld the sight.</p>
<p>A small old man appeared from within the manor. “—We’ve been expecting you, Princess Sakuya.”</p>
<p><em>Oh…</em></p>
<p>Leonis regarded the man with great interest. At first glance, he might have appeared as an ordinary elderly person, but Leonis could tell he was more.</p>
<p><em>This is a master of martial arts.</em></p>
<p>His old, dried arms could easily kill someone. He wasn’t so much a warrior as he was an assassin.</p>
<p><em>…Perhaps I can make him into a skilled skeleton assassin after he passes away,</em> Leonis mused, not overly concerned with how rude that notion was.</p>
<p>“My apologies, I was a little late. I was showing him around Old Town,” Sakuya replied.</p>
<p>The old man turned his eyes to Leonis.</p>
<p>“Princess Sakuya, who is this boy…?”</p>
<p>“He’s Leonis, a member of my platoon.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, I’ve heard of him.”</p>
<p>Bowing his head politely, Leonis stated, “Miss Sakuya is always a very dependable friend.”</p>
<p><a id="page-101"/>“Do come in,” the old man said, ushering them inside. “I’ll have some tea prepared for you at once.”</p>

</div>

</div>
<p class="space-break1">After being shown into the manor, Leonis took a seat on a veranda that offered a view of the pond. There was a garden on Excalibur Academy’s grounds as well, but this one was completely different. It was meant to reproduce the scenery of the Sakura Orchid’s lost homeland.</p>
<p>“The roadside trees in the Seventh Assault Garden are utility plants meant to purify sea water and regulate the environment, but those in this garden were all brought from the Sakura Orchid,” Sakuya commented as she approached Leonis from behind and pointed at one of the trees growing in the garden. “They sprout beautiful flowers come spring, but the Seventh Assault Garden is an offensive-type colony that travels all over the world, which throws off the timing for the blossoms.”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>“My older sister always looked forward to seeing those flowers bloom,” Sakuya said, her tone and eyes seeming distant.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Sakuya’s sister had perished on the day the Sakura Orchid was destroyed. The white garb she wore under her uniform was a memento of her lost sibling.</p>
<p>A gust of wind blew, and the leaves on the garden’s trees rustled. A large ripple played over the surface of the pond—</p>
<p><em>Splaaaaaaaaash!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, a black mass breached the surface.</p>
<p>“…What?!” Leonis exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p><a id="page-102"/>Sakuya, however, didn’t look taken aback.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re here, too, Fluffymaru,” she observed with a smile.</p>
<p>A large black wolf stepped out of the pond, his fur drenched, and then shook himself dry, splashing water all over the ground. The beast met Leonis’s gaze.</p>
<p><em>“Oh, it’s you, Lord Magnus.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Blackas, what are you doing here?”</em> Leonis replied to his friend’s telepathic greeting.</p>
<p><em>“Bathing. The humans tend to be surprised when I swim in the academy’s pool.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes, I imagine they would be.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Someone recently reported my presence there, and they very nearly sent another to hunt me down.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I…see. It seems you’ve been through a lot.”</em></p>
<p>Blackas was apparently being pursued by Excalibur Academy’s hunters’ association. Unlike Leonis, who was enrolled in the school, and Shary, who had a human form, Blackas always stood out when he went about his business on his own. There were spells that could give one a humanoid shape. However, Blackas had <em>unique circumstances</em> that made that impossible.</p>
<p>“Fluffymaru frequently comes by the estate to play. I would have liked to keep him here, but Raiou said that taming an animal like him would be impossible…”</p>
<p>“…Yes, I feel the same way.”</p>
<p>Blackas was the proud prince of the Realm of Shadows, putting him above obeying others. His relationship with Leonis was one of camaraderie. He was a guest general in Leonis’s army and by no means a subordinate to the Undead King.</p>
<p>And that proud prince lay sprawled out comfortably under a cherry blossom tree.</p>
<p><a id="page-103"/>“—Here is your tea.” Raiou, the old man from earlier, was carrying a tray with a few cups and sweets.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go practice for the dance, then,” Sakuya stated, getting to her feet. That was why she’d come here to begin with, after all. “I’ll return to the estate during the evening, but if you want to go home alone, you should take the bus. You’ve ridden alone before, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll be fine. Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I had fun on my date with you, kid. There’s still plenty of places I haven’t shown you, so next time we visit, let’s take it slow.”</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break1">“So what do you think of the Sakura Orchid’s scenery?”</p>
<p>Raiou sat across from Leonis, sipping his tea.</p>
<p>“It’s fascinating. I’m looking forward to the festival.”</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear,” the elderly man replied. He turned his attention to the black wolf lying in the garden. “Princess Sakuya has changed a bit, as of late.”</p>
<p>“…Has she?”</p>
<p>“Yes. When she first arrived, her heart was like ice. She’d shut herself off from everyone else.”</p>
<p>Leonis didn’t know what Sakuya was like back then. But if anything could have thawed her frozen heart, it must surely have been…</p>
<p><em>…Riselia, no doubt</em>, he concluded.</p>
<p>“That reminds me, I wanted to ask you something,” Leonis said. After drinking from his cup, he placed it on the floor of the veranda.</p>
<p><a id="page-104"/>If Raiou was a vassal of the Sakura Orchid’s royal family, he surely knew all sorts of things on the matter.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“What kind of gods are the Sakura Orchid’s guardian deities?”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Are you interested in our religion?”</p>
<p>“Miss Sakuya told me a bit about it. She said the Sakura Orchid was protected by two gods.”</p>
<p>“…Yes, that’s correct.”</p>
<p>Raiou turned around and pointed at a pillar supporting the estate.</p>
<p>“They are carved into that column over there. Fuujinki and Raijinki.”</p>
<p>“Over there…?”</p>
<p>Looking up the pillar, Leonis saw carvings of two giants glaring down from atop the clouds.</p>
<p>“Their names stand for that which they govern over. Raijinki commands thunder and Fuujinki calls great storms. Whenever the Sakura Orchid faced crises, they would wield their powers to protect the land.”</p>
<p>“Then you mean to say those deities existed?”</p>
<p>“Of course. The gods of the Sakura Orchid aren’t simply fictional beings of legend,” Raiou stated, and he shook his head. “I saw it with my own two eyes. How the Twin Gods did battle with the Voids.”</p>
<p>Nine years ago, when the Void Stampede washed over the Sakura Orchid, the royal family broke the seals on the two gods in an attempt to beat the Voids back. They believed that with their mighty powers, Raijinki and Fuujinki would annihilate the monsters and save the Sakura Orchid—</p>
<p>“However, just when it seemed that faint hope was within reach, <em>it</em> appeared.”</p>
<p><a id="page-105"/>Raiou was referring to the Void Lord who had caused the Stampede. It emerged from the emptiness and defeated the two gods in a matter of minutes. And then, it consumed and absorbed the defeated Fuujinki.</p>
<p>“It devoured…a god?” Leonis was struck with disbelief.</p>
<p>“Indeed. That monster took Fuujinki into its being.”</p>
<p>And with the storm god fused into it, the Void Lord could freely abuse its divine authority. Thus was the Sakura Orchid overrun by the Voids, ending its three-hundred-year-long history.</p>
<p><em>…I think I understand now.</em></p>
<p>Based on this story, Leonis was able to form a hypothesis on what the Sakura Orchid’s divine protectors were.</p>
<p><em>They were probably demi-gods.</em></p>
<p>Demi-gods were subordinate entities produced by the Luminous Powers. While they were no match for true gods, they did possess terrifying powers. Leonis could remember how, in the past, demi-gods gave the Dark Lords’ Armies a great deal of trouble.</p>
<p>…There was still something Leonis didn’t understand yet, though. If one of the gods, Fuujinki, was devoured by the Void Lord…</p>
<p>“What happened to the other deity?” Leonis asked.</p>
<p>“While the Void Lord consumed Fuujinki, Princess Setsura sealed Raijinki, who was grievously injured in the fight. I’m certain she believed the Sakura Orchid would have truly met its demise if its final guardian was lost.”</p>
<p>“…I’m inclined to agree.”</p>
<p>Among the countries the Dark Lords’ Armies had destroyed, Leonis faced a ruler who, as foolish as it was, and as clear as defeat may have been, opposed him to the last. They believed that so long as they didn’t accept defeat, they could always find a way to turn the tables.</p>
<p><a id="page-106"/>Just like Roselia, whose soul endured, even after one thousand years.</p>
<p>“Without its greatest protectors on the battlefield, the Sakura Orchid fell to ruin. That swarm of demons crushed our fortresses and invaded the capital, intending to swallow our land entirely. The capital was guarded by a group of Holy Swordsmen known as the Kenki Gathering, but they were overwhelmed by sheer numbers. Ultimately, they failed to safeguard Princess Setsura—Princess Sakuya’s older sister.”</p>
<p>Raiou’s features contorted with grief and regret. Leonis knew his feelings all too well—pain at having failed to protect what mattered most. Unfortunately, he couldn’t sympathize out loud.</p>
<p>“That is how the Twin Gods of the Sakura Orchid became just one—Raijinki,” Raiou concluded.</p>
<p>A gust of wind rustled the trees.</p>
<p>“So the surviving deity remains in the former lands of the Sakura Orchid?” Leonis questioned.</p>
<p>Raiou shook his head and pointed down. “No.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Leonis knit his brows, unclear on what to make of the gesture.</p>
<p>“Our guardian god is sealed right here, in the Seventh Assault Garden,” the old man declared.</p>

<p class="space-break1">After leaving the estate, Sakuya made her way to the relocated grove leading up to the shrine. Her steps were lighter than usual. She’d been terribly tense recently, but the date with Leonis was just the change of pace she’d needed.</p>
<p><em>It wasn’t long, but I did have fun.</em></p>
<p>The familiar sights of Old Town felt a bit different when she walked by his side.</p>
<p><a id="page-107"/><em>Perhaps I should take him to more confectionary stores next time. But I’ll probably need Miss Selia’s permission, and she can be overprotective…</em></p>
<p>Smiling at that thought, she set foot in the overgrown grounds of the shrine, when suddenly—</p>
<p><em>“Princess Sakuya.”</em></p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Sakuya suddenly became aware of several presences in the woods. The girl stopped in her tracks and scanned the trees. She couldn’t see them, but they were definitely there. This could be the work of only one group.</p>
<p><em>The Kenki Gathering…</em></p>
<p>Sakuya counted five, six of them…perhaps even more.</p>
<p>“You’re intruding upon the priestess princess’s holy ground. Are you trying to get yourselves cursed by the heavens?”</p>
<p><em>“We’re aware of how blasphemous this is. But no one will interrupt us here.”</em></p>
<p>The darkness took form and surfaced before her eyes, becoming a figure in a black anti-Void protection suit. Unlike the man who spoke to her yesterday, this one wasn’t using a voice changer, and his tone was familiar.</p>
<p>“Is that you, Uzan?” Sakuya asked. “I remember you playing with me when I was still a little girl.”</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time, Princess Sakuya.” The man kneeled respectfully, displaying a retainer’s fealty.</p>
<p>Despite the gesture, Sakuya didn’t relax.</p>
<p>“You could at least try to mask your Demon Sword’s presence,” she stated firmly. “I sense the power of a Demon Sword in all of you.”</p>
<p>One of those behind Uzan stirred at her remark.</p>
<p>“…I see you are familiar with Demon Swords,” Uzan said.</p>
<p>“Where did you get that power? You do know that using it contaminates your body with nothingness, right?”</p>
<p><a id="page-108"/>Uzan’s answer was immediate. “Of course we do, Princess Sakuya.”</p>
<p>“Then why…?!”</p>
<p>“Because we need the strength it offers if we are to achieve our revenge and make our heart’s desire a reality.”</p>
<p>“Revenge…” Sakuya’s eyes widened in shock. “Just what are you plotting?”</p>
<p>“Nothing less than our ultimate objective.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“We will summon the Void Lord who destroyed the Sakura Orchid nine years ago to this land.”</p>
<p>“…Wh-what?!”</p>

<p class="space-break1">“The Sakura Orchid’s god is sealed here in the Seventh Assault Garden?” Leonis was utterly astonished.</p>
<p>“I can’t blame you for being surprised, but it is the truth.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>During his reign as the Undead King, Leonis fought many gods. But while the mega-float the Seventh Assault Garden sat upon was quite vast, he didn’t detect any traces of a sealed divine entity.</p>
<p><em>If there was a god here, Blackas and I would have surely noticed it by now. Though I suppose it’s possible we may have overlooked one in a dormant state…</em></p>
<p>Then he realized something.</p>
<p><em>…It can’t be!</em></p>
<p>Leonis recalled that he had encountered a mass of super-high-density mana the likes of which had never existed in his era. It was a source capable of producing enough magical power to support <a id="page-109"/>all the functions of this mobile city and its population of over one million people.</p>
<p>“…The Mana Furnace!”</p>
<p>Raiou nodded. “Precisely. The Integrated Human Empire unearthed Raijinki from the ruins of the Sakura Orchid and placed our guardian in the Mana Furnace that serves as the heart of this city.”</p>
<p><em>…I see. So this city uses a god as the power source.</em></p>
<p>Such a feat was unthinkable one thousand years ago. The idea of mere humans harnessing superior beings and using them for energy… It did clear up a few previously unanswered questions, though.</p>
<p>Why was there such a large mana crystal? Why did the Archsage Arakael and the Holy Woman Tearis Resurrectia try to merge with Mana Furnaces?</p>
<p>The Six Heroes weren’t inherently drawn to the Mana Furnaces; they were trying to absorb the gods within them.</p>
<p><em>…I may have underestimated what humanity is capable of.</em></p>
<p>Surely this wasn’t limited to just the Seventh Assault Garden. The others were likely powered by ancient gods, too.</p>
<p><em>And since they’re using the deities, those in charge must have wiped all records of their existence…</em></p>
<p>Leonis fixed his gaze on Raiou. “Did Sakuya and the people of the Sakura Orchid…agree to this?”</p>
<p>“The circumstances are different, but one of our Twin Gods is still protecting the Sakura Orchid’s populace. That much hasn’t changed…,” Raiou replied. “And very few people know the truth. Only the military’s top brass and those close to the Sakura Orchid’s royal family. And now you as well…”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Indeed, this was information Leonis had never come across, despite his previous research.</p>
<p><a id="page-110"/>“…Why share this secret with me?”</p>
<p>“I pride myself on having a good eye for people.” Raiou smiled and peered into Leonis’s eyes.</p>
<p><em>…My word. A good eye for people, he says? Perhaps he should have his vision examined. I’m a Dark Lord, an enemy of humankind…</em></p>
<p>Blackas, who was lying in the garden, suddenly raised his head, his ears pricking up.</p>
<p><em>“What’s wrong, Blackas?”</em> Leonis asked telepathically.</p>
<p><em>“Several strange presences have appeared around the girl.”</em></p>
<p>“…What?”</p>

</div>
<p class="space-break1">“…You’re going to summon the Void Lord here?” Sakuya was incredulous. “Don’t tell me you’re trying to cause a Stampede here?!”</p>
<p>“That’s right, Princess Sakuya,” Uzan replied without remorse. “We thirty-seven Kenki Gathering members will call our sworn enemy, Shardark Void Lord, and strike him down.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The unwavering faith, the confidence in his voice, filled Sakuya with terror.</p>
<p>“B-but how would you even…?”</p>
<p>“By unleashing the seal on Raijinki, the Twin God slumbering in this city’s Mana Furnace,” Uzan declared, emotion peeking through in his voice for the first time.</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>“Surely you know this already, Princess Sakuya. That Void Lord absorbed Fuujinki. However, the Sakura Orchid’s deities are two parts of a whole. If he senses the other half is unleashed, he will surely come for it…”</p>
<p><a id="page-111"/>“…”</p>
<p>Sakuya was aghast.</p>
<p><em>They’re planning to use Raijinki as bait for the Void Lord, so they can slay him?</em></p>
<p>What was this man saying? It was madness. This couldn’t even be called a plan; they were simply looking for somewhere to die. They’d spent too long on the path of carnage, and after hunting Voids for so long, they’d lost sight of all else.</p>
<p>No, perhaps they’d been mad since that day nine years ago…</p>
<p>Once she’d got over her initial astonishment, Sakuya asked, “And you really think you can manage to kill the Void Lord?”</p>
<p>“We’ve besmirched ourselves with the power of the Voids to that end,” Uzan replied, clenching his armored fist. “Shardark Void Lord will fight the unleashed Raijinki, and once he is weakened, we will strike him down. While we don’t intend to rely on them, the Stampede caused by the Void Lord’s appearance will surely draw the city’s Holy Swordsman into the fight as well.”</p>
<p>“You’re willing to forfeit the Seventh Assault Garden to get your revenge?!” Sakuya cried, furious.</p>
<p>“It will be a sacrifice to stomp out the Voids.”</p>
<p>“…Uzan!” Sakuya shouted and manifested Raikirimaru in her hands.</p>
<p>Just like the Kenki Gathering, Sakuya had dedicated her life to revenge. However…</p>
<p><em>—I will not become a mindless demon… I won’t relinquish my human heart!</em></p>
<p>She gripped her Holy Sword as tendrils of pale lightning raged across its blade.</p>
<p>“The only one who can unleash Raijinki is the princess priestess of the Mikagami royal family—me. Do you think I’d ever agree to your plan?”</p>
<p><a id="page-112"/>“Your refusal is a shame, but our plan will not change. We already have a princess priestess on our side.”</p>
<p>“…What?” Sakuya gave Uzan a confused look, but the man didn’t bother to clarify.</p>
<p>“Since you’ve drawn your Holy Sword, I take it to mean there’s no room for negotiations anymore.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. I’ll never join you!” Sakuya stepped forward and swung her weapon.</p>
<p>However, her attack was blocked by a <em>third arm</em> that sprouted out of Uzan’s back.</p>
<p>“…What?!” Sakuya’s exclaimed. “Have you truly been corrupted by the nothingness that much…?!”</p>
<p>“You have grown strong, Princess Sakuya. However—” A pair of red eyes glinted behind his helmet. “You’re still no match for Princess Setsura.”</p>
<p>“…Setsura…?”</p>
<p>A fourth arm sprouted from his back and grabbed Sakuya by the throat.</p>
<p>“Kah…aah…”</p>
<p>The fingers of the monstrous arm dug into her throat. Perhaps Uzan had mentioned her deceased sister’s name simply to shake her resolve. It wounded Sakuya to know that the man who was once the Sakura Orchid’s most celebrated swordsman had fallen so far…</p>
<p>“…Damn, you…!”</p>
<p>…She couldn’t breathe. Her consciousness was growing hazy. Raikirimaru slipped from her fingers and faded into thin air…</p>
<p>“…—kuya… Miss Sakuya!”</p>
<p>But just then, she heard a familiar voice from afar.</p>
<p>“…K-kid… Stay…away…!” the young woman desperately gasped out.</p>
<p>“It seems we’ve been spotted,” one of the Kenki Gathering <a id="page-113"/>members observed. “Lord Uzan, the time has not yet come. Suppress your Demon Sword’s power.”</p>
<p>“—Yes, understood.”</p>
<p>The arm holding her slackened its grip, and Sakuya collapsed to the ground. “…Ugh…,” she managed, coughing.</p>
<p>“I wanted you to be a part of our plan, Princess Sakuya,” Uzan said, looking down at her. Then he turned away and vanished into the darkness.</p>
<p>“W-wait…”</p>
<p>As her consciousness faded, Sakuya could hear Leonis’s voice getting closer.</p>
