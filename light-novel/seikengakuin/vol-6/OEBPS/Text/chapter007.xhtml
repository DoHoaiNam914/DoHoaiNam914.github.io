<p><a id="page-36"/>“Nngha?!”</p>
<p>Riselia’s body thrashed, her back arching, and at that very moment, the crystal digging into her heart shattered to bits. Leonis gently released his minion’s hand and wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.</p>
<p>It may have looked easy when Leonis did it, but destroying that crystal without damaging Riselia’s body would have been an impossible task for the average sorcerer. Nefakess had surely never anticipated there’d be someone capable of removing it.</p>
<p>“You should be fine now. I crushed the crystal.”</p>
<p>“Th-thank you…Leo,” Riselia breathed, all the tension draining from her muscles.</p>
<p>Leonis checked her mana one more time, just in case, but all traces of the object were gone.</p>
<p><em>Still…</em></p>
<p>Leonis gritted his teeth. Nefakess Reizaad, that bishop. Why had he planted the crystal inside Riselia? Perhaps he’d set his sights on Riselia after the encounter in the Third Assault Garden.</p>
<p><em>Well, either way…</em></p>
<p>Leonis sneered devilishly. It wouldn’t be long before that little upstart learned the true terror of a Dark Lord.</p>
<p><em>Forgiving though I may be, I have no mercy for those who lay hands on my minions.</em></p>
<p>A shrill alarm sounded, marking the end of their break time.</p>
<p>“Let’s get going. Sakuya booked the next time slot,” Leonis said, reaching out to Riselia and pulling her to her feet.</p>
<p>The indoor training facility needed to be reserved in advance, and the eighteenth platoon had booked it for today. Regina and Elfiné couldn’t use the room due to their Holy Swords’ properties, so Riselia, Leonis, and Sakuya took shifts.</p>
<p>“I think Sakuya opted out today,” Riselia pointed out.</p>
<p><a id="page-37"/>“Really?”</p>
<p>Sakuya might skip lectures, but she wasn’t the sort to miss an independent training session.</p>
<p>“Yes, she said she’ll be away from the dorms for a while because of the festival…”</p>
<p>“Festival?”</p>
<p>“Oh, right, you wouldn’t know… Well, there’s a self-governing section of Old Town. And every year, they have a traditional, religious enshrinement ritual.”</p>
<p>Each Assault Garden was divided into relocation sectors meant to accommodate refugees from places destroyed by the Voids. Old Town, a part of the Seventh Assault Garden’s second sector, was one such place. It was modeled after the Sakura Orchid’s cities.</p>
<p>The sixth sector’s biotope area, which was home to many demi-humans and beastmen, was another example of an area built for those displaced by Void destruction.</p>
<p>“Sakuya is a shrine maiden there, so each year she performs an offering dance to the Sakura Orchid’s guardian deities.”</p>
<p>“Sakuya is a shrine maiden?! Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes… Although I admit that I’m not very familiar with the Sakura Orchid’s traditions.”</p>
<p><em>Th-that’s a surprise…</em></p>
<p>Something else piqued Leonis’s curiosity, however.</p>
<p>“You said deities… Does the Sakura Orchid have gods?”</p>
<p>In Leonis’s time, the deities were the Luminous Powers, who had declared themselves creators of this world, and the Goddess of Rebellion, who rose up against them.</p>
<p>There were also the demi-gods who served the Luminous Powers, and Demon Gods. One such Demon God was currently slumbering in Leonis’s Realm of Shadows.</p>
<p><em>And I’d rather not awaken them, if at all possible.</em></p>
<p><a id="page-38"/>It did beg the question of whether the deities of the Sakura Orchid were related to the ones Leonis knew.</p>
<p><em>I thought the legends of the Dark Lords, Luminous Powers, and Six Heroes had been forgotten, but…</em></p>
<p>Traces had survived, like fairy tales of Dark Lords who sought to bring the world to ruin.</p>
<p><em>I might want to look into the Sakura Orchid’s enshrinement ritual.</em></p>
<p>However, sending Shary there would only get him a detailed report of the festival’s best sweets.</p>
<p>“Umm…Leo?” Riselia’s head was lowered, and she spoke timidly.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“Like I said, Sakuya won’t be coming today, so we still have some time.”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah…”</p>
<p>“Nnn… So…could we?” she asked, her cheeks turning rosy as she grabbed Leonis’s sleeve.</p>
<p>“Just a bit,” he replied. “I still have classes during the afternoon.”</p>
<p>“R-right. Just a bit.”</p>
<p>Leonis had learned to pick up on the meaning behind Riselia’s subtlest gestures. She had likely depleted much of her mana during this training session and was feeling fatigued.</p>
<p>Leonis offered his fingertip to her, and Riselia nibbled on it wantonly. A sweet numbness ran through the digit.</p>
<p><em>I really do become softhearted whenever my minions are involved</em>, the Undead King mused self-depricatingly.</p>

<p class="space-break1">“Your Highness, the origin of that military vessel’s freight is still unclear.”</p>
<p><a id="page-39"/>“I see… Thank you, Eika.”</p>
<p>In Old Town, a short distance away from the bustling storefronts of Fuurin Street, stood a vast estate. Sitting in its courtyard was Sakuya, practicing her sword swings as she replied to the girl kneeling next to her.</p>
<p>This estate belonged to Raiou, the retainer to the Sakura Orchid’s former royal house and Sakuya’s legal guardian. In preparation for the enshrinement ritual that would take place four days from now, Sakuya had been visiting frequently over the last few days.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, please don’t overexert yourself.”</p>
<p>Sakuya shrugged and looked over her shoulder. “Yes, I know.”</p>
<p>The girl behind her looked up at her with a slightly displeased expression. Eika was an operative of the Murakumo, a secret intelligence organization working for the royal house. Sakuya had asked Eika to investigate the Void appearance at the pier and the unidentified figure that called themselves a Dark Lord.</p>
<p>“I never imagined I’d run into the Voids there.”</p>
<p>Last night, Sakuya had scouted out the Seventh Assault Garden, trying to detect any Demon Sword users after the recent appearance of several.</p>
<p>Demon Swords were the inverse of Holy Swords, which were a power granted by the planet. During a Hive Extermination mission a few days ago, three of Sakuya’s upperclassmen, including Liat, were contaminated by Demon Swords and went berserk.</p>
<p>And it didn’t end there. While it hadn’t been made public information, multiple Holy Sword users had been corrupted by Demon Swords in the last few months.</p>
<p>Sakuya was gathering the power of other Demon Swords. By feeding their power to her own Demon Sword, Yamichidori, she could take in their abilities. As a cost, or perhaps as a side effect, she could now sense the presence of Voids.</p>
<p><a id="page-40"/>This was why Sakuya had rushed to the pier, where she’d encountered the elf girl.</p>
<p><em>Those were definitely Voids last night.</em></p>
<p>Yet they hadn’t come out of tears in space like most of their kind did. Those monsters had emerged from freight containers.</p>
<p><em>An imperial warship smuggled Voids into the city, hidden in crates…?</em></p>
<p>It was baffling.</p>
<p><em>Maybe the army collected Void specimens for research purposes?</em></p>
<p>Sakuya had never heard of a successful attempt at capturing Voids. The army had snared a few weaker ones, but they all disappeared into cracks in space.</p>
<p>And then there was the matter of the masked figure who had appeared in the middle of the battle…</p>
<p>“What about the so-called Dark Lord?” Sakuya asked the Murakumo operative.</p>
<p>“My apologies. I ordered Kuroyuki and Reigetsu to look into it, but they’ve yet to turn up anything.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, it’s fine. I doubt it’d be easy to catch that figure.”</p>
<p>“However…,” Eika continued, looking up. “I’m not sure if there’s any direct correlation, but there’s been a change in the demi-human anti-imperial organizations’ activities over the last couple of weeks.”</p>
<p>“The terrorist cell that branched off from the capital’s extremist group?”</p>
<p>Some time ago, insurgents called the Sovereign Wolves had hijacked the imperial royal family’s ship, the <em>Hyperion</em>. However, a group of Holy Swordsmen on board (including Sakuya) interfered with their plan. Their leader, Bastea Colossuf, died in the incident, and the Sovereign Wolves were scattered.</p>
<p>Recently, it seemed they had gathered under someone else, who had rallied them once again.</p>
<p><a id="page-41"/>“And you think this new leader of theirs is this so-called Dark Lord controlling the Seventh Assault Garden from the shadows?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s only conjecture, but…”</p>
<p>“I see,” Sakuya said, placing a finger on her pale lips as she recalled the Dark Lord’s visage.</p>
<p>Massive Voids of A rank required a platoon-sized force to eliminate, and this Dark Lord had done so on his own. His power was overwhelming. Such strength was only possible with a Holy Sword…or a Demon Sword. Regardless, why would anyone with that level of might waste their time leading petty terrorists…?</p>
<p>But just then, the birdsong in the courtyard stopped.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Sakuya wheeled around as a heavy presence manifested in the nearby thicket.</p>
<p>“Who’s there?!” Eika demanded, drawing a dagger from her sleeve and throwing it at the intruder.</p>
<p>The knife scattered a few leaves but didn’t find purchase.</p>
<p>“The Murakumo is a far cry from its glory days.” A voice spoke from atop a maple tree. “To think you’d allow me to enter this estate. Shameful.”</p>
<p>Standing on a branch was a tall figure completely covered in black armor.</p>
<p><em>…Is that an anti-Void protect suit?!</em></p>
<p>Sakuya glared at the figure, her hand reaching for the grip of her katana.</p>
<p>“You…!” Eika growled at the figure as she reached into her sleeve to hurl another knife.</p>
<p>“Eika, wait.” Sakuya stopped her.</p>
<p>“Your Highness…?”</p>
<p>Calmly, Sakuya questioned, “You’re from the Kenki Gathering, aren’t you?”</p>
<p><a id="page-42"/>“Indeed, Princess Sakuya,” a mechanically modified voice replied as the helmet’s eyes glowed red.</p>
<p>“The Kenki Gathering?!” Eika raised her voice in surprise. “But why would you come here…?!”</p>
<p>The Kenki Gathering was an armed group that had served the Sakura Orchid’s royal family for two centuries. While the Murakumo mainly was in charge of intelligence and espionage, the Kenki Gathering were the guards proper.</p>
<p>After the Sakura Orchid was destroyed by the Voids nine years ago, the Kenki Gathering became a group of wandering mercenaries seeking revenge for their fallen homeland. They traveled the world, fighting and slaying Voids wherever they could.</p>
<p>People would often liken Holy Swordsmen from the Sakura Orchid to berserkers, a comparison based on the Sakura Orchid’s traditional combat style, which paid no heed to the fear of death.</p>
<p>“What did you come here for?!” Eika demanded. “You already parted ways with the royal family!”</p>
<p>“I came to warn you,” the voice replied briefly. “The Voids approach. The Seventh Assault Garden will become a battlefield.”</p>
<p>“What?” Sakuya was bewildered for a moment, and then her eyes widened in realization. “Don’t tell me you were the ones who smuggled the Voids into the city?”</p>
<p>The figure did not answer. Whether that was denial or affirmation, none could say.</p>
<p>“Answer me. Depending on what you say, I might not allow you to leave this place,” Sakuya declared, allowing a surge of electricity to run over Raikirimaru’s blade.</p>
<p>“As the orphaned child of the royal house, we wish for you to take part in this fight, Princess Sakuya,” the figure replied.</p>
<p>“Join your battle? Explain yourself…”</p>
<p>“I am only here to report our return to you, Princess Sakuya. I <a id="page-43"/>cannot reveal our plans here, with these bothersome flies buzzing about.” The man in the protector suit laughed with a shrill voice. “I will speak to you again when you are alone, Princess Sakuya.”</p>
<p>The figure then leaped away from the tree and faded like a shadow in the dark.</p>
<p>“Wait!” Eika made to go after him, but he was already gone.</p>
<p>This was a member of the Kenki Gathering, after all. He must have had an escape route planned well ahead of time.</p>
<p>“The Seventh Assault Garden will become a battlefield…?” Sakuya whispered the figure’s words again and bit her lip.</p>
<p><em>Voids are coming. That much is clear.</em></p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this was related to the Void attack on the pier.</p>
<p><em>I have to stop this from happening…</em></p>
<p>The Kenki Gathering—a group of demons, possessed by a maddened urge for vengeance toward the Voids. They were going to bring something terrible upon this city.</p>
<p><em>But what do I do…?!</em></p>
<p>And as that urgent question filled her heart, <em>a particular image</em> flashed in Sakuya’s mind.</p>

<p class="space-break1">The Seventh Assault Garden had a massive, uninhabited float attached to the fourth industrial area. While the enormous city supported over one million people, a fourth of it was still undeveloped compared to the scale planned initially for the Assault Garden project. At one point, this section of the fourth industrial area was going to be an urban zone, and it still had many laminated structures.</p>
<p>Gathered in an underground space beneath those structures were some forty silhouettes. They were a very unusual group, for all <a id="page-44"/>of them were wearing anti-Void suits. One was speaking to someone through a communicator.</p>
<p>“That’s right. The cargo you sent us is all gone.”</p>
<p>“This won’t get in the way of completing the plan, right?” another figure inquired.</p>
<p><span class="san">“Those were just sent as an experiment,”</span> an encrypted voice answered through the communicator. <span class="san">“You people are the crux of this plan.”</span></p>
<p>“We’re grateful for your help, but we don’t need those things,” Uzan, the leader of the Kenki Gathering, said bitterly.</p>
<p>The man was regarded as the strongest Holy Swordsman in the Sakura Orchid.</p>
<p><em>But that’s a thing of the past now.</em> He scowled unpleasantly beneath his helmet.</p>
<p>To take revenge on the Voids that had ruined his homeland, he’d thrown himself into combat. He’d sacrificed everything to slay his nemesis—that Void Lord.</p>
<p>And now he was on the cusp of making that wish come true.</p>
<p>“Lord Phillet, we will do as we please from now on.”</p>
<p><span class="san">“Of course, go ahead. This is your revenge, after all,”</span> the voice on the other side of the transmission replied with a laugh.</p>
<p>Uzan’s comrades—the Kenki Gathering—totaled thirty-seven members. Each was resolved to make a sacrifice that would claim their own lives and those of the Seventh Assault Garden’s civilians.</p>
<p><em>And when our long-awaited wish comes true, we will all surely fall to hell.</em></p>
<p>In ninety-eight hours’ time, a Stampede would destroy the city. That future was already set in stone.</p>
<p><em>Hopefully, Princess Sakuya will agree to join our side…</em></p>
<p>But then, abruptly, the sounds of footsteps could be heard echoing through the abandoned building.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p><a id="page-45"/>In response, the members of the Kenki Gathering all kneeled as one, including Uzan. The sounds of the approaching figure were the only thing that disturbed the gloomy silence. A young woman approached, clad in a pure white outfit. Her long, waist-length blue hair wavered with each step.</p>
<p>“Princess Setsura…!”</p>
<p>“The time has come,” the girl stated, her voice as clear as the chiming of a bell. “The Kenki Gathering will strike down our sworn foe—Shardark Void Lord.”</p>
<p>The Kenki Gathering raised their voices in a war cry.</p>
