<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter012">THE DARK LORD EXPLORES THE SAKURA ORCHID</a></h1>
<p class="noindent">One day, nine years ago, a red star appeared in the sky. It formed quite irregularly, without reason or regard for the turn of the heavens. The empire called it the Star of Calamity. The Sakura Orchid named it the Star of Misfortune.</p>
<p>When it formed, the sky split in two, and Voids spilled from the massive fissure in space. This cataclysmic rush of Voids washed over the Sakura Orchid, destroying its capital and devouring its people.</p>
<p>Amid the chaos, two girls—one six, the other thirteen—raced through the burning streets. The sisters looked very similar, with their striking blue hair.</p>
<p>“Sister…I…I can’t run any longer!”</p>
<p>Young Sakuya fell over, rolling over the rubble.</p>
<p>“On your feet.” Her older sister turned around and grabbed her arm tight. “If you don’t keep moving, the Voids will kill you.”</p>
<p>“But is there anywhere to go? Mother and Father, they’re…they’re already… Nnng…”</p>
<p>Sakuya balled her hands and started weeping.</p>
<p>“The strongest of our land, the Kenki Gathering, are still alive. For now, we must reach Raiou—”</p>
<p><a id="page-86"/>Setsura cut herself short and looked around. Sakuya followed her gaze and spied a lone figure. He was a tall, dashing man with long blond hair. A patch covered his left eye, and he wore a long coat. In his hands was a single-edged broadsword.</p>
<p>It was obvious from his appearance that he wasn’t from the Sakura Orchid. Even more peculiar was how he stood in the middle of the hellish scene without the slightest concern.</p>
<p>“So you two are the Priestesses of the Twin Gods.”</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>The stranger lifted his weapon and approached them slowly, an oily miasma rising around his body. He had the same horrifying presence as those monsters…</p>
<p>“Sakuya, run,” Setsura instructed, spreading out her arms to shield her sister. “If nothing else, you have to—”</p>
<p>“No, sister…!”</p>
<p>Blood was scattered through the air like petals from a wilting tree. Setsura’s body went flying, and then hit the ground hard.</p>
<p>“No… Nooo! Sisterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!”</p>
<p>A crimson puddle formed on the shattered flagstones. Sakuya hurried over to her sister and took her hand.</p>
<p>“Saku…ya… No… R-run…”</p>
<p>As Sakuya clung to Setsuna, sobbing, a large shadow eclipsed her.</p>
<p>“Priestesses of the Twin Gods, I must eliminate all of the Goddess Factors without exception.”</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>“You…” Sakuya’s eyesight, blurred by tears as it was, focused on the monster lording over her. “Who are you? Why? Why did you do this to Setsura?!”</p>
<p>“The emptiness has no name,” the one-eyed man said coldly. “But once… Long ago, I was known as Shardark.”</p>
<p><a id="page-87"/>“Shardark…” Sakuya mouthed his name like a curse. “That’s… That’s your name…”</p>
<p>But what did learning it achieve? After all, this nothingness in human form would claim her life in just a moment.</p>
<p>“If nothing else, priestess, I will ensure you die without pain.”</p>
<p>And then, that man—that monster—swung his sword down at Sakuya’s neck.</p>

<p class="space-break1">“Aaah…! Haah, haah…!”</p>
<p>Sakuya jolted awake in her room in Hræsvelgr dorm. Her sleeping gown clung to her skin from sweat.</p>
<p><em>It feels like it’s been a while since I dreamt of that day…</em></p>
<p>After wiping her forehead, Sakuya opened the curtains. It was still dark out, but the sunlight was just barely beginning to encroach on the night sky. Sakuya stood in front of her dresser mirror and undressed.</p>
<p>Examining herself, she got the feeling her modest bosom had grown a bit. A face that resembled her late older sister’s stared back at her from the glass. If Sakuya were to grow out her hair, she would surely be indistinguishable from Setsura.</p>
<p><em>What should I do?</em></p>
<p>Sakuya put on a bra, noting how it felt a bit tighter than it ought to, and heaved a sigh. The Kenki Gathering hadn’t contacted her since their first warning. Sakuya had sent Eika to search for their hideout, but she hadn’t had any luck thus far.</p>
<p>Naturally, Sakuya had no intention of going along with the Kenki Gathering’s plan. Regardless of their intentions, she couldn’t let them endanger this city’s populace.</p>
<p><a id="page-88"/>After failing to protect the Sakura Orchid, the Kenki Gathering became obsessed with vengeance.</p>
<p><em>And I’m no different</em>, Sakuya reminded herself bitterly.</p>
<p>After all, her body was a vessel, the same power of emptiness that the monsters she swore to vanquish used.</p>
<p><em>I wish I could’ve convinced him…</em></p>
<p>The Kenki Gathering was a group of powerful Holy Swordsmen. Sakuya stood no chance against them on her own. Regrettably, she had failed to convince the Dark Lord to render aid. Sakuya simply couldn’t accept his conditions. She was willing to give herself to him, but turning over the people of the Sakura Orchid left her no option but to refuse.</p>
<p><em>Maybe I should consider myself lucky he didn’t simply kill me right then and there.</em></p>
<p>If he’d wanted, that Dark Lord likely could’ve done it easily.</p>
<p><em>He was more gentlemanly than I expected, though. Or maybe he has something else in mind…</em></p>
<p>As she thought on it, Sakuya donned the white garb of her homeland—a memento of her sister.</p>
<p>“Setsura, please… Watch over the Sakura Orchid.”</p>

<p class="space-break1">“Mm… Ah…”</p>
<p>It was early morning. Having gotten plenty of sleep, Leonis awakened and rubbed his bleary eyes. When he opened the curtain and peered outside, he saw Sakuya practicing with her sword.</p>
<p><em>It’s about time I get going…</em></p>
<p>Leonis slipped out of bed and crept quietly from the room to keep from waking Riselia.</p>
<p><em>Yesterday certainly was a spectacular failure.</em></p>
<p><a id="page-89"/>As he descended the staircase, Leonis let out a disappointed exhale. It wasn’t the matter with Sakuya that vexed him, but the body double he’d left at Tessera’s birthday party.</p>
<p>After concluding his matters in the castle, Leonis had returned to the orphanage at once to relieve Dorug. But during his one-hour absence, the Champion of Rognas had managed to mess things up quite spectacularly.</p>
<p>When Dorug was informed that people sing and give presents at birthday celebrations, he launched into the Dark Fanfare. The tune’s lyrics praised the Dark Lords’ Armies. Even worse, he performed the entire song with great enthusiasm and wholly off key.</p>
<p>Just remembering the awkward atmosphere Leonis had walked into when he got back made him wish he could bury himself.</p>
<p>“E-everyone has things they’re bad at, Leo!” Riselia had said, clearly hoping to console him.</p>
<p>“That’s right!” Regina agreed. “Let’s go to a karaoke place and practice together, okay, kid?”</p>
<p>“I—I was happy you sang for me, Leo…,” Tessera admitted bashfully.</p>
<p>But their every attempt at encouragement was another twist of the knife.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Arle had apparently disappeared after eating some food. Perhaps she’d feared Riselia and the others might catch and interrogate her if she remained too long.</p>
<p><em>I suppose that’s the only silver lining here.</em></p>
<p>Had she remained and heard Dorug sing the Dark Fanfare, it would have exposed Leonis’s identity.</p>
<p><em>Damn you, Dorug! I should take away that Ironblood Death Medal I gave you for your service in the Siege of Zaras!</em></p>
<p>Leonis made his way to the concourse outside the dormitory. He could hear the sound of something cutting through the air. <a id="page-90"/>And standing under an artificial broadleaf tree, made for purifying sweet water, was…</p>
<p>“Haaaaaaa!”</p>
<p>Sakuya held Raikirimaru at the ready. Her blade flashed several times, slicing through multiple leaves that had dropped from branches before they touched the ground.</p>
<p><em>This is quite hackneyed, as training goes.</em></p>
<p>Upon close inspection, however, the fallen leaves were elaborately cut into the shapes of animals and geometric petals.</p>
<p><em>…Her swordsmanship skills are far beyond Riselia’s.</em></p>
<p>“Who’s there?” Sakuya asked, turning around.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Miss Sakuya.” Leonis approached her and bowed politely.</p>
<p>“What is it, kid? You’re not usually up so early.”</p>
<p>“…Yes. Actually, I wanted to ask you for a favor.”</p>
<p>“A favor? And it’s one you want to keep secret from Miss Selia…” Sakuya paused and thought for a moment. “Is it something pervy?”</p>
<p>“No,” Leonis replied at once.</p>
<p><em>Is this girl sexually frustrated or something?</em></p>
<p>“It isn’t? I suppose I jumped to conclusions.”</p>
<p>“Very much so. Um, I’m supposed to take Tessera, a friend of mine from the orphanage, to the Sakura Orchid Festival. I was hoping you could introduce me to places in Old Town, so I could show her around.”</p>
<p>This was Leonis’s convenient excuse. His true objective was to gather information on the deities worshipped by the Sakura Orchid’s people. With any luck, it would provide clues to the goddess he sought.</p>
<p>There was also the matter of the group Sakuya had mentioned <a id="page-91"/>yesterday. Leonis couldn’t ignore that, and he thought that it might be better to inquire about it as himself and not the Dark Lord Zol Vadis.</p>
<p>“Oh, so you’re going to watch the enshrinement ritual?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve heard you’ll be performing there as a shrine maiden.”</p>
<p>“Well, yes. Though knowing you’ll be watching is a bit embarrassing…” Sakuya scratched her cheek. “But all right, I’ll show you around. I was planning to go back to the estate and practice the dance anyway.”</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break1">And so Leonis decided that he and Sakuya would meet after his morning lectures, so that Riselia wouldn’t scold him.</p>
<p>Sakuya didn’t have a vehicle license, and so the pair had to take the shuttle bus to Old Town. They got off in the Area II Station, and walked the rest of the way there.</p>
<p>“Isn’t Miss Selia worried about you, though?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. My terminal has the guardian function installed on it, so she can track where I am.”</p>
<p>“…I see. Miss Selia is a bit overprotective, isn’t she?”</p>
<p>“Very,” Leonis replied.</p>
<p><em>“My lord, my lord—”</em> a voice abruptly called in his mind.</p>
<p>Shary was watching Leonis from somewhere. Looking around, he spotted a girl in a maid’s outfit standing atop a nearby building. It was a conspicuous spot, but Shary had concealed her presence, so most people wouldn’t notice her.</p>
<p><em>“Is something wrong, Shary?”</em></p>
<p><em>“No, it’s just that if you wanted to investigate the area, I could’ve done it for you.”</em></p>
<p><a id="page-92"/>…It seemed she didn’t feel comfortable with Leonis coming here himself. Even at this distance, he spotted her puffing up her cheeks in an adorable pout.</p>
<p><em>“I don’t doubt your abilities. I simply think there are some things you can only understand by seeing the place yourself,”</em> Leonis explained.</p>
<p><em>“…I see. As prudent as ever, my lord,”</em> Shary replied sagely and bowed from her perch on the rooftop. <em>“So you wish to find the best sweet shops based on your personal taste.”</em></p>
<p>“No, that’s not it,” Leonis unintentionally responded aloud.</p>
<p>“What isn’t it, kid?” Sakuya, who was walking beside Leonis, cast a confused look at him.</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing,” Leonis said evasively.</p>
<p>Before long, they arrived at the gate leading into Old Town. The atmosphere beyond felt like that of an entirely different world. There were still some skyscrapers, but there were far more wooden buildings along the road.</p>
<p>“Once you cross through, you’ll be in the Sakura Orchid’s self-governed area,” Sakuya pointed out.</p>
<p>She and Leonis held up their ID cards and entered.</p>
<p>“Were these buildings relocated from the Sakura Orchid?” Leonis inquired.</p>
<p>“No, they were built here,” Sakuya replied sadly. “The capital was completely razed in the Stampede nine years ago. Only the shrine and the worship stone were salvaged.”</p>
<p>Leonis lowered his head. “…I’m sorry. That was an insensitive question.”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t worry. For a young boy, you’re very considerate.” Sakuya giggled, seemingly amused. “Now, let’s go. And be careful, there are vehicles running…”</p>
<p>She took Leonis’s hand and pulled him along.</p>
<p>“M-Miss Sakuya, you don’t have to hold my hand.”</p>
<p><a id="page-93"/>“Heh-heh. What, are you that embarrassed to hold hands with a girl?”</p>
<p>“…Yes,” Leonis responded, his cheeks a bit red.</p>
<p>“Well, you’ll get used to it. Now, let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Huh, wait—Miss Sakuya!”</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break1">“The main road leads right to the shrine,” Sakuya said while she guided Leonis down the street.</p>
<p>At first, he was embarrassed to have her hold his hand in public, but as she’d stated, he grew accustomed to it quickly. A boy being led by someone older on a busy street wasn’t that unusual.</p>
<p><em>…I guess I’m just being overly self-conscious.</em></p>
<p>Sakuya looked like she was moving at a relaxed pace, but in truth, she had adjusted her steps to match Leonis’s. It suggested a more mature side to the young woman that Leonis hadn’t recognized in her previously.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of people,” he noted, looking around.</p>
<p>There weren’t quite as many passersby as there had been the other day, when he’d shown Veira, the Dragon Lord, around the Central Garden’s amusement area. Still, the pedestrian traffic was quite active. He spotted no small number of people in Excalibur Academy uniforms.</p>
<p>“Yes, the atmosphere is a lot calmer than in Central Garden. There are many general stores and confectionaries here, too, so it’s a popular spot.”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p><em>No wonder Shary gave me so many reports about this area in particular.</em></p>
<p>As they walked on, Leonis noticed something else that surprised him.</p>
<p><a id="page-94"/>“Most people here aren’t dressed the same way you are.”</p>
<p>Shopkeepers were dressed in Sakura Orchid traditional attire, but most of those walking around weren’t.</p>
<p>“The majority of the people here work in the city center,” Sakuya explained.</p>
<p><em>Ah, that stands to reason.</em></p>
<p>After continuing along the main street for a bit, Leonis and Sakuya arrived at a circular plaza with a fountain. Standing in front of the water feature was a statue fashioned after a wolf.</p>
<p><em>Is this some manner of gargoyle?</em> Leonis wondered. He sensed no mana coming from it, however, so it had to be an ordinary sculpture.</p>
<p>Noticing Leonis’s gaze, Sakuya said, “Wolves are worshipped in the Sakura Orchid as guardian beasts. The shrine has at least twenty-four of them.”</p>
<p>She then patted the statue affectionately on the head.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t it remind you of Fluffymaru the Black?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Hmm…” It honestly didn’t, but Leonis only offered a vague muttering in response. “Speaking of, why did you call that dog Fluffymaru the Black?”</p>
<p>“I call most fluffy things Fluffymaru,” Sakuya answered, holding up an index finger for some reason.</p>
<p>“So if you find a sponge…”</p>
<p>“I call it Fluffymaru, yes.”</p>
<p>“And if you have a feather pillow…”</p>
<p>“That’s Fluffymaru, too!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Leonis concluded it would be for the best to simply not think about it.</p>
<p>“By the way, boy, are you hungry yet?”</p>
<p><a id="page-95"/>“Yes, a little.”</p>
<p>He’d had breakfast, but they’d walked for a while, so he was beginning to feel peckish.</p>
<p><em>This body is so inefficient.</em></p>
<p>“It’s still too early for lunch, so let’s have a snack in that shop, shall we?” proposed Sakuya.</p>
<p>“Yes. But keep it a secret from Miss Selia, would you?”</p>
<p>She would scold him if she heard he had a snack before lunch.</p>
<p>“Very well. It’ll be our secret.” Sakuya closed one eye in a wink and brought a finger to her lips.</p>
<p>And so Leonis and Sakuya entered a confectionary store near the plaza and bought a treat called taiyaki. This was one sweet Shary had taken quite a liking to, and she often brought a few to Leonis as souvenirs from her investigations.</p>
<p>“So this fish-shaped snack is originally from the Sakura Orchid,” Leonis remarked as they sat on a bench in the plaza.</p>
<p>Sakuya tore her taiyaki in two and then offered its head to Leonis.</p>
<p>“…?” Leonis looked at her, taken aback.</p>
<p>“I’ll offer you half of my chocolate taiyaki for half of your custard one. Deal?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, deal,” Leonis agreed, splitting his own taiyaki in half and handing its head over to Sakuya.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh, I always wanted to try both of them together. I can’t exactly do this alone, after all,” Sakuya said, pressing the head and the body of the two different taiyaki together in an attempt to make a whole.</p>
<p>“…That’s kind of childish, Sakuya,” Leonis commented, cracking a wry smile as he took a bite out of his own taiyaki.</p>
<p>The flavorful cream melted in his mouth.</p>
