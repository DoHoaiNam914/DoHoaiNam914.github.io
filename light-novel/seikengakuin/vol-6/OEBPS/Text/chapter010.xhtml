<p>“Why not go, kid?” Regina suggested, a small smile on her lips. “The rest of the platoon will be attending to watch Sakuya’s dance.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I suppose I should, then.” Leonis accepted. He was interested in this Sakura Orchid ritual. He’d never visited the Sakura Orchid’s sector himself, and most importantly, he wanted to know more about this ancient god they revered. “I think I’d like to go.”</p>
<p>Tessera let out a small cheer at Leonis’s confirmation. “Then let’s all meet up tomorrow and go there.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Yet just as Leonis nodded, he received a telepathic message from Shary.</p>
<p><em>“—M-my lord, my lord! There’s an emergency!”</em></p>
<p><em>“What’s wrong, Shary?”</em></p>
<p><em>“There’s an unidentified intruder in the Dark Lord’s Castle!”</em></p>
<p><em>“…What?”</em></p>
