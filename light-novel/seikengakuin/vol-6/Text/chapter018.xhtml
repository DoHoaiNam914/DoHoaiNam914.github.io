<p class="space-break1">They took the shuttle bus to the orphanage, met up with Tessera, and then took another bus to Old Town. The evening sun was already dipping below the city walls, and a faint darkness was beginning to dye the sky. Like Leonis, Tessera was dressed in a child’s yukata. Leonis thought it was a rented one, like his, but as it turned out, it was handmade by Phrenia.</p>
<p>They got off at the Sector Two station near Old Town and headed to the gate on foot. It was hard to walk in the wooden clogs, but apparently, they were part of the festival’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>Naturally, there were far more people around than there had been two days ago. And since it was a day off, there were many students. Leonis recognized this because plenty of them were walking around in their uniforms.</p>
<p>“…I thought wearing yukatas was part of the rules here?” Leonis said, casting a suspicious glare in Riselia’s direction.</p>
<p>“I—I wanted to see you in a yukata!” Riselia confessed, unable to look Leonis in the eye.</p>
<p>The main street was lit with mana lanterns, and the sounds of the festival musicians grew gradually louder. Many stalls were set up along the streets, giving the place a very different feel.</p>
<p>“There sure are a lot of people around here,” Riselia remarked quietly.</p>
<p>“Yeah. We should take care not to get separated,” Leonis said, offering Tessera his arm.</p>
<p>“Huh? L-Leo…? Um…” Tessera bashfully took his hand, her face flushing as she lowered her head. “Th-thank you…”</p>
<p><a id="page-124"></a>Riselia took his other hand. “Make sure you don’t get lost, either, Leo.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine. I have my communication terminal with me.”</p>
<p>“No,” she chided firmly. “Some bad grown-up might decide to snatch you.”</p>
<p>“…I doubt that.”</p>
<p>Tessera giggled as she watched their exchange.</p>
<p>“Look at you, kid, so popular <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>,” Regina teased, poking him on the back of his neck.</p>
<p>Leonis frowned. “S-stop that, please.”</p>
<p>“Ah, look at that! It’s so cute…” Riselia had stopped and was looking at one of the stalls.</p>
<p><em>If anything’s cute here, it’s you</em>, Leonis thought for some reason. His minion’s eyes were fixed on candied apples and mandarins. It was exactly the sort of sweet one might expect a girl to like.</p>
<p>“No, if anything’s cute here, it’s you, Lady Selia,” Regina needled.</p>
<p>“…R-Regina, what are you saying?!”</p>

<p class="space-break1">Arle Kirlesio perused the streets beneath the glow of the mana lanterns.</p>
<p><em>What a lively festival this is. Even though the world is being overrun by unknown monsters…</em></p>
<p>The excitement of this bright celebration was something she would never have known in her forest. Elves had their own festivals, of course, but they were much more austere and quiet affairs. Arle felt ill at ease in this crowd.</p>
<p>Why was she there, then? That was quite simple—the Dark Lord Zol Vadis had ordered the Demon Wolf Pack here to keep a watchful eye for terrorists that might attack.</p>
<p><a id="page-125"></a>When Lena told her of their mission, Arle had wanted to remind the dark elf that they were terrorists, too, but she managed to stop herself.</p>
<p>“I will admit the food stalls are nice, though…”</p>
<p>As she ate fried noodles she’d bought from one of the vendors, Arle looked around the area. An elf’s sense of hearing was keen enough to pick up on conversations even in places packed with people.</p>
<p>But then, suddenly, her gaze settled on a girl dressed in white. She was strolling through the crowd like a ghost. Her hair was a vivid blue, and her face was concealed behind a mask. Perhaps she’d bought it at one of the stalls? It hardly made her inconspicuous, yet no one seemed aware of her presence.</p>
<p><em>That blue hair…</em></p>
<p>Arle immediately recalled the swordswoman she’d encountered at the pier a few days ago. Had her hair been so long, though?</p>
<p><em>…Why? Something about that girl feels…</em></p>
<p>Sensing something ominous from the masked young woman, Arle resolved to follow her.</p>
<p><em>…Huh?</em></p>
<p>Yet before she had the chance, the girl disappeared into the crowd.</p>

<p class="space-break1">Leonis and his group went around the plaza, enjoying the cotton candy and candy apples they bought.</p>
<p>“Oh, there’s a target shooting stall there. I’m good at that!” Regina said happily, tugging on Leonis’s sleeve.</p>
<p>“I’d imagine you are,” he replied.</p>
<p>“Can I try it, Lady Selia?”</p>
<p><a id="page-126"></a>Riselia nodded with a bit of a forced smile. “Go ahead…”</p>
<p>Apparently, this was a game where one was meant to knock down prizes with a toy gun.</p>
<p>“Which one do you want, Tessera?” Regina asked as she stuffed a cork bullet into the barrel.</p>
<p>“Umm. I want that…stuffed bear…”</p>
<p>“The stuffed bear? It’s a bit large, but I’ll get it for you!”</p>
<p>Regina closed an eye and held up the gun. Suddenly, her expression changed from a girl enjoying a festival to that of a sagacious sharpshooter.</p>
<p>“Anti-Large Aerial Beast Extermination Weapon—Dragon Slayer!” With that cry of enthusiasm, she pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>The cork bullet whizzed through the air and hit the stuffed bear right between the eyes—but the bear only wobbled in place.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I hit it! I did!”</p>
<p>“Missy, hitting it isn’t enough. You have to knock it down, too,” the person managing the stall said with a grin.</p>
<p>“…Mm. Fine,” Regina replied as she loaded the toy gun again. “How about this, then?!”</p>
<p><em>Pop! Pop!</em></p>
<p>She fired two shots, both of which struck the exact same spot seconds apart from each other. But once again, the stuffed toy only wobbled slightly.</p>
<p>“Regina, maybe you should just give up…,” Riselia told her.</p>
<p>“Not yet, Lady Selia! I’ll try to calculate the right angle this time—”</p>
<p>“Let me try,” Leonis interjected, lowering her arms and taking the gun away.</p>
<p>“Kid…”</p>
<p>“Leo?”</p>
<p><a id="page-127"></a>The two girls looked at him curiously, but Leonis only nodded and loaded a cork bullet into the barrel. The stall keeper sneered at him.</p>
<p><em>Devil’s bullet, gouge through fate itself…</em></p>
<p>He fired a shot charged with a bit of mana, which hit a can sitting on the edge of the shelf. A miss…at least normally. However, the bullet quickly rebounded, hitting a nearby prize. It wobbled, veered sideways, and hit the adjacent prize, and then the prize next to it, and the prize next to that, too. Eventually it hit the stall’s pillar, deflected again, and hit the stuffed bear directly.</p>
<p>Like Regina’s attempts, the bear didn’t fall. The cork dropped to the ground, bounced, and shot toward the bear again. It repeated this twice, thrice, four times, five times, six. The miracle looped over and over, and the single-bullet barrage eventually knocked the bear off the shelf.</p>
<p>“Phew, that was a difficult shot,” Leonis remarked with a shrug as he returned the toy gun.</p>
<p>“L-Leo, that was amazing…!” Tessera said, her eyes wide with respect and awe.</p>
<p>“N-not bad, kid…,” Regina added, obviously amazed.</p>
<p>Riselia did notice he’d used sorcery but only cracked a smile, seemingly content to overlook it.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s that. Now, let’s collect the prize—”</p>
<p>“S-stop screwing with me!” the stall keeper bellowed at them. “That made no sense! You cheated!”</p>
<p>Tessera fearfully hid behind Leonis.</p>
<p>“If anyone’s cheating, it’s you,” Leonis countered, pointing at the prize shelf.</p>
<p>There was a rod where the stuffed bear had been, and the toy had been caught on it, keeping it from falling.</p>
<p>“…Y-you brat!”</p>
<p><a id="page-128"></a>Angered at having his fraud exposed, the man grabbed Leonis by his yukata’s collar.</p>
<p>Leonis sneered coldly. “Oho? So you wish to experience the terror of death…”</p>
<p>“Wh-what…?” the man replied, his face contorting in anger.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a sharp voice cut into their exchange.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? I ask that you refrain from resorting to violence.”</p>
<p>Leonis turned around and saw a black-haired girl approaching.</p>
<p>“Miss Finé!” Riselia exclaimed happily.</p>
<p>Elfiné was moving through the crowd. She had the Executive Committee’s band on her arm and was accompanied by two orbs.</p>
<p>“Miss Elfiné, what are you doing here?” Leonis asked.</p>
<p>“The Executive Committee asked me to help manage the festival,” she explained. “I often get called to assist with security during events like this.”</p>
<p><em>…That makes sense.</em></p>
<p>Her Eye of the Witch’s power was quite useful for such large-scale celebrations. Long-distance communications, guiding refugees, finding lost children, watching suspicious figures, and…stopping brawls. Elfiné could cover quite the large area with all eight of her orbs active.</p>
<p>Of course, since Elfiné was only one person, she still needed the assistance of others to handle everything.</p>
<p>“So what’s happening here? Why would you raise a hand to a child…?” Elfiné questioned, cocking an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Ah, well… Hm…” The man hurriedly released Leonis.</p>
<p>“He was trying to cheat people out of their money,” Leonis said, pointing at the shelf.</p>
<p>“…?” Elfiné followed his gaze and quickly realized what had happened.</p>
<p>“No, um, well…,” the man fumbled.</p>
<p><a id="page-129"></a>“We’ll hear what you have to say at headquarters. For now, your business is suspended,” Elfiné stated, placing a sticker that declared as much on the stall’s sign. “Thank you for your cooperation, everyone.”</p>
<p>She bowed her head to Leonis and the rest of the group and left with the dejected man.</p>
<p>“Wow, Miss Finé looks busy,” Riselia commented.</p>
<p>Regina nodded and replied, “I’d bet. Let’s stop by headquarters later and bring her a snack from the festival.”</p>
<p>“Here you go, Tessera.” Leonis had picked up the plush bear and was handing it to the girl.</p>
<p>“Th-thank you, Leo!” Although blushing, the nine-year-old accepted it happily and hugged the bear tight.</p>

<p class="space-break1">Leonis looked around, keeping his eyes out for any trouble. He and the others strolled down the main street toward where Sakuya’s dance would be held.</p>
<p>Riselia pointed at a crowd that formed ahead. “Look over there. Did something happen?”</p>
<p>The people were cheering at something.</p>
<p>“It must be a street performance. Let’s check it out,” replied Regina.</p>
<p>“Good idea.” Riselia turned to look at Tessera, who nodded in consent. Set in the middle of the ring of audience members was a large umbrella, with entertainers standing under it.</p>
<p><em>…Let’s see how these performers match up to my skeleton circus</em>, Leonis thought as he wove through the throng to get a better look.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Immediately, his expression tensed. There were two familiar faces performing.</p>
<p><a id="page-130"></a>A girl in a yukata stood under the umbrella, juggling daggers and balls skillfully, with a rather blank expression. And sitting by her side was a large black wolf, balancing a large ball on its nose.</p>
<p><em>…Shary and Blackas?!</em></p>
<p>As the audience showered them with applause, Leonis sent a telepathic message their way.</p>
<p><em>“What in the blasted hells are you two doing?!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Ah, my lord—”</em> Shary turned her head, noticing Leonis’s presence. <em>“You look very cute in that outfit, my lord!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Grr…forget about me. Just what are you doing here?”</em></p>
<p><em>“We’ve concluded that this disguise will be most effective for blending in,”</em> Blackas replied while keeping the ball balanced on his nose.</p>
<p><em>“No, I’d say you stand out quite a bit.”</em></p>
<p><em>“That is fine. We are, as they say, hiding in plain sight.”</em></p>
<p><em>“…Hm. I see.”</em></p>
<p>Blackas had a point. Rather than suspiciously clinging to the dark corners of the festival, operating where one wouldn’t suspect could be more effective.</p>
<p><em>“And we get so many sweets, too!”</em> Shary happily appended.</p>
<p>Set beneath them was a box, filled to the brim with assorted treats that onlookers had thrown in.</p>
<p><em>“…So that’s what you were after.”</em></p>
<p><em>“N-not at all, my lord! This is all in the name of camouflage—”</em></p>
<p><em>“Very well. Just report in if anything happens.”</em></p>
<p><em>“W-we will…!”</em></p>
<p>Even as she communicated with Leonis, Shary didn’t drop what she was juggling.</p>
<p>“That girl’s amazing,” Riselia praised as she clapped.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think she looks kind of familiar, though, Lady Selia?” Regina asked.</p>
