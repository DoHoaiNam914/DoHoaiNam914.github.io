<p class="noindent">The boy first met the man in a back alley in the slums.</p>
<p>“An orphan. I see…”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>That boy, covered in rags and kneeling in the muck, gazed up at the tall figure. He was handsome with beautiful blond hair. The man inspected the boy’s face. His armor was silver and his cloak, a pure white. A sword adorned with gold decorations hung at his hip.</p>
<p>“…Are you a knight?”</p>
<p>The boy quickly corrected his posture and fell prostrate. Knights were among the highest classes in the Rognas Kingdom, and if a young vagrant like him were to appear disrespectful to the knight, he was within his rights to cut him down where he stood.</p>
<p>But why would such a neat and proper swordsman call out to him…? The boy simply couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>“Your soul has a rare, exceptional color to it. The same color as mine—the soul of a hero.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p><a id="page-116"></a>The knight said something terribly strange.</p>
<p>“Oh, I can see the color of one’s soul. It’s one of my unique skills.”</p>
<p>“The color of one’s…soul…?” the boy repeated, dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“What of your family?” the man asked, placing a hand on the boy’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a family. My brother and sister died in the war.”</p>
<p>“—I see. Hearing that saddens me greatly. Our kingdom’s knights have failed you.”</p>
<p>“N-no, milord! Not at all…!” the boy insisted, alarmed.</p>
<p>He had the feeling this knight’s blue eyes could see right through him, down into his very core—and, indeed, his soul.</p>
<p>“How old are you?”</p>
<p>“I’m five… No, probably six.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever wielded a sword before?”</p>
<p>The boy shook his head. He’d never so much as held a real sword.</p>
<p>“Good, it’s better that way.” The man nodded, evidently satisfied. “You haven’t developed any needless habits, then.”</p>
<p>“Hm…?”</p>
<p>The boy’s face clouded over with confusion, but the man reached out to him and finally asked the question.</p>
<p>“Tell me, my boy—would you like to become a hero?”</p>

<p class="space-break1"><em>Beep beep beep beep beep…!</em></p>
<p>“…Ngh, who dares disturb this Dark Lord’s slumber?!”</p>
<p>Still half asleep, Leonis picked up his terminal, which was ringing, and threw it against the wall.</p>
<p>The device bounced and fell to the floor.</p>
<p><a id="page-117"></a>“…”</p>
<p>Leonis massaged his temples and sighed. It was almost dusk outside. Two days had passed since Sakuya had shown him around Old Town, making it the day of the enshrinement ritual. Excalibur Academy students were excused from classes today, so after he’d trained with Riselia this morning, Leonis had taken an afternoon nap.</p>
<p>He sat up in his bed, combing his fingers through his unruly hair.</p>
<p><em>What an unpleasant dream.</em></p>
<p>…It had been one of that man, of all things. Leonis’s teacher and the Swordmaster of the Six Heroes. Most of his memories of his days as a hero had faded… Why did he still have to see him in dreams?</p>
<p>Grimacing, Leonis got out of bed. It was almost time. He needed to get changed, pick Tessera up from the orphanage, and then make his way to Old Town.</p>
<p><em>…I just hope nothing out of the ordinary happens.</em></p>
<p>Leonis thought back to what Sakuya had told him.</p>
<p>Members of the Kenki Gathering, an elite group from the Sakura Orchid, had visited Sakuya. They had once been charged with protecting royalty, but like the rest of their people, they’d lost their homeland in the Void Stampede nine years ago.</p>
<p>And now, to exact revenge on the Void Lord responsible, they planned to cause another Stampede here in the Seventh Assault Garden. Sakuya had approached the Dark Lord Zol Vadis for help with stopping them.</p>
<p><em>This is my kingdom. I wasn’t going to let them have their way to begin with.</em></p>
<p>He currently had Shary and Blackas stationed in Old Town in case anything happened. Additionally, he’d dispatched the Demon <a id="page-118"></a>Wolf Pack to track the enemy’s movements. They hadn’t found any traces of them yet, though.</p>
<p><em>I’ll definitely need to strengthen my intelligence organization in the future.</em></p>
<p>Blackas was an offensive general who exhibited his full strength on the battlefield, and while Shary was talented in espionage, her true role was assassination and not gathering information. Some of the beastmen species were well suited for spying, but none of the ones working under Leonis had the dedicated skills required.</p>
<p><em>…At some point, I should recruit people skilled in this sort of thing.</em></p>
<p>A certain black-haired girl with a Holy Sword optimized for data gathering flashed in his mind, but then…</p>
<p>“Leo, are you awake? It’s time to go pick up Tessera.”</p>
<p>“Get ready and dress yourself, kid!”</p>
<p>Riselia and Regina called to him from the other side of the door.</p>

<p class="space-break1">“What do you think? Does this yukata look good on me?”</p>
<p>Regina entered and spun in place, showing off her outfit. It wasn’t her usual uniform, but a traditional Sakura Orchid outfit called a yukata. Hers was made of pale blue-green fabric and decorated with flower and butterfly patterns. Her hair wasn’t done in her usual pigtails. Instead it was tied in a single ponytail.</p>
<p>“H-hm…”</p>
<p>As Regina struck a pose, Leonis hastily averted his gaze. The yukata was very open around the chest and had a sizable slit on its hem. Honestly, it made for a tantalizing sight when a buxom girl like Regina wore it.</p>
<p><a id="page-119"></a>“Oh, what are you going red for, kid? Heh heh… <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>” Regina smiled after noticing Leonis’s flustered reaction.</p>
<p>She leaned forward and poked Leonis’s cheek with a finger.</p>
<p>“…!” He jumped.</p>
<p>Enduring this kind of teasing wounded his dignity as a Dark Lord. And so he turned around and gazed directly at Regina.</p>
<p>“…Hm? K-kid?”</p>
<p>Regina looked a bit confused now that he was staring at her.</p>
<p>“Yes, it suits you very well,” he muttered. “That hairdo is very cute on you, too.”</p>
<p>“Ah, really? I-it’s…cute?” Regina asked, going red.</p>
<p>“Of course, the way you usually look is very cute, too.”</p>
<p>“…Ahhhhh, y-you shouldn’t tease girls like that, kid.”</p>
<p>“I’m not. It’s how I really feel…”</p>
<p>“Y-you dummy! You big dumb dummy!” Regina shook her head, face scarlet. Her ponytail wagged side to side.</p>
<p>Regina was the kind of girl who couldn’t handle receiving compliments very well.</p>
<p>Leonis had meant every word he said, though. Regina truly did look cute. Reiterating as much would just make her more bashful, however, so Leonis decided not to.</p>
<p><em>…I dread to think what she might do if I push her too far.</em></p>
<p>This was Regina, after all, the one who held authority over their dinner menu.</p>
<p>“Lady Selia, it’s terrible! The kid is turning into a Dark Lord of the bedroom again!” In the face of an opponent she could not best, Regina went crying to her mistress.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, now stop fooling around and get ready, you two,” Riselia replied a bit absently.</p>
<p>“Get ready how?” Regina asked.</p>
<p>“Both Leo and I still need to change into our yukatas. Here’s <a id="page-120"></a>yours, Leo,” Riselia said, taking a neatly folded garment out of her bag. “I rented it from an apparel shop. It should be your size, Leo.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine going in my uniform,” Leonis protested.</p>
<p>“Out of the question. I want to see you in a—ahem, I mean that’s just how this festival works.”</p>
<p>“…Oh.”</p>
<p>Well, if there were rules, he wasn’t going to argue against them. Leonis accepted the yukata reluctantly.</p>
<p>“Am I supposed to just tie the waist sash however I want?” he questioned, spreading the yukata out and looking at it curiously.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, kid, I’ll help you,” Regina replied, placing her hands on Leonis’s shoulders.</p>
<p>“Y-you don’t have to. I can put it on by myself.”</p>
<p>“No, no, no. We don’t have that much time.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go get changed, then,” Riselia stated. “Regina, I’m counting on you to help Leo get dressed.”</p>
<p>“Understood, Lady Selia.”</p>
<p>Seeing Regina nod encouragingly, Riselia went to her bedroom. No sooner had the door clicked shut than Regina reached for Leonis’s shirt.</p>
<p>“Come on, kid, take off your uniform. Or do you want me to remove it for you?”</p>
<p>Realizing that resistance was futile in this situation, Leonis obediently did as he was told.</p>
<p>“Your pants, too,” Regina added.</p>
<p>“…I—I know! Just turn around already, Miss Regina!”</p>
<p>Once he was certain Regina wasn’t watching, Leonis swiftly took off his trousers and slipped into his yukata.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh, it looks good on you… Oh, you’ve got the collar on backward. It’s supposed to be like this. <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>”</p>
<p><a id="page-121"></a>The blond young woman fixed his collar and briskly tied the sash around his waist. Leonis offered no objection until she tightened the sash.</p>
<p>“M-Miss Regina… It’s too taut, I can’t breathe.”</p>
<p>He hadn’t felt this suffocated since the Mountain Devouring Dragon attacked Necrozoa and constricted him one thousand years ago.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to loosen it up a little?” Regina inquired, adjusting the sash. “But if it’s too loose, it might come undone.”</p>
<p>“Leo, are you ready?” The door opened, and Riselia walked in, now clad in her yukata.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Leonis swallowed despite himself. The sight of her in a yukata was quite breathtaking. Hers had black-and-white stripes with flower patterns, and she had her brilliant silver hair done up. This exposed the alluring lines of her neck, giving her usual chaste atmosphere a slightly more enticing feel.</p>
<p>“You look so pretty, Lady Selia!” Regina praised.</p>
<p>“Th-thanks, Regina,” Riselia answered, raising one large sleeve to cover her bashful expression.</p>
<p>“…You really do look pretty.” The words left Leonis’s lips naturally.</p>
<p>“…Boo. You sound more honest than when you complimented me,” Regina grumbled.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Leo. Yours looks great on you, too.” Riselia smiled, examining Leonis and nodding in satisfaction.</p>
<p>And then, she slammed her fist into her palm, like she’d just come up with a good idea.</p>
<p>“Oh, right! Let’s take a picture of Leo in this outfit!”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t I think of that? Wait here, I’ll go get the camera—” Regina made to take off.</p>
