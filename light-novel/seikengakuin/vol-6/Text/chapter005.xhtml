<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter005">THE KENKI GATHERING</a></h1>
<p class="noindent">A battle was underway in one of Excalibur Academy’s training areas.</p>
<p>“Lightning, gouge my foes—Vil Valut!”</p>
<p>Magical electricity wreathed the tip of Riselia’s crimson, shining blade. Riselia, wearing her training wear, swung the Bloody Sword, searing the air.</p>
<p>“Hm, so the Holy Sword, this supernatural power of yours, can also conduct spells. Interesting,” the skeletal mage instructing her remarked quietly as he thrust out the staff gripped in his bony hands.</p>
<p>The end of the staff shone and dispelled the lightning around the blade. The skeleton was Nefisgal, the Underworld’s Archmage, one of the Three Champions of Rognas, and a servant of Leonis.</p>
<p>“Well, it may help you blind an enemy, should the need arise,” Nefisgal commented.</p>
<p>“I-I’m not done yet!” Riselia called out.</p>
<p>She dashed forward, closing the distance between her and the skeleton. As she ran, the young woman intoned another spell.</p>
<p>“Sweep over all, raging blade of gales—Jiura Kires!”</p>
<p><a id="page-28"></a>Riselia’s swipe loosed an invisible blade of compressed air.</p>
<p>“The Vampire Queen’s power is indeed impressive,” Nefisgal praised as he batted Riselia’s attack away. “You already possess vast reserves of mana.”</p>
<p>The statement wasn’t an empty compliment for his liege’s minion. As the highest rank of undead, Riselia’s latent mana potential exceeded even that of an elder lich like Nefisgal.</p>
<p>“However…” The skeleton wagged a bony finger. “The composition of your spells is still lacking, leaving your abundance of mana as an untapped treasure. Of course, being able to learn first-order spells after just a few days of training is impressive enough.”</p>
<p>Nefisgal raised his staff again, and the space around Riselia twisted in response. This was a second-order gravity spell, the Gravity Distortion Field, Divan Zo.</p>
<p>“Aaah…!” Riselia cried as she lost her balance and was slammed hard against the training facility’s floor. “Khhk…!”</p>
<p>“N-Nefisgal, try to be gentler with her…!” Leonis, who’d been leaning against the wall and watching over the session, protested in concern.</p>
<p>“I-I’m fine… Leo…” Riselia rose to her feet with some effort, holding up the Bloody Sword. “Please, give me more!”</p>
<p>“You heard her, my lord. Shall I continue?” Nefisgal turned to Leonis, who cracked a forced smile and shrugged.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps I really am being overly protective of her.</em></p>
<p>Riselia was the one who’d requested that they teach her sorcery. Indeed, vampires mostly fought by weaving spells with their vast mana reserves. And under the tutelage of Leonis and Nefisgal, two accomplished sorcerers, Riselia matured at a fast pace.</p>
<p><em>She has genuine promise. One day I shall have her lead my followers as my right hand. And speaking of minions…</em></p>
<p>Leonis thought back to the night prior. Based on the report <a id="page-29"></a>Shary had given him earlier that day, the Demon Wolf Pack had plotted to steal weapons from the pier. But instead of arms and equipment, the containers were loaded with Voids.</p>
<p><em>But why?</em> Leonis pondered. <em>Why would Voids, enemies of humanity, be in a military harbor?</em></p>
<p>He’d never believed keeping Voids in captivity was possible. During the fight in the Third Assault Garden, Leonis had trapped a few in the Realm of Shadows, but they all dissipated like fog before long.</p>
<p><em>And then there’s the matter of Sakuya.</em></p>
<p>Why had she been there?</p>
<p><em>My word. It’s one answerless question after another.</em></p>
<p>Things had undoubtedly grown more complicated in the past one thousand years. Back then, might had been everything.</p>

<p class="space-break1">For the hour that followed, training continued until Riselia couldn’t keep going anymore.</p>
<p>“Truly, she is my lord’s minion. Her talent is as rare as it is astounding,” Nefisgal said.</p>
<p>“She is indeed remarkable,” Leonis agreed, nodding at the skeletal archmage’s words.</p>
<p>“However, her control over her mana still requires improvement,” Nefisgal continued.</p>
<p>“Well, I wouldn’t fault her for it. I struggled with it quite a bit when I just became an undead,” Leonis replied.</p>
<p>He hadn’t been especially proficient with sorcery during his time as a hero. And when he was first reborn as the Undead King by Roselia’s power, he had too much mana and simply wielded it for indiscriminate destruction.</p>
<p><a id="page-30"></a>“Lady Riselia’s greatest talents lie outside my field of expertise, so once she learns sorcery to an extent, it would be for the best for you to oversee her tutelage, my lord,” Nefisgal stated.</p>
<p>Leonis nodded again. “True.”</p>
<p>However, most of the magic Leonis knew was from the Realm of Death. The spells possessed eerie, ostentatious incantations, and Leonis imagined Riselia wouldn’t be happy to use them.</p>
<p>“Then, my lord, I will be off…” With his duties concluded, Nefisgal made to return to the Realm of Shadows.</p>
<p>“Yes, good work.”</p>
<p>Before the skeletal mage could leave, Riselia, who was lying on the ground, hurriedly stood.</p>
<p>“Th-thank you for all your guidance!” she called, bowing her head respectfully.</p>
<p>As rich young ladies went, Riselia had more sportsmanship than most.</p>
<p>“Good work today, Miss Selia,” Leonis said as he approached and handed her a sports drink.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Leo,” Riselia replied, taking a seat on the floor of the training room and downing the drink.</p>
<p>The sight of her supple legs in her sports outfit was quite tempting.</p>
<p><em>I’m not sure if an undead should look this healthy…</em></p>
<p>Leonis sat down next to his minion. “It looks like your sorcery training is progressing well,” he remarked.</p>
<p>Riselia seemed doubtful. “I-it is?”</p>
<p>“Usually, it takes three years to learn how to handle mana and four more to pick up sorcery. By comparison, you’re advancing very quickly.”</p>
<p>“It feels kind of strange,” Riselia admitted, gazing down at her hands. “Using mana like this…”</p>
<p><a id="page-31"></a>“For the time being, you’re only capable of elementary magic,” Leonis explained. “But since you’re a Vampire Queen, you’ll grow to cast sorcery of up to the seventh order.”</p>
<p>“Order?”</p>
<p>“Spells are generally divided into orders. The higher one is, the more advanced its incantation becomes, and higher spells are stronger.”</p>
<p>“What’s the, um, highest order of spells you can cast, Leo?” Riselia asked.</p>
<p>“Me? Well… That’s a secret.” Leonis shook his head.</p>
<p>“Hmm…” Riselia stared at him fixedly and reached out with her hands.</p>
<p>“M-Miss Selia? Nng, h-hey, stop that…!”</p>
<p>Her cold fingertips tickled at his sides.</p>
<p>“…S-stop… Please stop that, Miss Selia! Fine, fine! The ninth order, I can cast spells up to the ninth order!” Left with no alternative, Leonis confessed.</p>
<p>Riselia ceased her relentless attack. “The ninth order?”</p>
<p>“…Yes. The ninth order is the greatest rank of sorcery,” Leonis responded as he straightened his ruffled uniform. “Anything beyond exceeds the realm of sorcery, reaching the rank of a natural cataclysm or the like. Some even call them miracles. And in case you were wondering, Nefisgal can only cast spells up to the seventh order, too.”</p>
<p>“Wow, Leo, you’re really skilled, then,” Riselia replied, her eyes wide with surprise.</p>
<p><em>I’m not a skilled sorcerer, I’m an all-powerful Dark Lord.</em></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Leonis had lied to Riselia. He could manage magic as powerful as the thirteenth order. His reincarnation spell was a twelfth-order spell, for example.</p>
<p>He kept magic above the tenth order reserved as a last resort <a id="page-32"></a>against the Six Heroes or the Luminous Powers, however. Even the Undead King couldn’t weave that kind of sorcery with ease. Worse, with this child’s body, he likely wouldn’t be able to withstand the cost that came with using such incredible magic.</p>
<p>“One does not learn sorcery in a day. It takes consistent practice,” Leonis stated.</p>
<p>“Yes, understood,” Riselia answered diligently before taking another swig of her sports drink.</p>
<p>“By the way, Miss Selia…,” Leonis began.</p>
<p>“…Yes?”</p>
<p>“Would you mind if I got revenge for tickling me?”</p>
<p>Riselia considered her answer, placing a finger on her lips in a pensive gesture.</p>
<p>“Okay, Leo. Do you want to try to tickle me?”</p>
<p>“I was…joking,” Leonis said, his cheeks reddening. A teasing smile spread on Riselia’s face.</p>
<p><em>It feels like I can’t win against her for some reason.</em></p>
<p>“Ah…” Riselia spread her arms out and then paused, her expression hardening for some reason.</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?” Leonis inquired.</p>
<p>“Y-yes… Well…” Riselia brought her hands to her chest. “Leo… Do you remember the day of the Holy Light Festival…?”</p>
<p>Seeing her grave expression, Leonis sensed something was amiss and straightened up. The day Riselia was referring to was when the Dragon Lord Veira awakened in the underground Void laboratory and went on a rampage.</p>
<p>Leonis had pursued Veira, leaving Riselia behind. She had met up with Arle and Sakuya, and the three girls squared off against Nefakess. Although the Void Lord lost his right arm in the battle and was forced to retreat…</p>
<p>“Did something happen back then?”</p>
<p><a id="page-33"></a>“…Y-yes,” Riselia conceded and, after pausing to gather some courage, parted her lips again.</p>

<p class="space-break1">“That’s terribly important! Why didn’t you tell me sooner?!” Leonis cried.</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry! I just didn’t want to worry you before an important mission…,” Riselia replied, bowing apologetically.</p>
<p>While Veira had been rampaging over the Sixth Assault Garden, Riselia had fought Nefakess. During the struggle, he’d put some kind of black crystal into her chest.</p>
<p>“That could be terribly dangerous. Skilled sorcerers embed cursed tools into their opponents’ bodies. They can even use them to control others like puppets.” Leonis placed his hands on his waist and sighed. “You really should have been more careful… So do you feel different in any way?”</p>
<p>“My mana seems fine, and I can use my Holy Sword without a problem.”</p>
<p><em>Hmm… Then this isn’t a type of cursed tool that saps mana.</em></p>
<p>Leonis took a knee.</p>
<p>“Miss Selia, please lie down here.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Hurry,” he urged her.</p>
<p>“A-all right…,” Riselia said. Although visibly confused, she did as requested.</p>
<p>“This might hurt a little, but bear with it.”</p>
<p>“H-huh?”</p>
<p>Her fair, toned limbs were covered in a set of two-piece training wear. With a serious expression, Leonis placed his palm over her chest.</p>
<p><a id="page-34"></a>“Leo?! Nng… Hii, mmm… <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>” Riselia writhed in place ticklishly.</p>
<p>“Stay still. And abstain from making weird noises…”</p>
<p>“Nng…” Riselia bit her lip and tried to stifle her breaths.</p>
<p>Her breasts, covered by her sports bra, rose and fell stiffly. Leonis closed his eyes, letting mana course through his fingers. By touching near Riselia’s heart, he could peer into the mana flow of her entire body.</p>
<p>In humans, magic power typically gathered at the meridians, but for a Vampire Queen like Riselia, it circulated throughout her whole body.</p>
<p><em>There’s something near her heart.</em></p>
<p>Leonis strained his closed eyes, and then…he saw it. A vaguely triangular crystalline object was embedded into her heart like a wedge.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t that—?!</em> He’d seen something very similar to this recently. <em>Isn’t that the black crystal Zemein had?!</em></p>
<p>Leonis had taken the object from Zemein’s remains, but it hadn’t exhibited any mana.</p>
<p><em>What does this mean? Why would Nefakess implant this in Riselia…?</em></p>
<p>“Nhahhh, L-Leooo…,” Riselia groaned, her expression agonized.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. Does it hurt?” Leonis asked her.</p>
<p>“Mmm… A little… But I’m fine…”</p>
<p>Evidently, Leonis’s mana stimulated the crystal digging into her heart.</p>
<p><em>Extracting it would be dangerous.</em></p>
<p>The object had already partially fused with Riselia’s body, and removing it would cause her terrible pain.</p>
<p>“Bear with it just a little longer. It’ll be over soon.”</p>
<p>“…All right.”</p>
<p>Leonis held Riselia’s hand with his free one. He focused on a point over her heart and channeled destructive magical power.</p>
