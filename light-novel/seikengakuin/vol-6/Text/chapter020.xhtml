<p><a id="page-132"></a>“Now that you mention it, I feel like I’ve seen her somewhere before…,” Riselia responded pensively.</p>
<p>“Y-you must be imagining things. Let’s go!” Leonis insisted, pulling on the sleeve of Riselia’s yukata.</p>
<p>“W-wait, Leo!”</p>
<p>They crossed a bridge over the river through the city, when suddenly—</p>
<p><em>Pop! Pop! Pop!</em></p>
<p>—Small explosions shook the air.</p>
<p>“…Get down!” Leonis turned around and called out sharply.</p>
<p>“Leo?” Riselia questioned as a few more blasts sounded in the sky.</p>
<p>“…That’s…the sixth-order spell, Guren Zo?!”</p>
<p>“Leo, Leo…!” As he shielded the three girls with his back, Riselia rested a hand on his shoulder. “Those are fireworks.”</p>
<p>“…” Leonis fell silent for a long moment, processing what she had just told him.</p>
<p>“Sakura Orchid fireworks are so pretty!” Regina cheered.</p>
<p><em>Pop, pop, pop pop pop.</em></p>
<p>The fireworks whistled as they took off, painting the sky with brilliant, flowerlike patterns of light.</p>
<p>“…I—I know what fireworks are, of course,” Leonis stated, clearing his throat.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh, you were trying to protect us, weren’t you, Leo?” Riselia giggled.</p>
<p>“N-no!”</p>
<p>“I think there’s a better view over there, Lady Selia!” Regina pointed at a spot with fewer people.</p>
<p>Standing under an artificial tree meant to purify the water supply, Leonis gazed at the fireworks blooming across the sky for a bit. He’d relinquished the top of the tree to Tessera, so that she’d <a id="page-133"></a>have a better view. It was tough to view much from where he was standing, though, even on his tiptoes.</p>
<p>“You can’t see from there, can you, Leo?” Riselia said, placing her hands under his arms and picking him up.</p>
<p>“M-Miss Selia?! P-put me down!” Leonis protested, his face flushed and his limbs struggling in midair.</p>
<p>“Stop thrashing around, Leo. <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>”</p>
<p>Nearby people looked on, smiling and laughing at the heartwarming sight.</p>

<p class="space-break1">The wavering flames of a campfire lit up the darkness. Sakuya sat in a silent room of the shrine. She had just finished purifying her body at the spring and donned her priestess garb. Before her was a wooden box containing an ancestral sword, a sacred treasure passed down in the Sakura Orchid’s royal house.</p>
<p>“You look quite beautiful, Princess Sakuya,” said Eika, who stood behind and was aiding with the preparations.</p>
<p>“I’m sure Setsura would be much prettier,” Sakuya replied.</p>
<p>“It’s almost time for the ritual. Make sure you’re ready.”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>Sakuya picked up the wooden box containing the sword and moved to the altar. This was a hallowed custom that none were permitted to intrude upon. Doing so was an unforgivable taboo.</p>
<p>The ritual was meant to offer the blood of a priestess to Raijinki, who slumbered within the city’s Mana Furnace. The dance Sakuya would perform before the people was to be done after that.</p>
<p>She hadn’t heard from the Kenki Gathering since the afternoon she’d spent with Leonis. But they were undoubtedly hidden somewhere in the city, biding their time. They couldn’t have much <a id="page-135"></a>time left. The power of emptiness consumed the souls of those who wielded Demon Swords.</p>
