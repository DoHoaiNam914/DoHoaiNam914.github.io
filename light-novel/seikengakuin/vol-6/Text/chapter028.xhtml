<p><a id="page-171"></a>She forcibly avoided the attack by propelling herself away with mana. Scorching tongues licked at the air before her. If the blaze spread, she’d have nowhere to run.</p>
<p><em>No good!</em></p>
<p>Just as it seemed the flames were about to consume Riselia—</p>
<p>A streak cut across the battlefield.</p>
<p><em>Boooooooom!</em></p>
<p>An explosion blew sediment and rubble into the air, stopping the fire.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Looking up, Riselia saw a brightly glowing Eye of the Witch orb floating overhead.</p>
<p>“Miss Finé!”</p>
<p><span class="san">“I’ll cover for you, Selia!”</span></p>
<p>The orb rotated and fired another flash of light at the Void. The searing beam struck the monster on the arm gripping the ax.</p>
<p><em>Now’s my chance!</em></p>
<p>Riselia rushed through the rising smoke. She channeled her Vampire Queen mana into the Bloody Sword and—</p>
<p>“Blood Blade!”</p>
<p>All of her power released at once. A storm of red swords swirled around the giant Void’s body. Its massive form finally toppled over with a loud thud.</p>
<p>“Haah, haah, haah… You saved me back there, Miss Finé,” Riselia thanked her, catching her breath.</p>
<p><span class="san">“I never thought I’d see Voids using Demon Swords…”</span> Elfiné remarked.</p>
<p><em>Crack…!</em></p>
<p>The sound of shattering glass filled the area.</p>
<p>“…?!” Riselia looked up.</p>
<p><a id="page-172"></a>A massive fissure ran through the skies above the Seventh Assault Garden.</p>
<p>“Such an immense fracture in reality!”</p>
<p>Riselia had seen one that large only once before. It had been six years ago, right before the Stampede that destroyed the Third Assault Garden…</p>
<p>“—<img alt="image" class="mi1" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" class="mi1" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" class="mi1" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" class="mi1" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" class="mi1" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" class="mi1" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" class="mi1" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" class="mi1" src="../Images/box.jpg"/> <img alt="image" class="mi1" src="../Images/box.jpg"/>!”</p>
<p>And suddenly, the Void they’d just felled opened its eyes and screamed.</p>
<p>“…It’s still alive?!”</p>
<p>Riselia immediately held up her Holy Sword, but the Void simply jumped away and landed atop a nearby building. It then began sprinting for the Central Garden.</p>
<p><span class="san">“Selia, all the Voids in Old Town have started toward the same place,”</span> Elfiné said.</p>
<p>“What? Why?!”</p>
<p><span class="san">“I don’t know, either. But something’s definitely happening in the Central Garden…”</span></p>
<p>Riselia suddenly felt her heart thumping ominously. She had a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>“Miss Finé, I’m going to the Central Garden!”</p>
<p><span class="san">“Huh? Selia, wait…!”</span></p>
<p>But Riselia had already left.</p>

<p class="space-break1">Shardark Void Lord, the Swordmaster of the Six Heroes, had emerged from the tear in reality. He had devoured the Sakura Orchid’s deity, Fuujinki, and merged with one of the Dark Lords, Dizolf Zoa, the Lord of Rage. After transforming so many times, he looked completely different than he had nine years ago. All <a id="page-173"></a>that remained of his original body was his face, and even that was incomplete. One of his eyes had been crushed and was missing.</p>
<p>And now this monster had absorbed the other Sakura Orchid deity into himself. Standing atop a nearby laminated building was Setsura, patiently waiting for the Void Lord to completely emerge.</p>
<p>She took out a triangular black crystal from her white garb’s sleeve. This was a Trapezohedron—a shard of the goddess had that perished one thousand years ago. On its own, it was nothing but a stone without any mana.</p>
<p>But should it be placed in a compatible vessel, it could become a receptacle for the goddess’s soul.</p>
<p>Setsura’s role was to beckon Shardark of the Six Heroes and turn him into a vessel for the goddess. The Kenki Gathering—or rather, their Demon Swords—were to be the sacrifice for her.</p>
<p>However, the plan had veered off course. Shardark was locked in combat with someone, that masked man she had fought earlier.</p>
<p><em>A wielder of sorcery, an ancient art said to have gone extinct centuries ago.</em></p>
<p>During their clash, he’d loosed one powerful spell after another. Nefakess had warned Setsura that someone capable of destroying the Archsage Arakael was hiding in the Seventh Assault Garden…</p>
<p>Either way, now that those two monsters were locked in battle, she couldn’t so much as approach them. Thus, her only recourse was to wait with the shard of the goddess in hand.</p>
<p>However, she soon detected someone approaching from behind.</p>
<p>“Sister…”</p>
<p>Setsura turned around. A girl in priestess attire stood before her, Holy Sword at the ready. It was Sakuya Sieglinde, her younger sibling. Changed as they both were, each girl bore a striking resemblance to the other.</p>
<p><a id="page-174"></a>“—I was under the impression you were too injured to move,” Setsura commented.</p>
<p>“I struck a deal,” Sakuya replied.</p>
<p>“A deal?”</p>
<p>Whatever the answer, Sakuya was content not to give it. She only raised her Holy Sword.</p>
<p>Setsura decided to inquire about something else. “How did you know where I was?”</p>
<p>“I <em>saw</em> it,” Sakuya replied.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Sakuya lifted her bangs, revealing her left eye, which was now an amber shade.</p>
<p>“That eye—” Setsura said.</p>
<p>Before she could finish, however, Sakuya disappeared in a flash of lightning.</p>
