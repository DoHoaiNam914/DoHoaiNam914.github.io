<p><em>…The Kenki Gathering. They seek a place to die as warriors…</em></p>
<p>There was a good chance they’d try something during the climax of the ritual. Sakuya didn’t know how they’d accomplish it, but their aim was to awaken Raijinki and use the god to lure out the Void Lord who had destroyed the Sakura Orchid.</p>
<p><em>Only a priestess—only I can release Raijinki, though.</em></p>
<p>Sakuya slowed to a stop. Sitting on ground covered with white sand was a large rock, severed in two. This was the divine rock—the altar—that had been taken from the Sakura Orchid’s ruined capital.</p>
<p>The young woman placed the wooden crate containing the sacred treasure before the altar. She then opened the crate and retrieved the sword. After pricking herself with it, she would drip blood on the stone.</p>
<p>However, right as she picked up the blade…</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Sakuya froze up, sensing a faint presence. Looking around, she spotted a ghostly figure amid the sea of white sand. It was a masked girl, clad in white Sakura Orchid attire. Her long blue hair trailed in the breeze, faintly illuminated by the flames of the bonfire.</p>
<p>“…Who are you?” Sakuya demanded sharply.</p>
<p>No normal girl could enter this place. Raiou had Murakumo operatives set up a perimeter around the shrine. Not even an ant could get here undetected.</p>
<p>The figure didn’t answer, but stepped forward and summoned a katana to her hand.</p>
<p>A moment later, steel flashed in the dark.</p>

<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-136"></a>Countless beautiful lights illuminated the sky, casting shadows on the ground below. The Kenki Gathering stood unseen, clad in their anti-Void protection suits, patiently awaiting the appointed time.</p>
<p>“The hour is upon us. We will have our revenge.”</p>
<p>All thirty-seven Demon Swordsmen glared into the emptiness, each one willing to lay down their life if it meant vanquishing the Void Lord who had destroyed their homeland.</p>
<p>Sacrificing the innocents of the Seventh Assault Garden to see their wish fulfilled didn’t trouble them in the slightest. They’d already steeled their resolve the moment they corrupted the Holy Swords granted to them by the planet and turned them into Demon Swords.</p>
<p><em>I do regret that we couldn’t bring Princess Sakuya over to our side.</em></p>
<p>She had rejected the hand Uzan had extended to her and would suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>Just then…</p>
<p><span class="san">“—Hello, Uzan. The operation is going smoothly, I hope?”</span></p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Hearing an odd, out-of-place voice come from his communication terminal, Uzan frowned beneath his vision. It was Finzel Phillet, the Kenki Gathering’s employer.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s you. We’re on an important operation. Keep communications to a mini—”</p>
<p><span class="san">“Now, now, just hear me out. Think of this as my farewell to you.”</span></p>
<p>“What do you want?”</p>
<p>As their sponsor, Finzel was the one who’d provided them with the anti-Void protection suits, an infiltration plan into the Seventh Assault Garden, a hiding place…and even their Demon Swords. Finzel was a true blessing for the Kenki Gathering.</p>
<p><a id="page-137"></a>Of course, there were some within the group who regarded this overly generous benefactor with suspicion, but they quickly rescinded all criticism when he brought a certain girl to them. It was Princess Setsura. Their sovereign, who had died the same day as their homeland.</p>
<p>“Look, we’re grateful to you for granting us a place to die and a chance at revenge.”</p>
<p><span class="san">“Hmm, I see. Sorry, but I have to ask you to repay that debt of gratitude to me now.”</span></p>
<p>“You can be sure that we will. Although we may not be fighting for your… What was it called again? Your…Demon Sword Project? It needs our combat data. And we promise we will go all out today to provide for you.”</p>
<p><span class="san">“That’s very encouraging to hear. But see, I’m something of a perfectionist, so I set up a little trick to make sure you put forth your best effort, gentlemen.”</span></p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>The next moment, the information terminal in Uzan’s suit lit up, and a small, winged fairy, small enough to sit in the palm of one’s hand, flew out of it. The glowing fairy flapped its wings, as black as those of a swallowtail butterfly, as it darted through the air.</p>
<p>“Lord Phillet, what is this…?”</p>
<p><span class="san">“The Artificial Elemental Seraphim. A messenger capable of conveying the goddess’s voice with its whispers. I used the Astral Garden’s network to sneak it into the protector suits you’re all wearing.”</span></p>
<p>“What…? What is the meaning of this?!”</p>
<p><span class="san">“You’ll have to forgive me. Your Demon Swords will be a sacrifice for the second coming of the goddess.”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-138"></a>And then, the fairy, the goddess’s oracle, whispered words of the future—</p>
<p>“…A-ahhhh… Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>The Kenki Gathering’s protection suits all shattered…</p>
<p>And from their wreckage emerged thirty-seven Void monsters.</p>
