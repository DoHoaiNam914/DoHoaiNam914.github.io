<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter018">CASINO MISSION</a></h1>
<p class="noindent">The sun dipped below the horizon, and stars began twinkling in the sky. Since ancient times, night was seen as belonging to the undead. Corpses would rise from the graveyards to wander the streets, and animated skeletons raised their swords on battlefields.</p>
<p>However, humanity had since conquered its fear of the dark, smiting it with the shining radiance of mana lamps. The Shangri-la Resort’s pleasure quarter, Night Town, was on a floating island a short distance away from the hotel. Its flashy, colorful mana lights reflected against the gigantic pool’s water.</p>
<p>This area, which opened only after sundown, was even more alive with activity than other streets during the daytime.</p>
<p>“L-Leo, should we really be in a place like this?” Riselia looked around, her hand anxiously gripping Leonis’s.</p>
<p>Although this was Leonis’s first time here, he was familiar with locales of a similar atmosphere.</p>
<p><em>Vices are the same, no matter where you go.</em> The glorious Rognas Kingdom’s castle town had also sported a pleasure district.</p>
<p>Lurking behind the ostentatious glow of Night Town’s bright <a id="page-120"></a>lights was a deep, viscous darkness. Yet standing at the brightest spot in the area, dotted with many of its own lights, was the massive structure of Casino Phillet Vomacht.</p>
<p>This twenty-two-story building had been named after the very first count of the Phillet family, and its first eighteen floors were all for gambling.</p>
<p>“Look at how pretty it is. I like this place.” Veira raised her hands, beholding the ostentatious edifice with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>She was dressed in a white camisole shirt and shorts, the same attire she wore when Leonis took her on a tour of the Seventh Assault Garden’s commercial district.</p>
<p>“…You think? It doesn’t mesh with my tastes much,” Leonis replied, raising an eyebrow. Be it in a human or an undead body, he found all these lights blinding. The silent depths of Necrozoa’s Grand Mausoleum felt much more soothing.</p>
<p><em>But I suppose dragons are drawn to shiny things.</em></p>
<p>Many of them guarded over treasures in their dungeons, though they never put those treasures to use.</p>
<p>“Say, Leo…” Riselia spoke up.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“What are we going to do about her ID?”</p>
<p>“ID?” Veira turned around, looking at the other two with curiosity.</p>
<p>“The guard at the gate can’t let you in without an ID.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that. Well, it’ll work itself out,” Leonis said dismissively.</p>
<p>“Work itself out…?” Riselia repeated, bemused.</p>
<p>“Leo, don’t tell me you never taught your minion how to charm others using sorcery,” Veira said, frowning.</p>
<p>“Er, well… No,” Leonis replied awkwardly. “Charm sorcery is fairly advanced; it’s too soon for her.”</p>
<p>That was partially a lie. Charming was high-level magic, sure, <a id="page-121"></a>but given its utility and compatibility with a Vampire Queen, there was precedence for Riselia to learn it right away despite the difficulty.</p>
<p>Why had Leonis refrained from teaching it, then? It was because of this odd, murky feeling Leonis couldn’t quite understand. For some reason, the idea of Riselia bewitching others didn’t sit well with him.</p>
<p><em>I suppose this is just selfishness on my part</em>, he mused.</p>
<p>“Hmph. Fine. I’ll just have to show this unskilled minion how it’s done.” Veira cast the other girl a proud grin.</p>
<p>“How what’s done?”</p>
<p>“Watch and see.”</p>

<p class="space-break1">The trio stood before Casino Phillet Vomacht. The blinding mana lights burned Leonis’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Shallow Grave, commencing the mission,” Leonis whispered into his communication terminal.</p>
<p>Shallow Grave was the Undead King’s code name when infiltrating enemy territory. Incidentally, Blackas’s code name was Creeping Shadow.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Shallow…? Uh, yes, be careful,”</strong></span> Elfiné’s voice replied through the terminal, sounding a bit confused.</p>
<p>“L-Leo… Th-this is my first time going into a place like this…,” Riselia said, looking very flustered and tense.</p>
<p>“We’ll be fine,” Leonis assured her, squeezing her hand.</p>
<p>They passed through the lobby and held up their Excalibur Academy student IDs at the entrance gate. An attendant dressed in a tailcoat scanned their cards over a magical apparatus.</p>
<p>“Mr. Leonis Magnus? Everything seems to be in order.” The <a id="page-122"></a>staffer bowed his head respectfully. “You are required to leave all information terminals here at the entrance.”</p>
<p>“Yes, here you are,” Leonis said, handing over the fake terminal Elfiné had prepared for him ahead of time.</p>
<p>Leonis had stored the terminal containing Cait Sith in the Realm of Shadows.</p>
<p>“Next will be you, miss…”</p>
<p>“O-okay!” Riselia replied, handing over her terminal.</p>
<p>“Hmm, the young lady over there…” The staff member turned to check Veira’s credentials next.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“Let me through. Your lord orders that you let her pass.”</p>
<p><em>Shiiiiiiine—</em></p>
<p>…Veira’s golden eyes shone with burning, ruby light.</p>
<p>“Ah… A-as you wish… Go…ahead—,” the staff member stammered vacantly.</p>
<p>Riselia gawked. “Huh?!”</p>
<p>“Don’t make a big deal out of it. A Vampire Queen should be able to do that, no problem,” Veira told her smugly.</p>
<p>“I told you not to do anything conspicuous,” Leonis chided her, sighing.</p>
<p>Having gained entry, the three took an elevator to the third floor and stepped out into a noisy, crowded hall. A fancy chandelier hung from the ceiling, and countless nobles were engaged in gambling and games of luck. Pretty women dressed in bunny outfits walked among the tables, carrying trays of drinks.</p>
<p>“Ah! Eeek!” Riselia covered her face with her hands at the sight of the bunny girls. “This really is a place for grown-ups!”</p>
<p>“I think the way you dressed back during the Holy Light Festival was much more provocative, Miss Selia,” Leonis whispered impishly.</p>
<p><a id="page-123"></a>“L-Leo, you dummy!” An embarrassed Riselia rained light punches on his shoulder.</p>
<p>This was payback for her forcing him to dress as a girl back then.</p>
<p>The trio made their way to a service counter, and after Riselia and Leonis showed their ID cards, they exchanged some of their credits for casino coins. Leonis offered half of his gambling currency to Veira.</p>
<p>“Take this and go play. But remember, no rampaging here,” he warned her.</p>
<p>“One coin will do just fine.” Veira flicked the little thing into the air and caught it. After a spin on her heels, she vanished into the crowd, waving good-bye.</p>
<p>“…” Riselia watched the Dragon Lord go, looking somehow anxious.</p>
<p>“All right, I need to take care of the mission. What are you going to do, Miss Selia?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, well…” Riselia brought a finger to her lips.</p>
<p>She seemed conflicted for a moment. Ultimately, she made a decision, nodding to herself.</p>
<p>“Leo…” She bent down to look at Leo at eye level.</p>
<p>He expected her to ask if Veira truly was his minion.</p>
<p><em>What do I tell her?</em> Some part of him wanted to clear up the misunderstanding, but he couldn’t reveal that Veira was one of the Dark Lords. Exposing her would reveal his identity as well.</p>
<p>“Leo, I know you have a lot of secrets, and that’s fine. If you ever want to talk about it, I’ll listen. So…” Her voice dropped to a whisper. “I want you to rely on me more.” Riselia’s clear, ice-blue eyes wavered, determined and a bit sad.</p>
<p><em>Rely on her?</em></p>
<p>This was something his minion had likely been grappling with <a id="page-124"></a>for a while. Leonis recalled how Veira had called him overprotective. Perhaps overprotectiveness was just the other side of a lack of trust.</p>
<p>“…Understood. I’ll try to depend on you more, Miss Selia,” Leonis replied.</p>
<p>The girl smiled and nodded. She straightened up with renewed vigor, silver hair fluttering.</p>
<p>“Where are you going, Miss Selia?”</p>
<p>“I’m off to have a duel,” she declared with a smile.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Offering no more, Riselia paced away into the throng.</p>
<p>“M-Miss Selia, wait!”</p>
<p>Leonis nearly went off after her but stopped at the last moment.</p>
<p><em>I need to trust her</em>, he reminded himself. <em>For now, I should focus on Miss Elfiné’s mission.</em></p>
<p>Leonis walked between the tables. All he needed to do was activate the terminal near one of the magical apparatuses in the casino, and Cait Sith would automatically sneak into the network. Unfortunately, there were no such magical apparatuses in sight.</p>
<p><em>So these are the devices known as slot machines…</em></p>
<p>He wove his way through the many people, looking around, when…</p>
<p>“Hello, little boy. You want some juice?”</p>
<p>…a pretty lady in a bunny suit approached with a drink tray.</p>
<p>“No, thank you,” Leonis declined politely.</p>
<p>“Oh, that uniform. Are you from Excalibur Academy?”</p>
<p>Leonis’s voice fell to a mumble. “Er, yes…”</p>
<p>“I see! Well, have a good time! <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>” The woman walked off to speak with another patron.</p>
<p><em>Fool. How dare she approach a Dark Lord such as myself so casually?</em></p>
<p>Not a moment later, another voice called to him.</p>
<p><a id="page-125"></a>“Um…”</p>
<p>“I don’t want any juice!” Leonis snapped angrily as he turned to face this latest irritation.</p>
<p>“E-e-excuse me, my lo—I mean, sir!”</p>
<p>“Wh—Shary?!”</p>
<p>Standing there, holding a tray of snacks, was none other than Shary. Her usual maid’s uniform was nowhere to be seen, however. She wore a hair band with bunny ears, a fluffy tail, and was dressed in a bunny suit complete with fishnet stockings. Coupled with her dusk-colored eyes, she looked like a real bunny.</p>
<p>“Sh-Shary, what is this…getup?!” Leonis demanded, astonished.</p>
<p>“Y-you ordered me to infiltrate this place, so I dressed appropriately!” Shary explained in an embarrassed manner, pouting all the while.</p>
<p>“R-right, I did tell you to do that. I suppose your usual attire would stand out too much.”</p>
<p>Leonis cleared his throat and picked up one of the sandwiches sitting on her platter. He ushered his assassin maid to a corner of the room while he ate.</p>
<p>“Did you gather any information?” Leonis whispered.</p>
<p>“Yes. There’s a secret room only chosen nobles can enter.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I see. This really is more than just a casino.”</p>
<p>“So it would appear… <em>Omnom</em>,” Shary replied, taking a moment to munch on a sandwich herself.</p>
<p>Leonis raised a questioning eyebrow. “Shary, are you sure you’re allowed to eat that?”</p>
<p>“Mm… Is it a problem?” she replied indifferently.</p>
<p>“Well, it doesn’t matter to me. Which floors have active magical apparatuses?”</p>
<p>“Those would be the fourth, fifth, and seventh ones. Each <a id="page-127"></a>offers different forms of gambling, but they’re all managed by the same Artificial Elemental.”</p>
