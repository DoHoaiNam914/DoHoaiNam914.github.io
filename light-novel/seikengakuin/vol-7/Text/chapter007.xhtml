<p><a id="page-52"></a>“You were really absorbed in whatever you’re looking at. Is this something pervy?” Regina said with an impish smile, trying to peek at Leonis’s terminal. Her breasts squished against his back.</p>
<p>“N-no!”</p>
<p>“I mean, you’re a growing boy, so it makes sense.”</p>
<p>“No, this is nothing like that!” Leonis argued, pressing the terminal against his stomach.</p>
<p>Regina seeing Shary’s report would be trouble.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ll keep it a secret from Lady Selia.”</p>
<p>“I was just researching the teams participating in the Holy Sword Dance Festival!” Leonis fibbed.</p>
<p>“But Lady Selia is already doing an analysis on their Holy Swords,” Regina countered.</p>
<p>“Well, I wanted to know the ace of each squad!”</p>
<p>“Their aces…”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Leonis pressed the excuse. “Strategies are built around the team’s star member. We in the eighteenth platoon build our plans around Sakuya, our main attacker, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“So if we know who our opponents’ best combatants are, we’ll have a better idea of what strategy each team might take.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re right.” Regina nodded, her face earnest. “Well, when it comes to skilled Holy Swordsmen, Lady Chatres comes to mind.”</p>
<p>“Chatres?”</p>
<p>“Chatres Ray O’ltriese. The third princess.”</p>
<p><em>The third princess…</em></p>
<p>“Doesn’t that make her—?” Leonis started asking.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Regina cut in at a whisper. “She’s my older sister.”</p>
<p>Regina was the disinherited fourth princess of House O’ltriese. This meant that Chatres was her elder sister, although the two were very close in age.</p>
<p><a id="page-53"></a>“Princess Chatres participated as a representative of the capital’s Elysion Academy when she was fourteen years old and has participated in the Holy Sword Dance Festival in years since. During her debut, Excalibur Academy took the win, but she dominated the two years after. Her Holy Sword, the Doom Blade, is a melee-combat Holy Sword that can defeat large Voids.”</p>
<p>“You know a great deal about her.”</p>
<p>“…No, this is common knowledge. Really,” Regina said, averting her gaze from Leonis. Evidently, she was very conscious of her sister’s achievements. “Not that I think special entrants like us will face her,” the girl added hastily.</p>
<p>But then…</p>
<p>“Regina, what are you doing?!” Riselia opened the door to the bathroom and stepped out.</p>
<p>“Lady Selia, the kid’s been watching perv—”</p>
<p>“I was not!”</p>

<p class="space-break1">After a light breakfast in the largest room on the floor, the members of the eighteenth platoon made their way to the training facility. The Phillet Company testing ground used for weapons development was only a fifteen-minute walk from the hotel.</p>
<p>“Miss Elfiné?” Leonis called during the stroll.</p>
<p>“Yes, Leo?”</p>
<p>“You’re rebelling against your family, right? Won’t that jeopardize your position?” Leonis had been pondering that point since yesterday. If the truth of the D Project were to be exposed, House Phillet would be ruined.</p>
<p>“…Yes, it will,” she confirmed, smiling. “But I’m prepared to accept that.”</p>
<p><a id="page-54"></a>“I…see.”</p>
<p>“Count Deinfraude Phillet is a cold, ruthless man,” Elfiné said quietly. “He pitted my siblings and me against each other…to determine who would succeed him. When I ran away to Excalibur Academy, he branded me a failure. My mother was killed, too.”</p>
<p>“…Killed?” Leonis repeated, but Elfiné didn’t reply.</p>
<p>“Still, I keep the Phillet name because its power is useful. Once I’ve brought my family’s secrets to light, I’ll have no more use for it.” With a resolute gaze, Elfiné stared into the sky.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break1">“This is great! We’ll be able to train all we want here!” Riselia declared with satisfaction as she and her friends stood before the gate into the testing grounds.</p>
<p>The Phillet weapon testing zone was much larger than Leonis had anticipated, based on its appearance from a distance. All around the main white dome were pipes that linked it to the mana furnace, and there were large containers attached to it, too.</p>
<p>“Oh, they have Void Simulators. Can we break them?” Regina asked, pointing at a spiderlike metallic device.</p>
<p>Excalibur Academy used those machines as well. On his first day, Leonis broke one of them, and Instructor Diglassê later told him they were very expensive to replace.</p>
<p>“Hmm.” Elfiné cracked a slightly exasperated smile. “Try not to ruin the place’s equipment, if you can help it.”</p>
<p>“F-figures…,” Regina replied, as Sakuya frowned in disappointment next to her.</p>
<p>Void Simulators aside, the place was quite well outfitted. It made for a fine spot to practice.</p>
<p><em>We can drill Riselia’s sorcery here, too…</em></p>
<p><a id="page-55"></a>Leonis typically had the Three Champions of Rognas assist Riselia with that, but Leonis had left them to guard the Seventh Assault Garden for the duration of the trip to the capital. To that end, Leonis would have to personally guide her while they were here. It was an excellent opportunity to observe his minion’s growth.</p>
<p>Everyone passed their check at the gate and entered the facility.</p>
<p>“…Wow!” Riselia exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>There were walls elevated to different heights towering over them, creating what felt like an artificial forest.</p>
<p>“I had them prepare an urban combat field, like the ones they use in the Holy Sword Dance Festival,” Elfiné stated.</p>
<p>“I see.” Leonis nodded. “Very pragmatic of you.”</p>
<p>“Can we bust through those walls?” Regina asked.</p>
<p>Riselia shook her head. “Not this time.”</p>
<p>The platoon quickly split into two teams and held a mock battle. The objective was simple: wipe out the opposing squad or capture the flag. The defending side included Sakuya and Elfiné, along with three spiderlike Void Simulators. On the offensive, Riselia and Leonis formed the vanguard, while Regina supported from behind.</p>
<p>“Miss Finé and Sakuya are gonna be a tough team to beat,” Riselia admitted.</p>
<p>“…Yes, I can imagine so,” Leonis replied.</p>
<p>Given this terrain, one possible strategy was to have Elfiné track movements from above, while Sakuya launched surprise attacks using that intel. By contrast, the other side had Riselia and Leonis on the front lines, with Regina offering covering fire from a platform in the back.</p>
<p><em>…We’ll just have to go for a frontal assault.</em></p>
<p>“Let’s begin, then!” Riselia gave the signal, and the training match began.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break1">A large vehicle drove down the Central Garden’s main street. Externally, it was no different from most other vehicles, but on the inside, it was completely different. Its windowpanes were tinted with magitech, making it so no one could peer in from the outside, and its fuselage was armored as military-grade ones were.</p>
<p>This was the royal family’s exclusive vehicle, and sitting in its back seat was a twelve-year-old princess. Cradled in her arms was a small creature, reminiscent of a rabbit, with a red gem embedded into its forehead. This was the spirit Carbuncle. Not an Artificial Elemental, but a genuine Origin Spirit. Of the three royal houses, only House O’ltriese commanded the power of Origin Spirits.</p>
<p>“I’m so happy, Chatres. It’s not often I get to go on an outing with you,” Altiria said.</p>
<p>“It’s just a training exercise,” the third princess replied, seated opposite her younger sibling. “Don’t expect it to be interesting,”</p>
<p>Chatres’s expression looked cold, but she wasn’t particularly in a bad mood. In fact, most of her subordinates would interpret her demeanor as being fairly positive. Their vehicle was currently headed for a Phillet Company–owned weapon-testing ground. Previously, Chatres had used a facility that belonged to the capital’s Elysion Academy, but since both students and reporters had flocked over to see the beautiful, powerful Lady Chatres in action, she had to change places this year. She didn’t want to trouble the school or other participating squads.</p>
<p><em>I swear. Holy Swords aren’t some performance spectacle.</em></p>
<p>Still, the selection of competitors was supposed to be more promising this year. Duke Crystalia’s daughter from Excalibur Academy was one entrant getting a lot of attention, but apparently, she’d only awoken to the power of her Holy Sword a few months ago.</p>
<p><a id="page-57"></a><em>This stage isn’t forgiving enough to allow someone without the necessary mettle to compete.</em> Chatres sighed. She didn’t feel one way or the other about Riselia Crystalia herself, but knowing that the nobles were trying to capitalize on her being a hero’s daughter was annoying.</p>
<p>“I hope I can manifest my Holy Sword soon. That way I can be in your unit, Chatres…,” Altiria whispered, stroking Carbuncle’s forehead.</p>
<p>“Who’s to say your Holy Sword will be suited for battle like mine is?”</p>
<p>“…Right. That’s up to the planet to decide, I suppose.”</p>
<p>Ever since the incident aboard the <em>Hyperion</em>, Altiria’s expressions had matured. Chatres’s younger sister had always been a sagacious girl, but perhaps she’d come to understand the importance of being a princess.</p>
<p><em>If I could have it my way, you’d never have to stand on the battlefield.</em></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break1">“—Let’s go, Leo!”</p>
<p>“Okay!”</p>
<p>Leonis took off after Riselia, who bolted forward. An artificial wall stood in their way, obscuring their line of sight. Per the rules, they couldn’t destroy the barricades, which made things troublesome. Instead, Regina and Leonis had to rely on Regina, who was atop a platform at their backs, to scout things out for them.</p>
<p>Obviously, if Leonis used a mystic eye of clairvoyance, he could expand his perception. However…</p>
<p><em>Working within the rules is entertaining in its own way.</em></p>
<p>…during training matches, Leonis forbade himself from using all spells that were above the second order. After fighting <a id="page-58"></a>unrestricted against foes like the Dark Lords and the Six Heroes, he found that regulated matches like this one were surprisingly fun.</p>
<p>“Miss Selia, look up!” Leonis stopped in his tracks.</p>
<p>A massive shadow descended on them. A metallic weapon shaped like a spider—a Void Simulator!</p>
<p>“Hyahhhhh!”</p>
<p>Riselia’s Bloody Sword flashed, sweeping over the robotic opponent.</p>
<p><em>Slaaaaaaaaaash!</em></p>
<p>In the space of a second, she accurately destroyed fourteen damage sensors across its body. The Void Simulator crumbled to the ground, inoperable.</p>
<p>“Excellent work!”</p>
<p>While praising his minion, Leonis fired a lightning spell that incapacitated another Void Simulator closing in from the other side. Its metallic armor contorted, and it collapsed on the floor, its many legs crushed.</p>
<p><em>I didn’t expect such a weak spell to destroy them</em>, Leonis thought, breaking into a cold sweat.</p>
<p>But then, glowing spheres burst out of the smoking machine’s abdomen.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>It was Elfiné’s Holy Sword, Eye of the Witch! Three orbs dispersed in different directions, energy building up in them. Leonis reflexively took cover behind the wall. Lasers fired from the spheres, striking the walls and producing a shower of sparks.</p>
<p><em>She’s using her Holy Sword to control the spiders from afar?</em></p>
<p>The orbs gained altitude, flying up over Leonis’s head.</p>
<p>“Leo…!” Riselia called out and swung down her Holy Sword.</p>
<p>Razor-sharp blood arced through the air, cleaving one of the <a id="page-59"></a>orbs in half. However, the other two split up, taking aim at Riselia. And then…</p>
<p><em>Vwooosh!</em></p>
<p>…a blinding flash shot through the two orbs at once, dispersing them into particles of light, which vanished into thin air.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Lady Selia, I’ll cover for you!”</strong></span> Leonis heard a voice call out from the transmitter terminal on his ear.</p>
<p>It was Regina from her sniper position. She was lying prone on the ground, positioned to fire with her Drag Striker.</p>
<p>“She shot them down from such a distance… Impressive,” Leonis remarked.</p>
<p>“Regina’s one of the academy’s top sharpshooters,” Riselia said, then she perked up and thrust the tip of her blade over Leonis’s shoulder. Particles of light flew into the air. Another orb had been lying in wait on the other side of the wall.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Watch out, there’s still a few nearby!”</strong></span> Regina warned them. And the moment she did, another sphere descended, and…</p>
<p><em>Flash!</em></p>
<p>…everything went white.</p>
<p>“She blinded us?!”</p>
<p>It was one of the functions of the Eye of the Witch’s lasers. It probably wasn’t of use against Voids, but when it came to fighting other people, it was perfect for surprise attacks.</p>
<p>“Virga!” Leonis chanted a first-order lightning spell, blasting the latest orb. No sooner had he done so than two more took its place, aiming attacks at him. “Whoa.” Leonis took cover behind the wall.</p>
<p>The place where he’d been standing was scorched black, and a ribbon of smoke rose from it.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Not bad, Leo. Did you read into my strategy?”</strong></span> Elfiné’s voice called from the orbs whizzing through the air.</p>
<p><a id="page-60"></a>“Don’t you think you set the output on those things a little too high, Miss Elfiné?!” Leonis replied, incredulous.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“I figured you’d dodge them easily enough. <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>”</strong></span> Leonis felt the smirk in the girl’s voice.</p>
<p><em>Is she using this mock battle as an excuse to measure my true powers?</em></p>
<p>Elfiné had hinted that she knew Leonis concealed his power. He’d wound up carelessly showing her his true strength a few times, after all.</p>
<p>“I think you’re overestimating me, Miss Elfiné,” Leonis replied.</p>
<p>“Leo, let’s break through before we get surrounded,” Riselia told him.</p>
<p>“Understood! Come forth, dark of night—Fougas!”</p>
<p>Forming a smoke screen around himself using sorcery, Leonis took off.</p>
<p>“I can’t let you do that, kid.”</p>
<p>A blade swept through the air. It was accompanied by tendrils of electricity that cleared away the dark mist.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>The fabric of white Sakura Orchid attire fluttered in the breeze. A figure leaped over the wall and landed before them—a girl wielding the Holy Sword Raikirimaru.</p>
<p>“Miss Sakuya…” Leonis stopped in his tracks, holding up the Staff of Sealed Sins.</p>
<p>He was in a relatively open part of the field, but there were walls on all sides, offering him no avenues of escape.</p>
<p><em>It seems they’ve lured me in.</em></p>
<p>With the walls all around Leonis, Regina couldn’t provide covering fire. Elfiné’s orbs had lured him here unaware. If Leonis was to get the enemy team’s flag, he needed to defeat Sakuya.</p>
<p>“Leo, step back,” Riselia said, stepping in front of him. “You <a id="page-61"></a>handle Miss Finé’s orbs.” She faced Sakuya, the Bloody Sword in hand, with earnest eyes. “We’re forcing our way through, Sakuya.”</p>
<p>“A one-on-one?” Sakuya asked. “I’m sorry, Miss Riselia, but you’re still no match for me when it comes to the sword.”</p>
<p>“…Yes. Probably not.”</p>
<p>Sakuya’s words were fact. Riselia’s growth was remarkable, but no other student at Excalibur Academy could match Sakuya when it came to swordplay. Riselia knew this perfectly well.</p>
<p>“However, anything can happen in a match!” Riselia brought the Bloody Sword to her wrist, nicking it and allowing the crimson liquid to drip to the ground. “Hahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” Riselia concentrated mana in her legs, propelling herself forward and closing the distance to Sakuya in a single bound.</p>
<p>Her center of gravity was tilted slightly to the left, for if Riselia had any chance of winning…it was by taking advantage of Sakuya’s covered left eye. One usable eye meant a narrowed field of vision and poor depth perception, making it so Sakuya couldn’t properly gauge distance.</p>
<p>“Dance, my blades—Bloody Spiral!”</p>
<p>Heeding the Vampire Queen’s voice, the blood that had splashed on the ground became a flurry of razors that gathered at the tip of her Holy Sword. Even Sakuya couldn’t dodge so many attacks.</p>
<p>However, an electrical glow ran through Raikirimaru’s blade.</p>
<p>“Mikagami Style Swordsmanship—Thunderclap!”</p>
<p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>
<p>By the time the sound rang out, the match had already been decided. The two swordswomen flew past each other, and then…</p>
<p><em>Crrrrack!</em></p>
<p>…with the clear sound of breaking glass, Riselia’s Holy Sword shattered.</p>
<p><a id="page-62"></a>“…!”</p>
<p>Riselia lurched forward, her broken Holy Sword still in her grip.</p>
<p><em>Her attack didn’t connect.</em></p>
<p>Sakuya hadn’t held back, however. Forcing a first-rate sword master to resort to a serious technique was an achievement on its own. That was poor comfort for Riselia, though.</p>
<p>“I forfeit.” Leonis raised both hands, surrounded by Elfiné’s orbs.</p>
<p>Beating the two of them would have been easy for Leonis, but that would render this training meaningless. Elfiné’s tactic won them the battle the moment it forced Riselia into a one-on-one match with Sakuya.</p>
<p>“I forfeit, too!” Leonis could see Regina wave a white flag from her platform.</p>
<p>Riselia got to her feet and summoned her Holy Sword again.</p>
<p>“O-one more time!”</p>
<p>Holy Swords were the manifestation of souls. Once shattered, they needed time to mend, yet Riselia’s heart hadn’t broken yet.</p>
<p><em>This minion of mine really is unyielding.</em></p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Then I’ll change the field and we’ll start over,”</strong></span> Elfiné said through her orbs.</p>
<p>“Yes, please!”</p>
<p>But then…</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“…Huh? Wait, hold on, something ran into our field…”</strong></span></p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“…There’s something running on the walls… A rabbit?”</strong></span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break1">“…A rabbit?” Leonis looked around. Indeed, he did spy something resembling a bunny hopping atop the walls. But could rabbits <a id="page-63"></a>really jump that high? It looked less like it was hopping and more like it was floating. With each leap, particles of light blew into the air.</p>
<p><em>A spirit?</em> Leonis furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>It was definitely a spirit, and a familiar one at that. Its white fur gave off a faint glow, and it had a red gemstone imbedded in its forehead.</p>
<p><em>That’s…</em></p>
<p>“That’s Fluffymaru the Bean Cake!” Sakuya exclaimed, pointing at the spirit.</p>
<p>“You know it, Sakuya?” Riselia asked.</p>
<p>“No. But it’s fluffy and soft, so it must be Fluffymaru the Bean Cake,” Sakuya replied, crossing her arms in an extremely confident manner.</p>
<p>“I believe it’s the fourth princess’s spirit…,” Leonis muttered, flatly ignoring Sakuya.</p>
<p><em>Carbuncle was its name, if I remember correctly…</em></p>
<p>It was the Origin Spirit the princess aboard the <em>Hyperion</em> had had with her.</p>
<p>“Ah, I think you’re right. But what is a royal family’s spirit doing here…?” Riselia said.</p>
<p>Some new voices cut in, as though to answer.</p>
<p>“W-wait, Carbuncle! Where did you go?!”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, it’s dangerous! There are people training inside—”</p>
<p>People where shouting outside the facility.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know what it’s doing here, but we should probably catch it,” Elfiné stated.</p>
<p>“I’ll handle it—”</p>
<p>Sakuya jumped up, landing on the wall. With her quick feet, she caught up to the small creature in no time.</p>
<p><a id="page-64"></a>“I’ve got you now, Fluffymaru the Bean Cake.” Yet as she tried to wrap both arms around the creature, it passed through her hands. “Huh?”</p>
<p>“Miss Sakuya, spirits don’t have a physical form!” Leonis reminded her.</p>
<p>“Good luck, Sakuya!”</p>
<p>Sakuya was astonished. “Aaargh, what am I supposed to do?!”</p>
<p>With its pursuer dumbfounded, Carbuncle bolted away over the walls, leaving a glowing trail in its wake. It was headed straight for…</p>
<p>“I’ll catch it!” Regina called, spreading both arms wide from atop her sniping point.</p>
<p><em>Right, Regina can command spirits</em>, Leonis recalled.</p>
<p>“We can let Regina handle this,” Riselia said.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“These walls are in the way.”</p>
<p>“Er, Chatres, what are you planning?!”</p>
<p>“Step back a little, Altiria. Activate!”</p>
<p>They heard a girl’s dignified voice outside the field, and then…</p>
<p><em>Vwoooooooosh!</em></p>
<p>…a crimson beam of light flashed, and with a rumbling sound, the walls set up on the training field all shattered in a spectacular manner.</p>
<p><em>What?!</em></p>
<p>Leonis reflexively deployed a protective barrier, shielding Riselia from the blast. A cloud of white dust hung in the air. The particles that had maintained the walls’ shape via mana crumbled to sand.</p>
<p>“<em>Hack, horf</em>… What?!” Riselia grabbed Leonis by the arm as she coughed.</p>
<p>An alert blared, and the facility’s air conditioner switched on <a id="page-65"></a>to handle the emergency. It blew away the dust, revealing a uniformed girl brandishing a broadsword. Her hair shone blond, and her noble eyes were the color of jade.</p>
<p>“…Princess…Chatres?” Riselia muttered.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Leonis turned to look at Riselia.</p>
<p>Chatres. Regina had told him of her this morning.</p>
<p>“Oh, Chatres, that’s barbaric! There are people training here!” Another figure appeared from behind the uniformed girl.</p>
<p>“This was the fastest way. Besides, I held back.”</p>
<p>The second girl wore demure attire and looked closer in age to Leonis.</p>
<p>“…Princess Altiria?!” Riselia exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Huh?” The girl, Altiria Ray O’ltriese, regarded the eighteenth platoon with round eyes “Ah… Whaaaaaaaaaaa?!”</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break1">Once things had calmed down a bit, Riselia asked, “Princess Altiria, what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“W-well, you see, my sister, Chatres, was training for the Holy Sword Dance Festival with her unit at the facility next door, and I came along to watch. But then, Carbuncle ran off…”</p>
<p>Leonis did recall hearing about someone using the adjacent facility. <em>But I didn’t think it’d be the ace Holy Swordswoman I heard about this morning.</em></p>
<p>Chatres Ray O’ltriese—the empire’s third princess and the Holy Sword Dance Festival’s favored competitor. Since she was a royal, it stood to reason that she’d have her own personal area for combat practice.</p>
<p><em>No, perhaps that’s not true.</em></p>
<p>The Integrated Human Empire’s ruling class had a somewhat <a id="page-66"></a>different position compared to the kings and queens Leonis had known a thousand years ago.</p>
<p>“My apologies for disturbing your drills. It was an emergency. Carbuncle is a spirit that belongs to the royal family. We couldn’t afford to let anything happening to it.”</p>
<p>Chatres briefly thanked the eighteenth platoon for recovering the creature. Apparently, she really had destroyed the walls with her Holy Sword. That spoke of tremendous destructive power, but what else did the princess’s weapon have in store?</p>
<p>“So where is Carbuncle…?” Chatres looked around.</p>
<p>“Ah, we caught it over here.”</p>
<p>Regina, Sakuya, and Elfiné approached, walking over the ruined walls. The glowing spirit was cradled in Regina’s arms. Despite hopping around just moments ago, it was now curled up, obedient and placid.</p>
<p>“…Carbuncle!” Altiria called out.</p>
<p>As Regina approached, the spirit hopped from her to Altiria.</p>
<p>“Oh, why did you do that?” Altiria chided the little spirit, puffing up her cheeks in an adorable pout. “You just ran off all of a sudden…” The princess turned to Regina and bowed her head. “Thank you very much for catching it.”</p>
<p>“O-oh, no, it was nothing. Perish the thought,” a flustered Regina responded, speaking in a tone that reminded Leonis of Fenris.</p>
<p><em>Come to think of it, this is her first time meeting her younger sister face-to-face.</em></p>
<p>The two had never met directly during the incident aboard the <em>Hyperion</em>.</p>
<p>“You know, it’s strange,” Altiria remarked, puzzled. “Carbuncle doesn’t let anyone else hold it but me…”</p>
<p><a id="page-67"></a>“Q-quite odd, indeed! Ohoho!” Regina responded with a strange, high-pitched tone.</p>
<p>Carbuncle had fought alongside Regina during the seajacking. Perhaps the spirit had sensed Regina’s presence and run off to meet her.</p>
<p>Altiria looked around, gazing at the members of the eighteenth platoon.</p>
<p>“I’ve been wanting to thank you all personally for the longest time,” she said. “I went unconscious and can’t quite remember what happened, but I know you all fought bravely to save my life.”</p>
<p>She pinched up the hems of her dress in a curtsy and lowered her head.</p>
<p>“Not at all, Princess,” Riselia answered, bowing as a retainer would. “Protecting you is a Holy Swordswoman’s duty.”</p>
<p>“As Altiria’s older sister, allow me to offer my gratitude as well.” Chatres dipped her head briefly.</p>
<p>Her blond hair, like the color of a stewartia flower, fell over her cheeks. Like Altiria and Regina, she was a very beautiful woman, but her jade eyes gave off something cold.</p>
<p><em>In terms of my subordinates, she reminds me of Iris, the Dark Priestess</em>, Leonis mused.</p>
<p>Noticing his gaze, Chatres eyed Leonis and cocked an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Excalibur Academy uniform…,” she muttered. “Don’t tell me you have a child in your platoon.”</p>
<p>“Yes, he’s a child, but he’s one of our team’s aces,” Elfiné said.</p>
<p>“What?” Chatres glared at Leonis sharply. “Impossible. You may be a special entry, but do you intend to make a mockery of the Holy Sword Dance Festival?”</p>
<p>“Chatres!” Altiria scolded, yet the older sister’s glare remained hard and judging.</p>
