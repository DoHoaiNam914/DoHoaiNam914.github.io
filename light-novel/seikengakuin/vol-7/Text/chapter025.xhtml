<p><a id="page-161"></a>“You did it, Leo…,” Veira said. “What was that power, anywa—”</p>
<p>“No. Not yet,” Leonis cut in, his eyes fixed upon the crater beneath.</p>
<p>Rivaiz had realized the power of Leonis’s Holy Sword and retreated into the leviathan’s body. She hadn’t escaped completely unharmed, however.</p>
<p>Veira landed atop the leviathan. Tentacles whipped out to intercept her, but she easily slashed and chopped them away.</p>
<p>“We can’t let her recover. We need to finish her off while we can.”</p>
<p><em>Bwooooosh!</em></p>
<p>Gigantic shadows appeared in the water around Leonis and Veira—quadruped dragons made entirely of water.</p>
<p>“Sea dragons?!” Leonis exclaimed.</p>
<p>“No. These are minions of the Lord of the Seas,” Veira clarified.</p>
<p>They were Origin Spirits that guarded Rivaiz’s Underwater Stronghold. Each of them individually was as strong as one of the Luminous Powers’ subordinate gods, placing them on the same level as Raijinki, the Sakura Orchid guardian deity whom Leonis had fought in the Seventh Assault Garden.</p>
<p>“This is bothersome.” The shot from his Holy Sword had greatly depleted Leonis’s mana.</p>
<p>“I’ll handle them,” Veira said. “You go after Rivaiz.”</p>
<p>“Very well.” Leonis nodded and threw himself into the crater.</p>

<p class="space-break1">The interior of the leviathan’s gigantic body rumbled eerily. Using a gravity spell, Leonis slowed his descent.</p>
<p><em>This Holy Sword’s power is much too challenging to control.</em></p>
<p>During the battle with Shardark, Leonis had unconsciously <a id="page-162"></a>focused all his power into the attack, but this time, he was more cautious. Even so, his body screamed in pain and exhaustion.</p>
<p>Instructors at Excalibur Academy asserted that using a Holy Sword consumed the power of one’s soul. Describing it as such was terribly vague, illustrating how little humanity understood about Holy Swords.</p>
<p>Excalibur XX seemed to be a Holy Sword that drew upon mana, but that wasn’t the only thing it consumed. Leonis couldn’t tell if the other thing was his soul or his mental fortitude.</p>
<p><em>It’s ironic that I, who once lost my soul and became undead, was granted such a weapon.</em></p>
<p>Leonis finally reached the bottom of the chasm his attack had gouged into the leviathan. The stench of burnt flesh hung heavily in the air.</p>
<p>“Holy Swords—weapons given to humanity to fight the Voids.”</p>
<p>Leonis stopped in his tracks when he heard those words. Through the darkness, he spied a girl with amethyst-colored hair watching him expressionlessly. Her watery raiment was torn, and she was covered in wounds.</p>
<p>“What are you?” she demanded. “Are you…human?”</p>
<p>Leonis took a step forward, not bothering to answer. “Lord of the Seas, why have you returned? Who’s pulling your strings?”</p>
<p>“It is I who am asking the questions here, insolent human…!”</p>
<p>A silvery light flashed for only a moment. Leonis reacted on reflex, moving to evade.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>A shallow cut appeared on his shoulder, sending blood spurting from the wound.</p>
<p><em>…Was that her raiment?!</em></p>
<p>The watery garment hanging over the girl’s body had become transparent blades, which shot forward to slash him.</p>
<p><a id="page-163"></a>“Tch…”</p>
<p>Leonis immediately began firing his Holy Sword in rapid succession. After repelling Rivaiz’s attacks, he jumped back.</p>
<p><em>Wasn’t Rivaiz unskilled in close-quarters combat…?</em></p>
<p>Leonis groaned and took a sharp breath. He hadn’t thought using Excalibur XX would exhaust him this much.</p>
<p><em>Still, she’s wary of my Holy Sword. That much is for sure.</em></p>
<p>In other words, this Holy Sword was a weapon capable of defeating the Lord of the Seas.</p>
<p>Rivaiz swung an arm, and her raiment became an invisible sword, which sped toward Leonis. Again, he fired repeatedly. Sparks popped in the air between the two Dark Lords.</p>
<p><em>The water blade protected her?!</em></p>
<p>It seemed this raiment was made to defend its wearer automatically, regardless of its master’s will. It was likely a powerful item similar to Riselia’s Bloody Sword.</p>
<p>“Then let’s give it more opponents to defend against.”</p>
<p>Leonis chanted his personal spell, Create Undead Army. Magic circles formed around him, summoning an army of undead—Elite Skeleton Warriors, Elite Skeleton Knights, Elite Skeleton Assassins, and Elite Skeleton Hounds.</p>
<p>“Fool. Deploying such weak troops against me is meaningless!”</p>
<p>The invisible water blades shot forth, crushing the undead fighters. Countless bones shattered. However, this was exactly as Leonis had intended.</p>
<p>“True. But your raiment will have to react to every single one of those soldiers, won’t it?” Leonis remarked as he sprinted forward, firing his Holy Sword nonstop.</p>
<p>“What…?!”</p>
<p>If Leonis’s soldiers truly were weak cannon fodder, the water raiment wouldn’t have acknowledged them as a threat. While these <a id="page-164"></a>skeletons were no match for the Three Champions of Rognas, they were still elite undead, and all of them were equipped with mass-produced copies of an Arc Seven.</p>
<p>Imitations of Zolgstar Mezekis were unquestionably weaker, but Rivaiz was injured. Even facsimiles of an authentic piece of the Arc Seven would be enough to wound her. Leonis used her raiment’s traits against her.</p>
<p>A water blade nicked Leonis’s neck, but he only ran faster.</p>
<p>“Hrahhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>He fired repeatedly and without taking the time to aim properly. The raiment’s attacks were broken, and shots were deflected with a flash. By using the skeleton soldiers as shields, Leonis gradually stripped Rivaiz Deep Sea of her defenses, pushing closer all the while.</p>
<p><em>Lord of the Seas, in the past you were certainly the strongest of the Dark Lords</em>. Leonis sneered as he crept closer to her. <em>But that title is by now a thing of the past.</em></p>
<p>The Undead King, Leonis Death Magnus, had known many defeats. They had granted him an awareness of his weaknesses and the capability to overcome them.</p>
<p><em>You grew far too confident in the leviathan’s absolute power and, in your conceit, neglected to push yourself further.</em></p>
<p>“Eighth-order spell, Argh Varheiz!” Rivaiz chanted.</p>
<p>A massive whirlpool of water, capable of cutting through anything, ripped into Leonis’s flesh. However, crimson flames erupted out from under his torn uniform! A red, glowing dragon scale deflected the eighth-order spell…!</p>
<p>This scale carried powerful magic resistance, for it belonged to Veira Dragon Lord! Leonis had taken it during the aerial battle and hid it underneath his clothes.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p><a id="page-165"></a>Rivaiz’s eyes widened, with shock and marvel.</p>
<p>“Your conceit is why you will lose, Lord of the Seas!”</p>
<p>Loading the last of his mana into Excalibur XX, Leonis unleashed his final shot.</p>

<p class="space-break1">Leonis resurfaced to the sight of Veira ripping into an Origin Spirit with her fangs. The creature shaped like a water dragon disappeared with an agonized roar. Leonis had hurried back with the intent to help the Dragon Lord, but evidently, that was unnecessary.</p>
<p>Noticing Leonis’s presence, Veira let out a victorious roar.</p>
<p>“Did you defeat Rivaiz, Leo?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I couldn’t annihilate her completely, but she won’t be doing much of anything for a long time,” Leonis explained.</p>
<p>He’d never intended to slay her. There was still the matter of who was pulling her strings, after all.</p>
<p>With Rivaiz defeated, the leviathan stopped moving. They couldn’t very well leave it here unattended, but if they attacked it now, it could go berserk, and that would be troublesome.</p>
<p>Just as it seemed the battle was over at last…</p>
<p>…Leonis heard a shattering sound, like a fissure running through glass.</p>
<p><em>Crack, crack, crack, crack…!</em></p>
<p>A massive crack had formed in the sky.</p>
<p>“Leo, that’s…,” Veira growled.</p>
<p>“So they’ve decided to make an appearance at last,” Leonis muttered, confident.</p>
<p>A massive, deep-blue-colored structure emerged from the tear in space. The Azure Hold—Veira Dragon Lord’s castle—had arrived.</p>
<p>However, the palace had not arrived alone. A lone figure floated <a id="page-166"></a>ahead of it, a middle-aged man with a grizzled air about him. He peered down at the pair of Dark Lords with the sharp eyes of a hawk.</p>
<p>Gasping, Veira cautioned, “Leo, that’s him.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The words went unheeded, for Leonis was staring wide-eyed in disbelief at this hovering man. He’d seen this person’s visage once before, at Riselia’s estate in the Third Assault Garden.</p>
<p><em>It can’t be! How…? Why would this man be here…?!</em></p>
<p>Duke Crystalia—Edward Ray Crystalia.</p>
<p>The one who arrived with the Azure Hold was the spitting image of Riselia’s father.</p>
