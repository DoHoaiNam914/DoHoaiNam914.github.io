<p class="noindent">By the time Leonis emerged from the Realm of Shadows, the storm had already passed. There were still sirens blaring in the Central Garden, and the city remained in combat mode.</p>
<p>“She’s always so much trouble.” Leonis sighed as he patted the dust off his jacket.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the communication terminal in his pocket started beeping.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“—Leo, Leo, where are you? Come in—”</strong></span></p>
<p>“Ah, Miss Selia… Don’t worry, I’m fine.”</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Leo…”</strong></span> Riselia sounded relieved upon hearing his reply. <span class="special"><strong>“Oh, I was worried sick!”</strong></span></p>
<p>“I—I’m sorry. You can scold me later.” Leonis meant that. His minion sounded…awfully upset.</p>
<p><em>I’ll have to humor her later, won’t I…?</em> The thought brought a cold sweat to his nape.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“I’m just glad you’re all right. Need me to come pick you up?”</strong></span></p>
<p>“It’s fine. I’ll head back on my own. Let’s meet at the hotel.”</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Can you make it back on your own?”</strong></span></p>
<p><a id="page-104"></a>“Don’t worry. I can check the map on my terminal.”</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Hmm…”</strong></span> Riselia paused for thought. <span class="special"><strong>“Fine… Just be careful. You wouldn’t want some stranger to kidnap you on the way back.”</strong></span></p>
<p>“Y-yes, I will,” Leonis replied with a strained smile.</p>

<p class="space-break1">Leonis moved swiftly through the shadows to return to the hotel, only to find the lobby of the Shangri-la Resort in an uproar. The attack hadn’t damaged it, but people were understandably panicked after seeing a dragon in the sky.</p>
<p>The news reported that a massive Void had appeared out of nowhere and, after causing some destruction in the Central Garden, vanished into the emptiness again. Since Leonis had destroyed all video devices, the broadcast was only the newscaster’s voice.</p>
<p>He passed the lobby’s identification check and returned to the eighteenth platoon’s floor, looking as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. Someone else must have arrived ahead of him, because the door to the meeting room was open.</p>
<p>“Ah, Leo.” Elfiné, who was seated on a sofa, looked up from her terminal.</p>
<p>“You came back, Miss Elfiné.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I heard the Central Garden’s in a real bad state. Selia called earlier and said today’s training is canceled.”</p>
<p>Nodding, Leonis replied, “Yes, that makes sense.” He took a seat on the sofa opposite Elfiné’s.</p>
<p>“You want some juice, Leo?” the girl offered.</p>
<p>“Okay. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Give me a minute, then.” Elfiné opened the door to the fridge. <a id="page-105"></a>“Excalibur Academy’s administration bureau sent me a request to investigate the gigantic Void’s data, but there are no records of anything like it. Apparently, the Void released a powerful EMP barrage that fried all the magical apparatuses in the area.”</p>
<p>“Oh…really?” Leonis asked, averting his gaze. “Hmm. Where are Miss Regina and Miss Sakuya?”</p>
<p>“Regina went to pick Selia up. As for Sakuya, I can’t get in touch with her.”</p>
<p>“It seems impossible to contact Miss Sakuya when she’s out.”</p>
<p>“She does tend to come and go like a cat, but I’m not worried about her.” Elfiné shrugged with a sardonic smile.</p>
<p>Said cat was presently working alongside her fellow members of the Demon Wolf Pack.</p>
<p>“Maybe I’ll try calling her,” Leonis remarked.</p>
<p>Before he could, Elfiné stopped him, as though she’d been waiting for the right time to mention something. “Leo…”</p>
<p>“…?” Leonis looked up, his fingers stopping just above the screen of his terminal. “Yes?”</p>
<p>“Hmm… I, erm, I wanted to ask you for a favor.”</p>
<p>“A favor…?”</p>
<p>Elfiné nodded and took a seat beside the boy. A few locks of her sleek black hair spilled over Leonis’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“M-Miss Elfiné?” Leonis felt his heart thump.</p>
<p>Elfiné’s drew close to his ear and whispered, “I want you to sneak my cat into the Shangri-la Resort’s casino.”</p>
<p>“…Your cat?” Leonis echoed softly.</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s called Cait Sith.” Elfiné activated her terminal and held it up for Leonis to see.</p>
<p>A black feline appeared on the screen, rolling about.</p>
<p>“Is this an Artificial Elemental?” Leonis questioned.</p>
<p>Nodding, Elfiné replied, “I made it myself. It’s a spirit that <a id="page-106"></a>operates in the Astral Garden. It infiltrates networks for me and gathers information like a cat hunting down prey.”</p>
<p>The Astral Garden was a network consisting of mana particles, forming a virtual space that functioned like an Assault Garden. Leonis honestly knew very little about the Astral Garden. He’d tried to investigate it in the past, but the magical technology that constituted it fundamentally differed from the sorcery used a thousand years ago.</p>
<p>“So why do you want to sneak this cat into the casino…?” he asked.</p>
<p>Elfiné dragged her finger along the monitor, moving Cait Sith away and shifting over to a bird’s-eye-view map of the Shangri-la Resort.</p>
<p>“This casino is used for more than just gambling. It’s a place for nobles to meet in secret, and there’s evidence that it’s being used to launder illegal funds, too. I might be able to get information related to the D Project there.”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>Even in ancient times, gambling dens used by the nobility were, in fact, clandestine social meeting hubs. When Leonis was still a human apprentice knight, his teacher, Shardark, once took him to such a place to stomp out a sinister conspiracy.</p>
<p>“But the Shangri-la Resort’s casino is detached from the Astral Garden, so it won’t be easy to access it from the outside.”</p>
<p>“I see. And that’s why you need to use the cat.”</p>
<p>“Yes, if Cait Sith can directly enter the casino’s magical apparatuses, I’ll be able to connect to it through the Eye of the Witch. I know I should be the one to do it, but—”</p>
<p>“If you go there, the Phillet Company might get suspicious,” Leonis finished, and Elfiné nodded.</p>
<p>“Can I ask you to do this for me, Leo?” Elfiné entreated, wearing a serious, earnest expression.</p>
<p><a id="page-107"></a>“…Very well. I can’t turn down a request from you, Miss Elfiné.”</p>
<p>Leonis owed her on a few accounts. Elfiné had seen footage of Leonis using snippets of his Dark Lord power, but she looked the other way and never disclosed the information to Excalibur Academy.</p>
<p><em>Besides, gaining information on the Demon Swords is something I’m interested in, too.</em></p>
<p>“Thank you, Leo,” Elfiné said, bowing in gratitude.</p>
<p>“Oh, no, don’t mention it.” Leonis shook his head lightly. “So what am I supposed to do exactly?”</p>
<p>“I’ll hand the cat over to you now.” Elfiné set to work operating her terminal. A moment later, Cait Sith vanished, instead appearing on Leonis’s terminal.</p>
<p>“Just activate your terminal near a magical apparatus in the casino. It’ll take about ten or so minutes for me to gain access. They confiscate terminals at the entrance to the casino, so make sure to hide yours well.”</p>
<p>“Understood. By the way…” Leonis had hit upon a wrinkle in this plan. “Are children allowed to enter the casino?”</p>
<p>“If you have an Excalibur Academy ID card, you should be able to enter with no problem.”</p>
<p>“I see. Come to think of it, Miss Sakuya does dabble in games of chance.”</p>
<p>“That was illegal gambling among students,” Elfiné corrected him.</p>
<p>“…I—I see.” Leonis got the feeling he should leave well enough alone when it came to this matter.</p>

<p class="space-break1">Upon returning to his room, Leonis sat on his bed and summoned Shary.</p>
<p><a id="page-108"></a>“You called, my lord?” The assassin maid rose from the shadow cast by the bed.</p>
<p>“Has Veira calmed down?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord Blackas is keeping a close eye on her.”</p>
<p>“Good. By the way, I need to ask you to handle something.”</p>
<p>“Order me as you will, my lord.” Shary pinched up the hems of her skirt in a reverent curtsy.</p>
<p>“I want you to infiltrate this resort’s casino before I do.”</p>
<p>“Understood. Who am I to assassinate?”</p>
<p>“This isn’t an assassination. I want you to record conversations among the nobles there.”</p>
<p>“Very well.”</p>
<p>“Ah, wait, take this with you.” Leonis stopped Shary just as she began to sink into the darkness. He reached for a box of doughnuts sitting on his bedside table and handed it to the girl.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, this is, well…a reward. Your research on the city’s restaurants proved helpful.”</p>
<p>“M-my lord…thank you so much! Your consideration is wasted on me.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. I leave the Dark Lords’ Armies’ future in your capable hands.”</p>
<p>“Yes! I will not disappoint you!”</p>
<p>Hugging the box of doughnuts, Shary gleefully vanished into the shadows.</p>
<p>“Phew…”</p>
<p>Leonis took off his shoes and lay on the bed. He’d considered entrusting Cait Sith to Shary, but Leonis was interested in this era’s casinos and elected to see it for himself. The establishment opened only after sunset, so he had some time.</p>
<p><a id="page-109"></a>While he was looking up at the ceiling, his thoughts wandered to what Veira had told him. The Lord of the Seas.</p>
<p><em>She was never the type to recklessly start quarrels with others.</em></p>
<p>Rivaiz rarely let her feelings show, and it was always impossible to discern her thoughts. As Dark Lords went, she wasn’t the bloodthirsty type who incited battles with her peers. That was more the tendency of the Dragon Lord, Lord of Beasts, and Lord of Rage.</p>
<p><em>I suppose her domain never bordering other Dark Lords’ territories was a factor…</em></p>
<p>Her relations with Leonis had been cordial overall in the past, and the two were even allies for a time.</p>
<p><em>What bothers me is this person who tried to dominate Veira.</em></p>
<p>Although she wasn’t at her full might anymore, there were still few who could drive her to a frenzy like that. Nefakess Reizaad, the Dark Lords’ Armies’ staff officer who seemed to be involved in the conspiracies working behind the scenes in this era, came to mind as a potential culprit. When Leonis had faced off against him in the ruined Third Assault Garden, Nefakess had chanted third-order spells.</p>
<p><em>That measly priest couldn’t possibly have that kind of power.</em></p>
<p>The one entity who could unquestionably control the Dark Lords was…</p>
<p><em>…Roselia.</em></p>
<p>If her reincarnated body had already awakened somewhere…</p>
<p><em>No. It couldn’t be her.</em> Leonis shook his head, denying the very idea. Roselia wouldn’t try to seize control of Veira forcefully. <em>Regardless, I’ll have to go and find out.</em></p>
<p>The Azure Hold’s resting place was quite a distance from the First Assault Garden. Even if Leonis were to ride his Skull Dragon, it would require over ten days.</p>
<p><a id="page-110"></a>“…And if I do that, I won’t make it back in time for the Holy Sword Dance Festival.”</p>
<p>“The what festival?”</p>
<p>“The Holy Sword Dance Festival. With the Skull Dragon’s flight speed, it would take me at least… Mm?” Leonis paused and turned around. “What?!”</p>
<p>Crimson hair filled his field of vision, as well as golden eyes that glinted with a brutal glare. Standing on his bed imposingly was Veira Dragon Lord.</p>
<p>“Veira?! How long have you been here?!” Leonis exclaimed, hurriedly crawling away until his back hit the wall. “It can’t be! How did you break the binds of the Ragva Zol?!”</p>
<p>“Hah! I shattered those chains with my dragon fangs!” Veira cackled ferociously, her teeth glinting. “You’re much too weak to hold the likes of me captive!”</p>
<p>“…What about Blackas?!” Leonis pressed, alarmed.</p>
<p>“The dog? I bound him in your chains and left him on the ground.”</p>
<p>“What…?!”</p>
<p>Leonis sent Blackas a telepathic message, but…</p>
<p><em>“Guh… Forgive me, Lord Magnus…,”</em> Blackas whimpered in his head.</p>
<p>“How dare you do that to my sworn friend!” Leonis glared at Veira. “I’ll have you know, Blackas is the rightful prince of the Realm of Shadows!”</p>
<p>“Who cares? I’m the Dragon Lord,” Veira replied arrogantly. Her attention strayed out the window. “Hmm. So this is humanity’s greatest capital.”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s humankind’s final fortress against the Voids,” Leonis replied as he stood.</p>
<p>“One section over there looks incomplete,” Veira observed.</p>
<p><a id="page-111"></a>“That’s because you destroyed it during your rampage,” Leonis pointed out dryly.</p>
<p>Looking away awkwardly, Veira responded, “W-well…I do regret that.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Leonis shot back sarcastically. “So dragons actually have words of reflection in their vocabulary? Color me surprised.”</p>
<p>“Are you trying to pick a fight with me?” Veira’s crimson hair wavered up like fire.</p>
<p>“Hmph. It seems you’re at least somewhat back to your old self, but you’re still not fully recovered.” Dark mana enshrouded Leonis as he summoned the Staff of Sealed Sins. “Perhaps I should trap you in the Realm of Shadows one more time, as revenge for what you did to Blackas!”</p>
<p>Just as it seemed a battle between two ancient Dark Lords would erupt in a hotel room…</p>
<p>“Leo, are you there?” The door to the room suddenly opened. “…Huh?”</p>
<p>…Riselia entered and saw the Undead King and the Dragon Lord standing on the bed. She blinked a few times, frozen in place with her hand on the doorknob.</p>

</div>
<p class="space-break1">“Ahhhh! Wh-what are <em>you</em> doing here?!” Riselia exclaimed, pointing fixedly at Veira.</p>
<p>“M-Miss Selia…,” Leonis stammered.</p>
<p>This wasn’t her first time meeting Veira. Once, they’d had a water-gun showdown at a pool. The heated match had been interrupted by a Demon Sword incident, leaving the result forever unknown.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re that girl from back then…,” Veira remarked with <a id="page-112"></a>innocent fascination, unfazed by Riselia glaring daggers at her. “Leo’s minion.”</p>
<p>“What?!” Riselia’s eyes widened in shock. Her being his minion was supposed to be a secret.</p>
<p>“Leo, who… What is this girl?!”</p>
<p>Unable to provide an adequate explanation, Leonis only managed an “Erm…”</p>
<p>He couldn’t tell Riselia that Veira was the dragon that had wrought havoc only a little while earlier. To his surprise and fear, the Dragon Lord herself seized the initiative and hopped off the bed.</p>
<p>“My name’s Veira. I’m…Leo’s minion.” The crimson-haired girl suddenly made an unbelievable statement.</p>
<p>“You’re Leo’s…minion?!” Riselia parroted, positively stunned.</p>
<p>“You fool, what are you—?” Leonis began.</p>
<p>The Dragon Lord turned to face him with a sadistic smile and whispered, “Hmm… Are you sure you want to finish that sentence?”</p>
<p>“What?” Leonis quietly replied.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to tell that girl I’m a Dark Lord, just like you?”</p>
<p>“Tch…” Leonis had no choice but to grit his teeth and fall silent.</p>
<p>“Th-that can’t be… I mean, I’m…<em>I’m</em> Leo’s minion…,” Riselia said, her voice weak.</p>
<p>“Ohhh, so I guess that makes us fellow minions under the same master. Except…” A confident smile blossomed on Veira’s face. “I knew him for ages before you did.”</p>
<p>“Th-that’s…” Poor Riselia floundered for a reply.</p>
<p>“It’s true. Leo and I fought back-to-back countless times.”</p>
<p><a id="page-113"></a>That much wasn’t a lie. The Undead King and the Dragon Lord had joined forces to fight the Luminous Powers and the Six Heroes.</p>
<p>“He’s even seen me in the nude. That’s how close we are.”</p>
<p>“What?!” Riselia’s eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p>Technically, that was true as well. Whenever Veira was in her dragon form, she was naturally naked.</p>
<p>“Veira, stop teasing her!” Leonis chided quietly.</p>
<p>“W-well, I’ve taken baths with Leo before!” Riselia protested.</p>
<p>“Oh? Is that right?” Veira threw a glare at Leonis.</p>
<p>The Undead King averted his gaze. “N-not…every day…”</p>
<p>Finally, Riselia moved past the doorway and into the room proper, having finally gathered the courage to do so. “Leo, is what she’s saying true? Is this girl, hmm…your minion…?” she asked, looking directly into his eyes.</p>
<p>“That’s, well…” Leonis hesitated for a moment, mouth hanging open, before ultimately nodding. “It’s true.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Leo summoned me to protect him,” Veira added, puffing out her chest proudly.</p>
<p>“Protect him…?” Tears welled up in Riselia’s ice-blue eyes.</p>
<p>“Ah, erm…Miss Selia?!” Leonis was confused by the unusual sight of his real minion’s tears.</p>
<p>“Y-you summoned her…because…I’m not good enough to keep you safe…”</p>
<p>“N-no, that’s not why!” Leonis denied hurriedly.</p>
<p>“I-it’s…true…I couldn’t do anything before, when the dragon was rampaging through the city…”</p>
<p>“Miss Selia, that’s…”</p>
<p>During Veira’s attack, Leonis had indeed left Riselia behind. He hadn’t done so believing she would drag him down, though. It <a id="page-114"></a>was a choice meant to keep her safe. Evidently, that decision had hurt the girl’s feelings.</p>
<p>Veira observed the exchange. “Hmm… You’re awfully overprotective,” she muttered, as though all the fun had been sucked out of her game.</p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>Before Leonis could press her for clarification, the terminal he’d placed on the bed suddenly started beeping.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“…eo, Leo.”</strong></span> Elfiné’s voice was coming from the device.</p>
<p>“Miss Elfiné?”</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Leo, the casino’s about to open.”</strong></span></p>
<p>Leonis retrieved the terminal. “Understood.”</p>
<p>“What’s this about a casino, Leo?” Riselia inquired.</p>
<p>“Ah. Well, Miss Elfiné asked me for a favor.”</p>
<p>“She did?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he answered. “She wants to infiltrate this gambling den because of a supposed connection to the D Project.”</p>
<p>Riselia, bright girl that she was, quickly understood the situation.</p>
<p>“I’m coming along,” she declared.</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“If you went alone, people might get suspicious if you don’t have a grown-up watching over you, right?”</p>
<p>“…I suppose that’s true.”</p>
<p>It would be more convincing than a ten-year-old boy exploring a casino alone.</p>
<p><em>And this promises to be less perilous than the Dragon Lord’s attack.</em></p>
<p>Even if something did happen, he’d be there to protect her.</p>
<p>“All right. Let’s go together.”</p>
<p>“Okay!” Riselia replied happily.</p>
<p>“Oh, that sounds like fun. I’ll come along, too <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>,” Veira added enthusiastically.</p>
<p><a id="page-115"></a>“There’s no need. Everything becomes a huge mess whenever you get involved,” Leonis stated coldly.</p>
<p>“What…what do you take me for?!”</p>
<p>“How about you reflect upon your actions before asking me that? What about your rematch with the Lord of the Seas?”</p>
<p>“W-well, my body still aches from what happened the first time.” Veira couldn’t look her fellow Dark Lord in the eye.</p>
<p>“Y-you two look close…,” Riselia grumbled, sulking.</p>
<p>Bitterly, Leonis thought, <em>This is going to be trouble.</em></p>
<p>Refusing Veira wouldn’t stop her. She’d follow Leonis anyway. And if he left her unattended, he might return to find the hotel in ruins.</p>
<p><em>Keeping her close to make sure she doesn’t run wild might be the best option.</em> Leonis sighed. Best option or not, it was hardly a preferable one.</p>
<p>“Listen to me. Don’t do anything too conspicuous, and no destroying anything. Are we clear?”</p>
<p>“I’ll try.”</p>

<p class="space-break1">Beneath the waves rested a massive Void colony known as a Void territory. No ship or Assault Garden dared cross such regions of the ocean, opting for detours.</p>
<p>The reason for the constant Void attacks wasn’t clear yet, but it was believed that Stampedes caused by Void Lords began in Void territories.</p>
<p>A colony of countless monsters of nothingness, emerging from cracks in space. Most people couldn’t imagine anything worse, yet that massive collection of Voids…was being swallowed by the sea itself.</p>
<p><a id="page-116"></a>Gigantic tentacles shot forward, consuming the misshapen creatures. Voids that only scarcely resembled marine life were torn effortlessly apart.</p>
<p>It was as if the ocean were lashing out at the Voids for defiling it with their presence.</p>
<p>At the core of this onslaught was a lone figure—Rivaiz Deep Sea, the Lord of the Seas.</p>
<p>The amethyst-haired girl gazed upon the atrocious carnage without so much as a twitch of an eyebrow. Her eyes stared forward, even and cool.</p>
<p><em>“It seems the Dragon Lord’s mental domination has been undone,”</em> came an aging man’s voice.</p>
<p>“We’re not going after her anymore?”</p>
<p><em>“No. I know where the Dragon Lord is. She’s taken refuge in humankind’s final stronghold, the Imperial Capital.”</em></p>
<p>“Why did she go there?”</p>
<p><em>“That is yet unclear. The Dragon Lord’s actions are inexplicable.”</em></p>
<p>“…I see. Understood.” Rivaiz nodded lightly. “Then I’ll continue as is…”</p>
<p>The Lord of the Seas extended a hand forward, dragging the Voids and the entire Void territory into a massive whirlpool.</p>
