<p class="noindent">At last, practice was finished for the day.</p>
<p>The fourth princess’s sudden visit was an unexpected event, but the eighteenth platoon mostly completed the schedule Riselia had set. Leonis expected the first day of their training camp to have a lighter regimen, but it ended up being fairly heavy.</p>
<p>Elfiné was out of breath, which made sense since she usually skipped out on stamina exercises, but Regina had also collapsed on the ground, gasping for breath.</p>
<p><em>The human body is so troublesome.</em></p>
<p>Leonis, who had only a ten-year-old’s stamina unless he used sorcery to reinforce his body, was also quite exhausted. The only ones who were okay were Sakuya, who looked perfectly fine, and Riselia.</p>
<p><em>I’m starting to miss my undead body.</em></p>
<p>He eyed his undead minion, who wasn’t showing any signs of fatigue, with envious eyes.</p>
<p>“I prepared more thorough practice for everyone tomorrow!” Riselia said enthusiastically.</p>
<p><a id="page-72"></a>“Ugh… Lady Selia, are you sure we’re not doing too much…?” Regina asked feebly.</p>
<p>“We have less than a week for the Holy Sword Dance Festival. Besides, Miss Finé went to such lengths to get us such a wonderful facility!” Riselia exclaimed, placing a hand on her waist proudly. “Although I guess overexerting won’t be good for us. I’ll extend our lunch break.”</p>
<p>Regina’s expression lit up at once.</p>
<p>“Oh! Then I think I’ll get a massage at the hotel. Wanna come with me, Miss Finé?”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Yes, let’s go together later.” Elfiné nodded, rubbing her hips.</p>
<p>“I’ll go hunting for taiyaki in the capital,” Sakuya said, vanishing Raikirimaru into thin air and pulling out a guidebook from her pocket.</p>
<p><em>…How do you hunt for taiyaki, exactly?</em> Leonis wondered dryly.</p>
<p>“Okay… What about you, Leo?” Riselia questioned.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord paused for thought. He’d never experienced a massage offered by a high-class resort before. However, he got the feeling that if he went to get one, Shary would get mad and insist that giving him massages was her job… Which left investigating the capital.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll go take in the sights of the Central Garden,” Leonis decided.</p>
<p>“All right. I’ll show you around, then,” Riselia replied.</p>
<p>“You know your way around the capital, Miss Selia?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Riselia bobbed her head and held up an index finger. “I’ve come here a few times with my father on official business. I can show you around the Central Garden’s famous spots.”</p>

<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-73"></a>Riselia and Leonis rented a small vehicle from the hotel and drove over to the Central Garden. While holding on to Riselia’s waist, Leonis watched the city scenery sail past him. Much like the Seventh Assault Garden, the streets were lined with roadside trees for water filtering.</p>
<p>“Is that building the palace?” Leonis inquired, pointing at a gigantic structure visible in the distance.</p>
<p>It was studded with countless towering spires, like a stonework castle. It stood out among the laminated structures of the area, and it seemed like there was a clear history and tradition to it.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Apparently, this castle existed before the empire was established, and it was broken off into blocks and moved here,” Riselia explained. “The interior has been reconstructed, of course.”</p>
<p>“So the emperor lives there?” Leonis asked.</p>
<p>“The royals live in a different estate. The palace is only used for government affairs.”</p>
<p><em>Hmm. It seems they make clear distinctions between those two aspects.</em></p>
<p>A thousand years ago, human kings lived in rooms within the palace.</p>
<p>Leonis brought up another question. “Where are the military facilities?”</p>
<p>“The royal guard’s garrison is on the palace grounds. Their primary tasks are guarding the palace and the three royal houses. Large-scale military facilities for fighting the Voids are concentrated on floats two, four, and nine. Of course, there are also units stationed on each of the others.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>The two left the main street and went into a park plaza atop a gently sloping hill.</p>
<p>“This is the victory memorial square,” Riselia said. “Sixty-two <a id="page-74"></a>years ago, the emperor and the Holy Sword Knights beat the Void forces. My grandfather took part in the battle, too.”</p>
<p>“Then that statue over there is of the emperor?” Leonis cast his gaze to the center of the plaza, where a gigantic statue of a young man bravely wielding a sword stood.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s a re-creation of His Grace manifesting his Holy Sword, Excalibur. The emperor’s Excalibur still remains the strongest of all confirmed Holy Swords.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Excalibur. A Holy Sword with the same name as the one Leonis manifested.</p>
<p>“Hmm. Is it possible for the same Holy Sword to reside with two different people?” Leonis questioned gingerly.</p>
<p>“I’m…not sure,” Riselia replied. “Plenty of Holy Swords have similar abilities, but I’ve never heard of two people manifesting the same one.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Leonis’s Holy Sword wasn’t shaped like a blade but, rather, a pistol. Maybe it was just a coincidence, and the inscription on the weapon was a coincidence.</p>
<p><em>I need to investigate my Holy Sword more thoroughly.</em></p>
<p>As they drove through the city, a building with a distinct octagonal roof stood out. This was the cathedral for the Human Church, the official religion of the Human Empire. The Human Church was a fundamentally different faith compared to the Holy Sect the Dark Lords’ Armies had faced a thousand years ago.</p>
<p>In this era, humanity was ignorant of the existence of the Luminous Powers that once reigned supreme over the world. Instead, the Human Church worshipped the power of the planet, which was said to be the source of the Holy Swords’ strength. Additionally, the Human Church was established alongside the Human <a id="page-75"></a>Integration Project and accepted other people’s faiths, integrating their beliefs.</p>
<p>A more exclusive faith would likely have failed to unify all of humanity.</p>
<p><em>A religion meant to rally all people together, eh…? The Holy Sect has brought me much grief in the past, but perhaps I won’t have to crush this new kind of worship.</em></p>
<p>For the time being, the Human Church wasn’t an enemy to Leonis’s reformed Dark Lords’ Armies.</p>
<p><em>But Nefakess Reizaad is masquerading as a priest.</em></p>
<p>Much like how Leonis hid as an Excalibur Academy student, Nefakess played the part of a holy man to blend in with the humans.</p>
<p><em>Or perhaps the Human Church is under his control…</em></p>
<p>Since Leonis was at headquarters in the capital, it was the perfect chance to confirm the truth.</p>
<p>As they passed through the plaza, Riselia and Leonis came to another wide road lined with tall buildings. “Are you hungry, Leo?” Riselia asked, slowing the vehicle down.</p>
<p>“…Y-yes, I suppose I am.”</p>
<p>Leonis had kept quiet about it to save face in front of his minion, but he was pretty famished after the morning’s intense activities.</p>
<p>“Then why don’t we stop somewhere for lunch?”</p>
<p>Riselia parked the vehicle on the shoulder of the road and looked around.</p>
<p>“What do you want to eat, Leo? Hmm. I’ll admit I’m not very familiar with the capital’s stores…”</p>
<p>“You can leave that to me,” Leonis said, gallantly retrieving his terminal. “I had my eyes set on a few promising spots.”</p>
<p>“Huhhh?!” Riselia looked surprised. “Leo, when did you start acting like one of those popular boys?!”</p>
<p><a id="page-76"></a>“Hmm.” Leonis nodded vaguely and called up information from Shary’s list of the top 100 eateries in the area.</p>

<p class="space-break1"><em>The world still looks a bit warped to me.</em></p>
<p>The meeting plaza of the Central Garden’s underground station twisted and spun with possibilities.</p>
<p>Sakuya returned her eye patch over her shining, amber-colored eye. It no longer throbbed with agonizing pain like before, but since using it made multiple possible futures overlap in her field of vision, she couldn’t very well have it active during her day-to-day life.</p>
<p><em>He said I’ll get used to it in time, but…</em></p>
<p>Zol Vadis—the so-called Dark Lord who controlled the Seventh Assault Garden from the shadows. He was the one who had bequeathed to her this mystic eye of time. His identity was a mystery, but true to his title of Dark Lord, he certainly possessed overwhelming powers that surpassed human understanding.</p>
<p>When the Void Lord Shardark appeared and consumed the sealed Sakura Orchid guardian deity, it was the Dark Lord who single-handedly defeated the monster. That much was a fact.</p>
<p><em>I need more power.</em></p>
<p>To take revenge on the Voids, Sakuya had accepted the power of the Demon Sword into her body. Yet that still wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>On the day of the most recent attack, a blue-haired swordswoman had appeared before Sakuya and unsealed Raijinki. It was Setsura, Sakuya’s sister, who supposedly had died nine years ago. It would only be a matter of time before they crossed blades again. When that time came, Sakuya needed to be ready. She had to master this eye.</p>
<p><a id="page-77"></a>“Will I stop being human when I do?” she whispered mockingly, pressing a hand on the eye patch.</p>
<p>“Frost Age?” a voice called out to her from behind in the crowd.</p>
<p>Turning around, Sakuya found a girl in shorts and a jacket approaching her, waving her hand in a friendly manner. Long, slender limbs, tanned skin, and pointed ears. A dark elf…</p>
<p><em>Lena Darkleaf…</em>, Sakuya recalled.</p>
<p>Lena was one of the commanders of the Demon Wolf Pack, a force under Zol Vadis’s command. Next to her was another girl, her mouth covered by a cloth. Sakuya knew this to be Arle Kirlesio, an elf she’d met on the ruined Third Assault Garden.</p>
<p>She, too, had joined the Dark Lord’s ranks. Her motives in doing so were a mystery to Sakuya, and the two had an unspoken understanding that neither would ask the other for their reasons… But surely, she had some goal.</p>
<p>“Hmm, what does ‘Frost Age’ mean?” Sakuya asked Lena.</p>
<p>“It’s your code name for when we’re operating in the city. I came up with it!” the dark elf explained proudly, puffing up her modest chest.</p>
<p>“I see…,” Sakuya muttered dryly.</p>
<p>“Incidentally, my code name is Shadow,” Lena explained. “And hers is Sword Fairy.”</p>
<p>“Sword Fairy?” Sakuya repeated quietly, confused.</p>
<p>“I—I didn’t come up with it…,” Arle clarified, her cheeks flushing beneath her cloth.</p>
<p>“Well, fine. So am I supposed to guard you?” Sakuya asked.</p>
<p>Lena nodded. “Yes. After all, things could get very messy.”</p>
<p>The three of them were headed to the base of an anti-national terrorist organization hidden in the capital. There were many criminal and anarchist organizations hiding in Camelot’s shadows. The Dark Lord Zol Vadis wanted to unite all those groups under his control.</p>
<p><a id="page-78"></a>Lena was to handle negotiations, and Arle and Sakuya were there as bodyguards, and to show off their strength to the various criminal factions.</p>
<p><em>I do think Arle alone would have been enough for this</em>, Sakuya thought.</p>
<p>Sakuya had once faced Arle Kirlesio in battle in the ruined city. Her skills were a match for Sakuya’s, if not greater, but this time Sakuya had to tag along, as it was a test of her loyalty to the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>“Will this take long?” Sakuya inquired.</p>
<p>Shrugging, Lena answered, “Depends on them.”</p>
<p>Sakuya felt guilty about abandoning her upperclassmen, but she would likely have to skip the afternoon training session.</p>

<p class="space-break1">Sitting on a bench beneath a shady tree, Elfiné linked her Eye of the Witch to her terminal. She was in a small park just outside the trial grounds. Since the area also doubled as an experimental plant, there were genetically modified ancient timbers growing in an orderly line.</p>
<p><em>Now then. Let the battle begin.</em></p>
<p>By using the equipment in the facility as a relay, Elfiné connected to the Astral Garden. Doing so was easy enough using the Eye of the Witch.</p>
<p><em>The only problems are the Phillet Company’s independent networks.</em></p>
<p>They were accessible only through special facilities in the Shangri-la Resort and the Phillet Company’s primary site on float four. They were completely disconnected from the outside network, so linking to them was challenging.</p>
<p><em>I’ll need Cait Sith to physically infiltrate the system.</em></p>
<p>Since it was exceedingly difficult for outsiders to gain admission <a id="page-79"></a>to float four, Elfiné decided to ignore it for the time being and focused on taking control of the Shangri-la Resort first. She had the aquarium, casino, stadium, and theater to consider.</p>
<p><em>I’ll have to prioritize the casino.</em></p>
<p>This was one place in the capital where gambling was considered legal. But that was only a front for wealthy citizens. Its true function was as a Phillet Company–owned meeting place for secret deals between the royalty and the nobility.</p>
<p>What’s more, it was a stronghold owned by Elfiné’s brother, Finzel Phillet. That meant that Elfiné would stand out if she tried to enter. Claiming she came to the casino to have fun wouldn’t work as an excuse.</p>
<p><em>I should leave Cait Sith with someone.</em></p>
<p>But who was the best person for it? As Elfiné thought on it, she got a call on her terminal.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>It wasn’t one of the eighteenth platoon members. The ID code was unfamiliar. Elfiné had been careful and doubted anyone had caught her snooping.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>With a hint of stress, she tapped on the terminal. And then…</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Ah, you finally picked up, Finé,”</strong></span> a familiar voice greeted her.</p>
<p>“…Clauvia.” Elfiné sighed. She nearly ended the call right there on impulse but reconsidered at the last second. Her sister had contacted her. Perhaps she had some information? Elfiné couldn’t let her guard down, though. Clauvia was removed from the Phillet Company, much like Elfiné. However, that made her even more unpredictable than their older brothers, in a way.</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“I see you’re back in the capital.”</strong></span></p>
<p>“…I didn’t come back here because you asked me to.”</p>
<p><a id="page-80"></a><span class="special"><strong>“You’re participating in the Holy Sword Dance Festival, though, right?”</strong></span></p>
<p>“Only by coincidence.”</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Heh-heh. You sure about that?”</strong></span> Elfiné could feel her sister grinning. <span class="special"><strong>“Since you’ve come all the way to the capital, how do you feel about helping the emperor’s younger brother and me?”</strong></span></p>
<p>“Sorry, Clauvia, but I’m busy.”</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“I see. Oh, well. Then let me give you a warning.”</strong></span></p>
<p>“What warning?”</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Brother dearest is planning something for the Holy Sword Dance Festival.”</strong></span></p>
<p>“Finzel?” Elfiné’s eyes widened in surprise. “What’s he scheming?”</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“I’m afraid I don’t know that much. But you’d best be cautious. Especially if you go up against the Academia unit from the Fourth Assault Garden.”</strong></span></p>
<p>The Academia was a Holy Swordsman–rearing facility established by the Phillet Company, and Finzel was enrolled there.</p>
<p><em>What is he plotting for the Holy Sword Dance Festival?</em></p>
<p>She couldn’t blindly believe what Clauvia had told her, but she had to be wary of the possibility that her warning was true.</p>
<p>“…Thank you for the warning.”</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Oh my. Did you just honestly thank me, Finé? <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>”</strong></span></p>
<p>“I’m hanging up now, Clauvia.”</p>
<p><span class="special"><strong>“Ah, wait! There’s one more thing!”</strong></span> Clauvia’s voice suddenly turned serious. <span class="special"><strong>“Deinfraude Phillet—that monster—is back in the capital.”</strong></span></p>
<p>“…!” Elfiné’s fingers trembled at the mention of the name. Count Deinfraude Phillet was her father, the governor of the Fourth Assault Garden, the ruler of the Phillet Foundation, and…her mother’s killer.</p>
<p><a id="page-81"></a><span class="special"><strong>“He was invited to spectate the Holy Sword Dance Festival. And Finé, he definitely knows you’re going to participate. So be careful.”</strong></span></p>
<p>“U-understood,” Elfiné managed.</p>
<p>Clauvia ended the call. A moment later, Elfiné felt something hit her forehead. Overhead, the blue sky had clouded over, and rain had begun to fall.</p>
<p><em>That’s strange. The Eye of the Witch predicted the weather should be clear until evening…</em></p>
<p>Black clouds moved in, and a flash of lightning crashed in the distance.</p>

<p class="space-break1">“Hmm, this place’s food is so good!” Riselia cupped her cheeks in bliss as she tasted her clam pasta. “Your recommendation was right on the money, Leo. <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>”</p>
<p>“I’m glad to hear that,” he replied, admittedly a bit relieved.</p>
<p>The restaurant Shary had recommended had a relaxed air; its interior design was tasteful, and the chef was quite skilled.</p>
<p><em>Hmm. Perhaps I should reassess my opinion of Shary’s intelligence-gathering skills.</em></p>
<p>Leonis wished she would put that skill to use for matters other than food, but she did a good job this time.</p>
<p><em>I should reward her later. Would a Great Hell Medallion perhaps be too generous…?</em></p>
<p>“Leo, you’ve got something on your mouth.” Riselia smiled and wiped his lips with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>“M-Miss Selia, I can take care of that on my own…” Leonis went red and turned his head away, yet she didn’t stop.</p>
<p>“Ah, stay still… There, all better.”</p>
