<p class="noindent">Sunlight filtered in through the curtains.</p>
<p>“Nnn… Mmm…”</p>
<p>Leonis, clad in his pajamas, sat up in bed and rubbed his eyes groggily. It was a top-class mattress, and his body sank right into its comfortable embrace. To one accustomed to sleeping in a stone coffin, lying in a bed like this was something he couldn’t quite get used to.</p>
<p><em>I feel like my bed in the dorm might have been better than this.</em></p>
<p>Leonis drew the curtains on the bed-side window. He looked over to the side and saw the mattress beside his was already empty. The sound of running water came from the bathroom. Riselia must have awoken ahead of him because she was already in the shower.</p>
<p><em>I should take this chance to check Shary’s report.</em></p>
<p>He lay down on the bed and activated his terminal. After tapping on it a few times, Leonis called up Shary’s report on the Demon Wolf Pack, the group he controlled under the guise of Zol Vadis.</p>
<p>First was the underground dungeon. Construction of the <a id="page-50"></a>Demon Lord’s Castle was well underway. Monsters were naturally appearing in the lower levels, and Leonis’s minions were using them for training. Lena Darkleaf was also preparing to negotiate with the capital’s underground organizations, as scheduled.</p>
<p><em>Hmm. Everything seems to be going swimmingly.</em></p>
<p>Leonis sent a reply that he acknowledged the progress update. The next report was on the capital’s recommended restaurants and was markedly lengthier than the previous one. Leonis made a mental note to check out the eateries.</p>
<p><em>Oh, a place with a real pizza oven… I see.</em></p>
<p>“Whatcha lookin’ at, kid? <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>” Leonis felt a pair of arms suddenly snake around him and embrace him from behind.</p>
<p>The Undead King jerked. “M-Miss Regina?!” He turned around, only to be met with Regina in a bathrobe and undergarments.</p>
<p><em>A little too casual, don’t you think?!</em></p>
<p>Her blond twintails were still wet, so she’d probably come right from the shower. Faint steam rose from her gently flushed skin, and Leonis caught the scent of floral shampoo.</p>
<p>“…Wait, what are you doing in our room?!” Leonis demanded.</p>
<p>“Lady Selia asked me to come over and give you a wake-up call,” Regina explained with a shrug.</p>
<p>“But why are you in your underwear?!”</p>
<p>“I figured getting dressed for this would just be a waste of time, so I came as is.”</p>
<p>“You walked around in a bathrobe?!”</p>
<p>The eighteenth platoon had free rein of the entire floor, so there wasn’t anyone else to see, but still…</p>
<p>“Plus, I figured it’d be a good way to bully you, kid.” The maid stuck out her tongue mischievously.</p>
<p><em>I knew it!</em> Leonis scolded himself for his carelessness. He’d completely let his guard down around her.</p>
