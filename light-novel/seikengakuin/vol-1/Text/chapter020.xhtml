<p><a id="page-118"></a>Elfiné placed a hand on Leonis’s skin and closed her eyes, and as if in response, the orbs began circling him.</p>
<p>“…Hmm. This is kind of a strange pattern.”</p>
<p>There was curiosity in Elfiné’s voice.</p>
<p>“R-really?” The boy’s heartbeat quickened.</p>
<p>“Yes. I can’t see the flow of your mana…”</p>
<p><em>…Damn. My mana obfuscation might be working too well…</em></p>
<p>“Erm, Miss Elfiné, can I ask you something?” Leonis hurriedly tried to change the subject.</p>
<p>“Of course. What is it?”</p>
<p>“Why did you join this platoon?”</p>
<p>Riselia was a borderline dropout who hadn’t been able to summon a Holy Sword. Leonis was genuinely curious as to why an upperclassman like Elfiné would join her team.</p>
<p><em>And then there’s the photo…</em></p>
<p>The question prompted Elfiné to hang her head for a moment before she whispered her reply.</p>
<p>“…I lost the power of my Holy Sword.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?” Leonis let slip without thinking. “What do you mean by that…?”</p>
<p>“This isn’t the Eye of the Witch’s true power.” Elfiné shook her head. “It’s only a limited ability.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I used to be an attacker focused on high firepower instead of an operator.”</p>
<p>“H-high firepower…?”</p>
<p>Leonis couldn’t believe that was true of such a nice, levelheaded, mature girl. Elfiné walked over to the picture and picked it up.</p>
<p>“The seventh platoon, the one I used to be a part of, was a skilled, well-balanced team. We were pretty high in the academy <a id="page-119"></a>rankings, and we even went on Void subjugation missions. But then…”</p>
<p>She paused, taking a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Six months ago, my platoon was attacked by Voids during a ruin investigation.”</p>
<p>“………”</p>
<p>She explained that a cunning pack of Voids had been waiting in the ruin. Elfiné’s group was caught in a trap, and by the time they noticed, it was too late. Soon after they encountered the enemy, the Voids began radiating a powerful signal that jammed the platoon’s communications and threw the chain of command into chaos. The Voids took the lives of two of the members of the squad…</p>
<p>Elfiné surviving was nothing more than a lucky coincidence.</p>
<p>No one had blamed her for abandoning her comrades and fleeing. Surviving and bringing data on the Voids back to Excalibur Academy was a Holy Swordsman’s mission, after all.</p>
<p>Even so, she couldn’t help but blame herself. Surviving filled her with guilt, and she kept torturing herself over it.</p>
<p>And so her Holy Sword lost its original power.</p>
<p>Elfiné’s fingers shivered as they traced along Leonis’s back. Each of the orbs hanging in the air illuminated faint light as if expressing her emotions…</p>
<p>“It was when I was in that sorry state that Riselia found me.”</p>
<p>Riselia visited Elfiné time and time again after she’d shut herself in her room, imploring her to join her platoon.</p>
<p>“At first, I kept saying no. But she was so earnest, I eventually gave in. See…?”</p>
<p>“…Yes, I see.”</p>
<p>It made sense to Leonis. Riselia did seem to have an odd power that allowed her to get her way in those kinds of situations. Perhaps it was charm…a charisma of sorts.</p>
<p><a id="page-120"></a>Elfiné took her hands off Leonis’s back. The light emitted by the hovering spheres changed to a subdued shade of green.</p>
<p>“All right, I finished registering your biological information. I’ll sync it up with the terminal.”</p>
<p>She got to her feet and started rapidly entering information into a tablet.</p>
<p>“…Okay, so, ‘Has a cute face but seems surprisingly preoccupied with breasts’… I… I see…” Elfiné turned to look at the boy with a mixed expression.</p>
<p><em>…Wait. What kind of data is this?!</em></p>
<p>“D-does biological data include that kind of thing, too?”</p>
<p>“Being a perv is bad, Leo.”</p>
<p>“Y-you misunderstand…!”</p>
<p>Elfiné scolded him, and Leonis protested. Then, the boy’s gaze suddenly fell on the screen of the other terminal sitting on the table.</p>
<p>It displayed a map of the area around Excalibur Academy. He did recall her mentioning that she was investigating the waters around these parts for a Void hive.</p>
<p>“Miss Elfiné, would it be all right if I took a look at that information later?”</p>
<p>“…? Sure, I don’t mind…” The young woman cocked her head to one side at his request.</p>

<p class="noindent">Leonis returned to his room with a spare tablet that Elfiné had lent him. Apparently, she had several of them handy.</p>
<p><em>…Is she some sort of collector?</em></p>
<p>He opened the door to his room. As he entered, he could hear the inviting sound of water running from deeper inside… Riselia <a id="page-121"></a>seemed to be taking a shower. Leonis gave a dry, loud cough and sat on his bed. As his fingers approached the tablet, he ran mana through it. The screen lit up, and a map dotted with red spots surfaced on the screen. It was data on Void locations over the last few months.</p>
<p><em>There really is a correlation…</em></p>
<p>Ogre, troll, chimera, wyvern… Those were all the names of monsters the Dark Lords’ Armies employed in their war against humanity. The Voids Leonis saw had the characteristics of some of those ancient beasts. And larger Voids seemed to appear predominantly around ancient ruins and battlefields.</p>
<p>Among all the locations, more Voids appeared to originate from somewhere below the seas where the Seventh Assault Garden now sat. This was where the Wasteland of Sidon once stood. The site of a battle between the Dark Lords’ Armies and the Six Heroes. The final resting places of countless monsters and undead, as well as the Archsage of the Six Heroes, Arakael Degradios, who had fused with the Holy Tree…</p>
<p><em>…Are Voids monsters of the past that have been transfigured by some sort of power?</em></p>
<p>He believed this theory to be sound. But even if that was the case, it still begged more questions. The remains of those ancient monsters should have disappeared long ago…</p>
<p><em>…And the Voids that took over the ruins disappeared after some time, too.</em></p>
<p>The cadavers of the Voids that Leonis had stored in his shadow had curiously vanished without a trace. Were the Voids invaders from another world or some type of weapon? But if they were weapons, they were a bit too diverse. Their reason for attacking mankind was still a complete mystery, as well.</p>
<p><em>…I may have to investigate this undersea nest of theirs.</em></p>
<p><a id="page-122"></a>These Voids could prove to be a great obstacle to the return of the Dark Lords’ Armies. And as the Undead King, having these entities running rampant through his territory was irksome.</p>
<p>Suddenly sensing a presence, Leonis shut off the tablet’s screen. The shadow at his feet wavered slightly.</p>
<p>“—I have returned, my lord.”</p>
<p>The umbral maid, Shary Shadow Assassin, silently appeared in the room. The black-haired girl twirled in place and bowed elegantly.</p>
<p>“Oh, Shary. Good work,” Leonis told her gratefully.</p>
<p>“Your words are wasted on me, my lord.”</p>
<p>“So did you gather any information pertaining to the current state of mankind?”</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>
<p>Shary presented Leonis with a large paper bag.</p>
<p>“What might this be?” the Undead King asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>“These are sweets, my lord. I believe they are called doughnuts.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Shary opened the bag, and a sweet scent wafted through the room.</p>
<p>“Have one.”</p>
<p>“………”</p>
<p>Leonis took a doughnut out of the bag and bit into it.</p>
<p>“…How is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s good.”</p>
<p>The sweetness of sugar filled his mouth. It was a taste that made him crave some tea.</p>
<p>“I’ve brought you something to drink, as well.”</p>
<p>“That’s considerate of you.”</p>
<p>“It’s called tapioca juice.”</p>
<p>It had an odd texture. Shary also began munching on a doughnut.</p>
