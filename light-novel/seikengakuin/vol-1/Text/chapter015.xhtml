<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter015">THE HOLY SWORD TRIAL</a></h1>
<p class="noindent">It was thus that Leonis made Riselia his minion…</p>
<p>Before going to the administration bureau for what was called a Holy Sword Trial, the two of them stopped for a light meal. At any rate, Leonis wasn’t undead anymore. He’d need sustenance, or he wouldn’t be able to use his sorcery properly.</p>
<p>“What would you do if I exposed your identity to the bureau?”</p>
<p>“…I’m not worried about that.”</p>
<p>If Riselia were to expose him, it would also come out that she was a vampire. That wasn’t an option for someone who aspired to be a Holy Swordswoman.</p>
<p>“…I—I know,” Riselia murmured grumpily.</p>
<p>“Regardless, a minion can’t betray its master.” A seal surfaced on Leonis’s hand, and he presented it to the young woman.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“A seal of dominion and subordination. It can be used to force a minion to obey—”</p>
<p>“N-no…! You mean, like, pervy things, too?!” Tears welled up in Riselia’s eyes.</p>
<p>“…Well, it’s possible. I won’t do anything like that, though.”</p>
<p><a id="page-82"></a>“…R-really?”</p>
<p>“Really,” answered Leonis, a bit exasperated.</p>
<p>…Some Dark Lords were known to use minions for such purposes. As the Undead King, Leonis had never subjected his minions to such treatment.</p>
<p>“…All right. I believe you, Leo.” Riselia nodded. “You were a gentleman when we were in the bath together. But what is a minion supposed to do?”</p>
<p>“A minion’s purpose in being is to defend their master, since this body has grown weak…”</p>
<p>Riselia giggled at his words.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, your big sister will keep you safe.” The girl patted his head somewhat happily.</p>
<p>The two then entered one of the school’s restaurants and claimed a table.</p>
<p><em>…A human body really is troublesome.</em></p>
<p>Leonis’s feelings had entirely flipped since his time in the bath. The newly undead Riselia, on the other hand, looked a bit anxious.</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m not really that hungry, but I can still eat normally, right?”</p>
<p>“Higher-ranking vampires can eat regular food, yes. It takes time to convert the nutrients into mana, though, so it’s a bit inefficient.” Leonis spoke in a whisper. “Also, unlike most vampires, you can walk around in daytime.”</p>
<p>A Vampire Queen was among the highest grade of undead creatures, rivaling even Elder Liches and Black Knights. It was a High Daywalker, dissimilar from the Nightwalker species of undead.</p>
<p>“…Oh, thank goodness.” Riselia sighed in relief.</p>
<p>A vampire who ate food was also useful in terms of camouflage.</p>
<p>“Erm, if you ever really feel to urge to drink blood, feel free to take it from me.”</p>
<p><a id="page-83"></a>He may have done it to save her life, but he’d still turned this girl who aspired to be a Holy Swordswoman into a vampire. The least he could do was share his blood whenever she needed it.</p>
<p>But when he said it, Riselia made a small, barely audible gulping sound.</p>
<p>“………”</p>
<p>Her ice-blue eyes were fixed intently on the nape of Leonis’s neck.</p>
<p>“…Um. Just a bit, though, all right?”</p>
<p>“N-no, that’s not what I…!” The girl turned away, her face flushing as red as a tomato. “I won’t drink blood, and I don’t want to forget my humanity.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, keep your voice down…!” Leonis looked around the nearby tables, flustered.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they’d come in at around three in the afternoon, so there weren’t too many students about. What few there were eyed their table and seemed to be whispering to one another.</p>
<p><em>…Did they hear what we just said?</em></p>
<p>He used a Sensory Expansion spell to listen in on their conversation.</p>
<p><em><span class="special1">“Check him out! Isn’t that kid, like, super cute?”</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="special1">“Uhhh. He’s still small. Are you into that or something?”</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="special1">“Yeah! Gotta pick ’em when they’re young and fresh.”</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="special1">“Whoa, you’ve got a serious criminal vibe. When kids that cute grow up, they become Dark Lords in the bedroom, know what I mean?”</span></em></p>
<p><em><span class="special1">“Stop it, that sounds bad… Ah, he looked over here. <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>”</span></em></p>
<p>One of the girls gave a mischievous smile and waved at him…which Leonis promptly ignored. Hearing the words <em>Dark Lord</em> did make his heart skip a beat, though.</p>
<p>“Watch what you’re saying…,” he warned Riselia.</p>
<p>The silver-haired girl hid her face awkwardly behind the menu.</p>
<p><a id="page-84"></a>“So did you decide what you’ll order?” she asked.</p>
<p>“…Bread will do.”</p>
<p>“Bread…? You mean this freshly baked bread?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that.”</p>
<p>“There’s lots of other stuff you could try. The food in this cafeteria is pretty good,” she said, pointing at a few menu items.</p>
<p>“Bread will do just fine. I don’t really know what all these other things are…,” Leonis said, cocking his head dubiously.</p>
<p><em>What is all this? Gratin…lasagna, pasta…?</em></p>
<p>These were all dishes Leonis had never heard of before. They likely didn’t exist a thousand years ago. Or maybe they did but only adorning the tables of royalty and nobility. Whichever it was, they certainly hadn’t been part of Leonis’s world.</p>
<p>Riselia suddenly poked Leonis’s forehead with her index finger.</p>
<p>“Just bread simply isn’t enough. You need balanced nutrition.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather not have an undead preach to me about nutr— Ah.”</p>
<p>By the time he stopped himself, it was already too late.</p>
<p>“…Nnnnn…!”</p>
<p>Tears began forming in Riselia’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I—I get it, okay? I’m sorry!”</p>
<p>Leonis offered a hurried apology. A Dark Lord begging his minion for forgiveness was an odd sight to be sure, but it wasn’t like she’d willingly become undead.</p>
<p>“…Meanie,” Riselia whispered sullenly.</p>
<p>“…I’m sorry,” Leonis apologized again, which she regarded with a little sniff.</p>
<p>“In that case, try this season’s vegetable-garnished pasta. Okay?”</p>
<p>“Fine, I’ll have that.” Leonis nodded.</p>
<p>Riselia ordered them the pasta and a salad.</p>
<p>“Your big sister will cover for you today. Once they issue your permanent ID card, use your own credits, okay?”</p>
<p><a id="page-85"></a>“Credits?”</p>
<p>“That’s the currency we use in the Assault Gardens. Completing tasks for the academy earns you rewards.”</p>
<p>“Oh, money. I see…”</p>
<p>Leonis smiled boastfully and pulled a gold coin from his shadow. It was a large Reidoa gold coin, issued by the Schkarest Empire. A commoner could live for the rest of his or her life off one of these coins, and Leonis had over twenty thousand of them hidden away in the Realm of Shadows. He’d taken them as military funds from Necrozoa’s vaults, planning to use them for the upcoming revival of the Dark Lords’ Armies.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“…What? What is this…?”</p>
<p>Riselia’s reaction to seeing the coin was lacking, to say the least.</p>
<p>“Huh…? It’s a Reidoa coin. One of these is worth enough to buy this entire restaurant.”</p>
<p>“Well, erm… I don’t think they take that kind of money here…,” Riselia said with a mixed expression. “The Seventh Assault Garden only accepts credits.”</p>
<p>“Wh-what…?” Leonis was dumbstruck. “B-but even if I can’t use it as currency, isn’t pure gold rare and valuable…?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s pure gold. But gold isn’t that rare of a metal.” Riselia smiled at him cheerily.</p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>
<p>“It’s used in decoration, but… Actually, the gold we refine is probably even purer than this.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>In an instant, the vast troves of wealth amassed in the Treasury of Shadows became worthless.</p>
<p>Leonis could only moan in despair.</p>
<p><a id="page-86"></a>But as he did…</p>
<p>“Oh, is that an old coin? Classy thing you’ve got there.”</p>
<p>A voice, cool like the wind, reached Leonis’s ears. Turning around, he was faced with a girl curiously eyeing the coin in his hand. Her hair was a shade of azure reminiscent of the sky.</p>
<p>She wore her hair short. At first glance, one might mistake her for a beautiful young man. However, her plump chest made a clear outline below her white outfit. She was short, just a bit taller than Leonis’s ten-year-old body. Her outfit was different from Riselia’s. The top of her uniform was casually draped over some sort of eccentric getup. Her eyes held the calm composure of a gorgeous young woman.</p>
<p>“Ah, Sakuya…” Riselia raised her eyes to meet Sakuya’s and waved.</p>
<p><em>…They’re acquainted, from the looks of things.</em></p>
<p>“Isn’t there a tactical drill today?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but it was painfully boring. I snuck out,” the short-haired beauty said and then turned her gaze to Leonis. “Are you the boy capable of using a Holy Sword…?”</p>
<p>“You’ve heard about Leo?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Elfiné told me about him. You were found in a ruin, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I was abducted by the Voids until Selia saved me…”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Well, whatever happened, it’s a good thing you’re safe.” The short-haired girl silently extended her right hand. “I’m Sakuya Sieglinde. Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>“Leonis Magnus.” Leonis returned the handshake.</p>
<p>Her hand was small and slightly cold. Unmistakably a girl’s hand. But the moment he grasped it, Leonis realized something.</p>
<p><em>…This is the hand of one who lives by the sword.</em></p>
<p><a id="page-87"></a>She looked to be about fourteen or fifteen years old. Just how much training had she endured to reach such a level at this age…?</p>
<p>“Hmm, Leo, is it? A good name. Invokes the image of a lion.” The girl smiled, letting go of his hand.</p>
<p>“Sakuya is our platoon’s vanguard attacker,” Riselia explained.</p>
<p><em>…I see, they’re in the same platoon.</em></p>
<p>Leonis was genuinely curious as to how Riselia had managed to tempt a swordswoman like Sakuya to her side.</p>
<p>“By the way, are you two here for lunch?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We’re going to eat and then go register Leo’s Holy Sword.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Sorry if I’m interrupting, then.”</p>
<p>“You’re not interrupting anything, Sakuya. Have you had lunch yet?”</p>
<p>“Mmm, well…” Sakuya averted her gaze and fell silent for a moment. “I actually don’t have any credits on me today.”</p>
<p>“What? What did you waste all your credits on?!” Riselia raised her voice in surprise.</p>
<p>“Gambling.”</p>
<p>“…So it’s your own fault.”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>Riselia reached a cold conclusion, to which Leonis nodded and agreed.</p>
<p>“…Th-that’s wrong!” Sakuya shook her head defensively. “I just, well, I got a little fired up, and…”</p>
<p>“………” Riselia’s scrutiny grew sharper.</p>
<p>…Contrary to how cool and collected this Sakuya person looked, she was pretty hopeless.</p>
<p>“I ran out of credits, so the other party agreed they’d let me off the hook if I showed them my breasts. I was about to take off my shirt when a professor on patrol walked in…”</p>
<p><a id="page-88"></a>“S-Sakuya! Y-you can’t do that—you’re a girl!” Riselia grabbed Sakuya by the shoulders and started shaking her.</p>
<p>“No sweat. The other person was a girl, too.”</p>
<p>“…I, uh, does that make it any better?” Riselia wondered with a perplexed expression.</p>
<p>Sakuya did have an appearance that looked like it might be popular among girls, too, but…</p>
<p>“Anyway, one thing led to another, and I’m broke.” The words almost sounded boastful coming from Sakuya.</p>
<p>Riselia give a small sigh.</p>
<p>“What am I going to do with you? Fine, I’ll treat you to lunch.”</p>
<p>“No, Miss Riselia, I couldn’t…”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I got some credits from the ruin investigation.” The silver-haired girl presented her card.</p>
<p>“Then I owe you one. Truthfully, my stomach’s been growling quite a bit for a while now.” Sakuya bowed her head deeply and politely took a seat at their table.</p>
<p>“What did you order, kid?”</p>
<p>“Some food I’ve never heard of before.”</p>
<p>“A daredevil, are you? I think I’ll go for some pancakes.”</p>
<p>“Sakuya, you can’t live on just sweets,” Riselia chimed in.</p>
<p>“You’ve absolutely nothing to worry about. I won’t gain any weight.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I…,” Riselia said, holding her temples in a gesture of exhaustion.</p>
<p>As they waited for their dishes to arrive, Leonis brought up a question that bothered him.</p>
<p>“Erm… Miss Sakuya, what’s that outfit you’re wearing?”</p>
<p>“Oh, this? It’s my homeland’s…the traditional garb of the Sakura Orchid.” Sakuya nodded. “…It’s a memento of my elder sister.”</p>
