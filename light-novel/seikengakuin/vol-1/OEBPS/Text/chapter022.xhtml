<p>“I’ve brought all sorts of other delicacies as well. Like this stretching ice cream…” Shary started taking an assortment of sweets out of her paper bag.</p>
<p>“Wait, wait…”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“That’s enough about food. Don’t you have any other data to share with me?”</p>
<p>“………”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you spent all this time playing outside.”</p>
<p>“………”</p>
<p>The umbral maid looked away, unable to meet her master’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s fine… I suppose even their cuisine is a good indicator of mankind’s current cultural level.” Leonis sighed.</p>
<p>“I did gather some information, however.” Shary cleared her throat. “There is no one in this city who seems to know about the Dark Lords…”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I assumed as much…”</p>
<p>According to Shary’s intelligence, the citizens of this city were apparently unfamiliar with the gods of old or the war between the Dark Lords and the Six Heroes one thousand years ago. The fact that no one knew about such a great war was quite jarring, to say the least.</p>
<p><em>It’s as if someone’s wiped the past from the face of history…</em></p>
<p>Leonis decided he would go to Excalibur Academy’s library tomorrow to look into it on his own.</p>
<p>“…Understood. Continue your investigation.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord.”</p>
<p>Shary nodded and…suddenly turned in the direction of the sound of running water in the bathroom.</p>
<p><a id="page-125"/>“I see you’ve made that girl your minion.”</p>
<p>“I did,” Leonis confirmed.</p>
<p>“Ah. So you indiscriminately make everyone you come across into your minion, my lord,” Shary said, pouting.</p>
<p>“What are you getting angry over?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about. You’re a dummy, my lord…”</p>
<p>“How can you call your master a ‘dummy’? Now, listen and be amazed…”</p>
<p>“…What is it?”</p>
<p>“That girl, she’s a Vampire Queen. The highest rank an undead minion can achieve. And she’s recently awakened the mysterious power of a Holy Sword. Should I raise her properly, she will be a great confidant for the newly re-formed Dark Lords’ Armies.” Leonis gave a boastful smirk, as if to say, “How do you like <em>that</em>?!” Shary, however, merely scowled in further displeasure.</p>
<p>“A confidant… I see.”</p>
<p>“Are you still upset over something?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. I hate you, my lord!” Miffed, Shary turned away from him and returned to his shadow.</p>
<p>“…What’s her problem? I never could understand what that girl was thinking.”</p>
<p>Leonis heaved an exasperated sigh and rolled onto the bed. He stared, unblinking, at the ceiling.</p>
<p><em>…Still, this world really has changed.</em></p>
<p>He was suddenly overcome with loneliness, as if there were a hole in his heart. Had <em>she</em> really reincarnated in this new era? Would he truly be able to rebuild the Dark Lords’ Armies in this world devoid of demons and monsters…?</p>
<p><em>…No, a Dark Lord like myself can’t afford to be so timid.</em> Leonis smiled wryly.</p>
<p><a id="page-126"/>He would have to seek her out. And if that meant hiding in this form, then that’s what he would do.</p>
<p><em>Besides, this isn’t all bad…</em></p>
<p>It may have been accidental, but he’d obtained a powerful vampire minion. She may have been inexperienced, but Riselia showed promise. With the Undead King’s guidance, she’d surely become a promising retainer to him.</p>
<p>That’s when he heard the bathroom door click open.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Reflexively, the Dark Lord turned his gaze toward the door. Gorgeous silver hair came into view… Riselia, dripping with water, emerged with a bath towel wrapped around her body.</p>
<p>“Oh, Leo. You can use the bath now, if you want.”</p>
<p><em>…See, you’re too naive!</em></p>
<p>Once again, she treated him like a child. Leonis was at his wit’s end.</p>

<p class="noindent">On that same day, in the early morning…</p>
<p>Something awakened on the seafloor directly below the Seventh Assault Garden. It was one of the Six Heroes, the one praised for being the wisest of all mankind. The one who, long ago, had cast aside his human form to fuse with the Holy Tree.</p>
<p>It was the Archsage, Arakael Degradios.</p>
<p>But his form had long since changed from what it once was, becoming a massive seedbed producing denizens of nothingness—Voids…</p>
<p>However. A small fraction of the man once called the Archsage still remained within this new form, and it sensed the revival of his sworn nemesis.</p>
<p><a id="page-127"/><em>…Undead… K…ing… Unnnndeaaaaad…Kiiiiiiiiiinnng…</em></p>
<p>Ancient hatred awakened a soul festering in emptiness. The roots of the Holy Tree writhed eerily below the water. Countless Voids birthed themselves from knots in its trunk.</p>
<p><em>Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!</em></p>
<p>The flock of Voids raised their voices in celebration, unknown to those above. They cheered as one would to praise the return of a king…</p>

<p><span class="special">“Roger, thirteenth platoon. Proceed with your survey, but be careful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="special">“Roger that— Hold on. What’s that…?”</span></p>
<p>A research team of Holy Swordsmen, diving underwater with the power of a water-type Holy Sword, raised their voices in alarm.</p>
<p><span class="special">“Number 03, what’s wrong?!”</span></p>
<p><span class="special">“Wh-what the…what the hell is that…? Aaah, aaaaaaaaaaaah!”</span></p>
<p>The sight before the man’s eyes struck fear into his soul.</p>
<p><span class="special">“Calm down, Number 03. Please respond…”</span></p>
<p><span class="special">“Are those…? Are those all Voids…?!”</span></p>
<p>The man’s terrified voice vanished in a wave of static.</p>
