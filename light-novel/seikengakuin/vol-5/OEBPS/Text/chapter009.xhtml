<p>“Very well. Then I’ll simply do whatever I can to protect you from the academy’s hunting patrol,” Sakuya declared, gently patting Blackas’s back.</p>
<p>Raiou then directed a sharp gaze at her. “Princess Sakuya. Certainly, you didn’t come here just for that?”</p>
<p>“…No,” Sakuya admitted. “I had a feeling you’d catch on.”</p>
<p>Raiou glanced at Eika and Kuroyuki, wordlessly asking them to leave. The two silently obliged.</p>
<p>After a breath, Sakuya began to explain. “It seems people with the same power as me are beginning to appear.”</p>
<p>“…The same power as you, Princess?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Demon Swords.”</p>
<p>Demon Swords were a power different from that granted by the planet, the Holy Swords. They housed a dark and diabolical strength. Sakuya came to possess one when she was six.</p>
<p>She would never forget how it happened. It was the same day the Voids destroyed the Sakura Orchid. Sakuya’s heart burned with anger over the loss of her parents and sister, and it was then that someone had appeared before her. An eerie shadow that called itself the goddess’s apostle.</p>
<p>The specter reached its hand out to Sakuya, and said, “<em>If you desire power, embrace the emptiness.</em>”</p>
<p>Oddly enough, Sakuya felt no fear. It wasn’t a question of yes or no, for there was no reason to deny the offer. And on that day, Sakuya had been granted the power of a Demon Sword and became a vengeful, demonic swordswoman.</p>
<p>Wielding the weapon had gradually corrupted her body with the power of the Voids. Yet even knowing this, Sakuya submitted herself and used the Demon Sword’s strength to cut the Voids down.</p>
<p><em>I need all the might I can gather, if I’m going to kill that man.</em></p>
<p>The man who took her parents, her sister, and her homeland from her was called Shardark Void Lord, a humanoid Void.</p>
<p>Seeing the cold, sharp light that filled Sakuya’s eyes, Raiou regarded her with a pained expression. “I understand. The Murakumo have been putting all their efforts into investigating the rumors.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I appreciate it.” Sakuya bowed her head to the old man. As the two continued speaking over the matter, the black wolf sitting on the veranda listened in, its ears perked upright at attention.</p>

<p class="space-break1">Leaving her sister behind, Elfiné returned to the Seventh Assault Garden and called a particular individual. They chose to meet in a coffee shop in a large commercial building in the Central Garden. Few people were sitting at the tables at this time of day, so Elfiné didn’t need to worry about being overheard.</p>
<p>The memory device her sister gave her was full of details about experiments the Phillet Company was conducting in cooperation with the military.</p>
<p><em>Forcibly evolving the power of the Holy Swords to allow humankind to transcend into its second phase…</em></p>
<p>According to the data, the Phillet Company was administering medicine to subjects and had been running multiple tests, including mental manipulations. These procedures went on to shatter the subjects’ psyches beyond all repair. Ultimately, the experiments did not yield the desired results.</p>
<p><em>This is clearly insane.</em></p>
<p>The power of a Holy Sword was linked to the wielder’s soul and psyche. As a Holy Swordsman matured, so did their weapon. The opposite was also true, however. A traumatizing incident could make one lose some or all of their Holy Sword’s abilities.</p>
<p><em>I’m the perfect example of that</em>, Elfiné thought with a self-deprecating smile. She reached for her glass of water.</p>
<p>“Did I keep you waiting?”</p>
<p>Elfiné turned around at the question. There she found a large young man with short red hair. It was Liat Guinness, the Holy Swordsman who had been dispatched by Excalibur Academy to the Sixth Assault Garden, and had only recently been relieved of that duty. He’d accompanied the expedition to the tundra, guarding those excavating the ice block.</p>
<p>Six months ago, he had been the captain of the seventh platoon. The very same squad Elfiné had also been a part of. She had last seen him during the Holy Light Festival.</p>
<p>“Sorry for calling you out of nowhere like that,” Elfiné apologized.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I still see myself as your captain.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Liat sat down in the seat opposite Elfiné’s. “So what is it you wanted to ask me about?”</p>
<p>“Yes…” Elfiné took a deep breath before going further. “Have you heard about the recent incidents of Holy Swords going out of control at the academy?”</p>
<p>Liat’s expression stiffened for a moment. “…Where did you hear about that?”</p>
<p>“Who do you take me for?” Elfiné questioned dryly.</p>
<p>“The seventh platoon’s…all-seeing witch. That’s what we used to call you,” Liat answered, shrugging as if he’d given up.</p>
<p>Someone had taken over the failed D Project’s experiments and continued them here in the Seventh Assault Garden within Excalibur Academy.</p>
<p>In order to confirm what her sister had told her, Elfiné had used the Astral Garden to access the administration bureau and analyze the data. Then she discovered that the Holy Swords of several students had gone out of control over the last few weeks for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>Elfiné assumed that, as part of the executive committee, Liat might be privy to something. Evidently, her hunch was correct.</p>
<p>“Yes, there have been more than a few occurrences recently where students have lost control of their Holy Swords. It was brought to our attention over at the executive committee.”</p>
<p>“And the administration bureau isn’t going to go public about it?”</p>
<p>“No. It would just cause needless concern among the civilians.”</p>
<p>“Right…” Elfiné could understand that decision. Holy Swordsmen had to be viewed as heroes who defended people from the Voids. Losing that trust could inspire major civil unrest.</p>
<p>“Has the bureau determined the cause behind this?” Elfiné asked.</p>
<p>“They say it’s currently under investigation. I don’t know the details myself. Until recently, I was stationed on the Sixth, after all. Some are speculating its mental shock from having witnessed Stampedes, or maybe the after-effects of a Void mental attack.”</p>
<p>Roughly two months ago, the Seventh Assault Garden had weathered a Void Stampede. For many students, it was their first real battle against the Voids. In light of that, the rise in unstable emotions wasn’t surprising.</p>
<p>“That reminds me…,” Liat began. “All the ones who lost control said something about hearing a voice.”</p>
<p>Elfiné knit her brow. “…A voice?”</p>
<p>“Yes, they claimed a goddess spoke to them in their heads.”</p>
<p>“A goddess’s…voice…”</p>
<p>“Auditory hallucinations could be a symptom. That’s about all I know, though. And I’m sure I don’t need to tell you, but this is all confidential information for the executive committee.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m aware. Thank you, Liat,” Elfiné replied, bowing her head to him gratefully.</p>
<p><em>So Excalibur Academy’s administration bureau is involved with the D Project, but…</em> The “goddess” Liat mentioned weighed on Elfiné’s mind. <em>I’ll have to dig a little more and see if the Phillet Company is still connected.</em></p>
