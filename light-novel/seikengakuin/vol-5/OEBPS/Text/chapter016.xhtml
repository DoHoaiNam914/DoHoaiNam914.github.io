<p>“…I see. Continue your research, then. And if you find any who look like they might be of use for the Dark Lords’ Armies, find a way to recruit them,” instructed Leonis.</p>
<p>“Understood,” Blackas answered.</p>
<p>Shary bowed her head respectfully. “It will be done, my lord.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Riselia’s voice began to crackle out of Leonis’s terminal. <span class="special">“…Leo, where are you? The meeting’s about to start.”</span></p>
<p><span class="special">“I made your favorite for breakfast, kid. Omelet rice <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>,”</span> Regina’s voice cheerfully added.</p>
<p>“…S-sorry, I’ll be right there,” Leonis replied hurriedly, and he used the shadow corridors to return to the dorm.</p>

<p class="space-break1">“…I’m sorry I’m late,” Leonis apologized as he walked through the front door of the dorm.</p>
<p>“Where were you, Leo? I was worried sick,” his overprotective minion scolded.</p>
<p>Plates of breakfast food lined the table in the common room. The rest of the eighteenth platoon were already seated.</p>
<p>“Well, Veira told me she’s returning to her homeland, so I went to see her off,” Leonis told the others.</p>
<p>“Really?” Riselia said, clearly surprised. “That’s…very sudden…”</p>
<p>“I don’t think she ever intended to remain for very long,” Leonis hastily replied.</p>
<p>“But she left the city all by herself?”</p>
<p>“She’s a very free-spirited sort of person. I’ve no doubt she’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“I—I see…” Riselia furrowed her brow, evidently still a little concerned. “If she’s Leo’s friend, I guess it’s all right,” she whispered to herself, apparently content with that vague explanation.</p>
<p>Leonis was surprised to see her expression looked rather wistful at the prospect of Veira’s departure. Perhaps that match in the pool had brought the two together, if only a bit.</p>
<p><em>Veira seemed to acknowledge Riselia’s strength, too…</em></p>
<p>“For now, just take a seat, kid. Your breakfast is getting cold,” Regina urged him.</p>
<p>Leonis complied, sitting in front of a plate of fluffy omelet rice with a large lump of butter on it, crispy toast, bacon, salad, and arugula. The omelet rice was done to the point of artistic perfection, making it clear that Regina was the one who had prepared the meal today.</p>
<p>Curiously, Leonis’s omelet rice also had a little flag planted in it.</p>
<p>“I don’t need this. Please stop treating me like a child,” the Dark Lord insisted, grumpily pulling the tiny thing out before digging into his omelet rice.</p>
<p>The eighteenth platoon began their emergency meeting over breakfast.</p>
<p>“So this is about the Hive extermination mission?” Leonis asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. We’re to destroy a force of dormant Voids before they hatch. The location is roughly a hundred and fifty kilorels to the southwest, near the Miasma Forest. There’s a chance that this Hive spans a fairly large distance.”</p>
<p>As Riselia spoke, she tapped the map on her terminal to indicate the place. A location known as the Forest of Death…</p>
<p><em>That’s where Necrozoa’s ruins are!</em> Leonis thought, his eyes widening in surprise.</p>
<p>The Dark Lords’ Armies final bastion was a massive underground labyrinth composed of thirteen strata. Death Hold, Leonis’s personal fortress, sat on the surface, along with a temple devoted to the goddess Roselia Ishtaris. The ground around Necrozoa was enveloped with a noxious haze, rendering the place a land of death.</p>
<p>Such had been the case one thousand years ago, anyhow. Death Hold fell to the human alliance and the Six Heroes. In the time since, a thick forest had swallowed the remains.</p>
<p>“That’s near where we found you, Leo,” Riselia remarked.</p>
<p>Pensively, Regina added, “When we investigated the ruins, we ran into multiple large Voids, but there weren’t signs of a sizeable Hive forming yet.”</p>
<p>The Grand Mausoleum where Leonis had sealed himself was deep within the underground labyrinth. He’d placed obfuscating spells to prevent the place from being ransacked by adventurers and grave robbers. Their power must have waned with time, however, allowing Riselia to venture as deep as she had and discover Leonis in magical stasis.</p>
<p>“I think that’s probably the biggest reason they ordered our platoon to assist with this mission,” Elfiné said. “We already have a sense for the area’s topography.”</p>
<p>“Compared to exploring a place we have no data on, the fact you were there once before makes a big difference,” Sakuya added, pushing away the green peas that had been added onto her omelet rice.</p>
<p>“You won’t grow if you’re picky with your food, Sakuya,” Regina chided casually.</p>
<p>“…Tsk!” Sakuya clicked her tongue in frustration. “The kid isn’t eating his peas, either!”</p>
<p>“Well, Leo is still a boy, you can’t blame him,” Elfiné answered, moving the peas Leonis had been avoiding onto her plate.</p>
<p>“You’re spoiling him too much, Miss Finé,” Riselia said. “Leo, you need to eat your veggies.”</p>
<p>“I think you spoil him pretty often, too, Lady Selia…,” Regina quipped in a low tone.</p>
<p>“F-fine,” Leonis huffed and shoveled the little green things back to his plate. He then dropped his gaze to Riselia’s terminal and the map displayed on it. The collection of red dots over the chart indicated the likely location of the Void Hive. It appeared sizable, with Death Hold as its center.</p>
<p><em>Going back home to Necrozoa, eh? I doubt there’s much left there, though.</em></p>
<p>The Undead King’s old base of operations had been lost a millennium ago. He’d already moved any hero-class artifacts kept there to the Realm of Shadows’ treasure vault. There weren’t likely to be any bones left worthy of reanimating. Such was why Leonis had prioritized investigating things on the Seventh Assault Garden rather than return there.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t overlook Voids infesting his stronghold, even if the place was little more than rubble now. Many undead had fought and died at Necrozoa; it was a place that deserved reverence.</p>
<p><em>It’s a good chance to sweep my stronghold clean of those pests. I’ll destroy them so thoroughly not even ashes will remain.</em></p>
<p>While Leonis entertained that wicked notion, Riselia explained the size of the unit that would be participating in the operation and the composition of their forces.</p>
<p>“—and that about sums it up for the briefing. Any questions?” asked Riselia, looking around the platoon’s members. “We’ll be part of a company-sized force. I know it’s an extermination mission, but that’s a pretty large formation.”</p>
<p>“Made up of elites with high grades, no less,” Regina chimed in.</p>
<p>“Yes. Liat Guinness, the Blazing Lion from the fifth platoon, will have command of the operation,” Riselia continued with a nod. “I won’t call it excessive force, but we’ll make for a pretty robust unit.” The argent-haired girl then faced Elfiné. “Miss Finé, you’ll handle backup in the relay base—”</p>
<p>“No, I want to participate in this operation on the site,” Elfiné interjected.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Riselia looked at her, her eyes wide with surprise. Regina and Sakuya made similar expressions. Visibly concerned, Riselia gently protested, “But, Miss Finé…”</p>
<p>The older girl shook her head with a faint smile on her face. “Don’t worry. It’s about time I returned to the front lines. There’s some information you can only gather directly from the field, and if I don’t participate in battle, my sense for combat won’t return. I think that’s the only way I’ll ever restore my Eye of the Witch’s full abilities.” There was clear, resolute light to her black eyes.</p>
<p><em>The lost power of her Holy Sword…</em></p>
<p>Elfiné’s Eye of the Witch possessed outstanding radar capabilities, but she once told Leonis that this wasn’t the true power of her Holy Sword. Six months ago, two of her comrades had died while investigating a Void Hive. Elfiné’s Holy Sword had lost its strength following that event.</p>
<p>Meeting Elfiné’s gaze, Riselia responded, “Understood. We’ll have you accompany us this time.”</p>

<p class="space-break1">“Ugh… Ha… Aaah, aaah… Nngh…!”</p>
<p>Another terrible awakening. His body felt heavy and damp from cold sweat.</p>
<p>More dreams of <em>that day</em>.</p>
<p>He revisited it continually in his nightmares, and the regret never faded. After his platoon dissolved following his failure to protect them, he spent every waking moment fighting Voids—his idea of a fitting punishment. He worked to evolve his Holy Sword and acquire more power.</p>
<p>Then, one day, he started hearing that voice in his head.</p>
<p>The goddess.</p>
<p>“We’re ready to set out, Captain!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ll be right over.”</p>
<p>Extinguishing the black, malformed flames he’d produced in the palm of his hand, the man rose to his feet.</p>
