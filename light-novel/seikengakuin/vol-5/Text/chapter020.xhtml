<p class="noindent">Upon returning to camp, Leonis was greeting by the tantalizing smell of spices.</p>
<p>“Ah, Leo!” Riselia hurried over upon noticing him. “Where were you? I was worried sick.” She bent over him with a reproachful look.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry…,” Leonis began, but he was soon cut off by Elfiné.</p>
<p>“Don’t get mad at him, Selia. Leo saved my neck out there.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Riselia turned to look at Elfiné, and suddenly noticed. “Miss Finé, what happened to your leg?!”</p>
<p>“I was careless. A Void attacked me.”</p>
<p>“A-are you all right?! We’ll get you patched up right away!” exclaimed Riselia.</p>
<p>“It only grazed me. We need to let Liat know what happened.” Elfiné placed a reassuring hand on Riselia’s shoulder before walking over to the fifth platoon’s camp.</p>
<p>Turning back to Leonis, Riselia asked, “You fought a Void?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It wasn’t a very powerful specimen, though,” Leonis replied with a shrug and tried to steer the conversation away from that subject. “Did you make any progress on decoding the inscription?”</p>
<p>“It’s proving a bit tricky. I’ll have to do it little by little after I go back to the academy.”</p>
<p>Leonis’s expression appeared conflicted. “…I see.”</p>
<p>If Riselia decoded the carvings, she could realize who the true ruler of Necrozoa is.</p>
<p><em>No, I’m overthinking it…</em></p>
<p>Leonis had scoured Excalibur Academy’s library, and hadn’t found any evidence to support that the language used for sorcery one thousand years ago was still practiced. And without anything to compare her text to, it was doubtful Riselia would translate it.</p>
<p>“Oh, kid, could you come over here for a second?” Regina was standing by a pot with a fire lit beneath it and motioning for Leonis to approach. Her blond pigtails flopped about like a rabbit’s ears as she gestured.</p>
<p>Leonis did as requested.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I made dried meat soup. Could you taste it for me?”</p>
<p>Regina lifted the pot’s lid, and a cloud of steam carrying the scent of herbs and spices rose up. The soup was an amber shade, with meat and oil mixed in.</p>
<p>“It smells great,” Leonis stated.</p>
<p>“It really is!” Riselia said, beaming. “Regina added whatever ingredients we had on hand. She cut up some dried meat and simmered it with the herbs. Then she used salt and pepper for seasoning and a special spice.”</p>
<p>Regina nodded in satisfaction as her mistress explained. Leonis swallowed in expectation. The smell was undeniably appetizing. Regina scooped some soup into a metallic bowl and blew on it a few times. She then put the lump of dried meat on a spoon.</p>
<p>“Open up, kid. Say ‘aahhhh…’”</p>
<p>“Uh…” Leonis looked taken aback.</p>
<p>“Come on, hurry up. It’ll go cold.”</p>
<p>“F-fine…” Leonis blushed and reluctantly parted his lips.</p>
<p>The texture of the dried meat melted on his tongue, and the flavor of the soup’s spices filled his mouth. It was appropriately salty, and the taste revitalized his tired body.</p>
<p>“How is it? Did I use too much salt?” Riselia questioned.</p>
<p>“No, I think it’s just right. It’s good.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh. Great. <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/> One more bite then. Say ‘aahhhh…’”</p>
<p>“…That’s not fair, Regina! I want to feed Leo, too,” Riselia complained.</p>
<p>Regina shrugged and handed the soup bowl over to her.</p>
<p>“L-Leo, say ‘aahhh…’”</p>
<p>“…I am not some bird for you to feed,” Leonis objected with a frown. Still, he did as asked.</p>
