<p class="noindent">“…Hey, where’s Leo? He’s here somewhere, right?”</p>
<p>A girl with crimson air floated in the air. She was speaking to two stunned figures watching from the window. There was an almost violent beauty to the strange girl. Smooth, unblemished skin. Shapely limbs that looked like they had been sculpted by a goddess of beauty. Her eyes glinted like smoldering rubies.</p>
<p>Unconcerned with how she was being perceived, the young woman lorded over her audience like a tyrant reigning supreme over the heavens.</p>
<p>“I’ll ask you one more time. Where’s Leo?” The devilish girl’s voice was as cold as ice. Her crimson locks shook violently, the air around her crackling.</p>
<p>“Y-you…!” Riselia exclaimed, finally regaining enough composure to speak as she gawked out the second-floor window. “Who are you?”</p>
<p>“Oh. A mere human asks for my name?”</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Riselia shivered beneath the burning gaze of the floating girl. The Vampire Queen suddenly felt like a rabbit being eyed by a dragon.</p>
<p><em>Wh-what’s with this girl…? She’s looking for Leo? Why…?</em></p>
<p>Riselia bravely met the crimson-haired girl’s stare despite her instinctual panic to hide the boy behind her back. That defiant attitude only served to sour the floating young woman’s mood, however.</p>
<p>“Foolish human.” The girl quietly thrust her right hand forward, producing a small, orange fireball. “Crimson Flare—,” she began chanting.</p>
<p>The sphere of flame quickly swelled.</p>
<p>“Wait, Veira!” the boy behind Riselia called out, stepping into view.</p>
<p><em>Leo?!</em></p>
<p>Riselia turned around and saw Leonis bitterly glaring up at the hovering girl he had called Veira. The crimson-haired girl’s eyebrows jumped in surprise.</p>
<p>“Child. Did you just speak my name?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. I am…Leonis.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?” Veira eyed Leonis sharply at his admission. “What is this? Are you using a child in an attempt to fool me?”</p>
<p>“Would a child have this?” Leonis replied, producing a staff as tall as he was from the shadow at his feet.</p>
<p>Veira’s ruby eyes widened with disbelief. “…The Staff of Sealed Sins… It can’t be!”</p>
<p>“For now, come inside, and we can talk. I have…things I must ask you,” Leonis said before turning around and moving away from the window.</p>
<p>“Leo…,” Riselia protested with clear discomfort.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Miss Selia. She’s an old…yes, a very old friend.”</p>
<p>Veira contemplated the suggestion from her spot in the air for a while. Eventually, she shrugged. “…Hmm. Well, I suppose it’s best to hear the explanation for all of this.”</p>
<p>The crimson-haired girl landed on the windowsill and entered the room.</p>

<p class="space-break1">After entering his room with the strange young woman, Leonis locked the door behind him and immediately erected a barrier preventing sound from leaving the room. He then took one long, deep breath.</p>
<p>“…How are you still alive, you bloody fool?!” he bellowed, thrusting the tip of his staff at the young woman’s nose, even though she was a head taller than him.</p>
<p>Yes, Leonis knew who this person was. She was the very same red dragon discovered in the block of ice recently exhumed from the tundra. She was of the eight Dark Lords: Veira Greater Dragon, the Dragon Lord. Or rather, this was her human form.</p>
<p>Veira regarded Leonis with an elegant, confident smirk worthy of an absolute sovereign. “That’s a foolish question. I am the ruler of the dragons, the most powerful form of life this world has ever known. You hardly hold the monopoly on immortality, Leo.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Those words weren’t a bluff. Having fought Veira countless times, Leonis was convinced she spoke the truth.</p>
<p><em>…Right. Even if someone were to slay her successfully, Veira isn’t the kind to stay dead.</em></p>
<p>“I can understand you still being alive. But weren’t you corrupted by the power of emptiness?” Leonis asked bitterly.</p>
<p>Upon being released from her seal within the ice block, Veira’s body was corrupted by the Void miasma, which gradually transformed her into a Void Lord. After she had rampaged in the skies of the Seventh Assault Garden, she had seemingly perished in a duel with Leonis.</p>
<p>Veira shook her head with evident confusion.</p>
<p>“…Are you saying you can’t remember fighting me?” Leonis questioned.</p>
<p>“No. Or, well, I suppose there are some vague memories…,” Veira admitted, placing a finger on her lips pensively, as if trying to remember something. “Right before I awakened from my seal, I thought I heard someone’s voice…and then I completely lost consciousness. The next thing I knew, I was below the sea. That was a surprise. My body was mostly destroyed. Had I stayed that way much longer, I’d have truly met my end. Thus, I discarded my body and assumed this form. This is my worst awakening to date.”</p>
<p>“So you’re saying you cut yourself off from your body when the emptiness consumed it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what this ‘emptiness’ you keep mentioning is, but I suppose that would be the gist of it, yes. Unfortunately, that means I left the majority of my power back there.”</p>
<p><em>You really are like a lizard</em>, Leonis thought, but he knew better than to say as much aloud.</p>
<p>Calling Veira a lizard was taboo, and would only serve to incur her wrath.</p>
<p>“But all that aside…” Veira poked Leonis’s forehead with an impish smile. “I could tell you were the one who killed me immediately, Leo. You’re the only one who could slay me like that, after all.”</p>
<p>“Well, we have fought many times before… W-wait, what are you doing?!”</p>
<p>Veira inched closer to Leonis’s head and started sniffing his hair.</p>
<p>“This is indeed your scent. It really is you, Leo.”</p>
<p>Veira’s cleavage was thrust before Leonis’s eyes. He hurriedly looked away, his cheeks flushed.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you followed my smell back here?” Leonis asked.</p>
<p>Unlike the days when he had an undead body, Leonis now bathed daily because of his clean freak of a minion. As keen as a dragon’s nose might have been, Veira shouldn’t have been able to track him with it.</p>
<p><em>I’m in a human body. Veira shouldn’t be familiar with anything about me in this form.</em></p>
<p>“I traced your magical wavelength,” Veira responded matter-of-factly, shaking her head. “A dragon can trace the trail of one’s mana.”</p>
<p>“Oh, right…,” Leonis said, gazing into the glint of Veira’s golden eyes. He kept his magical energy concealed most of the time, but evidently, that wasn’t enough to fool Veira.</p>
<p>“Your scent has changed, however. It smells rather refreshing. Like flowers…,” Veira remarked and inched her face closer to sniff at Leonis’s hair again.</p>
<p>The flower aroma was because he’d been using Riselia’s shampoo.</p>
<p>“Speaking of differences, I think it’s about time you started answering my questions, too,” Veira stated, folding her arms and looking down at Leonis. “Why, exactly, do you look like a child?”</p>
<p>“…Let us just say some unexpected developments led to me reincarnating incorrectly,” Leonis answered uncomfortably.</p>
<p>“Wait, <em>you</em> failed at sorcery?” Veira pressed, gazing fixedly at the other Dark Lord’s face. “I suppose strange things do happen.”</p>
<p>“Reincarnation is twelfth-order sorcery with many uncertain factors,” Leonis countered, frowning.</p>
<p>Veira considered something for a moment. “Hmm. You truly look nothing like you used to. You really were cute during your hero days, right?”</p>
<p>“Mind your own business.”</p>
<p>“And you even behave like a child.”</p>
<p>Veira sat on Leonis’s mattress, snickering. Her crimson hair spilled over the white sheets. She kicked her beautiful, slender legs forward and dangled them off the side.</p>
<p>“Don’t sit on my bed,” Leonis chided her, but she ignored him.</p>
<p>“So this is the Undead King’s new castle, is it?” Veira said, looking around the room curiously.</p>
<p>“For the time being,” Leonis replied tersely.</p>
<p>“A tad cramped, don’t you think? Was Death Hold in Necrozoa ruined?”</p>
<p>“Well, I heard Azure Hold has sunk to the bottom of the ocean,” Leonis shot back coldly.</p>
<p>Veira shrugged. “Yes, it went down along with the Divine Dragon the Luminous Powers sent to challenge me.” She then turned her eyes to a picture frame sitting on a bedside table. It was a commemorative photograph the eighteenth platoon had taken upon winning their first training match. Veira’s eyes settled on Riselia in the image. “That girl is an undead minion, yes? The wavelength of her mana wasn’t the same as a normal human’s.”</p>
<p>“Yes, she’s my vampire subordinate.”</p>
<p>“A vampire, hmm? That’s quite the prize.”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>Riselia wasn’t just any vampire, but the highest grade of undead, a Vampire Queen. Leonis didn’t volunteer that information, though.</p>
<p>“She’s a fool to have tried to challenge a Dark Lord like me, but the fact she was willing to defend you with her life was admirable. She’s a fine servant,” Veira praised.</p>
<p>“That she is.”</p>
<p>Leonis was caught up in the pleasure of hearing his favored minion complimented when it happened. Veira lifted her dangling legs and snaked them around his neck, pulling him back toward the bed in a choke hold.</p>
<p>“…Ngh… What…are you…?!” Leonis managed, even as her legs strangled him. He tried to shake Veira off, but he had only a ten-year-old’s strength. The sensation of her thighs against the back of his head grew tighter.</p>
<p>“You dared to kill me, Leo.”</p>
<p>“Y-you’re still…alive…aren’t you…?!” Leonis croaked.</p>
<p>“I was mostly dead. And you tried to turn me into your minion, didn’t you?”</p>
<p><em>Squeeze.</em></p>
<p>“What were you trying to gain by turning me into a mindless skeleton dragon, hmm?”</p>
<p><em>Squeeze. Squeeze.</em></p>
<p>“N-no…it was…the Void…Voids…,” Leonis gasped out, struggling for air all the while.</p>
<p>“…Voids? You’ve mentioned that before.”</p>
<p>The pressure of Veira’s thighs slackened a bit.</p>
<p>“While you… I mean, while we were sealed, this world changed drastically,” Leonis explained after a deep breath.</p>
<p>“…So it seems,” Veira muttered, looking out the windows at Excalibur Academy’s facilities. “Tell me, Leo… What happened?” A slight shade of anxiety crossed the Dragon Lord’s eyes.</p>
