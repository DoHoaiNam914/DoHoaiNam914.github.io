<p>“I thought I’d eventually overcome the fear and regain my Holy Sword’s power. But somewhere deep down, I’ve been running away all along. I’ve been taking advantage of Selia and the other girls’ kindness.”</p>
<p>“…And that’s why you insisted on joining this mission?”</p>
<p>Elfiné bobbed her head. “Yes. I came here to face and resolve my fears. I figured that anything I’d find by running away would be the wrong kind of strength.”</p>
<p>“The wrong kind of strength?” repeated Leonis.</p>
<p>“I think Muselle Rhodes turned his Holy Sword to a Demon Sword in a bid to reclaim his lost power. And honestly, I kind of understand how he felt. Without Selia and the others…I think I’d have gone the same way,” Elfiné confessed, her gaze dropping to her open palm. “I don’t want to run anymore, though. Not from the Voids or from myself.”</p>
<p>Luminous particles amassed in Elfiné’s hand, coalescing into a sphere of light.</p>
<p>“I think you’re back to normal now,” Leonis said.</p>
<p>Elfiné smiled. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>“I’ll carry us back to camp.”</p>
<p>“How are you going to—Whoa!”</p>
<p>With a wave of his staff, Leonis chanted a gravity control spell. Elfiné’s body floated up into the air, and she hurriedly held her skirt down.</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” Leonis stated, cradling the now lighter Elfiné in his arms.</p>
<p>“W-wait…,” Elfiné objected bashfully. “A-a bridal carry is a little…embarrassing…”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to be shy,” Leonis assured.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Elfiné flushed to the tips of her ears.</p>

<p class="space-break1">“I knew the writing on that statue reminded me of something,” Riselia muttered pensively, still sitting in the collapsible cottage.</p>
<p>In one hand, she held the book her father had left behind in his study. The text in it didn’t resemble any language Riselia was familiar with, and it gave the impression it was alien to this world. Still, Riselia’s passion for ancient history refused to be denied, and she had been working out the mysterious language in her spare time. Her intuition told her the writings in the journal and the carvings on the statue were of the same script. Indeed, upon comparing the two, Riselia realized she could decipher some of the engraving.</p>
<p><em>And I think the letters on the door where I found Leo looked like this, too</em>, she suddenly recalled. Riselia had been inspecting that entrance when it had opened on its own.</p>
<p><em>Analyzing these matching characters… Maybe I should ask Miss Finé for help here.</em></p>
<p>By comparing the text in the epitaph and the book, Riselia hoped to create a lexicon that would fully decipher the language. It was laborious work, to be sure, but it was the sort Riselia enjoyed.</p>
<p>As she gradually read through the text she’d recorded from the statue, her eyes suddenly widened in astonishment.</p>
<p>“…A… Lia… Huh? R-Riselia?!”</p>
<p>It seemed her name had been inscribed upon the half-sunken sculpture.</p>
<p>“Oh…I got it wrong. There’s a little wedge on the character there, so it’s a different vowel…”</p>
<p>Realizing her mistake, Riselia swiftly corrected herself.</p>
<p>“Selia… <em>Roselia</em>… Right? Hmm.”</p>
<p>The moment she mouthed that name, an inexplicable sort of anxiety overcame her. There was a familiar tugging, as though the young woman had forgotten something important. Riselia and Roselia. Two names with a familiar intonation. What did it all mean?</p>
<p>“Lady Selia, glaring at a book like that is bad for your eyes.”</p>
<p>Riselia turned around and saw Regina staring back at her with an exasperated expression. “Don’t worry. My night vision’s gotten better recently,” she replied with a slight smirk.</p>
<p>“…What does that mean?” Regina questioned, puzzled.</p>
<p>Riselia was getting progressively more used to her Vampire Queen body. By focusing mana into her eyes, she could see in the dark as keenly as she would with a pair of night-vision goggles.</p>
<p><em>I should be careful not to get too accustomed to this, however.</em></p>
<p>Riselia snapped Duke Crystalia’s book shut. An appetizing scent was wafting into the cottage from the outside.</p>
<p>“Dinner’s ready,” Regina told her.</p>
<p>“Thanks. It smells great.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go share it with the rest of the group. Might as well, since I went to the trouble of making it.”</p>
<p>“Speaking of, where’s Leo?” Riselia asked.</p>
<p>“He went outside earlier,” Regina replied. “When you get focused on work, you completely lose track of what’s going on around you.”</p>
<p>“R-really?”</p>
<p>“I know you like investigating ruins, but please try to pay more attention.”</p>
