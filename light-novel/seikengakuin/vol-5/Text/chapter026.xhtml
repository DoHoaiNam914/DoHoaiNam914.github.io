<p>The True Ancestor’s Dress—a unique garment only a Vampire Queen could don. Riselia’s argent locks shone with mana as power surged through her. Yet, while the outfit explosively augmented her physical prowess, it consumed significant amounts of magical energy. Riselia hadn’t properly mastered using it yet.</p>
<p><em>I have ten seconds at best… I have to finish this!</em></p>
<p>Kicking off the ground, Riselia thrust forward, loosing the swiftest attack she could muster at the grip of Liat’s weapon.</p>
<p>Undaunted, Liat swung his broadsword up, repelling the strike.</p>
<p>“Kuh…!”</p>
<p>“Groooooooooh…!”</p>
<p>With a raging howl, Liat brought his Holy Sword down.</p>
<p><em>Grrrnh! Grrrrrk! Grrrnnnh!</em></p>
<p>The ground quaked as intermittent explosions sounded.</p>
<p><em>The Flare Bomb’s ability…!</em></p>
<p>Using mana to leap up, Riselia came plunging down from above.</p>
<p>“Blood Chain!”</p>
<p>Blood laced with mana formed interlocking ringlets that coiled around the Blazing Lion.</p>
<p>“Hyaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>Riselia trained her Blood Sword at Liat’s arms, hoping to force him into dropping the Demon Sword. She couldn’t afford to kill him. Her blade sunk deep into the young man’s shoulder.</p>
<p><em>I’ve got to destroy that Demon Sword!</em></p>
<p>Pulling her weapon free, Riselia slashed again. However…</p>
<p><em>Whoooosh!</em></p>
<p>…Liat’s body suddenly caught fire.</p>
<p>“What…?!”</p>
<p><span class="special">“Selia, get away! The Demon Sword is—”</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Elfiné’s warning did not come in time. Riselia’s body was enveloped in flame.</p>

<p class="space-break1">“Curse you, curse you! My arm, my aaaarm!” Zemein shrieked, the pained cries echoing through the underground chamber. “You’ll pay for this, whelp… I’ll lop off your limbs and feed them to the Demon Swords!”</p>
<p>Zemein’s remaining five appendages jutting from his back slithered toward Leonis like serpents.</p>
<p>“Hmph. You look down on me over how I look? I see your pride has taken its toll on your intellect,” Leonis spat with a sneer.</p>
<p>“Disappear…!” Zemein screeched. His writhing arms lanced at the boy.</p>
<p>“Learn your lesson already, hopeless fool.”</p>
<p><em>Slash, slash, slash!</em></p>
<p>Blades of darkness jumped out of the shadow at Leonis’s feet, effortlessly severing the limbs.</p>
<p>“…Ugh… Gyaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>Leonis looked on as Zemein bellowed in agony. “I suppose I should’ve expected as much from you,” he stated coldly. “The only thing you ever cared for was merging creatures together. You were worthless in battle and employed callous, foul methods. My current minion is merely fifteen years old, and she’s already far smarter than you ever were.”</p>
<p>“N-nnngh… Wh-what…?! Wh-who are you…?!” Zemein cried, fear plain in his eyes. It seemed the old man had realized he wasn’t facing an ordinary child.</p>
<p>“I suppose this is where I should stop toying with you, then… Hmm?” Leonis suddenly paused.</p>
<p>Seizing upon his chance, Zemein began chanting a spell. “Flames of darkness, bring your tyranny to bear and destroy my foooooooe!”</p>
<p><em>Booooooooooom!</em></p>
<p>An explosion shook the subterranean cavern, filling it with light.</p>
<p>“Ki-hi, ki-hi-hi-hi-hi…! This is a sixth-order spell, magic beyond the reach of anything a human can achieve! It should reduce him to nothin—”</p>
<p>“Hmph. Such a long recitation and that’s the best you can accomplish?”</p>
<p>“Wh-what…?!”</p>
<p>The smoke cleared, revealing Leonis standing composedly behind a barrier of shadows. There wasn’t so much as a speck of dirt on his uniform.</p>
<p>“Mel Ziora was a spell of my own invention. Was it always so weak?”</p>
<p>“H-how…?” Zemein croaked, stepping back fearfully. “Wh-what… What are you…?!”</p>
<p>“You still haven’t figured it out? My word. You truly are hopeless.” Leonis shrugged and produced the Staff of Sealed Sins from his shadow. “Is this clear enough for your dimwitted mind?”</p>
<p>“I-it can’t be… Th-that rod! It belongs to…!”</p>
<p>“I am the Undead King you were so keen on resurrecting,” Leonis declared, tapping the bottom of the Staff of Sealed Sins against the ground.</p>
<p>“Mel Ziora!”</p>
<p>A raging sphere of fire sped past Zemein and exploded behind him.</p>
