<p>“…Ugh…”</p>
<p>There was no pain, but Leonis contorted his face at the itchy sensation. Mana began coursing through the vampiress’s body, transmitted via the Undead King’s blood. Her silvery hair began to glow.</p>

<p class="noindent">After an hour or so, Riselia had finally calmed down. The newly supplied mana spurred her heart to beat again, and her temperature was gradually returning to normal.</p>
<p>“…Just who are you?” she asked, lying beneath her bedsheets.</p>
<p>Having calmed down, the reality of her undead existence was starting to sink in.</p>
<p>“I’m an ancient mage who was resurrected.” Leonis gave a nod as he put on his uniform top.</p>
<p>He kept his status as the Undead King secret, instead explaining he was an ancient mage slumbering in the crystal Riselia had found, and he was capable of using the lost art of sorcery. He clarified that it was his magic that had turned her into his minion.</p>
<p>Riselia silently listened to the explanation before offering a question:</p>
<p>“Sorcery? Not a Holy Sword?”</p>
<p>“In the age I lived in, we used spells and sorcery.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>It didn’t seem she was wholly convinced yet, but…</p>
<p>Riselia took another look at her body.</p>
<p><a id="page-79"/>“…All right. I’ll believe you,” the girl said with a small sigh. “It really does seem like I died…”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. This was the only way I could save you with my magic.”</p>
<p>“…I understand.”</p>
<p>The young woman’s shock was unmistakable, but the facts were plain as day. There was little to do but accept them. She came to terms with the situation quicker than Leonis had expected.</p>
<p><em>It’s clear she still feels conflicted about it all, though…</em></p>
<p>That much was easy to understand.</p>
<p>Riselia huddled deeper beneath the covers.</p>
<p>“So I’m not human anymore, am I…?”</p>
<p>“That…would be the case, yes.” It was unpleasant news for Leonis to have to relate.</p>
<p>“Do you think I’m still able to gain the power of a Holy Sword?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Leonis had no way of knowing about that unfamiliar power. However, he couldn’t say for certain there was no chance, either.</p>
<p>“I see…” Riselia fell silent for a moment. “But you did save my life, right?”</p>
<p>“………”</p>
<p>Such a fair girl. She’d died to save Leonis, so it only made sense for him to return that kindness in some way. But even if he were to point that out, Riselia wouldn’t hold it against him.</p>
<p>“…Then, yeah. I’m grateful,” she said, hugging a pillow.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I’m better off this way than dying down in the ruins, right?”</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose so, but…” The greatest Dark Lord found himself a bit taken aback.</p>
<p>“…All right. Then it’s settled.”</p>
<p><a id="page-80"/>Riselia rose to her feet, resigned to her new circumstances, sheets still clenched in her fingers.</p>
<p>“By the way, are you after something? Why were you asleep all those years?”</p>
<p>“Well…” Leonis fell silent for a few moments, carefully picking his words. “There’s someone I’m looking for.”</p>
<p>“Someone?” Riselia seemed to sense something in the boy’s earnest tone. “Is this person…important to you?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Leonis nodded.</p>
<p>“I see. All right, then.” Riselia beamed at him. “Then I’ll help you find that someone.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate it, but…”</p>
<p>“But in exchange…” Riselia stuck out her index finger. “I want you to make me stronger. Strong enough to fight the Voids.”</p>
<p>“That shouldn’t be too difficult.” Leonis was by no means opposed to strengthening his minions.</p>
<p>“In that case, I look forward to working with you, Leo.”</p>
<p>And so the Undead King and his vampire minion sealed the agreement with a handshake.</p>
