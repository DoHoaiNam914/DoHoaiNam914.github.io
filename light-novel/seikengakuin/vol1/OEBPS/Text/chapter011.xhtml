<p><a id="page-53"/>“My lord.”</p>
<p>“What is it, Shary?” Leonis looked back at the girl, who eyed him shyly.</p>
<p>“I find your current appearance exceptionally cute, my lord.”</p>
<p>“Are you making light of me, Shary?”</p>
<p>“…Perish the thought, my lord,” Shary apologized in a flustered manner. Her lord, his eyes half-lidded, gave a shake of his head.</p>
<p>“…No matter. I’ve summoned you two because I must ask something of you both.”</p>
<p>“Order me as you will, my lord.” The girl bowed her head.</p>
<p>“I will gladly lend you my strength, my friend.” The black wolf nodded.</p>
<p>“I want you to investigate this city. This world is far too different from what I imagined before my return.”</p>
<p>Blackas gave a grunt of consent, looking around curiously.</p>
<p>“Things truly have changed beyond all recognition while we slumbered,” he agreed.</p>
<p>“They have. Sorcery has declined over the years, so using it would attract unwanted attention.”</p>
<p>Compensating for the loss of sorcery, mankind had created a civilization around artifacts that could activate magic instead. The lighting illuminating the corridor would have been considered a precious magic tool one thousand years ago.</p>
<p>“But if sorcery has declined, how could they create things like these without any knowledge of it?”</p>
<p>“That’s something else we need to look into. At any rate, I can’t use my magic publicly, so I’ll have to rely on you two.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>“By your will, my lord.”</p>
<p>The two disappeared back into his shadow. Leaving the <a id="page-54"/>investigation of the city to them, Leonis could focus his efforts on Excalibur Academy.</p>
<p>The boy stepped down the corridor. Suddenly, a shrill alarm began to blare. A mana detector was going off.</p>
<p>“What?!” Leonis quickly chanted a magic obfuscation spell. The spell took hold, and the alarm stopped.</p>
<p><em>…I’ll need to be cautious.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">The examination took fifteen minutes or so and was completely unmanned. Upon completing it, Leonis boarded an elevator. When the door opened, he stepped outside into blinding sunlight and found Riselia waiting for him.</p>
<p>“Good job, Leo,” she said, handing him a card. “This is your ID card. Well, a temporary one, at least.”</p>
<p>“Card?” Leonis eyed the blue tile curiously.</p>
<p>At its center was an icon with the simple design of a white sword. He didn’t need to use a mana detection spell to tell some kind of magic was embedded in it.</p>
<p>“This is proof of your identity in the Assault Garden. Make sure you don’t lose it, okay?”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s head to the academy,” Riselia said, tapping the vehicle’s seat, which was still dirty with sand.</p>
<p>Leonis looked at the conveyance with confusion, noticing the sidecar was gone.</p>
<p>“Where’s Regina?”</p>
<p>“She said needed to do some shopping, so she’s off in the commercial district.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p><a id="page-55"/>Apparently, the sidecar could become a transport vehicle of its own. Leonis sat down on the seat like before and wrapped his arms around Riselia’s waist. The engine rumbled as she pushed down on the pedal, and the vehicle sped down the tunnel.</p>
<p>The ground was paved, so it was a much smoother ride compared to when they’d been driving across the wasteland. The wind was pleasant, and Riselia’s silver hair trailed behind her as they cruised along. And when they left the tunnel…</p>
<p>“Wha…?!” Leonis’s mouth fell open in surprise.</p>
<p>Before the two stood an enormous laminated structure.</p>
<p>“This is the commercial district,” Riselia explained. “Impressive, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Erm, yes, I suppose,” the boy replied with false composure.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s surprised the first time they see it.” The silver-haired girl was apparently disappointed by Leonis’s response.</p>
<p>The high-rise was dotted with countless windows. Leonis had never seen anything like it. The technology needed to create such a multistoried building could never have existed in his native era.</p>
<p>Many other boys and girls were walking about, all sporting the same uniform. Clearly, they were Riselia’s fellow students at Excalibur Academy.</p>
<p>“It feels surprisingly peaceful here.”</p>
<p>“You can tell?”</p>
<p>“That’s the kind of atmosphere this place gives off…”</p>
<p>He was well acquainted with what a country in wartime looked like and found it hard to believe this place was at the front line of the battle against Voids.</p>
<p>“The Seventh Assault Garden has never allowed a Void to penetrate its walls,” Riselia explained. “It’s the newest city, if you don’t count the Eighth Assault Garden. That one’s still under construction. <a id="page-56"/>Holy Swordsmen are dispatched to fight on the front lines, but the city itself is safe.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“The Garden is divided into a residential and a commercial district, and in the center is the administration bureau, which unifies the whole city. And the part that governs military affairs…” The young woman raised a finger, pointing ahead.</p>
<p>“…is Excalibur Academy, the core of the city.”</p>

<p class="noindent">“Before we register you for the Academy, you should probably take a bath.”</p>
<p>Going through the gate, Riselia parked the vehicle in an open parking space within the academy grounds. Excalibur Academy’s premises were vast and comprised of several combined facilities.</p>
<p><em>…How is this possible? This place is far larger than even a Dark Lord’s castle.</em> Upon disembarking, Leonis was overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the academy.</p>
<p>“Are these all academy facilities?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s all a bit stunning at first.” Riselia gave a nod before explaining.</p>
<p>“That’s the great auditorium,” she started. “That building over there is where the cafeterias are. There are restaurants in the city’s commercial district, but the cafeterias are affordable, and their meals are really tasty.” Leonis’s tour continued. “The area sitting right in the middle of the academy is the outdoor training ground. Students train using a personalized regimen built to match the unique abilities of their Holy Swords. Lastly, there’s the library, the laboratories, a dance hall, leisure facilities, and a sauna next to the dorms.”</p>
<p><a id="page-57"/>“Erm, I understand what the training ground is for, but why do you need a dance hall and a sauna?” Leonis wondered aloud.</p>
<p>“Holy Swords are weapons born of one’s heart. Neglecting the needs of your heart inhibits your ability to wield that power. Actually, the Second Assault Garden had more standard training facilities, but the results weren’t all that satisfactory.”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>So this place employed more unorthodox training methodologies.</p>
<p>The two continued to walk, heading down a boulevard of broad-leaved trees. They passed a group of girls in the same kind of navy-blue uniform that Riselia wore. The girls took one look at Leonis and promptly assailed him with all manner of comments unsuitable for the Undead King, like: “Look at him, he’s so cute!”</p>
<p>“Are girls more common at this academy?”</p>
<p>“The gender ratio is about fifty-fifty, but this sector has the girls’ dorms—” Riselia cut herself off.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Leonis looked up at the silver-haired girl. Her expression was tense, her lips pursed. Standing a few dozen paces ahead was a blond boy in an academy uniform.</p>
<p>“Well, if it’s isn’t Miss Riselia. Hello, there. What brings you here?”</p>
<p>“Muselle Rhodes…” Riselia took a cautious step back.</p>
<p><em>…He doesn’t look like a friend of hers.</em></p>
<p>The young man named Muselle was tailed by a group of four academy girls, all beautiful… Though, of course, none were a match for the beauty of the girl standing at Leonis’s side.</p>
<p>Muselle himself had a handsome face, though his vulgar expression hardly matched. He gave off a rude sort of air as he looked Riselia up and down, evaluating her.</p>
<p><a id="page-58"/>…There was something about it that was off-putting.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, Leo.” Riselia tugged at the boy’s arm to lead him away.</p>
<p>“Hmm? And where would you be off to?” Muselle and the girls waiting on him blocked Riselia’s exit, their shoes squeaking slightly as they moved.</p>
<p>“…Please step aside,” requested Riselia.</p>
<p>“Come now, no need to be so cold… Hmm, who’s this kid?” The young man looked down, obviously noticing Leonis for the first time.</p>
<p>“You might be my senior, but who he is has nothing to do with you.” Riselia glared at him, resolute. Her adversary suppressed a laugh.</p>
<p>“My, if this isn’t fantastic! The dropout squad is bringing in a child now!”</p>
<p>“…Kh. He’s a full-fledged Holy Swordsman.”</p>
<p>“This boy? Ah-ha-ha, spare me the jokes!” Muselle’s voice was bold as he looked down at Leonis with a sneer.</p>
<p><em>…Good grief. Ignorance truly is bliss, isn’t it…?</em> The Undead King shrugged mentally.</p>
<p>In any other situation, he’d have reduced this boy to ash a hundred times over and reanimated him as a skeleton warrior, the lowest of undead servants. Had Shary been here, this brat would be a smear on the ground by now.</p>
<p><em>…But I suppose I can’t fault anyone for doubting my abilities because of how I appear right now. I’ll look past his attitude, if only so as not to make myself conspicuous…</em></p>
<p>Noticing Leonis wasn’t stirred by his provocation, Muselle returned his attention to Riselia. “You should stop trying so hard and just join my platoon already, Riselia Crystalia. If you join the highest-ranking platoon, perhaps you’ll be allowed to remain in the academy.” Muselle’s lips twisted into a grin, and he spoke as <a id="page-59"/>if to make sure Leonis heard him. “Even if you <em>can’t manifest a Holy Sword despite being the daughter of such distinguished Holy Swordsmen</em>.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Riselia glared at Muselle through narrowed eyes.</p>
<p><em>She doesn’t have a Holy Sword?</em> Leonis thought suspiciously. <em>Come to think of it, she didn’t use one back in the ruin.</em></p>
<p>No… It wasn’t that she didn’t. She couldn’t.</p>
<p>That was why she had to jump in and use her body to protect Leonis from the Void’s talons. But if that was the case, why was she enrolled in an academy for training Holy Swordsmen…?</p>
<p>“You don’t have to throw yourself into dangerous Void investigations. You need only join my collection of toys.”</p>
<p>Muselle’s smile took on a vulgar, perverted sheen as he reached for one of the girls standing beside him and began fondling her breasts. The girl only shivered in faint reaction but showed no resistance, as if she were a doll lacking its own will. She simply let Muselle grope her to his heart’s content.</p>
<p><em>What is that? Some kind of enslavement or mental manipulation spell? No…</em></p>
<p>The sorcery of a millennia ago had been lost to the ages. In which case…</p>
<p><em>It must be a Holy Sword…</em></p>
<p>…Leonis understood. Holy Swords could be more than the cannon-type that Regina had. The Undead King would have to adjust his perception of what a Holy Sword could be.</p>
<p>“…I refuse,” Riselia answered flatly.</p>
<p>Muselle clicked his tongue in annoyance.</p>
<p>“You dare ignore the goodwill I show you?!” he shouted. Clearly irritated, he pushed away the girl he was fondling.</p>
<p><em>You call this “goodwill”…?</em> Leonis was quickly getting fed up with this.</p>
<p><a id="page-60"/>This young man seemingly harbored some distorted desires…some warped lust for Riselia.</p>
<p><em>She’s fair enough to make the Undead King stop in awe, after all.</em></p>
<p>“—Step aside.” Again, Riselia tried to ignore him and walk away.</p>
<p>“…Tch. Wait. What’s with that attitude? Do you think you’re better than me?!”</p>
<p>“…Ow!” A pained sound came from the girl’s mouth as her expression stiffened.</p>
<p>Muselle had grabbed her by her silvery hair.</p>
<p>—At that moment, the air around them grew still and cold.</p>
<p>“Wh-what…?” Muselle froze in place. He looked as though he’d suddenly felt the presence of death sweep over him. As if a hard hand had gripped his heart. Every pore in his body broke out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>“………”</p>
<p>Leonis tapped at Muselle’s heel with the end of his shoe. That alone was enough to make the young man fall to his knees, as if crumpling in weakness. To Riselia’s eyes, it seemed he’d suddenly collapsed on the spot for no reason.</p>
<p>“…Ah, guh, aaah…!”</p>
<p>Muselle didn’t have a much better idea what was going on, but he felt the creeping sense of death bearing down on him, choking his words.</p>
<p>“Uh, are you all right, mister?” Leonis asked with a feigned ignorance. He knelt down and took hold of Muselle’s arm.</p>
<p>“Ahhh…!”</p>
<p>A sudden rush of instinctive terror made Muselle pull away, but Leonis wasn’t about to let him escape. He brought his face to Muselle’s ear and whispered:</p>
<p>“A bastard like you has no right to touch her hair. <em>This woman is mine.</em>”</p>
<p><a id="page-61"/>He whispered each word clearly so as to be sure they were understood.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Leonis let go of his arm.</p>
<p>“Wh-what? What the hell are you…? Sh-shit!” Muselle scurried to his feet. “H-Holy Sword, Activate!” he cried with an intense expression.</p>
<p>“Leo…!” Riselia reflexively stepped forward to cover the boy.</p>
<p>But at that moment…</p>
<p>“Muselle Rhodes. Unauthorized use of a Holy Sword is forbidden.” A dignified voice caught their ears from somewhere nearby.</p>
<p>Muselle clicked his tongue in annoyance and lowered his hands. Turning around, they saw the admonition had come from a girl in an academy uniform who’d been following a levitating orb. Her long black hair reached down to her waist and swayed with each of her steps. Her expression was dauntless.</p>
<p>“What’s more, this sector is for the girls’ dorms. If you do not leave at once, I will have to report you to the bureau. Are we clear?”</p>
<p>“Guh… I-I’ll remember this!”</p>
<p>Muselle glared at the black-haired girl first and then cast a hateful look at Leonis before taking off with his four followers trailing after him.</p>
<p><em>…That was a bit disgraceful of me—getting this worked up over a fly like him…</em></p>
<p>Leonis knew he shouldn’t be doing anything to make himself stand out here in Excalibur Academy. That could get in the way of his future plans for this city. But the moment that lowlife touched her hair…the aura of death Leonis kept concealed began slipping out, ever so slightly.</p>
<p><em>Not that I regret it.</em></p>
<p>Leonis was the most tolerant and lenient among the Dark Lords, but even that had its limits.</p>
<p><a id="page-62"/>After all, <em>Riselia Crystalia was already his minion</em>.</p>
<p>“Miss Finé!”</p>
<p>“It looks like Muselle Rhodes has his eye on you. My condolences.”</p>
<p>The girl approached the two of them. She was a beautiful young woman with sleek, black hair that could’ve been spun from the darkness of night itself. She was a bit taller than Riselia, and there was a mature air about her.</p>
<p>With a wave of the girl’s arm, the orb of light that floated at her side disappeared into thin air. Was that orb a Holy Sword, too…?</p>
<p>“Thank you for your help, ma’am.” Riselia bowed her head in gratitude.</p>
<p>The black-haired young woman shook her head and then squatted down to look at Leonis.</p>
<p>“So you’re the boy she found in the ruin.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Leonis nodded, feeling his pulse quicken.</p>
<p>…Did every girl Riselia knew have a big chest?</p>
<p>“I’m Elfiné Phillet. I serve as a platoon operator.”</p>
<p>“Miss…Elfiné?”</p>
<p>Leonis remembered the name. She was the one Riselia had been communicating with earlier. Her voice was soothing, as if it was somehow enveloping him like a blanket.</p>
<p>“I’m Leonis Magnus. Miss Riselia rescued me in the ruin.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh. I suppose that makes you little Leo,” she said, gently patting his head.</p>
<p>…Between her and Riselia, why did everyone seem so keen on shortening the Undead King’s name?</p>
<p>“Welcome to Excalibur Academy. We greet you with open arms. I actually just received your uniform from the bureau. The size should be right, I think…”</p>
<p>She took a folded uniform set from her bag and handed it to Riselia.</p>
<p><a id="page-63"/>“Thank you, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to have his Holy Sword registered next?”</p>
<p>“I thought I’d bring him to the dorm first. Have him take a bath and change.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see. You should probably take a bath, too, Selia.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?! Do I smell…?” Shocked, Riselia sniffed at her sleeve. “Do I smell, Leo?!”</p>
<p>“Well, I didn’t mind…”</p>
<p>“…” Riselia’s shoulders dropped.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, you don’t smell,” Elfiné reassured her with a wry smile. “You’re just dirty with sand.”</p>
<p>“By the way, will you be going back to the dorm, too, ma’am?” Riselia asked.</p>
<p>“I have some Void investigation data I need to submit to the knights. There’s definitely something below the sea in this sector.”</p>
<p>“Something? Like ruins?”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to tell. The knights have sent elite investigation teams to check it out, but…”</p>
<p><em>…Under the sea, hmm?</em> The conversation caught Leonis’s interest. The site of the Dark Lords’ Armies’ final battle sat here, below the ocean. Right beneath their feet…</p>
