<p class="noindent">13:00 Imperial Standard Time.</p>
<p>Having received an emergency request, Riselia and the eighteenth platoon hurriedly changed into their uniforms and arrived at the entrance to Excalibur Academy’s Anti-Void Tactical Conference Room.</p>
<p>“Riselia Crystalia, here at your urgent summons,” the argent-haired girl stated at the door.</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>Riselia opened the door. Inside, she saw the eighteenth platoon’s instructor, Diglassê, along with Elfiné and a female information analysis officer clad in a knight’s uniform. All three were already seated. Elfiné raised her head and nodded gently at the rest of her group’s arrival. Diglassê, meanwhile, jerked her chin, gesturing for them to take a seat quickly.</p>
<p><em>What has happened? Have more Voids appeared?</em> Sensing the unusual air in the room, Leonis took a seat between Riselia and Regina. The eighteenth platoon’s girls exchanged puzzled, unsure glances.</p>
<p><a id="page-44"/>“Firstly, there’s something I’d like for you all to see,” Diglassê stated quietly.</p>
<p>The information analysis officer nodded and fiddled with a device. A large, poor-quality image was projected on the broad meeting table. It depicted some part of the ocean covered with thick, gray fog.</p>
<p>“This is footage taken this morning by an observation unit deployed at the isle of Hakura.”</p>
<p>“Hakura? The base there is meant to gather information on the nearby Void territory, right?” questioned Riselia.</p>
<p><em>That’s the first I’ve heard of that</em>, Leonis thought. “Void territory?” he asked.</p>
<p>“An area filled with a high density of Void reefs,” Riselia explained. “They’re cursed places that humans can’t enter. There’s constantly a thick layer of miasma over a Void territory, so ships and tactical fighter planes can’t enter or observe what goes on in them.”</p>
<p>“While we don’t know what occurs within them, we do monitor their outer circumference. The Integrated Empire has set up observation bases on the islands surrounding this Void territory, and they continually monitor that portion of the sea.”</p>
<p><em>I understand. So the Void reef the</em> Hyperion <em>encountered the other day was like a small, localized version of a Void territory.</em></p>
<p>“Today at zero four zero four hours, the observation unit caught signs of a large structure…,” Diglassê said, pointing at the image and tapping it with her finger.</p>
<p>When she did, something came into view in the footage. A giant shadow was drifting on the ocean’s surface. The sun rose in the recording, revealing the full form of the thing bobbing on the water. A group of artificial islands linked by bridges—but they were dilapidated and lined with the ruins of countless buildings.</p>
<p><a id="page-45"/>“…Is that…?!” Riselia swallowed nervously.</p>
<p>Regina, Sakuya and Elfiné’s eyes widened in shocked disbelief.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to see clearly because of the miasma, but…,” Diglassê began grimly, “after disappearing into a Void territory six years ago, it seems that the Third Assault Garden has returned.”</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>An eerie silence settled over the meeting room.</p>
<p><em>The Third Assault Garden?</em> If Leonis recalled correctly, that was Riselia’s birthplace, a city destroyed in a Void Stampede.</p>
<p>“The Third Assault Garden’s mana furnace should have completely shut down,” Riselia said, her voice shaking. “And the whole city had to be abandoned. So how…?”</p>
<p>“The cause is still unknown,” the information analysis officer replied. “Excalibur Academy speculates that the deactivated mana furnace was driven to an uncontrollable state via some unidentified factor.”</p>
<p>“An uncontrollable state…? Is that even possible?” Riselia muttered.</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen any cases of this in the past, but that’s not to say it’s impossible,” Diglassê replied. “The fact of the matter is that the Third Assault Garden is currently moving at fourth combat speed.”</p>
<p>“Where is it heading?” Elfiné inquired.</p>
<p>“We don’t know for certain, but it’s been moving steadily south…” Another image appeared over the table at the information officer’s command. This time, it was a map showing the portions of the seas under humanity’s control. “Which means it will come into contact with the Seventh Assault Garden.”</p>
<p>“…!” The girls of the eighteenth platoon exchanged startled looks.</p>
<p>“It’s moving slowly, and this is just an approximation, but it <a id="page-46"/>should reach us within fourteen days,” the information analysis officer concluded.</p>
<p>“Why here?” Elfiné wondered again.</p>
<p>“That is still in the dark, I’m afraid. However…” The officer hesitated for a moment. “Soon after the Third Assault Garden emerged from within the Void territory, it sent two distress signals to the Seventh Assault Garden.”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“I-it can’t be…,” Riselia whispered, an expression of utter shock on her face. “I mean, there shouldn’t be anyone there… No one else survived.”</p>
<p>“Officially, yes. The only ones who lived through that Stampede were a small group of people who took cover in the underground shelters, including the two of you. But even if there were any undiscovered survivors, they couldn’t possibly have endured six years in the Void territory. Yet, something sent those distress signals. There’s the possibility of a mechanical malfunction, but…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>While everyone else was listening to Diglassê’s explanation, Leonis’s eyes were glued to the image of the ruined city projected on the table. No one but him seemed to notice. More specifically, Leonis was the only one who could have recognized the oddity.</p>
<p>What he saw was…</p>
<p><em>How? How did that get there?</em> As Leonis pondered a question he could not find the answer to, Diglassê rose from her seat silently and glanced around the room, eyeing everyone present.</p>
<p>“So, with this being the situation, I’m sure you understand the reason I’ve called you here.”</p>
<p>“You want us to investigate the Third Assault Garden,” Riselia reasoned.</p>
<p><a id="page-47"/>“Precisely. Eighteenth platoon, I am hereby ordering you to inspect this ruined city.”</p>
<p>This didn’t come as a surprise. Riselia and the other girls’ expressions didn’t waver at all. Teens though they were, these young women were students of Excalibur Academy and full-fledged military knights. As bearers of Holy Swords, they accepted their duty and were willing to lay down their lives to protect their home.</p>
<p>“In the event that you encounter a critical situation, you have the approval to retreat at your platoon captain’s judgment. Based upon your report as the advance force, the academy will send a larger search party at a later date.”</p>
<p>“Have any Voids been sighted in the Third Assault Garden?” Sakuya inquired, speaking for the first time in this meeting. “Considering the city emerged from a Void territory, isn’t there a high possibility that it serves as a Void nest?”</p>
<p>“At present, no Void outbreaks have been detected around the target area. But keep in mind that we haven’t been able to observe the Assault Garden in detail.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me, I have a question,” Riselia interjected as she gingerly raised her hand.</p>
<p>“You have permission to speak.”</p>
<p>“Serving as an advance force in this situation is an important duty. Why give it to us?”</p>
<p>So far, the eighteenth platoon had been entrusted with refugee rescue and site investigation missions. More important assignments were always given to higher-ranked groups.</p>
<p>Diglassê hesitated before at last replying, “It was the administration bureau’s idea. I’m sure a girl as bright as you can understand the meaning behind the choice.”</p>
<p>“…It’s because I’m Duke Crystalia’s daughter, isn’t it?”</p>
<p><a id="page-48"/>“Lady Selia…” Regina bit her lips.</p>
<p>Leonis quickly picked up on the situation. <em>They’re saying they want a hero. Humans never change, do they?</em> he thought bitterly.</p>
<p>Riselia was a tragic girl whose Holy Sword awakened after a long period of dormancy. Bound by the duty of a Holy Swordswoman, she would return to her birthplace, a city destroyed by Voids. Such a beautiful story was bound to grip one’s heart no matter what era it was.</p>
<p>One thousand years ago, there was a boy who served as a certain kingdom’s hero—Leonis Shealto. His battles brought hope to the people but threw him into despair as he lost agency over his own life.</p>
<p>The current exchange reminded him of that trifling story.</p>
<p>“I won’t deny there is political significance to this. However, I do greatly value your strength as a group. Your victory in the practice match this morning was quite impressive.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, ma’am.” Riselia nodded with a resolved expression and looked around, examining her friends’ faces.</p>
<p>Regina, Sakuya, and Elfiné each bobbed their own heads in assent.</p>
<p>“Leo…” Riselia’s expression wavered when her eyes settled on Leonis’s face.</p>
<p>“Yes, he’s only ten years old and hasn’t been in the academy for long. It’s fine if you exclude him from the—,” Diglassê started, but Leonis cut her off.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to worry about me, ma’am,” he said.</p>
<p>“Leo…”</p>
<p>“Miss Selia, I’m part of the eighteenth platoon, too,” Leonis reminded, gazing straight into her eyes.</p>
<p>“…Understood. I’ll make sure to keep Leo safe,” Riselia declared.</p>
<p>Leonis cracked a wry smile. Riselia had witnessed a sliver of <a id="page-49"/>his power as a Dark Lord. Even still, she could only see him as a child. That hadn’t changed since the day she’d saved him in the mausoleum.</p>
<p>“The eighteenth platoon acknowledges and accepts your orders, ma’am. We will return with results in hand.”</p>
<p>Riselia raised a fist over her chest and saluted the instructor.</p>

<p class="noindent">They were set to sortie four hours later, at seventeen hundred Imperial Standard Time. It was very short notice, but considering the squad’s target was on the move, the faster they investigated, the better.</p>
<p>“Make sure to check your equipment thoroughly and individually. Your gear can save your life.”</p>
<p>Riselia was in her room in the Hræsvelgr dorm, stuffing her bag with things for the mission.</p>
<p>“Oh, these rations aren’t expired yet. We should probably eat them as soon as we can…”</p>
<p>Leonis shrugged as he watched her go about her tasks in a fidgety manner. The entire capital of the Realm of Shadows resided within Leonis’s shadow. Shary watched over his treasury and the bones he used to make his skeleton soldiers. He didn’t need to bother putting his things into his bag. Thus, Leonis simply sat on the edge of the bed, watching Riselia work.</p>
<p>“And a canteen and a hair dryer… Ah, wait, that won’t fit inside, will it?”</p>
<p><em>She’s shaken up. Well, it’s easy to see why.</em> After a small sigh, Leonis said, “That city—the Third Assault Garden—that’s your birthplace, right?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.” Riselia nodded, her hands stopping. A short silence <a id="page-50"/>hung between the two. “…I had a dream this morning,” Riselia whispered abruptly.</p>
<p>“A dream?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. About what happened six years ago. It’d been a long time since I last had that dream…” Riselia closed her bag’s zipper and turned to face Leonis. “The Stampede that destroyed the Third Assault Garden happened six years ago. I was still only nine, and all I could do was sit in the shelter with Regina and cower. My father was fighting the Voids outside, and I just listened and trembled.”</p>
<p>Riselia’s shoulders shook as she thought back to that nightmarish day.</p>
<p>“After that, we were lucky enough to be saved by the Seventh Assault Garden’s refugee search party, but everyone else had been lost. We couldn’t even bury our loved ones.” Riselia’s words felt distant, and they were tinged with pain.</p>
<p><em>I see. Survivor’s guilt.</em> Riselia was bogged down by a regret she shouldn’t have to carry, but that irrational emotion was one Leonis was familiar with. <em>“I escaped again.” That’s what you’re thinking, right?</em></p>
<p>“I have a duty to go back to that place. Honestly, I’m anxious about it, and I don’t know what might happen, but…”</p>
<p>“…I know.” Leonis nodded.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the communication terminal rang out.</p>
<p>“Elfiné…”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Selia, I analyzed the route to our destination. Could you give it a look?”</span></strong></p>
<p>“Ah, yes, of course. I’ll be right over,” Riselia replied seriously. “I’ll be going out for a bit, Leo. Pack up the rest, okay?” With that, the argent-haired young woman hurried out of the room.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>After seeing the door close and confirming that Riselia’s footsteps were growing distant…</p>
<p><a id="page-51"/>“Blackas, Shary,” Leonis said.</p>
<p>“Did you call, my friend?”</p>
<p>“D-did… <em>Cough, cough…</em> Did you call for me, my lord?”</p>
<p>Leonis’s shadow rippled, and a large ebon wolf surfaced from within it. A few seconds later, an adorable girl dressed in a maid’s uniform appeared after the beast. The black-haired maid was holding a half-eaten doughnut and had her white cheeks stuffed like a squirrel. Her face was dirty with crumbs.</p>
<p>“What is this, Shary?” inquired Leonis.</p>
<p>“Sticky doughnuts. I bought quite a few of them.”</p>
<p>“…” Leonis stared at Shary, his eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a few for you, too, my lord.”</p>
<p>“…Mm.”</p>
<p>Shary pulled out a doughnut from one of her sleeves. Leonis took it and bit into it, glaring at the girl all the while.</p>
<p>“Hmm, this is…”</p>
<p>It did have a sticky, unusual texture dissimilar to any other sweet Leonis had eaten so far. The scent of cinnamon made it quite delicious.</p>
<p>“Hmm, this texture… Human civilization truly has come far,” Leonis praised.</p>
<p>“Shall I brew you some tea, my lord?” Shary offered.</p>
<p>“Why, yes… Wait, no, there’s no need. You really have gotten used to this world, haven’t you?” the Dark Lord observed, half-impressed and half-amazed.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve taken up a part-time job in the interest of gathering intelligence.”</p>
<p>“Of what sort, exactly?”</p>
<p>“Work involving making sweets,” Shary answered, holding a hand up to her chest reverently.</p>
<p>“You are my minion. I don’t recall approving anything of <a id="page-53"/>the sort,” Leonis stated, pressing a palm to his forehead in exasperation.</p>
