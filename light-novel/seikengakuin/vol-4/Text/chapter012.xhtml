<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter012">THE HOLY LIGHT FESTIVAL</a></h1>
<p class="noindent">Two days had passed since the demon attack. The Holy Light Festival had arrived. As Riselia had hoped, the sky was bright and the weather was clear. The sun shone warmly upon the academy’s flagstones.</p>
<p>“Mm, looking good! The place has just the right atmosphere!”</p>
<p>Riselia gave a satisfied nod, glancing around the meeting room on the first floor. It had been transformed with decorations for the café and was completely unrecognizable. While the Hræsvelgr dorm’s exterior had been left unaltered—aged and dignified—the girls had done a splendid job remodeling the interior.</p>
<p>All the wallpaper had been changed, lending them the appearance of an eerie painting. Little bells shaped like skulls and bats hung from the ceiling. Three skeletons adorned the building’s entrance.</p>
<p>“It’s like a real vampire mansion. It’s kind of relaxing,” Riselia remarked.</p>
<p>“Actual vampire abodes are no different from regular aristocrat estates,” Leonis, who once had vampires serving under him, corrected. “They were all quite gloomy places.”</p>
<p>Still, he couldn’t deny that this place was well suited to the undead, though.</p>
<p><em>Hmm. This atmosphere is indeed relaxing. It reminds me of the underground mausoleum.</em></p>
<p>The illumination was just right, too. Leonis wouldn’t have minded leaving the dorm this way permanently.</p>
<p>“It’s a good thing it’s bright out today. Though, it kind of clashes with the café’s mood…,” Regina muttered, looking out the window.</p>
<p>“The contrast kind of adds to the fun, doesn’t it?” Riselia responded, a strained smile on her lips.</p>
<p>Outside, a murder of crows was roosting on a nearby tree, likely lured by Riselia’s vampiric power.</p>
<p>“It’s about time we change into our costumes and get ready,” Elfiné decided, clapping her hands to gather everyone’s attention.</p>
<p>“Oh, right!” Riselia exclaimed.</p>
<p>Leaving Leonis behind, the girls filed into Elfiné’s room, which had been designated as their dressing booth.</p>

<p class="space-break">While Riselia and the other girls were changing into their costumes, Leonis went to the kitchen to brew coffee and took a seat at one of the café’s tables. During his era, he’d never thought something like coffee would exist. It was as if the darkness of the blackest pitch had been concentrated into a beverage. A perfect drink to fit a Dark Lord’s image if there ever was one. If it weren’t so bitter, it would have been flawless.</p>
<p><em>That aside…</em>, Leonis pondered as he added plenty of sugar to the cup and stirred it.</p>
<p>For the time being, there were no further signs of the demon assassins. Was there only one after all, or were they perhaps biding their time, lying in wait for the proper chance?</p>
<p>Leonis was keeping a watchful eye on Riselia, too, but it didn’t seem like anyone who might try to abduct her had made contact with her. A few students approached the young woman, trying to hit on her, but Leonis cast a Death Delusion on them, which left them crippled with terror for several days.</p>
<p>Leonis may have been the most forgiving of the Dark Lords, but even he knew to answer an attempt to lay hands on his favored minion with bitter punishment.</p>
<p><em>Either way, I will have to remain vigilant for a while longer.</em></p>
<p>“—We’re ready, Leo. <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>”</p>
<p>It was then that the door to the dressing room opened. In came Riselia, dressed in her café outfit.</p>
<p>“…M-Miss Selia?!” Leonis very nearly spat out his coffee, his cheeks turning red.</p>
<p>The silver-haired young woman was dressed in a sleek, glossy enamel leather outfit. It showed off a generous amount of cleavage and revealed her thighs seductively. There were two small bat wings attached to the outfit’s back. It was attire styled in the image of a vampire.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh. You better be a good boy, or the big bad vampire’s going to suck your blood,” Riselia said with a wink as Leonis stiffened.</p>
<p>She’d probably thought it a playful joke on Leonis that a vampire was dressed up in a vampire-like costume.</p>
<p><em>No, that’s not what a vampire looks like—that’s a succubus!</em> Leonis quipped to himself.</p>
<p>True, the two species were similar in appearance, but succubi were a type of demon, not undead. The research materials Riselia had gathered had likely mixed up the two.</p>
<p>“The kid’s looking at you with horny eyes, Lady Selia. I told you this was too titillating,” Regina remarked from behind Riselia.</p>
<p>“Huh?!” Riselia looked at Leonis with surprise.</p>
<p>“I—I did not!” Leonis hurriedly protested.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh. You sure about that, kid?” Regina questioned.</p>
<p>In contrast to Riselia’s alluring outfit, Regina was dressed in a bright-poppy-orange getup. Her hair ribbons had pumpkin designs reminiscent of a monster called a jack-o’-lantern. However, no such creature had ever been a part of the Dark Lords’ Armies. As Leonis thought about it, he began to wonder if jack-o’-lanterns were even real. As far as he could recall, they only ever showed up in books.</p>
<p>As that thought crossed his mind, Leonis’s eyes were naturally drawn to Regina’s chest, which seemed rather cramped under her blouse buttons.</p>
<p>“What do you think, kid? Does it suit me?” Regina leaned forward with a mischievous grin.</p>
<p>“Y-yes, you look…very cute,” Leonis replied honestly, averting his gaze from her bosom.</p>
<p>Hearing this meek praise made a blush creep over Regina’s cheeks.</p>
<p>“K-k-kyut…?” She ended up biting on her tongue.</p>
<p><em>…That’s really cute.</em></p>
<p>“W-well, kid, you’ve sure learned how to hand out compliments,” Regina stuttered bashfully. “At this rate, you’re gonna be a Dark Lord in the bedroom when you get older.”</p>
<p><em>Hmm. Is she…?</em> Leonis wondered, realizing something. “Oh, no, you’re truly very cute, Regina. You’re pretty,” he continued, laying on the compliments.</p>
<p>“Y-you shouldn’t tease older girls like this, kid!” Regina hurriedly replied.</p>
<p>“Honestly, the ribbons suit you well.”</p>
<p>“…Grr, Lady Selia, the kid’s bullying me!” Regina cried and hid behind Riselia, her face red down to her neck.</p>
<p><em>I see. This maid is weak to direct compliments, is she?</em> Leonis’s expression turned vicious at discovering this unexpected weakness.</p>
<p>“Wh-what about me, Leo?” Riselia looked at him with a lonely frown.</p>
<p>However, before he could reply…</p>
<p>“M-Miss Finé, I can’t! This is too embarrassing!”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry; you look great.”</p>
<p>Elfiné exited the dressing room, pulling Sakuya by the hand. The former’s outfit was an old-style witch costume. She had a pointy round hat and an ebony-colored cloak. Her sleek, black hair was done up, and her mature smile made the girl the very image of a witch.</p>
<p>“You look great, Miss Finé!” Riselia complimented enthusiastically.</p>
<p>“Thank you. You look pretty, too, Selia,” Elfiné replied with a smile. “Come on, Sakuya, show yourself to Leo…”</p>
<p>Sakuya was only peeking her head out the door, but Elfiné tugged her into view.</p>
<p>“…Aaah!”</p>
<p>Against her will, she entered stumbling, unintentionally showing herself to everyone.</p>
<p><em>Oh, this is…</em> Leonis’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>The young swordswoman was dressed in a black-and-white gothic Lolita-style long skirt. She had a stylish mini hat and an Alice band on her head that fit her blue hair perfectly.</p>
<p>“…That was awful, Miss Finé,” Sakuya muttered begrudgingly, gripping the hems of her skirt.</p>
<p>She looked completely different from when she slew Voids with Raikirimaru in hand.</p>
<p>“What do you think, Leo?” Elfiné inquired.</p>
<p>“I think she’s adorable.”</p>
<p>“Are you making fun of me, kid?” Sakuya glared at him sullenly.</p>
<p>That sulking expression of hers was lovely in its own way. Leonis looked at the four girls lined up before him. A quartet of beauties dressed in costumes, each charming in her own right. Leonis did not doubt that they would be popular with the customers.</p>
<p><em>I suppose I’ll be busy today.</em></p>
<p>Leonis was set to staff the kitchen. Of course, if things turned too hectic, he could summon his Shadow Servants or skeletons to help.</p>
<p>“I’ll go start my preparations, then—,” Leonis said, heading for the kitchen.</p>
<p>But then…</p>
<p>“Oh, wait up, kid,” Regina called while cutting ahead of him.</p>
<p>“…Wh-what is it, Miss Regina?” Leonis asked, a slight sense of dread settling over his heart.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee… Hee-hee…,” Regina chuckled ominously, crossing her arms. “Actually, kid, we prepared one for you, too.”</p>
<p>“…P-prepared what?”</p>
<p>“Well, if you’re going to fit in with the café’s atmosphere, you’re going to need suitable attire.”</p>
<p>“A costume? But I’ll be in the kitchen, out of sight…”</p>
<p>“Right, because we were told that having a boy living in the girls’ dorms looks bad from a public morals’ perspective.”</p>
<p>“Well, yes…”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Regina took out a folded-up bundle of cloth—a frilly dress.</p>
<p>“But if <em>you become a girl, that’s not a problem</em>.”</p>
<p>“W-wait! Stop right there!” Leonis exclaimed. “How did you come to that conclusion?! B-besides, this is all too sudden!”</p>
<p>“I mean, if I’d told you ahead of time, you would have run away.”</p>
<p>“Obviously!”</p>
<p>“Now, put it on. It’s cute!” Regina spread out the ensemble to show him.</p>
<p>It was a dainty maid outfit.</p>
<p>“I made it,” Riselia revealed.</p>
<p>“Miss Selia?!” Leonis looked at her, aghast.</p>
<p><em>My minion conspired against me?!</em></p>
<p>“I—I can’t wear this; these are women’s clothes!” Leonis’s honor as a Dark Lord wouldn’t allow it! Glaring at Regina, whose face was twisted in a sinister grin, Leonis took a step back… Only for someone to grab him by the shoulders.</p>
<p>“…Miss Sakuya?!”</p>
<p>“Don’t hold this against me,” she stated solemnly. “I don’t want to be the only one subjected to humiliation here.”</p>
<p>“But you’re a girl!” protested Leonis.</p>
<p>“B-be quiet. I’m taking you down with me, kid!”</p>
<p>Now Sakuya had turned against him. Left with no other recourse, Leonis turned to Elfiné. Surely the ever-responsible oldest girl among the group would come to his aid.</p>
<p>“Hmm… I’m sure you’ll make an adorable girl, Leo,” Elfiné said, bringing her hands together in a show of apology.</p>
<p>In the end, Leonis was powerless to resist.</p>

<p class="space-break">08:30 Imperial Standard Time.</p>
<p>Excalibur Academy’s gates swung open, and countless citizens poured onto the premises. Even during peacetimes, part of the campus grounds was always accessible to the general populace. The training facilities themselves and the academy’s school buildings were typically off-limits. That changed during the Holy Light Festival, however.</p>
<p>Half the visitors to the academy were people from the Sixth Assault Garden, which was currently docked nearby. They mostly came to watch the Holy Sword Blade Dance Festival, a large-scale tournament of mock battles between Holy Swordsmen.</p>
<p>Typically, sparring matches were projected onto large screens across the city, but during the Holy Sword Blade Dance Festival, spectators were allowed to watch from the grounds.</p>
<p>“The afternoon matches are especially popular, because that’s when high-ranked platoons participate. So we should have less traffic then,” Riselia explained.</p>
