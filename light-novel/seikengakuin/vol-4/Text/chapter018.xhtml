<p class="noindent"><em>She</em> had finally awakened from her thousand-year seal. The lord of the skies, the bringer of storms. The herald of calamity. Ruler of the world and sovereign among sovereigns.</p>
<p>Veira, the Dragon Lord. The grand ruler of the dragons, who had slumbered in this icy prison, awaiting the goddess’s rebirth.</p>
<p>However, the great creature’s soul had been tainted. Nothingness was consuming her spirit, eating into it from within. Her awakened consciousness was corrupted, and…</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break"><em>Groooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh…!</em></p>
<p>Veira’s howl quaked the world. Her frozen prison was ripped asunder at once, sending gigantic ice fragments ripping into the bulkheads like paper.</p>
<p>“…Nng, Rua Meires!”</p>
<p>Leonis reflexively deployed a mana barrier, protecting Riselia and the others behind him. Emergency lights came on, and a shrill alarm blared through the laboratory.</p>
<p>“…Veira… You truly are alive…” Leonis groaned as he watched the dragon rise, now freed from its seal.</p>
<p>Veira was a Dark Lord of the same rank as Leonis. Until now, Leonis had thought she’d met her end against the Six Heroes.</p>
<p><em>That ice block. It was the highest tier of Dragon Tongue Sorcery, the Frozen Prison of Time, Ex Quiriz.</em></p>
<p>The permafrost container guarded against interference from all powers and suspended the soul. Even the flames at the heart of the world could not melt it. Veira had willingly encased herself in this prison, where she had slumbered for a millennium.</p>
<p><em>Just like I did…</em></p>
<p>The crimson dragon started unfurling her wings as emergency bulkheads began to come down. Lightning-like mana began shining around Veira.</p>
<p><em>Is she going to fly out of here?</em></p>
<p>Veira raised her head, looking to the sky far above it. Incandescent light began gathering in her jaw.</p>
<p>“Leo, get down…!” Riselia shouted, pushing Leonis to the floor.</p>
<p><em>Bwhoooooooooooosh!</em></p>
<p>The burning flash evaporated several levels’ worth of special alloy bulwarks in the blink of an eye. Metal fragments rained down, the deafening sound of them clattering to the floor ringing in Leonis’s ears.</p>
<p>“…!” Lying on the floor, Leonis looked up. Overhead, he could now spy the sky through the massive hole Veira had blasted. Lightning boomed and flashed in the gathering storm clouds.</p>
<p><em>Graaaaaaaaaaah!</em></p>
<p>The Dragon Lord raised her voice in a growling cry as her massive form took off. She wasn’t using her wings to fly. Many dragons soared by enveloping their bodies in mana. The crimson dragon floated up quietly, escaping into the outside world.</p>
<p>“What…?” Elfiné was the first to recover from her stunned silence. “What was that monster?! Clauvia, what was that?!”</p>
<p>“That was unexpected. I never thought this would be how the Dark Lord’s seal would break…,” Clauvia stated, eyes fixed above.</p>
<p>“…Dark Lord?” Elfiné questioned blankly.</p>
<p>“That’s right,” Clauvia whispered. “That creature was a ruler in ancient times, a harbinger of death, destruction, and chaos that rebelled against the gods of this planet. Duke Crystalia referred to beings like that dragon as Dark Lords.”</p>
<p>Leonis turned to look at Clauvia suspiciously. He was sure the people of this era had forgotten all about the Dark Lords and the gods.</p>
<p><em>Just how much did Riselia’s father know?</em></p>
<p>Now wasn’t the time to pursue that line of questioning, however. Not when Veira, the Dragon Lord, was alive, awake, and rampaging.</p>
<p>“If we let that monster run free, it’ll wipe out the entirety of the Sixth Assault Garden!” Elfiné exclaimed.</p>
<p>“And the Seventh Assault Garden, too. Both will be leveled in half a day,” Clauvia appended.</p>
<p>“.…!” Elfiné glared at her sister.</p>
<p>“Miss Elfiné, things are going to get chaotic. We have to evacuate the civilians,” Riselia said.</p>
<p>“You’re right…” Elfiné manifested multiple Eye of the Witch orbs in the air around her.</p>
<p>“The lab’s central sector still isn’t responding…,” Clauvia stated with a perplexed expression, pressing a terminal to her ear.</p>
<p>“I’ll go check it out,” Riselia decided, turning to face Leonis. “Leo, you should—”</p>
<p>Yet the boy wasn’t there. Instead, he was standing beneath the shaft with the Staff of Sealed Sins in his hands.</p>
<p>“Leo?!” Riselia cried, startled.</p>
<p>“I’ll go after that dragon!” he declared before using his sorcery to fly up.</p>
<p>“…Wait, Leo!”</p>

<p class="space-break">A siren blared. People screamed in terror as the shadow of the giant dragon loomed above. But amid this chaos, a single young man in priestly garb walked composedly through the laboratory.</p>
<p>“That’s strange. This is much sooner than I’d expected,” the Void called Nefakess Reizaad said with suspicion.</p>
<p>Veira had awakened before the Trapezohedron’s corruption could completely corrupt her soul.</p>
<p>“I suppose that’s just a testament to the great Dragon Lord’s power.”</p>
<p>Then Nefakess wondered if there was some other factor at play. Regardless, Veira’s spirit would be consumed before long, revealing if she was a suitable vessel for the goddess.</p>
<p>“Oh. My, my…”</p>
<p>His gaze then turned to a glass pane separating the lab from a corridor, where a single girl sprinted past him. She was a beautiful sight with flowing, argent hair.</p>
<p>“Aaah, how lovely. This must be the goddess’s guidance at work…,” Nefakess remarked, his thin lips contorting into a vicious smile.</p>

<p class="space-break">As the wind raged violently around her, Shary saw the gigantic red dragon soar past her from atop a high-rise building.</p>
<p>“…Is that Lord Veira?!” Her eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p><em>Why is the Dragon Lord here?! Just what is going on in this city?!</em></p>
<p>“Getting distracted? How complacent!”</p>
<p>A six-legged lizard demon extended its long spear-like tongue toward the maid. Shary narrowly avoided it, slashing through the tongue and severing it down the middle. The demon howled, but Shary ignored it and turned around, casually tossing a dagger behind her as she did. A bat demon that had been closing in on her let out a pained screech.</p>
<p>“The Dragon Lord… Is this your doing?” she asked the spiral demon as she drew another dagger from under her skirt.</p>
<p>The spiral demon was likely the leader of the group. The lizard and bat ones were equal in strength to the spider demon that attacked the academy. The spiral demon, however, was stronger.</p>
<p>“I know nothing of it. I only follow my master’s orders,” the creature asserted.</p>
<p>“…Your master?”</p>
<p>“You think an assassin would reveal their boss’s name?”</p>
<p>The spiral demon vanished from sight. A moment later, the shadows beneath Shary’s feet began to churn.</p>
<p><em>He’s a user of shadows, just like me!</em></p>
<p>Shary jumped away, hurling a knife at her feet. Unfortunately, the spiral demon deflected it easily.</p>
<p>“You, at least, seem to be a bit more capable than the rest,” the assassin remarked, her dusk-colored eyes glinting.</p>
<p>Three daggers flew through the air and then stabbed into the ground in a formation around the hovering spiral demon.</p>
<p>“—Vars Rea!”</p>
<p>Using the weapons as a conduit, Shary unleashed a third-order shadow magic spell—the Umbral Lightning Slash. Black electricity lashed at the demon repeatedly. It was unlikely to kill an opponent of this level, but it would buy Shary time.</p>
<p>She kicked off the ground and raced vertically up a water tower, the hems of her skirt flapping as she ran.</p>
<p>“Shaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>Countless ebon tendrils extended toward her from atop the structure. It was the bat demon. Shary avoided all of them handily, jumping into the air and then planting the soles of her boots into the creature. The bat demon crashed into the roof of the water tower, and Shary mercilessly drove a dagger into its throat. After a final howl of agony, the monstrous thing met its end.</p>
<p><em>Taking a life is all too simple.</em></p>
<p>Looking up, Shary found the red dragon again. Veira soared toward the Seventh Assault Garden, destroying the city beneath it with sheer wind pressure. There was someone following it, too, jumping between the rooftops.</p>
<p><em>M-my lord?!</em> Spotting Leonis, Shary made to follow him.</p>
<p><em>Whish…!</em></p>
<p>A shadow coiled around her wrist, however, holding the girl in place.</p>
<p>“You’re not going anywhere.”</p>
<p>The spiral demon extended another arm. At the same time, more of its ilk were gathering on the rooftop.</p>
<p>“You fools. Can’t you tell how much stronger I am?” Shary sighed as she took out another dagger. “As your senior in the arts of assassination, I suppose I have an obligation to put you in your place.”</p>

<p class="space-break">Riselia raced up the research institute’s emergency staircase with blinding speed. The steps had crumbled here and there, but she was using mana to leap over anything in her way.</p>
<p>Clauvia Phillet had called the gigantic dragon trapped inside the ice block a Dark Lord. Riselia was familiar with that term.</p>
<p><em>The book Father left behind mentioned that creature’s name…</em></p>
<p>A sovereign of the ancient world, Veira, the Dragon Lord.</p>
<p>She’d only been able to decipher the monster’s name, though. Riselia didn’t know anything about what kind of creature it was. Still, the terrifying power of that dragon was palpable.</p>
<p><em>Leo went after it, but…</em> Riselia knew, of course, that Leonis was an exceptional sorcerer. Yet as strong as he was, his body was still that of a child.</p>
<p><em>Thud!</em></p>
<p>Riselia smashed open the bulkhead sealing the central sector with a kick.</p>
<p>“…Huh?” Her eyes widened in surprise at the sight that greeted her inside. The researchers were all tied up with ropes and lying on the floor. “Wh-what…?”</p>
<p>Before she could run over to help them, the rumbling roar of gunfire brought her to a stop.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Riselia reflexively took cover behind the broken bulkhead.</p>
<p>“Dammit, now we’ve gotta deal with a Holy Swordsman!”</p>
<p>“What the hell was that monster?!”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t it supposed to be a spirit?!”</p>
<p>A group of beastmen with hoods over their faces were shouting to one another as they fired their rifles.</p>
<p>“Holy Sword—Activate!” Riselia chanted, and her Bloody Sword manifested in her hands. She cut a shallow scratch into her wrist, letting blood laced with mana drip onto the floor. Then she brandished her weapon, allowing the crimson liquid running along it to drop, and suddenly, the red puddle on the floor turned to countless sharp edges that swept the barrage of bullets from the air.</p>
<p>“Ahhhhh!” The terrorists ran off at this demonstration of power.</p>
<p>Paying no heed to the fleeing insurgents, Riselia swung her Holy Sword and sent blades of blood to cut the bound researchers free.</p>
<p>“Everyone, evacuate to the surfac—”</p>
<p>Before Riselia could even finish her instructions, the scientists scrambled toward the exits. The terrorists were getting away, too. Unfortunately, she didn’t have the time to go after them, as fires were beginning to break out in the facility.</p>
<p><em>I need to get out of here, quick—</em></p>
<p>Riselia dashed out into a corridor, checking for more survivors. She did find someone, though it was certainly not who the young woman had been expecting.</p>
<p>“You’re…?!” Riselia raised her voice in surprise.</p>
<p>There stood a slender girl who looked to be thirteen or perhaps fourteen. Her verdant hair was tied into a ponytail, and she had pointed ears. It was Arle Kirlesio, the elf Riselia and her platoon had rescued on the Third Assault Garden.</p>
<p>“A-are you working with these terrorists?!” Riselia asked, aghast.</p>
<p>“N-no! I’m not working with them—,” Arle said hurriedly.</p>
<p>“Oh, no, listen, you can still turn back now! I can be your guardian, so—” Riselia was desperately trying to convince the girl.</p>
<p>“I already said: I’m <em>not</em> on their side!!” The elf shook her head to emphasize the point. “I simply happened to be with them because…well, things just happened!”</p>
<p>“Uh…” Riselia remained doubtful.</p>
<p>Arle shook her head again and then declared, “I’ll go defeat that dragon.”</p>
<p>“H-huh?!” Riselia stammered with surprise.</p>
<p>“Such is the mission I was given.”</p>
<p><em>Wh-what is she saying?!</em></p>
<p>Riselia wondered if perhaps the culture shock of being brought to a new city was causing Arle to act weird. It wasn’t an uncommon occurrence among newly rescued refugees.</p>
<p><em>She really should’ve been sheltered in Excalibur Academy…</em></p>
<p>“Listen, it’s dangerous here right now,” Riselia told the other girl with the kindest voice she could manage. “You should come with me, and—”</p>
<p>“Oh, so you’re with a hero of the old world, too. How unexpected.”</p>
<p>Riselia and Arle turned to face this new voice. On the opposite side of the hall stood a familiar, slender, white-haired man in the priestly garb of the Human Church. It was the mysterious person Riselia had encountered in the Crystalia Estate.</p>
<p>“You. You’re the one from the ruined city,” Arle stated, glaring. Apparently, she was acquainted with this man, too.</p>
<p>“Nefakess Void Lord.” The man bowed his head in a refined, friendly gesture.</p>
<p>“You’re the one who unleashed the Dragon Lord!” Arle shouted as she drew her blade.</p>
<p>“No, the humans were the ones who dug up Lord Veira. I didn’t help them with that. Regardless of my involvement, she would’ve awakened in her own in time,” Nefakess explained with a shrug. “Still, I’m content to let Lord Veira rampage to her heart’s content. I’ve only come for that young lady there.”</p>
<p>With a thin smile, the white-haired man gazed intently at Riselia.</p>
<p>“Were you the one who destroyed the goddess’s vessel in the ruined city?” asked Nefakess.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” Riselia replied, meeting the strange person’s eyes unflinchingly.</p>
<p><em>A goddess… Does he mean that Void Lord? I didn’t do that. It was Leo…</em></p>
<p>Some part of Riselia instinctually understood that letting this man know that was a bad idea, though.</p>
<p><em>He must be an enemy of Leo’s…</em></p>
<p>Holding up her Bloody Sword, Riselia took slow, careful steps backward, retreating. Her vampire senses told her there was danger about. This man was no ordinary human.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s fine. There are plenty of ways to get what I want from you,” Nefakess stated composedly.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Arle sidled up to Riselia and whispered, “Fires raging all around. We can’t afford to fight here.”</p>
<p>“Right…”</p>
<p>Thanks to Riselia’s improved perception, she was already aware of the smoke beyond this passage. Since the young woman had an undead body, she wasn’t vulnerable to suffocation. However, as a Vampire Queen, she was susceptible to fire.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you an opening, so run to the surface,” Arle instructed.</p>
<p>“Understood.” Riselia gave a quick nod.</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p><em>Baaaaaaaaang!</em></p>
<p>Arle swung her sword overhead and slammed it against the floor.</p>
<p>“Huh? H-hey!”</p>
<p>A tremor ran through the structure, and the floor beneath them caved in at once.</p>
<p>“Come on. We’re jumping!”</p>
<p>Arle grabbed Riselia’s hand and sprung up.</p>

</div>
<p class="space-break">The fierce rain whipped so violently that Leonis was having trouble seeing, and the frequent bolts of lightning weren’t helping.</p>
<p><em>…She’s quick. Where is she even headed?</em></p>
<p>Leonis sailed through the stormy sky in pursuit of Veira’s gigantic red form. He couldn’t hope to catch up to her with gravity control spells. Instead, he was kicking off the walls of the countless high-rise buildings dotting the city, using them as footing to propel himself with explosions of mana.</p>
<p>Leonis was never excellent when it came to flying. He could use earth sorcery to levitate, but that didn’t convey him swiftly enough. True flight was the realm of air magic, but that element was a poor fit for undead physiology, and Leonis never mastered it fully.</p>
<p>On occasions when flight was a necessity, he’d always summoned his skull dragon, but riding such a conspicuous mount wasn’t possible in a densely populated city. At worst, the Assault Garden’s antiair defenses would shoot him down.</p>
<p><em>Shary, where are you?!</em></p>
<p>Leonis had been trying to send the assassin telepathic messages for some time now, but he got no response. There was some magical interference in place. That wasn’t something Shary would ever overlook, though. Which meant she was probably fighting someone.</p>
<p><em>I wanted to have her guard Riselia, but I guess that just isn’t possible now.</em></p>
<p>Shary was…probably fine. And if worse came to worst, he did give her <em>that thing</em> for a reason. Right now, Leonis had to focus on pursuing the Dragon Lord.</p>
<p>Seeing Veira alive was a massive shock for Leonis, but he accepted it quickly enough. Some part of him had always felt that someone of Veira’s tenacity wouldn’t die easily. He had fought Veira several times in the past, and she’d always managed to survive.</p>
<p><em>I swear I’ve killed that infernal dragon several times over, and she found a way to cheat death every single time.</em></p>
<p>Veira was headed in the Seventh Assault Garden’s direction. The city had already transitioned to anti-Void interception mode and was firing. None of their attacks would so much as scratch Veira, though.</p>
<p><em>…Don’t tell me she’s headed for Excalibur Academy.</em></p>
<p>As he soared through the blowing wind, Leonis broke into a nervous sweat. The academy was his base of operations. He couldn’t afford to let it be destroyed.</p>
<p><em>She’s gone completely berserk…</em></p>
<p>Veira wasn’t a Dark Lord with a preference for meaningless slaughter. Of the Eight Dark Lords, she was one of the more sensible ones. But when enraged, the dragon became the most terrifying Dark Lord of all. She had once destroyed the mountains the gods occupied in the space of a single night.</p>
<p><em>I won’t let you reduce my kingdom to ashes, Veira!</em></p>
<p>Leonis pushed off against another building.</p>
<p>“Lord Magnus.”</p>
<p>A shadow stirred on the surface of the following structure Leonis was about to use as his footing. A black wolf appeared there, its fur wet.</p>
<p>“You’ve come, Blackas.” Leonis smiled, running along the wall parallel to the dog.</p>
<p>“Lord Magnus, is that not the Dragon Lord? What is happening?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, either. Apparently, the beast was sealed in the tundra but was exhumed by humans.”</p>
<p>As he sprinted, Leonis’s thoughts were racing as well. Why did Veira awaken just as Leonis laid eyes on her? The timing was too conspicuous to be a coincidence.</p>
<p>“Get on,” Blackas told him.</p>
<p>Leonis grabbed onto his friend’s ebony fur and mounted his back. Blackas’s coat was damp with rain.</p>
<p>“Looking like this suits you so much more, friend. The very image of a black wolf.”</p>
<p>“I see…” Blackas nodded curtly as he leaped from shadow to shadow.</p>
<p>This was an ability called Shadow Crossing, something Leonis couldn’t replicate. They rapidly closed in on Veira, but suddenly, the crimson dragon flapped her wings and stopped in midair.</p>
<p>“…What?!”</p>
<p><em>Grooooooooooooooooooh!</em></p>
<p>A rumbling roar shook the skies above the Seventh Assault Garden. The air trembled and rattled, and windows shattered at once.</p>
<p>“A Dragon Beckon…!”</p>
<p>By filling their roars with mana, the greater dragon races could summon others of their kind. However, all true dragons had gone extinct. There were none to answer the cry.</p>
<p><em>Who is she calling?</em></p>
<p><em>Crack… Crack… Crack…!</em></p>
<p>Countless fissures formed throughout the air.</p>
<p>“…Voids?”</p>
<p>Monstrous, dragon-like voids tore through the fissures. Though they vaguely resembled the mighty creatures Leonis admired, they could never be mistaken for the genuine article. Their torsos were disgustingly swollen, their wings seemed to spurt from their backs in random places, and countless tendrils wiggled eerily from their bodies. These things seemed a mockery of all that was draconic—beholding them filled Leonis with anger and hatred.</p>
<p>“Veira. Even one as grand as you has been polluted by the Voids.”</p>
<p>Rage swelled in Leonis’s heart. The Archsage and Holy Woman had been similarly corrupted, but this was different. Veira was a dragon, the single greatest creature in existence. This was Leonis’s worthy match and rival. Seeing her tainted and disgraced like this was unforgivable.</p>
<p>“Curse you! You would besmirch the title of Dark Lord?!”</p>
<p>Red flames billowed from the tip of the Staff of Sealed Sins. The eighth-order spell, Grand Annihilation Fireball. The massive crimson sphere burst in the sky. Torrents of scorching heat blew away the Voids emerging from the cracks!</p>

<p class="space-break">Sirens screamed through Excalibur Academy, alerting its personnel to enter class-1 combat positions. The events on the academy combat field were immediately called off, and all the platoons hurried to defend their home.</p>
<p>“I don’t remember inviting those things to the Holy Light Festival!”</p>
<p>Regina climbed up to the dorm’s roof, still dressed in her haunted café outfit. A large number of citizens had been evacuated to the lawn around the building.</p>
<p>“Everyone, get inside!” Regina called out from above.</p>
<p>While the structure looked rickety enough to be blown off by the storm, it was better that the civilians took shelter.</p>
<p>Her pigtails fluttering in the raging winds, Regina manifested her Holy Sword, the Drag Howl, and shouldered it. The sight in the sky was both incredible and frightening.</p>
<p><em>What are those things…?!</em></p>
<p>Flying among the dark clouds were countless dragon-class Voids.</p>
<p>Regina’s Holy Sword was optimized for long-distance bombardment, but in its current form, it wouldn’t be able to hit targets moving at high speeds accurately. On the other hand, these Voids were even larger than the wyvern class, and her Holy Sword’s Drag Striker mode lacked the firepower to penetrate their defenses.</p>
<p>Perhaps noticing the citizens gathered at the ground, the Void dragons circling overhead began gliding down toward the surface.</p>
<p>“You’re not getting any closer!”</p>
<p><em>Bang, bang, bang, bang!</em></p>
<p>The Drag Howl flashed, spewing intermittent blasts of fire.</p>
<p><em>Whooosh…!</em></p>
<p>One dragon-class Void was shot down, crashing into the forest behind the dorm.</p>
<p>“That’s one…,” Regina muttered. Unfortunately, the Void she’d felled sluggishly rose to its feet only a few moments later.</p>
<p><em>…These things are tougher than I thought.</em></p>
<p><em>Bang, bang, bang!</em></p>
<p>Regina’s Drag Howl loosed three more shots.</p>
<p><em>I have to hang on until Sakuya gets here…</em></p>
<p>Their strongest fighter, Sakuya, had been on a break at the training grounds when the attack began. Regina had tried to contact her, but apparently, the Voids were jamming communication.</p>
<p><em>She should still be on her way</em>, Regina reasoned.</p>
<p>However, Sakuya could be caught in a battle herself. It was also possible she’d been mobilized into one of the executive committee’s interception squadrons.</p>
<p>The shadow of a gigantic Void glided across the ground. Regina took aim at the creature soaring above and fired, but it paid no heed to her attacks. With a roar, a gout of flames gathered in its mouth.</p>
<p><em>Oh, crap…!</em> Regina tried to meet the blast with a volley from her Drag Howl, but she hadn’t reacted in time. A white flash of heat incinerated the forest’s trees and quickly engulfed the dormitory and Regina with it!</p>
<p>“Serene mirror of the water gods—Arzays!”</p>
<p>The next moment, a shining blue spherical mirror manifested in front of Regina. The Void’s surge of flames was drawn into the mirror, then dispersed back in every direction.</p>
<p><em>Boom, boom, boom-boom-boom!</em></p>
<p>The deflected fire exploded around the premises, forming burning pillars.</p>
<p>“Aaah…!”</p>
<p>The damage was great, but Regina and the dorm survived. Perplexed that she was still living, Regina searched for the source of the voice that had saved her. High in the sky, she spotted a robed skeleton holding a staff.</p>
<p>“H-huuuuuh?!” Regina cried out in astonishment, nearly falling off the roof.</p>
<p>“Kah-kah-kah! The dragons of my day were far more robust!” The bony figure cackled and rattled.</p>
<p>It then turned the tip of its staff toward the approaching Voids.</p>
<p>“Blow forth, wisp of the Dragon Lord’s breath—Raz Veira!”</p>
<p><em>Whoooooooooooooosh!</em></p>
<p>Coursing red flames reduced a pack of charging voids to cinders.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>By this point, Regina could only stare at the scene, stupefied.</p>
<p>“You mustn’t hog all the prey, Sir Nefisgal!”</p>
<p>“Here, here! We deserve a chance at glory, too!”</p>
<p>These two new voices prompted Regina to look down. There she spied two more skeletons in battle armor.</p>
<p>“Worry not, friends! There’s plenty of enemies to go around, Sir Amilas, Sir Dorug!”</p>
<p>Feeling a sense of vertigo settle over, Regina pressed her finger against her temple. On closer inspection, she recognized these creatures. They were the skeleton props they’d set up in front of the haunted café’s entrance. Leonis had brought them to help set the mood.</p>
<p>“Ah…” Connecting the pieces, Regina shrugged.</p>
<p><em>It’s the kid with his tricks again…</em></p>
<p>She’d seen Leonis summon some kind of dragon made of bone aboard the <em>Hyperion</em>. These three were probably his doing as well, sentinels to guard the dorm.</p>
<p><em>I guess he’s been trying to keep his true power a secret, but he does such a terrible job at it!</em></p>
<p>In all likelihood, everyone in the eighteenth platoon had discerned that there was more to Leonis than meets the eye. After all the flashy stunts he’d pulled, it was impossible not to be suspicious. Only Leonis thought he was covert.</p>
<p><em>I guess we shouldn’t say anything if he’s that dead set on hiding it, then.</em></p>
<p>Regina didn’t know what he actually was. Yet, he had saved the life of her little sister, Princess Altiria. So even if the administration bureau started asking around about Leonis, Regina had every intention of protecting his secret.</p>
<p><em>I just hope a day comes when the kid feels ready to tell us the truth…</em></p>
<p>It was then that she heard a muffled voice coming from her communication terminal.</p>
<p><span class="font">“—gina, ca—ear me?”</span></p>
<p>“Miss Finé?! Where are you right now?!”</p>
<p><span class="font">“Sixth—rden—ask the Acad—forcements?”</span></p>
<p>Her voice sounded awfully shaken. Normal transmissions were still impossible. Elfiné must have been using the Eye of the Witch’s power to break through the Void’s jamming.</p>
<p>“—Are you asking if the academy can send you Holy Swordsmen for reinforcements?”</p>
<p><span class="font">“Yes—lease—”</span></p>
<p>Unlike the Seventh Assault Garden, which often fought Void nests on the front lines, the Sixth Assault Garden was a supply city. There weren’t many Holy Swordsmen stationed there. The academy’s administration bureau was aware of that, but with no method of easy message relay, it would take them time to deploy.</p>
<p>Regina looked at the skeletal knights chattering among one another.</p>
<p><em>I can let the kid’s skeletons handle protecting this place, right?</em></p>
<p>The robed skeleton did wipe out one of the larger Voids in the blink of an eye. If the other two were as strong as their companion, then they were wasted on guarding this dorm. Yet Regina had a feeling that though these skeletons were ordered to protect the Hræsvelgr dorm, they’d be indifferent to the fate of the rest of the academy. Was it really okay for Regina to leave?</p>
<p><em>It’d take me a while to get to the Sixth Assault Garden with a vehicle, too…</em></p>
<p>Regina bit on the nail of her thumb, conflicted. Fortunately, she spied a familiar shape dashing through the rain.</p>
<p>“Sakuya!”</p>
<p>“Sorry I’m late! I was caught up fighting the Voids!” Sakuya screeched to a halt in front of the gate.</p>
<p>“Can you go help protect the Sixth Assault Garden?!” Regina shouted down at her from the rooftop.</p>
<p>“What about the academy?” replied the swordswoman.</p>
<p>“We should be okay!”</p>
<p>“Understood!” After a quick nod, Sakuya disappeared into the storm as quickly as she had arrived. That was Thunderclap, an ability afforded by her Holy Sword that enabled the girl to accelerate through electromagnetism.</p>
<p>“I’m counting on you, Sakuya,” Regina muttered as she held up her Drag Howl.</p>
<p>A dozen or so of the large Voids began to dive down toward the academy.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Two large specimens are approaching sector two! I repeat, two large specimens approaching—”</p>
<p>Standing amid the downpour in the museum’s plaza, Elfiné busily transmitted information to assist in the citizens’ evacuation and relay Void positions to the Holy Swordsmen fighting.</p>
<p>The Voids summoned by the red dragon were striking multiple points around the Sixth Assault Garden. There weren’t many of the creatures, but each individual specimen had power that placed it at A rank. Only a group of multiple Holy Swordsmen working in tandem could defeat it.</p>
<p>“…Deploying eight orbs at once really is too taxing…”</p>
<p>Elfiné pressed a hand against her temple, trying to suppress the thumping headache that was washing over her. The overwhelming flood of information weighed heavy on her mind. During combat training, she only used four orbs for probing, with two deployed for analysis and backup. Gathering information from all over the city was far more strenuous.</p>
<p>However, since the Void’s jamming rendered the communication terminals useless, Elfiné’s analysis-type Holy Sword remained their only hope.</p>
<p>A rumbling explosion sounded somewhere distant, and flames began spreading in all directions.</p>
<p><em>Leo, Selia…</em></p>
<p>Elfiné was worried about them. She’d lost the two after the ice block had shattered. While she could search for them with one of her orbs, her talents were needed elsewhere.</p>
<p><em>Clauvia’s gone, too…</em></p>
<p>At some point, Elfiné’s sister had vanished as well.</p>
<p><em>What is she thinking?</em></p>
<p>When they were younger, Elfiné had always thought of Clauvia as a bit of an eccentric girl, but she was still brilliant, and she loved her little sister dearly. Somewhere along the way, she’d become like a stranger to Elfiné.</p>
<p><em>Not even she had expected that dragon monster to break out.</em></p>
<p>Clauvia had wanted Elfiné to analyze it. But why come personally to her instead of the Phillet Company’s research team…?</p>
<p><em>She called it a Dark Lord. What did that mean…?</em></p>
