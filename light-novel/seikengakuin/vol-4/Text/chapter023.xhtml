<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Riselia tried to evade it, but the object disappeared into her chest.</p>
<p>“May you prove to be a worthy vessel for the goddess.”</p>
<p>“Wait…!” Riselia demanded, trying to grab Nefakess, but he slipped into a crack and disappeared.</p>
<p>“Miss Selia, who was that man?” Sakuya asked her.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. He was, like, a Void in human form. But that can’t be…” Riselia shook her head.</p>
<p>“No. I’ve seen something like this before,” Sakuya admitted.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“The Void Lord who destroyed the Sakura Orchid looked like a person.”</p>

<p class="space-break"><em>It really can produce an unlimited number of demons.</em></p>
<p>Shary sprinted through a rainy alley. While countless spider demons pursued her through the shadows, she lashed out at them with whips. But each time she destroyed a spider, an intense explosion knocked her back.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Beaten down by repeated self-destruct blasts, fatigue began playing over Shary’s features. Her maid uniform was drenched with rain, and her left hand, which had been gripping the Refisca, had been rendered almost wholly useless.</p>
<p>The injuries Shary had suffered earlier were more severe than she’d realized. She’d avoided fatal damage by cloaking herself in shadows, but…</p>
<p><em>Perhaps I’ve…grown weaker…</em>, the maid thought in self-deprecation. <em>My lord, you brought color to my world, and in exchange…</em></p>
<p>Looking around, Shary realized she was surrounded by darkness. The shadow corridors had been ruined. There was no escape. If the spiders continued to detonate, she wouldn’t last long. Shary got to her feet, holding the Refisca between her teeth.</p>
<p><em>I have to at least defeat the Shade Fiend, even if it means going down with him.</em></p>
<p>But just then, something dropped down to the puddle at her feet…a ring. It was the one Leonis had given her as a reward. She’d held on to it ever since. Shary hurriedly picked it up. The trinket possessed magic capable of summoning a powerful monster.</p>
<p><em>…If I call a creature on par with a Shadow Demon, it should at least stall Raspilius.</em></p>
<p>Seeing Shary bending over as an opening, the spider demons lunged at her.</p>
<p><em>My lord!</em></p>

<p class="space-break">“Let’s finish this, Veira!”</p>
<p>Leonis charged with Zolgstar Mezekis, the Evil-Rending Sword, in his hand. Blackas’s dark flames burned around his body.</p>
<p>“Graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>The Dragon Lord breathed destructive white heat at Leonis.</p>
<p>Leonis planted his feet on the ground and leaped up with a shout. The black flames at his legs billowed, leaving a small crater in his wake. Veira’s fire swept across the ground, blowing dirt and forming burning columns. Yet Leonis was already above the dragon, swinging down the Evil-Rending Sword as he chanted a spell.</p>
<p>“Al Gu Belzelga!”</p>
<p>Zolgstar Mezekis turned red with heat from Mage Blade, a Demon Sword technique that allowed one to channel sorcery through their weapon. Of course, there weren’t many objects in existence that could withstand the might of an eighth-order spell. Anything but the Arc Seven would’ve likely shattered to pieces from the mere attempt.</p>
<p>The countless Void hands spurting out of the Dragon Lord’s body grasped after Leonis.</p>
<p>“Too slow!” Leonis tumbled in midair, somersaulting as he slashed through the arms. This manner of attack wasn’t part of the Hero Leonis’s sword skills that were sealed with Dáinsleif. Wielding a weapon with sheer magical power was the style of a Dark Lord. No, even that wasn’t a proper description. There was no form or grace to Leonis’s movements.</p>
<p><em>Swinging a sword with the abandon of a child is exhilarating!</em></p>
<p>There was a ferocious smile on Leonis’s lips.</p>
<p><em>Voooosh!</em></p>
<p>He cut down the Void arms and then aimed at Veira, thrusting the Evil-Rending Sword into the dragon’s neck! The power of a Holy Sword forged for slaying Dark Lords pierced through the creature’s hide.</p>
<p><em>I’d expect nothing less from one of the Arc Seven. Truly it is a weapon forged for slaying my comrades and me!</em></p>
<p>With the Black Tyrant’s flames coursing around him, Leonis forced the edge of Zolgstar Mezekis farther into Veira’s nape. The corrupted dragon howled, spreading her wings in an attempt to escape. Hoping to shake Leonis off, she bashed herself against the barrier’s walls. As she climbed up toward the sky, Veira rammed herself again and again into the glowing surfaces that trapped her and her fellow Dark Lord.</p>
<p>The goddess’s barrier couldn’t possibly be destroyed, but each time Veira collided with it, the walls flickered.</p>
<p><em>I can’t believe her sheer strength!</em></p>
<p>Leonis desperately clutched onto Zolgstar Mezekis, its blade still buried in Veira’s flesh.</p>
<p>“Rah Vaias!”</p>
<p>A sixth-order spell passed through the weapon, entering directly into the dragon’s body! More scales peeled off the massive creature, and a black miasma issued from her wounds.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Drawing out his blade, Leonis began to fall. But as he did, he slashed through the base of one of Veira’s wings.</p>
<p>“Grohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” Veira howled madly, diving downward to pursue Leonis as he plummeted. Faced with the sight of the dragon’s open maw, Leonis chanted a spell from the Realm of Death.</p>
<p>“Heed my voice, for I am the king of the undead who transcends death! Rise forth and gather at my side, ye soldiers!”</p>
<p>The moment Leonis landed, a gigantic skeletal dragon appeared, biting down on Veira’s throat! Using the remnants of gigantic sea creatures lying at the bottom of the ocean, Leonis had haphazardly pieced together a makeshift bone dragon. That was one reason he’d selected the seabed as their battlefield.</p>
<p>“This isn’t over yet. Let’s go!” Leonis shouted with a smirk as he pieced together one skeletal monster after another.</p>
<p>However, Veira crushed his creations with swings of her mighty tail.</p>
<p><em>Whooooosh…!</em></p>
<p>While shielding himself with bone, Leonis put some distance between himself and Veira.</p>
<p><em>They couldn’t even stall her…</em></p>
<p>Curiously, Leonis’s opponent didn’t give chase. The dragon began to swell again, and her remaining scales came off as more miasma began to spout from her body. With her neck at an unnatural angle, Void wings and arms bubbled out of her flesh. It was a sickening sight, as if the creature were continually repeating cycles of evolution and regression.</p>
<p>“This needs to end swiftly,” Leonis muttered, gritting his teeth in frustration. “I can’t bear to see this happen to you!”</p>
<p>Giving such a shameful display was an insult to proud Veira, the Dragon Lord!</p>
<p>“Arzam!” Endowing Zolgstar Mezekis with the strength of his most potent offensive spell, Leonis charged toward the Dragon Lord.</p>
<p>“Gyrahhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>Leonis thrust the blade into the dragon’s heart, piercing it through, but he continued shoving the weapon deeper.</p>
<p>“Burst—Arzam!”</p>
<p><em>Boom!</em></p>
<p>Veira’s body ballooned, turning red like lava.</p>
<p>“Arzam!”</p>
<p>Again Leonis loosed another tenth-order spell into the dragon, hoping that it would somehow burn away the corruption within Veira.</p>
<p>Zolgstar Mezekis shattered to pieces within the great beast’s body, and crimson flames came gushing out, turning to smoldering magma that spewed out of Veira.</p>
<p><em>Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!</em></p>
<p>With a thundering noise, Veira, the Dragon Lord, fell to pieces.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Gripping Zolgstar Mezekis while funneling so much power through it had left Leonis’s hands burned. He looked down at Veira’s remains.</p>
<p>“That was a fair duel. Surely you won’t hold a grudge.”</p>
<p>Had the Dragon Lord been at full strength, Leonis likely wouldn’t have been able to kill her. Then again, he wasn’t in his original form, either. Sparing no time for sentimentality, Leonis drew the Staff of Sealed Sins from his shadow.</p>
<p>“Create Elder Undead.”</p>
<p>He sprinkled blood over Veira’s remains and chanted a spell from the Realm of Death. It was the same magic he’d used to resurrect Riselia as a Vampire Queen.</p>
<p><em>I hope you at least become an Elder Dracolich.</em></p>
<p>At worst, she would return as a mindless dragon zombie.</p>
<p><em>But if you do, I won’t make you my minion. I’ll grant you the peace of a proud death.</em></p>
<p>The spell circle gave off an ominous glow, and the spell took effect. However, something odd occurred. Leonis was suddenly surrounded by light, and he disappeared.</p>

<p class="space-break"><em>Huh?</em></p>
<p>Shary’s eyes opened slowly. What she saw defied her wildest imagination. The spider demons that lunged at her lay dead, pierced by blades of ice.</p>
<p>“Wh-what is this…?”</p>
<p>As her eyes adjusted, she made out a figure.</p>
<p>“My…lord…?”</p>
<p>Leonis stood with his back to her, the Staff of Sealed Sins in his hands.</p>
<p>“…My lord, what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“That’s what I want to know.…,” Leonis answered, looking perplexed. Upon seeing the ring he’d given the assassin maid, he nodded in realization. “You used the ring.”</p>
<p>“The ring…?”</p>
<p>“I told you, didn’t I? That item allows its owner to summon the greatest, most powerful thing in the Dark Lords’ Armies.” Leonis averted his gaze sheepishly. “In other words, me.”</p>
<p>“…Oh.”</p>
<p>“Tch. What is that supposed to mean?” Leonis asked indignantly.</p>
<p>Shary remained seated on the ground. “Heh… Heh-heh-heh… Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh…” She started chuckling softly, unable to hold back the laughter.</p>
<p>“…Is something amusing about this?”</p>
<p>“You’re funny sometimes, my lord.”</p>
<p>“…Something about your tone rubs me the wrong way, but very well.” Leonis shrugged. “So who are you fools supposed to be…?”</p>
<p>He finally turned his gaze in the direction of the Shade Fiends surrounding him and Shary. The creatures froze, sensing his overwhelming aura of death.</p>
<p><em>Hmm. More demon assassins.</em></p>
<p>“I am a merciful Dark Lord,” he told the swirling spiral demon in command of the others. “But since you had the gall to lay a hand on my personal maid, I am given no recourse but to sentence you to a gruesome death.”</p>
<p>“What nonsense are you spouti—?” the spiral demon began.</p>
<p>“Eighth-order spell—Nel Gira,” Leonis chanted. A black sphere appeared in midair. It consumed the demons, sending them into oblivion. In no time at all, Shary and Leonis were alone.</p>
<p>Turning to face Shary, Leonis said, “—Come, Shary. Let us return home.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes, my lord!”</p>
<p>The leaden gray clouds finally cleared away, and rays of sunshine shone down on the city.</p>
