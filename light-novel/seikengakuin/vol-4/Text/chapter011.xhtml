<p>“I’d prefer to tour the Sixth Assault Garden over the festival, actually,” admitted Leonis.</p>
<p>“Makes sense. It’s not often we get to link up with other cities,” Regina replied in agreement.</p>
<p>“The Sixth Assault Garden has a famous museum, too,” Riselia appended.</p>
<p>“A museum?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s got relics collected from ruins around the world on display. One of the empire’s leading research institutes is stationed near it, and they display the results of their efforts to the public there.”</p>
<p><em>Oh…</em></p>
<p>That sounded like helpful information. The place could provide Leonis with useful information about the state of the world.</p>
<p>“Still, I’m a bit anxious about letting you go alone…,” Riselia said, placing a finger on her chin. “I’d rather show you around…”</p>
<p>Her doting streak was already reemerging.</p>
<p>“Ah, we’ll probably be pretty busy in the morning,” Regina pointed out. “But once the public matches begin, business in the café should slow down.”</p>
<p>“Really? Then I’ll escort you on your museum trip, Leo,” Riselia concluded.</p>
<p>“I really can go alone…,” the Undead King weakly asserted.</p>
<p>“Nooooope. What if some stranger kidnaps you?” Riselia scolded, poking him gently on the forehead with her index finger.</p>

<p class="space-break">In the dead of night, a petite girl trekked through the extensive woods behind the Hræsvelgr dorm, insects chirping all around her. This forest was once used as an arena for combat practice, but when the training field capable of altering its terrain was completed, it mostly became a place where students could relax.</p>
<p>At least, that’s what it was used for in the day. As well maintained as the trees and shrubs were, most didn’t venture into the woods after dark.</p>
<p>The girl sprinted along without anything to light her way, treading upon earth damp with evening dew. Scant rays of moonlight cast her Sakura Orchid attire in a pale glow.</p>
<p>Upon reaching a clearing in the forest, Sakuya stopped.</p>
<p>&lt;You have…cut down the Voids…Your Highness.&gt;</p>
<p>“Yes. How many of them were there…? I can’t remember. I was quite absorbed in it…”</p>
<p>She’d slain countless Voids on the Third Assault Garden. In fact, she’d likely broken her previous record, though that held little meaning to Sakuya.</p>
<p>&lt;Your skill with a sword is impressive. Given time, you may even overcome Setsura.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;…But this isn’t enough to slay our sworn enemies…&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;…You must cut down…the Voids…&gt;</p>
<p>The voices bellowed around her eerily, like the chanting of a curse.</p>
<p>“Yes. I know,” Sakuya replied quietly.</p>
<p>On moonlit nights, the vengeful spirits etched into Sakuya’s flesh grew restless. The malevolent ghosts of her people had called to Sakuya in her mind since the day her homeland had fallen to ruin.</p>
<p>A cold sweat surfaced on the young woman’s forehead. She focused on a spot between her eyes, whetting her consciousness until the voices petered out.</p>
<p><em>Yes… I will take revenge on that Void.</em></p>
<p>Shardark Void Lord, a Void in the form of a one-eyed swordsman, had taken Sakuya’s sister’s life.</p>
<p>Even now, her countless comrades from the Sakura Orchid fought as she did. They all dreamed of the day a Holy Sword harboring the will of their home would claim that Void Lord’s head.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there came sneering from the dark.</p>
<p>“Geh-eh-eh… You give off a demonic scent, lass…”</p>
<p>“Who’s there?!” Sakuya demanded, scanning her surroundings.</p>
<p>“You are not the vampire we seek, but you’re quite the interesting find in your own right…,” the new voices continued.</p>
<p>“Some manner of phantom?” Sakuya muttered to herself, a sharp glow in her gaze. She looked up with a start, where she saw a set of gleaming red compound eyes peering down at her. They belonged to a writhing, cackling, gigantic spider monster.</p>

</div>
<p class="space-break">“Mmm… Haa… Mha… <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Feeling the nibbling on his earlobe, Leonis grimaced as sweet pain shot through his body.</p>
<p><em>I can’t sleep like this!</em></p>
<p>Opening his eyes and turning over in his bed, he found himself faced with Riselia, who was fast asleep and appeared very satisfied. While awake, she’d act modest and reserved, only drinking from him when given permission. When she was unconscious, however, the vampiric impulses her mind kept at bay surfaced.</p>
<p><em>Not that I particularly mind letting her suck my blood</em>, Leonis thought with a sigh. He was responsible for her being a vampire, after all. Supplying his minion with what she needed to survive was his duty as her master. The only trouble was: It hurt.</p>
<p>When Riselia partook of his blood while awake, she nibbled gently. The same could not be said for when she was slumbering. Leonis sat up gently, making sure not to wake the girls. As Riselia pecked at the air, biting down on nothing at all, he stuck out his index finger in front of her lips.</p>
<p>“Mm… Schlrp… Nha…”</p>
<p>Riselia ran her tongue over his digit for a moment and then bit down on it. Having her gnaw on his finger hurt as well, but it was preferable to his earlobe aching.</p>
<p>“Mm… Rio… Schlrp… Mhaaa…”</p>
<p>The sight of his minion wholeheartedly sucking on his finger was a bit heartwarming.</p>
<p><em>Have your fill of this Dark Lord’s mana…</em>, Leonis mused.</p>
<p>“…Mm! <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a new pain rushed through his other arm, which he’d been propping himself up with.</p>
<p>“…Miss Regina?!” gasped Leonis, nearly raising his voice.</p>
<p>“Mm, tasty, mm, mha…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The blond-haired girl chomped down on his free arm. Evidently, she just had a random tendency to bite in her sleep.</p>
<p>“I’m not a piece of ham, you know,” Leonis whispered with a hint of annoyance, shoving a pillow into her mouth.</p>
<p>“Mm, nnm…” Regina started nibbling on it instead.</p>
<p><em>Tomorrow I’ll be sleeping on the sofa</em>, he decided.</p>
<p><em>Ting!</em></p>
<p>Leonis heard the faint sound of clashing swords from beyond the window.</p>
<p><em>What was that?</em></p>
<p>Leonis got to his feet quietly and approached the pane. Through it, he saw what looked like a flash of lightning through the broadleaf trees.</p>

<p class="space-break">Sakuya raised her voice in a battle cry as she swung her sword. “Lightning Fire Slash!”</p>
<p>A blade crackling with electricity cleaved through the darkness. It was an earnest, lethal cut, wholly unlike the way Sakuya wielded her weapon during practice matches. Yet, it surprisingly failed to strike true.</p>
<p><em>It avoided Raikirimaru’s first slash?!</em></p>
<p>Swiftly fixing her posture, Sakuya leaned against one of the trees as she hurriedly searched for her opponent.</p>
<p><em>Is this a Void?</em> she wondered, but the young woman quickly dismissed that notion. It wasn’t likely the administrative bureau would allow a Void to slip this deep into the academy’s premises. If that was the case, then what was this creature?</p>
<p>“…Quite skilled, aren’t you? Geh-eh-eh…” Its cackling echoed through the forest.</p>
<p>“So you speak human words, monster…,” Sakuya muttered to herself.</p>
<p>The next moment, the trees lined next to her were all silently cut down at once. Kicking off the ground, she charged forward. Writhing, whiplike appendages slashed through the brush in pursuit.</p>
<p><em>Thunderclap!</em></p>
<p>Sakuya jumped into the trees with her body enveloped in lightning. Her Holy Sword, Raikirimaru, was best suited to these sorts of cluttered, uneven terrains.</p>
<p><em>Never underestimate a Sakura Orchid swordswoman!</em></p>
<p>Pushing against a tree trunk, Sakuya swiftly changed direction and cut down one of the creature’s limbs. The appendage fell limply to the ground and soundlessly melted into the shadows cast on the forest floor by the moonlight.</p>
<p><em>It didn’t feel like I actually touched anything. Does this beast have no physical form?</em></p>
<p>After landing, Sakuya sliced through another extremity that lanced toward her from the dark.</p>
<p>“Geh-eh-eh… This is a Holy Sword, yes? Quite the mysterious power. It’s impressive that it can cut through our shadows.”</p>
<p>“Chattering in the heat of battle. You’re quite the confident one.”</p>
<p>Coating herself in lightning, Sakuya leaped forth. Using the direction of her opponent’s attacks as a reference, she discerned its location.</p>
<p>“Ultimate Blade Technique—Thundering Lightning Slash!”</p>
<p>This was a lethal single-target sword technique enabled by the acceleration from Thunderclap. Multiple slashes intersected, converging on a single point in the darkness.</p>
<p><em>Got it!</em></p>
<p>Yet the moment Sakuya was confident she’d hit her opponent, she heard a voice from above.</p>
<p>“Impressive power. For a human.”</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>A set of crimson eyes were watching Sakuya from the treetops. If her target was above, then what had she attacked? The lump of darkness she had cut sloshed and coiled around Raikirimaru like elastic tar.</p>
<p>“…Kuh… Let go…!” Sakuya growled.</p>
<p>“Geh-eh-eh… Be consumed by…your own shadow.…!”</p>
<p>A human-shaped mass of ebon emerged, as if to swallow Sakuya up. Before it had the chance, however…</p>
<p>“Zol Meides!”</p>
<p><em>Booooooooooooooom!</em></p>
<p>Black flames suddenly burst to life out of thin air, annihilating the shadow.</p>
<p>“What?!” the monster cried in surprise.</p>
<p>Sakuya was sitting on the ground with a stupefied expression. A set of footsteps was growing louder behind her.</p>
<p>“Are you all right, Sakuya?”</p>
<p>“Kid…”</p>
<p>Leonis stepped into the moonlight, still wearing his pajamas.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break"><em>I knew it. That light was Sakuya’s lightning sword.</em></p>
<p>Leonis approached Sakuya slowly, extending a hand to her. He’d been led here by the flashes in the night.</p>
<p>“Can you stand?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Y-yeah…” The blue-haired girl nodded, rising to her feet.</p>
<p>Leonis was relieved to see that Sakuya didn’t have any injuries, save for a few scrapes and scratches.</p>
<p><em>I can’t use healing magic, after all.</em></p>
<p>“What are you doing here, boy?”</p>
<p>“I was having trouble sleeping. But that’s not important right now.” Leonis looked up to the treetops, where the creature was perched. “What is that?”</p>
<p>The thing sported glimmering red eyes and a swollen abdomen from which extended several squirming limbs.</p>
<p><em>You look down upon the strongest of Dark Lords so brazenly… You have some nerve.</em> Leonis tapped the bottom of the Staff of Sealed Sins against the ground.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. It attacked me all of a sudden…” Sakuya shook her head, fixing her grip on Raikirimaru.</p>
<p>“It’s not a Void?” Leonis questioned.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>“Was that…sorcery…?!” the monster inquired in disbelief. “Have the humans of this age not…lost the ability to wield it…?”</p>
<p><em>This thing knows about sorcery…?</em> Leonis furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>“No… Perhaps a vampire’s minion might be able to…,” the creature reasoned to itself aloud.</p>
<p>“Who are you calling a minion—? Wait.” Leonis went silent when he realized that the monster spoke of a vampire. Did it know about Riselia?</p>
<p>“Geh-eh-eh… It seems you know of her…” The shadowy thing laughed.</p>
<p>The next moment, its arms extended toward Leonis.</p>
<p>“Get behind me, kid!” Sakuya stepped in front of Leonis, slashing away the incoming attacks. The electrical discharges released by her Holy Sword flashed in the dark woods.</p>
<p>“This is a challenging opponent,” Sakuya admitted. “Can you cover for me?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Leonis stated, standing back-to-back with the girl, his staff in hand.</p>
<p>Sakuya often assumed this formation with Riselia when training.</p>
<p>“Impudent humans…!”</p>
<p>The monster blitzed through the air. Dropping downward, the shadow creature loosed a flurry of blows at Sakuya.</p>
<p>“Second-order spell—Lanche Vero!” Leonis chanted as he sprinted between the trees.</p>
<p>A torrent of black spears erupted from the tip of the Staff of Sealed Sins, intercepting the monster. Using the opening Leonis created for her, Sakuya jumped into the woods, disappearing.</p>
<p>Despite its large size, the shadow creature swiftly leaped to a treetop. As Leonis gave chase, mud splashed over his pajama bottoms. Riselia was going to scold him for that later.</p>
<p><em>Curse you…</em></p>
<p>Filling with anger, Leonis aimed a Gravity Bullet spell at the monster. It sped toward its target, ripping apart the trees in its way. However, the air around the monster was enveloped in a bright-white light, which destroyed Leonis’s spell.</p>
<p><em>That was sorcery. Is this a demon?</em></p>
<p>Demons were beings that differed slightly from most monsters. They took on many varied forms, and their powers were just as inconsistent. They all shared a few commonalities, though. Each was more powerful than a common monster and highly intelligent.</p>
<p><em>And this looks to be a fairly powerful one, at that.</em></p>
<p>Of course, to a Dark Lord like Leonis, demons weren’t even worthy of his attention. A fifth-order (or higher) spell could destroy it in one hit. Doing that would expose the extent of his power to Sakuya, though. What’s more, it could have come here through the shadow corridors, as Shary had reported.</p>
<p>Leonis needed to capture this creature, ensorcell it with a domination spell, and get it to talk.</p>
<p>The spider demon’s red eyes glinted ominously. “Geh-eh-eh… Shadow Bind Barrier!”</p>
<p>A shining, malevolent magic circle appeared over the area.</p>
<p><em>A barrier spell?!</em></p>
<p>Leonis jumped into the air. The ground directly beneath him was consumed by darkness, and the surrounding trees sunk into the gap.</p>
<p>“Shray Zast!” Leonis fired another flurry of spells.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the spider demon proved nimble, skittering about to evade his shots.</p>
<p>“Miss Sakuya!”</p>
<p>“Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!” Sakuya let out a battle cry, her blade flashing with electricity.</p>
<p>Moving through the woods at high speed, she closed in on their opponent from the flank. The creature hurriedly produced another appendage to stop her, but…</p>
<p>“Too slow!” Sakuya swung down her Holy Sword.</p>
<p>“Her movements…are quicker…?!” the spider demon exclaimed.</p>
<p>“My Raikirimaru is a sword of acceleration,” Sakuya stated coldly. “The more I swing it, the faster I become. Ultimate Blade Technique—Lightning Flash!”</p>
<p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>
<p>Sakuya’s blade bit into the spider demon’s abdomen. The monstrous thing let out a screech of agony that tore through the still silence of the night.</p>
<p><em>Striking a demon is an impressive feat.</em> From Leonis’s estimate, their opponent was fairly skilled. It seemed Sakuya held back during training quite a bit. Despite her best effort, the cut hadn’t been fatal, however.</p>
<p>“Gaaaaaaaaaah! How dare you hurt me, you lowly human!”</p>
<p>The spider demon tried to chant some kind of spell, but the magic immediately dispersed.</p>
<p>“…It can’t be!” the creature howled. “Incantation disruption?!”</p>
<p>That was Leonis’s doing. Incantation disruption was a highly advanced technique, but it was child’s play for a Dark Lord who had mastered all sorcery had to offer.</p>
<p>“Hyaaaaaah! Thundering Lightning Slash!”</p>
<p><em>Riiiiiiiiiiip!</em></p>
<p>Sakuya’s blade gouged into the spider demon’s abdomen. The creature fell to the ground and began sinking into the shadows.</p>
<p><em>No, we can’t let it get away…!</em></p>
<p>He still needed to get information out of it. Holding up his staff, he began chanting a spell…when the spider demon suddenly turned still. A silvery knife knit the demon’s shadow into place.</p>
<p>“…What?!”</p>
<p>And as the spiderlike creature froze in place…</p>
<p>“Haaaaaaaaaah!” Sakuya drove her Holy Sword into the glittering red compound eyes.</p>
<p>“Curse you… Curse you, curse youuuuuu!”</p>
<p>The demon’s tendril-like appendages coiled around Sakuya’s arms as it let out an agonized howl. Its abdomen swelled, turning red-hot like a furnace.</p>
<p><em>This is bad!</em></p>
<p>Understanding the spider demon’s intentions, Leonis chanted an eighth-order spell.</p>
<p>“Vorzaid!”</p>
<p>Darkness enveloped the demon’s massive form just as it was about to explode, completely destroying it. Silence settled over the woods at once. Sakuya lowered Raikirimaru’s blade.</p>
<p>“Miss Sakuya… Are you all right?” Leonis asked her.</p>
<p>“Y-yes…,” Sakuya muttered as her Holy Sword faded away into particles of light. “What was that monster…?”</p>
<p>Leonis regarded the young woman seriously. “Have you ever seen anything like it before?”</p>
<p>Sakuya shook her head. “For now, let’s report this to the administrative bureau. By the way, kid…” Her eyes narrowed in suspicion.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Why are you hiding your true power?”</p>
<p>“Wh-what do you mean?” Leonis stammered, feigning ignorance.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Sakuya didn’t pursue the inquiry any further. “No, forgive me. I’m sure you have your reasons,” she said with a shrug. Then she began walking back in the direction of the dorm.</p>

</div>
<p class="space-break">“It’s hard to see where we’re walking, kid, so be careful.”</p>
<p>“Okay…”</p>
<p>Leonis and Sakuya trekked through the dense woods, with Leonis walking a short distance behind Sakuya. As he looked up at the trees, he called out to Shary telepathically.</p>
<p><span class="font">“I am here, my lord…,”</span> she replied to him at once.</p>
<p>It was she who stitched the demon’s shadow in place earlier. She was guarding over Leonis while keeping herself out of sight.</p>
<p><span class="font">“My apologies. I didn’t imagine it might attempt to self-destruct…,”</span> Shary expressed with regret.</p>
<p><span class="font">“It’s fine. You’re not at fault for that. What did you make of that beast?”</span> Leonis asked his maid.</p>
<p><span class="font">“It was a demon, for sure. A high-ranking one.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font">“Do you have any idea what its objective was?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font">“All I have is a conjecture, but…”</span></p>
<p><span class="font">“Feel free to share,”</span> Leonis urged.</p>
<p><span class="font">“I believe this creature was of the same profession as myself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font">“A demon assassin…”</span></p>
<p>During his era, Leonis’s enemies hadn’t simply been heroes and warriors. Many factions had sent covert killers to take the life of the Undead King. Curiously, it didn’t seem like this spider demon had come for him. It was shocked at the sight of him using sorcery, making it seem unlikely that Leonis’s identity had been exposed.</p>
<p><em>It mentioned a vampire. Was it after Riselia?</em></p>
<p>If that was true, then Leonis couldn’t even begin to guess what the demon wanted with her. It was all too inexplicable…</p>
<p><span class="font">“My lord, I have more…,”</span> Shary added.</p>
<p><span class="font">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font">“I believe that demon was the one who interfered with the shadow corridor, but there is trace evidence that several other spots were attacked…”</span></p>
<p><span class="font">“…So more than one demon has infiltrated this city.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font">“So it seems, my lord…”</span></p>
<p><span class="font">“And what punishment would you say suits those who would intrude upon a Dark Lord’s kingdom without permission?”</span> Leonis inquired.</p>
<p><span class="font">“A swift death would do, in my humble opinion,”</span> Shary responded.</p>
<p><span class="font">“Hmm. Indeed…”</span></p>
<p>And since they made an attempt on his favored minion’s life, they must be punished all the more.</p>
<p><span class="font">“Shary, probe for the enemy’s identity,”</span> Leonis ordered.</p>
<p><span class="font">“By your will, my lord,”</span> Shary replied, and she disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>A sneer twisted Leonis’s face. <em>You will rue the day you thought you could claim that which belongs to a Dark Lord, you fools.</em></p>
