<p>“…Understood. I only need to put up with this until then.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, are you angry, Leo?”</p>
<p>“No,” Leonis replied sullenly, gripping the hem of his skirt.</p>
<p>The boy was clad in a classic maid’s uniform. He had a black wig with an Alice band on his head. His outfit was modeled after the ghost girl said to appear randomly in this dorm.</p>
<p>“You’re so cute, kid! I knew it would fit you like a glove!” Regina declared, having returned from taking orders at a few of the tables in their café.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was her way of getting back at him for flustering her earlier.</p>
<p><em>…I-I’ll remember this, woman!</em> Leonis gritted his teeth, a shameful blush on his cheeks.</p>
<p>“Look at that maid! She’s so adorable!” one female student in the café whispered.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I wish I could take her home!” appended another.</p>
<p><em>Inconceivable</em>, thought Leonis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at a different table…</p>
<p>“Are you ready to place your order?”</p>
<p>“Miss Sakuya, you’re so pretty…”</p>
<p>“Sakuya, you’re a cutie patootie.”</p>
<p>“…Grr, I am not! Hurry up and make your orders!”</p>
<p>Poor Sakuya was being toyed with by her classmates.</p>

<p class="space-break">Within the thick greenery of the artificial environment’s forest sat a dilapidated building. And in one of the basement rooms of that structure…</p>
<p>“This is the plan,” the dark elf girl Lena whispered. “We use an underground materials transportation route to infiltrate the Sixth Assault Garden’s research institute. After that, Zarik will lead another unit to stage a bombing riot to distract security. Using that opening, we’ll round up the laboratory staff and take them hostage. After that, we’ll make them reveal where they’re holding the Origin Spirit. Simple, right?”</p>
<p>“…Oh. Yeah, it is.”</p>
<p>“It’s bold, but that’s what makes it unexpected.”</p>
<p>The other members of the Demon Wolf Pack nodded, seemingly convinced by Lena’s plan.</p>
<p><em>Are they complete and utter fools?! This is suicidal!</em> Arle, who was also in attendance, cradled her head in exasperation.</p>
<p>Several swords and guns lay ready on one side of the room.</p>
<p>“I’d like to hear your opinion, rookie,” Lena asked Arle. “Don’t you have any thoughts on the operation?” The dark elf seemed to be fond of Arle, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>“I don’t…think things will go that simply.” Arle shook her head, carefully choosing her words.</p>
<p>Their plan was rash and would almost certainly get them all killed.</p>
<p>“Watch your words, girl!” a lion-headed beastman roared.</p>
<p>“Don’t.” Lena raised a hand, silencing the angered man. “The Dark Lord has ordered us to take the Origin Spirit.”</p>
<p>“Yes. His Greatness said it’s an idea that has merit,” a beastman chimed in.</p>
<p>“And that we are to make sure everything is perfectly prepared…,” added another.</p>
<p><em>The Dark Lord, huh?</em> Arle mouthed the words bitterly.</p>
<p>She still had her doubts, but apparently, the Zol Vadis who ruled over this organization had created an underground labyrinth using sorcery. What’s more, he’d supposedly destroyed some sort of dragon that had taken up residence in it.</p>
<p><em>And this Dark Lord approved such a rash plan?</em></p>
<p>“Can’t this Dark L— Can’t ‘His Greatness’ lend us his power for this task?” Arle inquired, finding a way to voice her doubts.</p>
<p>“His Greatness hasn’t been wholly restored yet,” Lena replied.</p>
<p>“That is why he sent us on this mission.” The werewolf, Zarik, shook his head.</p>
<p><em>That sounds like useful information.</em></p>
<p>Had one of the Eight Dark Lords resurrected at full power, they would quickly destroy this human city.</p>
<p><em>I must purge this menace before they can wreak havoc.</em></p>
<p>Still, it appeared these demi-humans were all devoted to the Dark Lord. Showing any ill will toward him in this place would put her that much further away from reaching him.</p>
<p>“I have one more question. Assuming we do successfully infiltrate this laboratory place, can we really steal the Origin Spirit?” Arle pressed. As an elf of the forest, the petite woman knew all too well the fury spirits could exhibit. Villages had been razed to the ground for provoking them.</p>
<p>“That should be fine. We can use the Phillet Company’s Artificial Elementals for that.”</p>
<p>“Artificial Elementals?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The witch who gave us the Demon Swords, Sharnak, left this last gift. If we use them to seize the Origin Spirit, it should fall under our control,” Lena detailed, a confident smile on her lips.</p>
<p>A serpent-shaped Artificial Elemental had taken control of the <em>Hyperion</em>’s core during the seajacking incident.</p>
<p>“We must act as one and be of aid to His Greatness!”</p>
<p>“We will bring the hammer down on the haughty Human Empire and their Holy Swords!”</p>
<p>The beastmen were raising their voices in bloodthirsty cheering, one after another.</p>
<p><em>…What is this Dark Lord trying to achieve by taking fools like them under his command?</em></p>
<p>It seemed that no matter what Arle might say, they were hell-bent on going through with this plundering operation.</p>
<p><em>I suppose I do owe them for saving my life. If I was to leave them to their fates, it would weigh on my conscience.</em></p>
<p>Her presence would hopefully ensure no one perished on this fool’s errand.</p>
<p><em>Ugh. What am I even doing here?</em> The elf hero sighed.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Leo, the table over there ordered a chamomile tea and an apple pie.”</p>
<p>“U-understood!”</p>
<p>Leonis moved busily between the tables in his maid uniform.</p>
<p><em>I swear, why does a Dark Lord have to do this?!</em></p>
<p>The curious idea of a haunted mansion café, coupled with pretty girls serving the customers in cute outfits, drew quite a few customers. Their exhibit was a roaring success. So much so that they didn’t have enough hands to go around during the busiest times, and Leonis had to deploy high-tier skeletons to staff the kitchen.</p>
<p>That said, the peak hour was already behind them.</p>
<p>“…E-excuse me. Is Leo here?” A bashful young girl’s voice mentioned Leonis by name.</p>
<p>Turning around, he saw a familiar orphan speaking with Elfiné. She was an adorable girl with her black hair cut to shoulder length—Tessera Lillibel.</p>
<p>“Oh. Are you a friend of Leo’s?” Elfiné smiled warmly at her.</p>
<p>“Y-yes…”</p>
<p>“Well, Leo’s over there.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?” Tessera turned to look at him, her eyes round with surprise.</p>
<p>“L-Leo…?”</p>
<p>“…N-no!” Leonis covered his face with the tray, pretending to be someone else.</p>
<p>“Wh-why are you a girl, Leo?”</p>
<p>She seemed confused.</p>
<p>“It’s…a long story…,” Leonis admitted, giving up.</p>
<p>“Ah, I… Erm, I understand,” Tessera, mature girl that she was, seemed to understand the general situation.</p>
<p><em>It’s a good thing she’s quick on the uptake.</em></p>
<p>“I, erm, I think you look very cute, Leo,” Tessera said sheepishly.</p>
<p>“R-really…,” Leonis replied vaguely, unable to take the compliment.</p>
<p>“Oh, Tessera, you’re here. Go on, take a seat.” Riselia returned from the kitchen and urged the girl to one of the available chairs.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Miss Riselia,” Tessera replied as she silently settled in a spot next to the window.</p>
<p>“Did you call her, Miss Selia?” Leonis asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I sent the older kids in the orphanage tickets for the Holy Sword Dance Festival.” Riselia had a part-time job at Tessera’s orphanage, and she went there a few times every week. Apparently, the children loved her more than the establishment’s manager.</p>
<p>“What about those twins, the tomboy girl and the bespectacled boy? They’re always with her, aren’t they?” Leonis asked.</p>
<p>“Millet and Linze are watching the Holy Sword Dance Festival. I, erm, I came here because I heard you were here, Leo…,” Tessera answered before settling into bashful silence.</p>
<p>Leonis furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>“The eighteenth platoon’s match is tomorrow, so come cheer for us,” Riselia stated.</p>
<p>“Y-yeah! I’ll be there!” Tessera nodded earnestly, clenching her little fists.</p>
<p>“—My. What an interesting concept for a café.”</p>
<p>A familiar voice sounded from the entrance. Fenris Edelritz entered, brushing back her platinum-blond hair.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here, Fenris?” Riselia questioned, glaring at her sullenly.</p>
<p>“What a greeting. I’m merely doing my share of the work for the executive committee. Making the rounds to make sure none of the platoons’ presentations are breaking any rules… W-wait. What is that indecent outfit you’re wearing?!”</p>
<p>Upon noticing Riselia’s costume, Fenris’s face turned red.</p>
<p>“Th-this isn’t indecent! It’s a vampire costume!”</p>
<p><em>No, it’s a succubus one</em>, Leonis thought.</p>
<p>And it did look quite indecent.</p>
<p>“I—I believe that getup might violate regulations…,” Fenris remarked, taking out a terminal to check the school protocol.</p>
<p>“H-hey—” Riselia raised her voice in protest, but someone cut her off.</p>
<p>“Being a stickler for the rules isn’t a trait you should be flaunting, Miss Fenris. Our role is, all in all, to ensure the citizens enjoy the Holy Light Festival,” said a large man who’d appeared beside Fenris.</p>
<p>“But, Sir Liat…!” protested Fenris.</p>
<p>“My apologies, could you let us rest here for a while, little lady?” the man requested, directing his words at Leonis.</p>

<p class="space-break">Liat Guinness, also known as Liat the Blazing Lion, was an upperclassman and the vice president of the executive committee, which upheld matters of public order and conduct at Excalibur Academy. The young man possessed a stern face, and his crimson hair was trimmed short. True to his moniker, he had a large build, like a lion’s. He carried himself with a dignity one wouldn’t expect from a seventeen-year-old.</p>
<p>Seeing this hulking young man occupy one of the café’s small chairs invoked a certain sense of dissonance.</p>
<p>“Liat is a seasoned warrior who leads Void extermination squads to the front lines. He might even be stronger than me,” Sakuya whispered into Leonis’s ear as she passed by him.</p>
<p>He’d been dispatched to a mission on the Sixth Assault Garden and had only just recently returned to the academy after a half-year absence.</p>
<p><em>Yes, he does give the aura of a mighty warrior.</em></p>
<p>Leonis had to admit that Liat cut an impressive figure. Naturally, he was only strong by human standards, but Leonis did think he was a match for the valiant warriors and knights he fought in the past. Regardless of their position, the Undead King held a positive impression of the strong. As he carried a tray with two teacups to Liat and Fenris’s table, he decided he’d treat them to some buttered toast on the house.</p>
<p>“Thank you, dear. It smells lovely,” Fenris said in return, elegantly lifting the cup off its saucer. Apparently, she hadn’t realized who the maid serving her was.</p>
<p>“I have to say, a haunted mansion is certainly a very unique, interesting idea,” Liat commented, taking in the decorations.</p>
<p>“…Still, I can’t very well condone that shameless costume,” Fenris added with a frown.</p>
<p>“W-well, hmm, that’s very, uh…,” Liat muttered with an awkward, dry cough.</p>
<p>It was then that Elfiné approached the table. “Hello, Liat. I haven’t seen you in a while. I hope you’re in good health,” she greeted with a friendly tone.</p>
<p>“Oh, Elfiné. I hear you’ve left the seventh platoon?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m part of the eighteenth now.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>On his way back to the kitchen, Leonis stopped in his tracks and listened in. Did the two of them know each other?</p>
<p>“I hear you were part of Clauvia’s expedition in the Sixth Assault Garden,” Elfiné stated.</p>
<p>“…As omniscient as ever, aren’t you?” Liat replied with a forced smile.</p>
<p>“Yes. I <em>am</em> a witch, after all,” Elfiné responded, holding down the brim of her hat with a thin smirk. Suddenly, her expression turned serious. “So what did my dear elder sister dig up in the tundra?”</p>
<p>Liat fell silent for a moment. “That’s confidential. But you know that.” He shook his head.</p>
<p><em>An excursion from the Sixth Assault Garden…</em></p>
<p>Leonis recalled Lena’s report; something about an expedition from the Sixth Assault Garden discovering an Origin Spirit.</p>
<p>“I figured. The imperial laboratory’s data on the matter had substantial protection placed on it,” Elfiné admitted.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, you two, what exactly are you talking about…?” Fenris demanded.</p>
<p>“Since they put Clauvia in charge of this, it isn’t just a ruin excavation,” Elfiné continued, wholly ignoring the inquiry.</p>
<p>“Honestly speaking, I don’t know much, either. I was only there to guard the supply convoy.” Liat shrugged and shook his head. “But I did hear that whatever they excavated was inside a gigantic ice block.”</p>
<p>“And they carried the whole thing, ice block and all, to the Sixth Assault Garden’s laboratory?” Elfiné pressed, cocking an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Honestly, I don’t have the first idea what it might be.”</p>
<p>“I see…” Elfiné bit her lips.</p>
<p>“Leo, can you handle table number three?” Riselia suddenly called out to Leonis.</p>
<p>“Ah yes!” he hurriedly replied.</p>
<p>“Wait… Did she just call that girl Leo?” Fenris glared at him huffily.</p>
<p><em>Blast!</em> Unfortunately, by the time the thought occurred to him, it was too late. Fenris was gazing fixedly at Leonis’s face.</p>
<p>“…On closer inspection, you’re that child!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Wh-whatever do you mean?!” Leonis stammered.</p>
<p>“You can’t fool Fenris Edelritz’s discerning eye!”</p>
<p><em>I’ve been fooling your discerning eye the whole time!</em> Leonis quipped to himself.</p>
<p>“Well, if he’s not a boy, there’s no problem with him being in a girls’ dorm, right?” Riselia said, standing between them as if to defend Leonis.</p>
<p>“Th-that’s just sophism!” Fenris retorted.</p>
<p>“But look at how cute he is! He’s a girl now, so it’s all good!” Riselia asserted.</p>
<p>“No, it isn’t!” Leonis snapped.</p>
<p><em>Oooooooooooooooh!</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, a loud uproar of applause from the distant training field put the argument to rest.</p>
<p>“I see everyone’s enjoying the Holy Sword Dance Festival,” Liat said with a smile.</p>
<p>Customers were starting to leave their tables.</p>
<p>“Kid.” Regina suddenly tapped on Leonis’s shoulder. “Rush hour’s just about over. You can slip out with Lady Selia.”</p>
<p>“Can you handle the place alone, Regina?” Riselia questioned.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” She nodded confidently. “I want you to enjoy the festivities, Lady Selia.”</p>
<p>“Thank you! Let’s get going, Leo!” Riselia exclaimed, taking Leonis by the hand.</p>
<p>“Ah, wait! I’m not finished with you yet!” Fenris shouted after her.</p>
