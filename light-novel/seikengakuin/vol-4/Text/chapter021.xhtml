<p class="space-break">“Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, obey your fated destruction—Arzam!”</p>
<p>Leonis’s Staff of Sealed Sins radiated an ominous glow. From above came a tenth-order spell that could not be matched in terms of single-target offensive power.</p>
<p><em>Booooooooooooooooooom!</em></p>
<p>An earsplitting detonation, strong enough to shake the world itself, sounded as a pillar of red flames burst out of the ground, snaking upward.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“…No damage whatsoever. I expected nothing less from you, Veira.” Leonis felt cold sweat drip down his forehead. A crimson dragon stood composedly before him. Against any other opponent, a tenth-order spell would have been a certain victory.</p>
<p>“Fighting a dragon with sorcery is a bad idea, after all.”</p>
<p>“Could we seal her in the Realm of Shadows?” Blackas asked.</p>
<p>Leonis considered the idea for a moment but ultimately shook his head. “That risks giving me another enemy to fight.”</p>
<p>Leonis’s third minion was sealed in the Realm of Shadows, and they were beyond his power to control at the moment.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to end this quickly. And I might have no choice but to turn it into a melee battle…”</p>
<p>Battles between Dark Lords could last days, even weeks. When Leonis had an undead body that knew no fatigue, he relished that challenge. However, now that he was a human child, he was subject to exhaustion. His mana was also only a third of what it had once been. Playing a slow game here would spell defeat.</p>
<p>“Graz Garud! Voira Zo! Al Gu Belzelga!”</p>
<p>Muttering incantations in quick succession, he waved his staff to increase the power of his sorcery and unleashed a flurry of tactical-level eighth-order spells.</p>
<p>“Grohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” the infernal dragon howled, raining bolts of destructive lightning within the barrier.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Blackas jumped away, acrobatically launching off the barrier’s walls to evade the thunderbolts.</p>
<p>“W-wait, Blackas, my present body can’t keep up!” Leonis cried out.</p>
<p>The ebon wolf didn’t stop, however. Leonis grabbed onto him for dear life with his free hand. He had a Rider’s Unity spell in place to ensure he’d stay mounted on his friend, so there was no chance of him falling off, but…</p>
<p>“We’ll close in on her this way, Lord Magnus!”</p>
<p>“Understood!”</p>
<p>Blackas dashed and jumped, racing vertically up the barrier. Veira raised her head and let fly a jet of deadly fire.</p>
<p>“Sharianos!”</p>
<p>Instead of using defensive magic, Leonis reflexively cast an offensive ice element spell.</p>
<p><em>Booooom!</em></p>
<p>Cold met hot, and there was an intense blast of steam, filling the area with heavy mist. Yet even in the reduced visibility, Blackas did not stop.</p>
<p>“She doesn’t seem to be calling any more Voids…,” the great wolf observed.</p>
<p>“You’re right. She probably instinctively understands that those small fries will be of no use against me,” Leonis boasted.</p>
<p>Of course, the dragon-class Voids were only weak to someone of Leonis’s power. The hideous creatures were a considerable threat to Excalibur Academy’s students. Although Leonis had left the Three Champions of Rognas at the Hræsvelgr dorm, they couldn’t protect the entirety of the Seventh Assault Garden alone.</p>
<p><em>I have to settle this quickly.</em></p>
<p>“Graaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>A destructive burst of flames surged against the barrier walls. This breath attack was capable of blowing away entire fortresses. Simple defensive spells couldn’t hope to deflect it. Blackas darted to avoid the scorching fire.</p>
<p>“Tsk. And I’d hoped that fighting close would be easier.” Just as Leonis muttered the words, Veira underwent a sudden change.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Sakuya?!” Riselia called out, still lying on the ground.</p>
<p>“Ultimate Blade Technique—Thundering Lightning Slash!” Sakuya unleashed a flurry of rapid swipes, her body surrounded by electricity.</p>
<p>Each stroke of her blade was so swift that Riselia couldn’t follow them, even with her vampire’s eyesight. Sakuya had likely cut down countless Voids on the way here. Raikirimaru’s power increased her speed and allowed her to accelerate further the more the weapon tasted the flesh of its enemies. By now, Sakuya was moving at her maximum speed.</p>
<p>This was Sakuya Sieglinde’s true, uninhibited might, a talent she’d never displayed during training matches.</p>
<p>However, something about her otherworldly sword prowess felt…curiously off to Riselia.</p>
<p><em>Sakuya?</em></p>
<p>Riselia ran mana through her eyes, and as she watched the clash between her friend and Nefakess, she saw what was bothering her. Sakuya’s right hand, the one clenching Raikirimaru, was enveloped in black vapor.</p>
<p><em>Is that the same miasma Voids give off? But that can’t be…</em></p>
<p>But then…</p>
<p>“By my…blade…thy contact…shall be null and void…!” Riselia heard a voice manage from behind her.</p>
<p>Arle Kirlesio approached, crawling along the ground.</p>
<p>“I shall shatter thy light… Phar Rias!”</p>
<p>At that moment, the luminous barrier torturing Riselia shattered.</p>
<p>“Spell breaking is…my…specialty…,” the elf girl uttered, gritting her teeth in pain all the while. “You can…still move, right…? That girl is strong…but she can’t win…on her own…”</p>
<p>As Arle lost her balance and collapsed, Riselia hurriedly went to catch her. A puddle of blood was forming at the elf’s feet, and it seemed she’d broken a few bones. Powerful fighter or not, she was in no condition to continue the battle.</p>
<p>Riselia was hardly in better condition. Her Vampire Queen abilities were already working to heal her, but it was consuming a lot of her mana.</p>
<p><em>If only I…had more…</em></p>
<p>Riselia tried to rise to her feet, her consciousness still muddled. That bishop may have looked human, but he was a monster of unfathomable strength. Sakuya couldn’t fight him off alone.</p>
<p>“…I’m sorry. I’ll only take a little.”</p>
<p>Riselia swallowed audibly before gingerly sinking her fangs into Arle’s neck.</p>

<p class="space-break"><em>Vrah.…Vrahhhhhhh!</em></p>
<p>Fetid miasma seeped from between Veira’s scales. Her massive form swelled with an ominous cracking sound. Plates were beginning to pop off of her as sharp, taloned arms sprouted from beneath. The Dragon Lord was taking on another, more despicable form.</p>
<p>“…Kh. Blackas, we have to bring her down before it’s too late!” Leonis growled. He wondered if it was already too late to save his fellow Dark Lord.</p>
<p><em>Should that be the case, then I will be the one to lay you to rest</em>, he promised.</p>
<p>Leonis landed on the ground, facing Veira directly as a black miasma billowed from its body.</p>
<p>“Original sorcery—Black Tyrant!”</p>
<p>Dark flames enveloped Blackas and Leonis. The Demon Sword Dáinsleif contained the soul of a sword-wielding hero within its blade. Whenever Leonis held the weapon, he became capable of using the techniques he’d learned from the Swordmaster Shardark.</p>
<p>But right now, Leonis’s blade abilities were sealed with the sword. He could handle a weapon to some extent, but he couldn’t hope to match Sakuya without Dáinsleif’s power.</p>
<p>That was why he’d used Black Tyrant. The armor spell allowed him to take Blackas Shadow Prince’s power into his body. This granted Leonis some melee combat prowess. It was magic that the Undead King had developed himself for when he fought enemies resistant to sorcery.</p>
<p>“Should I create a Shadow Blade?” Blackas asked his longtime friend.</p>
<p>“No. A weapon created with magic can’t hope to pierce her scales.”</p>
<p>Leonis returned his Staff of Sealed Sins to the shadows and took hold of something else.</p>
<p>“When facing Dark Lords, I use this.”</p>
<p><em>Ssssss…</em></p>
<p>A steel longsword with a decorated cross-shaped pommel slipped out of the thick ebon. This was Zolgstar Mezekis—a Dark Lord–slaying weapon. During the incident aboard the <em>Hyperion</em>, the witch Sharnak had turned it into a monster.</p>
<p>Leonis had crushed that Void Lord to bits but gathered its fragments and had successfully reforged Zolgstar Mezekis with the aid of his magic. The original blade was lost, of course, but Leonis was a first-class magical craftsman. This sword was more than capable of penetrating the Dragon Lord’s scales.</p>
<p>“Veira, I’ve always regretted…not fighting by your side to the very end,” admitted Leonis as he took up his mighty blade.</p>
<p>As the Undead King, he’d wished to die honorably in battle, fighting the Six Heroes. Yet Roselia had given him another task, and he’d lived on, awakening in this new age.</p>
<p>“Feel my blade’s wrath—Veira, the Dragon Lord!”</p>

<p class="space-break">“Farga!”</p>
<p>A torrent of flames rocketed through the air, sending Sakuya flying.</p>
<p>“Khn… Hyahhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>Yet rather than crash, she somehow managed to land on her feet and slash at her foe with Raikirimaru again. Nefakess gave a consternated look but managed to dodge.</p>
<p>“Oh. How strange. A human withstanding a third-order spell with naught for protection but their own flesh and blood. Or perhaps…there’s more?”</p>
<p>“I’ve no reason to explain myself to you,” Sakuya said, thrusting her sword at the man. Raikirimaru skimmed against Nefakess’s throat.</p>
<p>“Dance forth, flames of scorching heat—Phranis!” This time, he cast a spell at point-blank range. Fire erupted from the tip of his staff, washing over Sakuya.</p>
<p>“That won’t work,” Sakuya declared, cleaving a path through the fire and taking a confident step forward.</p>
<p>“What…?!” Nefakess whispered in disbelief, his eyes wide.</p>
<p>A blue light settled over Raikirimaru’s blade. “Demon Sword—Yamichidori,” Sakuya stated in a soft tone. “It’s the first time I’ve wielded it against a human opponent.”</p>
<p>“Oh, this… Why, this is fascinating,” Nefakess remarked, cracking an indomitable smile. “I see. You’re not so much human as you are turning into a V—”</p>
<p>“Silence! Close your foolish mouth!”</p>
<p>There was a flash of azure as Raikirimaru swept forward. Sakuya then pulled the sword close to her and thrust with lightning-fast speed. The blade plunged in, ready to gouge its enemy’s heart out, yet it caught nothing but empty air. Nefakess had vanished into a floating crack.</p>
<p>“…What?!”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to be surprised about,” Nefakess sneered from somewhere. “I’m closer to the nothingness than you are. That’s all there is to it…”</p>
<p>Sakuya reflexively hopped away, but—</p>
<p>“Dance, ye gelid blades of frost—Shariagira!”</p>
<p>“…Aaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>Frigid knives sped through the air, cutting into Sakuya’s body.</p>
<p>“We’re not finished. Shariagira—” Nefakess stepped out on one of the cracks in the air, chanting another spell.</p>
<p>“Nefakess!”</p>
<p><em>Zwoom!</em></p>
<p>Blood, sharpened to an edge, swung like a whip, biting into the man’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaaaaah!” Turning around, Nefakess found Riselia, bringing her Bloody Sword down at him.</p>
<p><em>Slash!</em></p>
<p>The silvery blade severed the man’s right arm, the one that had been holding his staff.</p>
<p>“…Wh…at?!”</p>
<p>Converting all the blood in her body into mana, Riselia stepped forward. Her argent hair shone luminously, and the True Ancestor’s Dress she was now wearing let out a crimson glow.</p>
<p>Nefakess jumped back. His fair features were stained with panic. “…I’ll admit I’m surprised. I didn’t think you’d break free of my Holy Light Barrier.”</p>
<p>Riselia offered no answer, only glaring. <em>I have to focus all my mana into this slash…!</em></p>
<p>That’s when the young woman noticed something strange. Even though she’d completely severed Nefakess’s arm, he wasn’t bleeding. Instead, a black mist was rising from the wound.</p>
<p><em>That’s Void miasma! But how?!</em></p>
<p>“Celestia! Celestia! Celestia!”</p>
<p>Bolts of purifying light leaped from Nefakess’s hand. The spells were capable of reducing most undead to dust. As they struck Riselia, a pain intense enough to sear her heart to ashes coursed through her chest. Still, the girl pushed forward. So long as she wore the True Ancestor’s Dress, holy magic could not strike her down.</p>
<p>“Holy Light Barri—” Nefakess prepared to chant another barrier spell.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget about me!”</p>
<p>A flash of lightning streaked past Riselia.</p>
<p>“Ultimate Blade Technique—Lightning Flash!”</p>
<p>Raikirimaru tore into Nefakess’s right shoulder before he could complete his magic. Not even a second later, Riselia’s Blood Sword stabbed at the man’s chest. Then countless blades of blood formed and trained on Nefakess, enclosing him in a crimson cage.</p>
<p>Riselia held up the Bloody Sword and chanted, “As queen of the undead, I order you! Dance, frolic with madness—Blood Storm!”</p>
<p>The red knives swirled and slashed, yet Nefakess did not seem frightened.</p>
<p>“Keh… Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!”</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>“I see! So I’ve underestimated humankind’s power!”</p>
<p><em>Crack, crack, crack…!</em></p>
<p>Fissures began appearing at the base of his severed arm. The fracture glared at Riselia like some gigantic eye. It was so unnatural that the young woman shuddered and froze in place for a second.</p>
<p>“I shall retreat here, out of respect for humanity. However…” Nefakess paused to level a captivated, almost clinging sort of glare at Riselia. “Beauteous queen. Allow me to grant you this humble offering.” A triangular stone flew from the man’s hand.</p>
