<p class="space-break">Come nightfall, Leonis was revising his notes for the next day’s lectures.</p>
<p>“Leo, are you still up?”</p>
<p>“Hard worker, aren’t you, kid?”</p>
<p>Riselia entered his room, clad in pajamas and cradling a pillow for whatever reason. She must have just taken a shower, because faint steam rose from her damp locks. Regina was standing behind her, dressed similarly and carrying a pillow of her own.</p>
<p>“Hello, Miss Selia,” Leonis said, closing his book with a hint of suspicion. “Are the outfits going to be ready on time?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, they should be done tomorrow at this rate.” Riselia nodded.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh. You’ll have to wait for the day of the event for the grand unveiling,” Regina added teasingly.</p>
<p>“I-I’m not that curious about them,” Leonis replied, averting his gaze. “By the way, why do you have those pillows?”</p>
<p>It had been on his mind since the girls had come in.</p>
<p>“Oh, this? It’s a feather pillow,” Riselia replied. “It’s really fluffy and comfortable to sleep on.”</p>
<p>She beat the object a couple of times, as if to illustrate.</p>
<p>“My pillow has buckwheat chaff,” Regina appended.</p>
<p>“No, I mean, why did you bring them here?” Leonis corrected the question.</p>
<p>The two girls gazed at each other, puzzled.</p>
<p>“Well, we figured we could sleep in your room tonight, Leo,” Riselia stated bluntly.</p>
<p>“…?!” Leonis went wide-eyed. “Wh-what do you mean?!”</p>
<p>“The rooms downstairs are all full of stage settings for the Holy Light Festival,” Regina answered with a shrug.</p>
<p>During the celebration, the Hræsvelgr dorm’s ground floor was contracted yearly to serve as a storehouse for various clubs’ equipment. It was a condition for the eighteenth platoon living here, so they weren’t in any position to protest.</p>
<p>“So during the Holy Light Festival, Sakuya always stays with Miss Finé, and I used to sleep in Lady Selia’s room,” explained Regina.</p>
<p>“But my place is full of tools for decorating the café. It’s so packed I don’t have anywhere to sleep, so that just leaves your room, Leo,” Riselia said, bringing her hands together apologetically.</p>
<p>“I…see…”</p>
<p>Leonis couldn’t refuse when she worded it like that. After all, he was staying at what had initially been Riselia’s study.</p>
<p>“We’re having a pajama party tonight, Lady Selia,” Regina declared cheerfully.</p>
<p>“Yep, we used to sleep in the same bed a lot back at the Crystalia Estate.” Riselia nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh. You were always a scaredy-cat back then.”</p>
<p>“I—I wasn’t scared…”</p>
<p>The young lady and her maid chatted cheerfully, hugging their pillows.</p>
<p>“W-wait! I don’t mind you two sleeping in my room, but…” Leonis cleared his throat. “I think I’ll spend the night on the living room sofa.”</p>
<p>Back when he was undead, Leonis rested in a stone coffin. Compared to that, even a couch was an improvement. In fact, Leonis was confident he could even sleep comfortably inside a musical instrument case.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“No.” Riselia shook her head. “You can’t do that, Leo. You’ll catch a cold.”</p>
<p>“A cold? I won’t…,” Leonis began to object but stopped.</p>
<p>He couldn’t confidently claim he wouldn’t get sick. He’d gone to sleep without drying his hair not too long ago and woke up coughing. Riselia had to nurse him back to health. That occasion made it painfully clear just how frail his human body really was.</p>
<p>“If anyone has to lay on the sofa, it’ll be me,” Riselia told him firmly.</p>
<p>“…Fine. I’ll sleep in my bed,” Leonis surrendered.</p>
<p>Riselia had a way of being very stubborn when she got protective. There was no reasoning with her.</p>
<p>“Your hair’s pretty frizzy, isn’t it, kid?” Regina remarked, grabbing Leonis like she had her pillow.</p>
<p>“M-Miss Regina?!”</p>
<p>Her pigtailed hair brushed against his cheeks, and the scent of her soap filled his nose. Through the fabric of her pajamas, he could feel her breasts pressing against him without a bra to contain them.</p>
<p>“You can’t hog Leo like that, Regina,” Riselia loudly protested, pouting while sitting at the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>“All right, all right,” Regina responded with a sarcastic smile, releasing Leonis’s body and moving over to the opposite end of the bed where Riselia was perched.</p>
<p>Leonis was left with no option but to sandwich himself between the two girls.</p>
<p>“M-Miss Selia, don’t cling to me like that…” Leonis’s cheeks were flushing red, but Riselia didn’t seem to notice.</p>
<p>“By the way, Leo, is there anywhere you’d like to go?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Somewhere I’d like to go…?” parroted Leonis, not entirely understanding what she meant.</p>
<p>“It’s not like we have the Holy Light Festival every day, so you should enjoy it, too, kid,” Riselia explained, gently tapping a finger on his head.</p>
<p>“Oh, right…”</p>
<p>Going around and enjoying the festivities didn’t sound like a bad idea, but Leonis’s true interests resided with the Sixth Assault Garden, which the Seventh was set to couple with at the climax of the celebration. The other floating city would fall under the Dark Lords’ Armies’ control eventually, so scouting it out early was ideal. There was also the matter of the Origin Spirit the Demon Wolf Pack had mentioned.</p>
