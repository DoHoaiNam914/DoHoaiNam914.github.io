<p class="noindent">“The warrior Amilas, the grappler Dorug, and the archmage Nefisgal. The proud Three Champions of Rognas. In honor of your distinguished service during this recent campaign, I bestow a Devil Bone Medal upon you three.”</p>
<p>“A-a Devil Bone Medal?!”</p>
<p>“How awe-inspiring…!”</p>
<p>“Is that not one of the greatest honors one in the Dark Lords’ Armies can receive?!”</p>
<p>The three skeletal knights clattered their remaining teeth in excitement as they wept tears of gratitude.</p>
<p>“You deserve it,” Leonis responded with a magnanimous nod. “Your achievements are great. Take pride in yourselves.”</p>
<p>They were in Leonis’s room, on the second floor of the Hræsvelgr dorm. A little more than three days had passed since the investigation of the Third Assault Garden. Having finally awakened from the fatigue induced by using the Demon Sword Dáinsleif, Leonis elected to reward the three knights for their contribution in battle.</p>
<p><em>I must establish that while punishment will be severe in the newly reformed Dark Lords’ Armies, effort will be generously compensated.</em></p>
<p>Despite being deep within enemy territory, the three skeletal knights had done a splendid job of guarding his minion, Riselia. They’d demonstrated their vigorous strength during the fight against the Voids as well. Such achievements were more than sufficient to earn them a Devil Bone Medal.</p>
<p>“Hmm. Leo, is that little…bone toy of yours really that big of a deal?” Riselia asked, her ice-blue eyes regarding the badge with doubt.</p>
<p>“Y-you do not know, Lady Riselia?!” Amilas rattled in surprise.</p>
<p>“Why, a Devil Bone Medal is the greatest decoration an undead could hope to earn!” Dorug prattled.</p>
<p>“…It is?” Riselia asked, looking utterly perplexed.</p>
<p>“In that case, I shall receive the medal as the representative of our order!” the robed skeleton, Nefisgal, said as he made to put away the medal.</p>
<p>“Wait just one moment, Old Nefisgal! That will simply not do!”</p>
<p>“The one to hog all the glory should be the one who contributed the most! In other words, it should be me, Hell’s Grappler, Dorug!”</p>
<p>“How could you say that? I haven’t much life left in my old bones. It would only be fair to relinquish it to me.”</p>
<p>“We are undead, Nefisgal. There hasn’t been any life in any of our bones in recent memory! Now, go on, hand it over—”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, no, no, I am most worthy of this reward!”</p>
<p>The trio’s quarrel devolved into a scuffle, and soon the three skeletons were tangled together in a marrowy jumble of fisticuffs.</p>
<p>“…Grr, you three…!” Leonis groaned, holding a finger against his temple in annoyance. “Enough of this. Hold a duel or whichever contest you prefer and decide who shall receive the prize.”</p>
<p>Holding up his Staff of Sealed Sins, Leonis dropped the three lumped-up skeletons into his shadow. The Champions of Rognas kept on wrestling as they sank into the floor.</p>
<p>“…I swear. Their strength as undead is without question, but why must they be so…?” Leonis whispered in exasperation, his shoulders drooping.</p>
<p>Riselia, however, chuckled in a wry manner.</p>
<p>“Wh-what?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Your friends are pretty funny, Leo.”</p>
<p>Feeling a blush creep onto his cheeks, Leonis gave a dry cough. “I have a medal prepared for you as well, Miss Selia.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Leonis brandished his staff, producing a skull the size of one’s hand that levitated in the air.</p>
<p>“L-Leo, what’s this?” Riselia asked.</p>
<p>“An Arch Death Medallion,” Leonis answered with a solemn tone. “Do accept it.”</p>
<p>Had the Three Champions of Rognas still been there, they likely would have raised their voices in shock. This was the highest-caliber award, made from applying golden leaves to a real dragon’s skull. Only the greatest generals of the Dark Lords’ Armies were bequeathed one.</p>
<p>Leonis was confident, however, that Riselia had done enough to earn this trophy. During the battle with Tearis Resurrectia, a member of the Six Heroes who’d been turned into a Void, she’d shared her blood with Leonis when he was injured. This act had saved him in his time of crisis. Plus, her blood had also served to awaken sealed memories regarding the goddess Roselia.</p>
<p>“Now, no need to feel reserved. Take it,” urged Leonis.</p>
<p>“H-hmm…”</p>
<p>The Dark Lord offered Riselia the shining golden dragon skull. However, the young woman shook her head uncomfortably.</p>
<p>“I-I’m fine. I don’t need it! Knowing you’re grateful is enough for me,” she said, patting Leonis gently on the head.</p>
<p>“Y-you don’t need it?” This unexpected response seemingly flustered Leonis. “It’s an Arch Death Medallion, you know!”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah. I mean, you gave me that pretty dress, right?”</p>
<p>“Right…”</p>
<p>Indeed, he’d gifted Riselia the True Ancestor’s Dress, an item rare and valuable enough to be referred to as a national treasure. That hadn’t been a reward, though. Leonis had always intended to give that to Riselia.</p>
<p>“Then, do you want something else? While not quite a match for the Arch Death Medallion, I could bequeath you a Death Chariot or a Staff of Hell—”</p>
<p>Leonis hurriedly tried to offer her alternatives, and Riselia regarded him with a strained smile. Squatting down, she hugged Leonis’s head tightly.</p>
<p>“M-Miss Selia…?”</p>
<p>“Listen, Leo,” she whispered into his ear. “The best prize is seeing everyone back safely. And that’s all thanks to you.”</p>
<p>“Aaah…” Leonis stiffened.</p>
<p>Riselia’s fingertips had a coolness to them, a unique vampiric trait, and her silvery locks brushed gently against his neck.</p>
<p>“Now, we should be getting ready for breakfast. Regina’s waiting for us.”</p>
<p>Riselia got to her feet and sauntered out of the room, her uniform’s skirt wavering as she did. Having been left behind, Leonis scratched his flushed cheeks and returned the medallion into his shadow.</p>
<p><em>Such humility. Any of my other subordinates would have squabbled over this reward.</em> Leonis felt his admiration for Riselia increase, as it often did. Naturally, his minion had no way of knowing that.</p>

<p class="space-break">With the skeletal knights out of sight, Leonis shifted his room’s curtains and opened the window. Leonis wasn’t one for bathing in sunlight, but by now, he’d gotten used to it.</p>
<p>Occasionally, he felt a tinge of longing for his stone coffin in the Grand Mausoleum, but when he once tried to sleep in the dark closet, Riselia got angry at him when she came to wake him up. She told him, “You’re not a vampire.” To which he’d dryly replied that she was, which only served to make her angrier.</p>
<p>Leonis activated the small terminal on his desk, checking the report Shary had brought him. He’d already grown used to using these devices that operated on magical technology. It’d been three days since his team had returned from their investigation on the Third Assault Garden. Of course, calling their excursion something so mundane wasn’t nearly enough to sum up all the things that had happened, but that was beside the point.</p>
<p>“No information about that man…,” Leonis whispered to himself, sighing internally.</p>
<p>Nefakess Reizaad. One thousand years ago, the slender white-haired man had been a retainer to Azra-Ael, the Devil of the Underworld. It was clear that he’d been involved in the attempt to bring Tearis Resurrectia—the Holy Woman of the Six Heroes who had been turned into a Void—back to life.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was evident he possessed information regarding the goddess Roselia, whom Leonis sought. He’d stated that Roselia was to awaken using the Holy Woman’s body as a vessel. And indeed, Leonis had confirmed that the goddess’s soul had dwelled within Tearis Resurrectia’s body.</p>
<p>However, her soul, much like her vessel, had been defiled and polluted by emptiness.</p>
<p>“I need you to promise me. In the distant future, if I change and become something else… I want you to kill me with that Demon Sword… And then… <em>Please find the real me.</em>”</p>
<p>Roselia’s words had been locked away in Leonis’s mind until recently. Her divine foresight allowed her to foresee the possibility that the power of the Voids might tarnish her soul.</p>
<p><em>And that’s why she split her spirit into several fragments…</em></p>
<p>Roselia had tasked Leonis with freeing the parts of her soul polluted by the Voids and finding her true form. Right now, the only tangible clue he had was the Devil of the Underworld’s retainer.</p>
<p><em>I must use all the Dark Lords’ Armies’ resources to seek him out.</em></p>
<p>Leonis’s grip around the Staff of Sealed Sins tightened.</p>
<p>“Don’t think you can run from a Dark Lord forever… Heh-heh-heh…” He chuckled menacingly, an evil look in his eyes.</p>
<p>“—ord… Hmm, my lord?”</p>
<p>Feeling a tug on his uniform’s sleeve, Leonis looked down, and his brow furrowed. “Mm?”</p>
<p>“I have a report, my lord…”</p>
<p>Beneath him was the upper half of a girl clad in a maid’s uniform. Her lower portion was submerged in his shadow on the floor.</p>
<p>“Oh, Shary. Very well,” stated Leonis.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Excuse me, my lord…” Shary Corvette Shadow Assassin silently crawled out of the dark. She was a lovely creature with dusk-colored eyes and black hair. The girl was a covert killer and Leonis’s servant.</p>
<p>Shary levitated for a moment in front of Leonis before the tips of her shoes clicked on the floor. She greeted her master with a dignified curtsy.</p>
<p>“You mentioned a report. Is it about Nefakess Reizaad?” Leonis questioned.</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t discovered anything about him yet. My apologies,” replied Shary as she shook her head slowly.</p>
<p>“I see. Then, what is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s about the remnants of the Sovereign Wolves group, who joined your ranks recently. Fourteen more of their former members have offered to join your side.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so the Demon Wolf Pack continues to grow.” Leonis nodded to himself at this development, looking pleased.</p>
<p>The Demon Wolf Pack was a group composed of core members of the Sovereign Wolves group, an organization of anti-imperial demi-human terrorists. Following the seajacking of the royal family’s personal vessel, the <em>Hyperion</em>, they lost their leader and were on the verge of collapse. Leonis swooped in to fill the gap left in the wake of their commander’s death, integrating them into his own forces.</p>
<p>Initially, there were only thirty or so members of the Demon Wolf Pack, but Leonis had subordinates actively scouting demi-human ruffians who were displeased with the Human Empire. At present, their ranks had swelled to sixty.</p>
<p>Leonis secretly hoped that one day, when he would announce his second coming to this world as the Undead King, this organization would come to form the core of the new Dark Lords’ Armies.</p>
<p>“Let them do so. I leave judgment of who to scout up to you.”</p>
<p>“May I really make that decision?” Shary confirmed.</p>
<p>“Yes, go ahead.”</p>
<p>Shary was likely concerned that mindlessly adding more members to the group might result in problems cropping up at unexpected junctures. Her doubts were reasonable. Unlike the undead who made up the grand majority of Leonis’s army one thousand years ago, the Demon Wolf Pack was an assortment of different creatures from various walks of life. While the menace of the Undead King kept them in line, for the time being, that could change as the Demon Wolf Pack continued to grow.</p>
<p><em>But so be it…</em>, mused Leonis. Leading such a heterogeneous group was a challenge he welcomed. Building the Dark Lords’ Armies into a full-fledged force demanded that kind of experience.</p>
<p>“Understood. I will do as such, then—”</p>
<p>Bowing respectfully, Shary began to sink back into Leonis’s shadow.</p>
<p>However, Leonis called out to stop her. “Wait, Shary.”</p>
<p>“Yes, what is it?”</p>
<p>“I still haven’t given you a reward, have I?” he asked.</p>
<p>“…?!” The maid’s dusk-colored eyes widened.</p>
<p>During their mission in the ruined city, Shary had been told to escort and guard Regina and the other girls—a task she had completed expertly. She’d also done well protecting Leonis’s kingdom’s people during the takeover of the <em>Hyperion</em>.</p>
<p>These accomplishments more than justified a medal.</p>
<p>“My lord, an award would be wasted on someone like me…,” Shary said as she bowed in reverence.</p>
<p>“No need for modesty.” Leonis shook his head. “Failure to recognize my minions’ accomplishments would tarnish my honor as a Dark Lord.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“Now then, for your prize…”</p>
<p>“Is it doughnuts again?”</p>
<p>“Are doughnuts what you desire?”</p>
<p>“E-erm, anything would make me happy so long as it comes from you, my lord. But if possible, I’d prefer something that lasts longer… M-my apologies!” Shary waved her arms in a flustered manner.</p>
<p>“Hmm. Something more permanent, you say…”</p>
<p><em>Perhaps a Dragon Mask or a Devil King’s Gauntlet would do?</em> Leonis turned down the idea almost as soon as it occurred to him. Both items were priceless treasures, but Shary was petite, and they wouldn’t suit her.</p>
<p>While Leonis continued to ponder his options, Shary suddenly asked, “Excuse me, but you gave your Vampire Queen minion the True Ancestor’s Dress, correct?”</p>
<p>“Mm? Yes, I thought it might be too soon, but Riselia Crystalia has the potential to serve as my right hand eventually. I’m sure she’ll master using it before long,” Leonis replied.</p>
<p>Shary pouted dejectedly at this. “M-my lord, are you considering making that girl your…b-bride?”</p>
<p>“M-my what?!” Leonis found himself stammering. “What do you mean, <em>bride</em>?!”</p>
<p>“The True Ancestor’s Dress is to be worn by a vampire woman who will be wed!” Shary asserted indignantly.</p>
<p>“W-well, that’s a custom unique to vampire culture!” Leonis hurriedly retorted. “I only gave her that outfit to increase her powers.”</p>
<p>“R-really…?” the assassin maid asked wearily.</p>
<p>Leonis nodded, to which Shary let out a relieved sigh, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>“Are you dissatisfied that I gave the dress to such an inexperienced minion?” Leonis inquired.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t intend to question your decisions, my lord.” Shary shook her head with an expressionless face.</p>
<p>The Undead King regarded his attendant pensively. “Hmm. Shary, what is your opinion of Riselia Crystalia?”</p>
<p>“Her skill with a sword is still lacking, but she grows at an astounding rate,” Shary said, remaining stoic. “As a leader, her judgment skills are extraordinary, and I must praise the effort she puts into her duties.”</p>
<p>“I see. It sounds like you’ve been observing her quite closely,” Leonis remarked, his tone betraying approval of Shary’s praise.</p>
<p>“I must be able to discern if she’s suitable enough to serve as your minion,” Shary replied flatly.</p>
<p>Having his favored underling receive such praise pleased Leonis. Suddenly, he recalled he was supposed to be granting Shary a reward, not talking up Riselia. “Right. What say you to a magical ring, then?” he suggested.</p>
<p>“A…ring?” Shary looked up at Leonis, wide-eyed. “I-I’m very happy, but…I’m not sure my heart is ready for this…”</p>
<p>The girl’s cheeks flushed a rosy color as Leonis offered her the band in question. It was a very ominous-looking, skull-shaped thing.</p>
<p>“It’s the Devil’s Ring. A mythology-class artifact I obtained when I defeated Zol-Azura, the Devil of Hades.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
