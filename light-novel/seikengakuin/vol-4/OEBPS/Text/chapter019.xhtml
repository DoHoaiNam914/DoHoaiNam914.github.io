<p class="noindent"><em>Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!</em></p>
<p>With every howl loosed from Veira’s maw, more corrupted dragons tore their way through fissures in reality. Dozens upon hundreds of Voids appeared from cracks, swooping and circling in the skies. Beholding the sight reminded Leonis of the Demon Dragon’s Mountain Range.</p>
<p>“There’s no end to them!” From atop Blackas, Leonis gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>It was unlikely Excalibur Academy would survive in the face of this overwhelming force. Against a Stampede, they only needed to slay the Void Lord leading it. This situation was a bit different, though. As far as Leonis could tell, Veira wasn’t wholly transformed yet. Her flaming red scales looked just as they had one thousand years ago.</p>
<p>The Archsage, Arakael Degradios, and the Holy Woman, Tearis Resurrectia, had unquestionably become Voids, and their forms had reflected that change.</p>
<p>“Blackas, I don’t believe she’s entirely lost to the power of the Voids yet.”</p>
<p>“That’s—” Blackas began to reply but cut himself off. As a constant friend and companion of this Dark Lord, he aptly picked up on Leonis’s feelings. “…Indeed. I suppose we cannot deny that possibility outright.”</p>
<p>“I wish to save her,” Leonis stated. “If we try now, it should still be possible.”</p>
<p>“Is there some method of clearing away that corruption?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I will kill Veira. Then, using the sorcery of the Realm of Death, I shall resurrect her as an undead.”</p>
<p>“You intend to make the Dragon Lord your minion?”</p>
<p>“I do. Though, I don’t know if I’ll succeed.”</p>
<p>When left alone, dead Voids faded away and disappeared. Leonis wasn’t at all sure if he could resurrect the great dragon with his magic. Even success didn’t guarantee that Veira would be free of Void influence.</p>
<p>“Regardless, we can’t fight it here!” Leonis declared, lifting the Staff of Sealed Sins. “Demonic stars, bend to my authority and plummet from your heavenly seat—Gran Mezekis!”</p>
<p>As Veira howled, a gigantic dark sphere formed above the dragon, bearing down on her as if trying to push the winged creature toward the earth.</p>
<p><em>Voooooooooooooooooooooooo!</em></p>
<p>Leonis had cast a tenth-order spell, the Shooting Star Avalanche. A condensed lump of gravity consumed the tyrant of the skies, sending her down into the ocean.</p>
<p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>
<p>Veira’s collision with the sea sent up a spectacular spray of water. Blackas and Leonis floated over to the site of the dragon’s impact.</p>
<p>“As is traditional, when two Dark Lords clash, we use this!”</p>
<p>Leonis produced a blood-colored orb from midair and held it above his head. The waters beneath him began to swirl and part, exposing the seabed. Waves of darkness gouged into the perimeter of the exposed ocean floor, forming a circular barrier.</p>
<p>This was the Goddess Boundary Field, a barrier produced by Roselia Ishtaris’s unique sorcery. Even Leonis, who had activated the magic, couldn’t escape it. There were only two methods of egress: combatants could stop fighting and reach an agreement, or one side died.</p>
<p>“Now I can fight without having to worry about the city being damaged,” Leonis remarked. Looking down at Veira, who was collapsed on the seabed, he tried to draw the sword hiding within his staff. The effort proved fruitless, however.</p>
<p><em>I thought so.</em></p>
<p>Since the goddess’s Demon Sword, Dáinsleif, was powerful to the point of extreme danger, there were significant restrictions placed on its use. Leonis could only draw the weapon to defend his kingdom. What’s more, it could be used against fellow Dark Lords or other servants of the Goddess of Rebellion.</p>
<p><em>It’s quite the handicap, given I’m fighting Veira.</em></p>
<p>Dragons had a heavy resistance to magic, a unique trait of their species. For a sorcerer like Leonis, a dragon was the worst possible opponent. And since he was in the body of a young boy, his mana reserves were greatly diminished.</p>
<p><em>There’s no other option, though</em>, Leonis thought with a sardonic smile. He descended to the exposed ocean floor with the Staff of Sealed Sins in hand.</p>

<p class="space-break">A bolt of lightning crackled through the sky as the downpour buffeted a downtown alleyway.</p>
<p>“Hisssssssssssss!” A lizard demon howled as it lunged down.</p>
<p>Shary dodged it, her skirt billowing in the stormy weather. Whirling, she launched a blade of darkness through the air. The knife struck the lizard demon square in the head, sending it sinking back down into the shadows.</p>
<p>“Shouting before launching a surprise attack? Are you some kind of fool?” the assassin maid taunted with a cold look in her crimson eyes.</p>
<p>Only the spiral Shade Fiend remained, but it was on a whole other level compared to the other two.</p>
<p><em>I suppose I’ll have to take this fight seriously…</em></p>
<p>Shary drew an ebon blade, the Death Butterfly’s Dagger, Refisca. It was a legend-class magical weapon gifted to her by Leonis. Holding the beautifully decorated hilt in an underhand grip, Shary pushed off against the building’s wall and leaped up.</p>
<p>The spiral demon took cover in the shadows, apparently waiting for a chance to strike. This assassin was probably from the Realm of Shadows, like Shary. The creature gave off the scent of one who’d spent their life in the dark and mastered killing as their craft.</p>
<p>Once, a girl named Shary Corvette had been no different.</p>
<p>This <em>is all I can do.</em></p>
<p>As Shary jumped, the Refisca formed copies of itself in the air. The countless knives rained down on the girl’s target, and yet, they didn’t seem to hit anything. For a moment, there was only the sound of splashing water.</p>
<p>Suddenly, ghostly obsidian arms extended from the walls all around Shary, coiling around and snaring her limbs.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Giant spiders slithered out of the shadows on the walls, one after another. Three, four, six of them. All were identical to the demon that had attacked the dorm.</p>
<p>“Geh-eh… Geh-eh-eh-eh-eh…!” An eerie cackling filled the alleyway.</p>
<p>“…I see. So that’s what this was all about,” Shary whispered as she tried to get free.</p>
<p>These creatures were the same as the one that had attempted to kill Leonis and Sakuya through self-destruction. That could only mean…</p>
<p>“You create these demons with your power,” Shary deduced.</p>
<p>“Precisely. I am Raspilius,” the spiral Shade Fiend said, emerging above Shary.</p>
<p>“What you have observed is the power of my Demon Sword, granted to me by the great one. It enables me to forge reproductions of demons I’ve consumed. The Shade Fiends are a force of assassins, contained entirely within me.”</p>
<p>“…Who is this great one you speak of?” Shary questioned.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to know,” the Shade Fiend replied with a sneer. “After all, you’re going to die.”</p>
<p>The next moment, the spider demons all exploded at once.</p>

<p class="space-break">Racing up the emergency staircase, Riselia and Arle hurried to the surface. After Riselia kicked the door open, the pair found themselves in a botanical garden. Plants from across the world were gathered here, seemingly for research purposes.</p>
<p>Turning to look at Arle, Riselia asked, “Who is that bishop?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know much about him, either.” The elf shook her head, her ponytail waving to and fro. “All I know is that he came <em>from the same era I did</em>.”</p>
<p>“The same…era?” Riselia’s brow furrowed at this unusual wording.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but I don’t think I have the time to explain.”</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Countless fireballs formed in the air and flew down at the two. Riselia and Arle split up, dodging the burning spheres that skipped across the ground, leaving flames in their wake.</p>
<p>“Is this the sort of place you like to play?” mocked a familiar voice.</p>
<p><em>Crack, crack, crack…!</em></p>
<p>Fissures ran through the air as if it were made of glass, and from within them, Nefakess appeared, still cloaked in his bishop’s garb. Riselia recognized those fractures.</p>
<p>“Void cracks?! But how?!”</p>
<p>Nefakess raised his hand with a smile.</p>
<p>“Egila Iva!”</p>
<p>Bolts of black lightning lanced from his hand.</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>Arle Kirlesio deflected the electricity with her sword and lunged at Nefakess. Riselia could see a faint aura cover Arle’s body. The elf had reinforced her physical strength with mana.</p>
<p>Despite her dainty arms, Arle loosed an intense slash. Unfortunately, Nefakess sank back into a Void fissure before her blade could connect.</p>
<p>“Hmm. An Arc Seven. The Demon Smiting Sword, Crozax…,” Nefakess remarked, appearing behind the two girls.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Arle swiftly turned, preparing to cut the man through, but her slice was blocked by a staff that manifested in Nefakess’s hands.</p>
<p>“A pity. It seems you’ve yet to master it,” he taunted with a thin smile.</p>
<p>“That rod…,” Arle said, her eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>“The Staff of Downfall, Vraluka Zoa. A legendary archmage’s staff.”</p>
<p>“One of the Six Heroes…?!” Arle’s eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p>“As you can see, I’m wasted on close combat.”</p>
<p>Sensing the mana building up in the rod’s tip, Arle jumped backward.</p>
<p>“Third-order sorcery—Farga!”</p>
<p>A deafening explosion boomed. The air shook, and the blast consumed Arle.</p>
<p>“It seems your current strength is a far cry from your original power, elven hero…,” needled Nefakess.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget about me!” Riselia shouted, charging toward the man in priestly garb with her Bloody Sword in hand.</p>
<p>However, Nefakess avoided her handily. Moving his hand in the shape of the holy mark across his chest, he began chanting. “Bring forth sacred radiance on the haughty fallen dead—Holy Light Barrier!”</p>
<p>Nefakess struck his staff down on the ground, and a bright, divine glow began spreading around him.</p>
<p>“Kuh… Ahhhhhhhh!” Overcome with burning, sizzling pain, Riselia crumbled where she stood. “Wh-what…?!”</p>
<p>“This is holy magic. For an undead, there is nothing more painful.”</p>
<p>“Ngh… Ahhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>Riselia couldn’t breathe. Gripping her own neck, the young woman slumped to the ground, writhing in agony. The pain defied description. It was as if her very soul were being scorched to the core.</p>
<p>“How peculiar,” whispered Nefakess as he watched Riselia twist and thrash. “If this is the extent of your power, I can’t see how you managed to destroy the Holy Woman.”</p>
<p>“Ah… Nghahhhh… Ahhhhhh!”</p>
<p>“Ah well. There’s plenty of information I need to squeeze out of you…” Nefakess violently grabbed Riselia by her long, argent locks.</p>
<p>At that very moment, a flash coursed through the air.</p>
<p><em>Fwishhhhhhhhh!</em></p>
<p>“…What?!”</p>
<p>As a slash delivered at godspeed bore down on Nefakess, the man reflexively blocked it with his staff. Pale lightning sizzled and popped in the air, dancing vibrantly over the water puddles. At the center of it all stood…</p>
<p>“—Forgive me for taking so long, Miss Selia,” Sakuya apologized quietly, Raikirimaru in her hands. “I’m guessing I have permission to cut this man into ribbons?”</p>
