<p class="noindent">It was dusk. Having finished his lectures, Leonis was on his way back to his room at the dorm, only to discover…</p>
<p>“…This place is looking rather…interesting.”</p>
<p>Colorful cloths were scattered all over the floor.</p>
<p>“Ah, welcome back, Leo,” Riselia greeted him, sitting in front of a sewing machine.</p>
<p>“I’m here, too, kid,” Regina added, turning to face him.</p>
<p>“Did you come up with costume designs?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Well, we looked into all sorts of materials and decided that going with cute ones would be best,” Regina replied.</p>
<p>“Ugh, after we went to the trouble of getting all that reference material…” Riselia sighed wearily.</p>
<p>“Well, no one’s going to come into a café if we look scary, would they?” Regina shrugged.</p>
<p>“I guess…,” Riselia mumbled.</p>
<p>“Either way, I see you’ve already found a direction,” remarked Leonis with a nod.</p>
<p>The sewing machines’ ticking sounds filled the room. Finding Regina at work was one thing, since she was a maid, but Leonis was surprised Riselia was sewing.</p>
<p><em>Those two are more dexterous than I thought</em>, Leonis thought, oddly impressed with them, as he brewed some water.</p>
<p>“I’ll make some tea. I have some tea leaves. Would you like to try them?” he offered.</p>
<p>“Oh, thank you, Leo,” Riselia replied.</p>
<p>Mana filled the stove, and the water soon boiled. Leonis prepared the beverage not with a cheap, flavored and scented substitute, but with real, expensive tea leaves. They’d been a gift from a noble long ago. Leonis had kept them safe in the Realm of Shadows’ treasure vault. Shary had handpicked the ones he was using today, so there was no doubting their quality.</p>
<p><em>I had an undead body at the time, so I had no use for these previously…</em></p>
<p>The gentle din of rain reached Leonis’s ears. Looking out the window, he saw a light shower had started.</p>
<p>“They say the weather should clear up on the day of the Holy Light Festival,” Regina commented.</p>
<p>“Oh, thank goodness. It’s hard to set my hair on rainy days…,” Riselia said.</p>
<p>“I’ll do it for you,” Regina told her reassuringly.</p>
<p>“Hmm, excuse me, but how do you know the weather two days from now?” Leonis asked, setting the leaves into the tea strainer.</p>
<p>“The academy’s administration bureau gathers Holy Sword wielders with future sight. Usually, they’re tasked with scouting out Void nests. But since their abilities need practice to develop, they’re also used to forecast the upcoming weather.”</p>
<p>“Future sight…,” Leonis muttered pensively. “There really are all kinds of Holy Swords, aren’t there?”</p>
<p>Immediately, a doubt sprouted in the Undead King’s mind.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t that future sight have foreseen matters like the Void Stampede or the incident on the <em>Hyperion</em>?”</p>
<p>“Apparently, seeing the future is a very abstract power,” Riselia answered. “It’s only by matching those predictions with data collected from analysis-type Holy Swords, like Miss Finé’s Eye of the Witch, that the Assault Garden can read what’s to come in any meaningful capacity.”</p>
<p>“And there are people in the military who remain skeptical of foretold events,” Regina appended.</p>
<p><em>I see. So it’s like star reading.</em> Leonis quickly lost interest. It was no comparison to the future sight afforded to the goddess Roselia by virtue of her authority.</p>
<p>“Still, I really hope things clear up in time for the celebration,” Riselia stated.</p>
<p>“Me too,” Leonis responded. In truth, though, he didn’t care one bit for the weather. When he was the Undead King, he always stayed inside Necrozoa’s Death Hold. Plus, all it took to manipulate a battlefield’s atmospheric conditions was an eighth-order spell.</p>
<p><em>Speaking of, that one always did appear with a great storm in their wake.</em></p>
<p>Leonis thought back to the past with a hint of sweet nostalgia. In his era, there’d been another Dark Lord who’d stood equal with him; a creature hailed as the ruler of storms—Veira, the Dragon Lord.</p>
<p><em>It was always quite obvious whenever Veira descended upon the battlefield…</em></p>
<p>Feeling his lips soften into a smile, Leonis took a sip of his tea. A soothing aroma tickled his nostrils. Just as the steam clouded over the windowpane, Leonis noticed a familiar figure approach. A platinum-blond girl, accompanied by two ice wolves.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Listen carefully! I come with a notification from the executive committee!”</p>
<p>Standing in front of the Hræsvelgr dorm’s entranceway, Fenris Edelritz brushed back her platinum-blond hair.</p>
<p>“Now, now, Lady Selia,” Regina soothed, calming Riselia first before addressing their guest. “Why don’t you come inside for some tea, Lady Fenris?”</p>
<p>“…No, thank you. Your offer is appreciated, though,” Fenris politely refused before thrusting a slip of paper in front of Riselia.</p>
<p>“A submission form for the Holy Light Festival?” As she beheld the sheet, Riselia blinked in befuddlement.</p>
<p>“Indeed. I see the eighteenth platoon intends on holding a café, like last year?” questioned Fenris.</p>
<p>“Y-yes, we are… Is there a problem—?”</p>
<p>“There is a major problem! You there, boy…” Fenris pointed sternly at Leonis, who was seated behind Riselia.</p>
<p>“What about Leo?” Riselia asked.</p>
<p>“He’s going to be serving customers in the café as well, yes?”</p>
<p>“W-well, yes…”</p>
<p>“You are aware, I believe, that this is a girls’ dorm? Since he’s still young, he was given special permission to stay here by his designated guardian.”</p>
<p>“Th-that’s right, but—” Riselia started to stammer out an excuse, but Fenris continued to interrupt.</p>
<p>“During the Holy Light Festival, many outsiders will be visiting the academy. And the executive committee must maintain appearances. We can’t let anyone think we do not uphold public morals on the Seventh Assault Garden.”</p>
<p>“Th-that’s… Well…” Faced with this reasoning, Riselia was at a loss for words. Indeed, Leonis living in the same dorm as her was a unique situation.</p>
<p>“As such, the executive committee cannot and will not approve of this child working in customer service,” Fenris stated firmly, placing her hands on her hips.</p>
<p>“…Well, if you say so, I guess we’ll have to defer to your decision,” Leonis conceded, shrugging.</p>
<p>“Leo?!” Riselia looked at him, shocked.</p>
<p>“I’ll just spend the festival working behind the scenes, in the kitchen,” the boy stated.</p>
<p>“Yes, that would certainly be acceptable,” Fenris approved, satisfied. “Believe me when I say that I did not do this out of ill will.”</p>
<p>“I understand. I wouldn’t want to cause trouble for the academy, either,” Leonis replied.</p>
<p>“…It’s a shame, but I guess there’s no other option.” Riselia hung her head, disappointed.</p>
<p>Leonis hadn’t wanted to draw attention to himself, so as far as he was concerned, this was a fortunate turn of events.</p>
<p>However, just as Leonis tried to hide his relief, Regina flashed an impish smile.</p>
<p>“…Miss Regina?” Leonis asked, brow furrowed with suspicion.</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing. Don’t mind me, kid.” Regina evaded the inquiry, merely beaming.</p>

<p class="space-break"><em>How in the world did things come to this?</em></p>
<p>In the center of a forest was a run-down, dilapidated structure. And lying on a bed in one of its rooms was Arle Kirlesio, heaving a confused sigh. A dark elf girl named Lena had rescued her from trouble with Holy Swordsmen in the city.</p>
<p>Lena had kindly shared food with Arle, who was on the verge of collapsing from hunger, and even set her up with shelter. The dark elves were once subordinates of the Dark Lords’ Armies and mortal enemies of the elves. Yet it seemed that after a thousand years, that divide had closed. Even Arle herself didn’t feel any need to resent a dark elf at this point. However…</p>
<p><em>I didn’t think she was the leader of a criminal organization.</em></p>
<p>Arle was currently in a hideout belonging to the Demon Wolf Pack, a demi-human criminal organization. They presented themselves as a resistance movement but were actually a half-baked excuse of an armed terrorist group.</p>
<p><em>I should probably break away from them soon before things take a turn for the worse…</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was a reason Arle had to remain for a while yet. She’d learned the name of the figure behind this group: Zol Vadis.</p>
<p>It was the moniker of an ancient Dark Lord who had reigned over the world before the Eight Dark Lords rose to power. Never had Arle imagined she’d hear that name in an age when the war between the Six Heroes and the Eight Dark Lords was forgotten.</p>
<p><em>I find it hard to believe the real Zol Vadis has resurrected, but…</em></p>
<p>If the name of such a wicked creature was floating around, Arle had to look into it. Heroes were those charged with striking down Dark Lords. That was why she’d been granted one of the Arc Seven, the Demon Smiting Sword, Crozax.</p>
<p>Arle thought that if she could gain this organization’s trust, she might get a chance to meet this Zol Vadis. To do that, she would need to prove herself, however.</p>
<p>“Arle, I’m coming in.” The curtain hanging over the door shifted, revealing a petite girl, her dark eyes sagacious and penetrating. This was Lena.</p>
<p>“What?” Arle asked her.</p>
<p>“You said you’re confident in your sword skills, right?”</p>
<p>“…I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s go ahead and put that boast to the test, shall we?” Lena said with a confident look.</p>

<p class="space-break">After Fenris’s visit, Leonis returned to his room and set up an isolation barrier around its perimeter. With this field in place, no one could enter the room, and no sound would leak out. Leonis turned on the lights, casting shadows in the room.</p>
<p>“Blackas, Shary. Come forth.”</p>
<p>He invoked the names of his friend and his subordinate.</p>
<p>“I come in accordance to your summons, my lord,” Shary stated, appearing on one knee. Immediately after the girl’s arrival, a pitch-black wolf arrived from the dark.</p>
<p>“You called, my friend?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Blackas, ther— Mm?!” Leonis suddenly exclaimed.</p>
<p>The prince of the Realm of Shadows…had his black fur combed down. It was exceptionally sleek and shiny.</p>
<p>“Wh-why do you look like that?!”</p>
<p>“I surrendered myself to the care of a professional called a trimmer,” Blackas explained.</p>
<p>“A…trimmer?”</p>
<p>The ebon wolf shook his head, and the floral scent of shampoo rose from his jet-black fur.</p>
<p>“That swordswoman helped introduce me.”</p>
<p>“You mean Sakuya.”</p>
<p>Apparently, the executive committee was trying to round up the strays strolling around the academy in preparation for the school festival. Leonis had to admit that having a wolf go about the campus freely was a bit much.</p>
<p>“That girl saw me toying with those people and escorted me to a popular beautician.”</p>
<p><em>Rustle. Rustle, rustle.</em></p>
<p>“…I think I understand the gist of what happened,” Leonis replied, regarding his friend with half-lidded eyes. “Do you like the way your fur feels now?”</p>
<p>“It keeps humans from pursuing me on sight, at least.” Blackas shook his head, once again unleashing a puff of some flowery scent into the air.</p>
<p>Indeed, between his cut-and-combed fur and the ribbon Sakuya had tied to him a while back, one wouldn’t mistake him for a wild beast.</p>
<p>“…I suppose I can’t complain so long as you’re satisfied with it.”</p>
<p>Blackas Shadow Prince was once known as the rampaging emperor of the Realm of Shadows. He was royalty and usually demanded more respect, but if Blackas himself was satisfied with this, Leonis wasn’t going to dwell on it.</p>
<p>“Shary, you mentioned a report?” Leonis questioned to move things along.</p>
<p>“Yes.” The assassin maid nodded respectfully. “I discovered traces of suspicious activity in the shadow corridors.”</p>
<p>“What?” This caught Leonis’s attention.</p>
<p>The shadow corridors were a type of magic formed by the secret knowledge of the Realm of Shadows.</p>
<p>“The one set up along the city’s coastal area is beginning to tear apart,” Shary detailed.</p>
<p>“Hmm. Isn’t it possible the city’s apparatuses are interfering with it?” Leonis suggested.</p>
<p>This Assault Garden used an assortment of cutting-edge magical technology. Since the shadow corridors were a magical construct, too, albeit of a different sort, it was possible they were being influenced.</p>
<p>“That is possible, yes,” Shary acknowledged. “I’ve repaired the damage but thought I should report it either way.”</p>
<p>Shary wasn’t capable of observing every single person who used the shadow corridors. The man who appeared in the Third Assault Garden came to mind as a possible culprit.</p>
<p>“Understood. Stay vigilant,” Leonis instructed.</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord.” Shary bowed her head and then added timidly. “…Um…”</p>
<p>“What is it? Is there anything else?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes… I have, um, procured some baked sweets. Would you mind trying them?”</p>
<p>Shary produced a plate with a pile of cookies on it from the shadows.</p>
<p>“Oh, that is some admirable dedication on your behalf.” Leonis nodded, satisfied. “I’ll try them.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes. They may not suit your palate, but…”</p>
<p>Leonis took a cookie and bit down on it.</p>
<p>“Ngh! Kah, kah, kah! W-water…!”</p>
<p>“A-are you all right, my lord?!”</p>
<p>All the moisture in his throat suddenly vanished, and the cookie clogged his windpipe. The treat was terribly briny. Someone had kneaded salt into it.</p>
<p>“M-my apologies!”</p>
<p>“<em>Hack! Horf!</em> I-it’s fine. It simply caught me by surprise,” Leonis generously assured, even as he was still coughing.</p>
<p>“I-I’ll make them better next time, so you can throw those away…,” the ebon maid muttered dejectedly, slowly sinking back into the shadows in a forlorn manner.</p>
<p>“…Shary?” After a moment of thought, Leonis took another cookie off the plate. It tasted just as nasty and was crumbling from the inside, too.</p>
<p>“Are you going to eat those, Lord Magnus?” Blackas asked.</p>
<p>“She went to the trouble of making them for me,” responded Leonis as he reached for another cookie. “I have to.”</p>
