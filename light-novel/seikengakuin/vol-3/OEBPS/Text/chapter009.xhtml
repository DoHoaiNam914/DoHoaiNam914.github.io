<p>“But I can’t use the Dark Lords’ Armies’ funds…”</p>
<p>“Ugh. No, I suppose you can’t…”</p>
<p>Leonis’s army was critically lacking in funds. His treasure vault in the Realm of Shadows contained many coins that were virtually worthless in this era. They could perhaps be sold as antiquities, but if Leonis were to peddle any mythology-class artifacts from millennia ago, their authenticity could be called into question, which ran the risk of exposing his identity.</p>
<p>“Hmph. Very well,” Leonis decided after a few moments, wiping his mouth with a handkerchief Shary offered him. “I want you two to see this.”</p>
<p>Holding up the Staff of Sealed Sins, Leonis used his sorcery. The gemstone sitting on the staff’s tip, the Dragon’s Eye, flashed blue and began replaying images on its pearly surface—namely, the footage of the Third Assault Garden sailing along the ocean.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Blackas asked.</p>
<p>“I’m projecting my memory. This is a massive fortress of the same model as this city. Six years ago, it was destroyed by those despicable Void monsters.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. And?”</p>
<p>“Look at this.” Leonis held the staff over Blackas’s nose. “There, in the plaza near the city’s center. Can you see it?”</p>
<p>“…Is that…?!” Blackas’s golden eyes widened.</p>
<p>This was what Leonis had noticed earlier in the meeting room, what everyone else had overlooked. It was only natural that they would have, of course, because none among them knew its importance.</p>
<p>However, Leonis had been immediately drawn to it. Red symbols were scrawled on the ground around the plaza. One was a star and the other, a burning eye.</p>
<p><a id="page-54"/>“The Holy Sect’s symbol…” Blackas growled.</p>
<p>The Holy Sect was a religious organization that worshipped the Luminous Powers and possessed powerful influence over the human nations one thousand years ago. Much like the gods, the Dark Lords, and the Six Heroes, knowledge of them should have been long forgotten.</p>
<p>So why was their symbol drawn in the ruins of a destroyed city?</p>
<p>The markings couldn’t have been made before the Assault Garden was destroyed, because they were clearly etched over the rubble.</p>
<p>“How puzzling. It feels strange that only their symbol would survive the many years,” Blackas remarked.</p>
<p>“Indeed. Which makes this our sole clue regarding all that lost history. Perhaps it could even lead us to something connected to Roselia’s vessel. To that end…” Leonis brandished his staff, dismissing the image displayed on the jewel. “I will investigate the ruined city. Blackas, my apologies, but…”</p>
<p>“Yes, I understand.” Leonis’s lupine comrade nodded composedly, as if to imply that no further word was needed. “I shall watch over your kingdom in your absence.”</p>
<p>“Please. You’re the only one I can trust with this.”</p>
<p>Dáinsleif had designated the Seventh Assault Garden as Leonis’s domain. As such, he couldn’t callously depart it without leaving protection. The remnants of the Sovereign Wolves had only just been inducted into the Dark Lords’ Armies and still needed to be carefully monitored before they could be trusted not to do anything untoward.</p>
<p>“My lord, what of—?”</p>
<p>“Shary, you come with me.”</p>
<p>“By your will, my lord.” Shary bowed her head respectfully.</p>
<p>“Do be careful, Lord Magnus,” Blackas said.</p>
<p><a id="page-55"/>“Yes. By the way…” Leonis furrowed his brow, his gaze fixed on Blackas’s neck. “I’ve meant to ask. What’s that?”</p>
<p>Clasped around Blackas’s neck was a collar with a blue ribbon tied to it.</p>
<p>“A gift from the swordswoman,” declared Blackas, showing off the ribbon under his throat.</p>
<p>“Swordswoman…? You mean Sakuya Sieglinde?”</p>
<p>“Yes, her. She said that if I was to walk through the woods on the academy’s premises, the humans might mistake me for a stray and make an attempt to hunt me down. Wearing this collar would dispel that suspicion, it seems.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>Blackas displayed the accessory with a hint of pride. Leonis felt inclined to ask if it was the sort of thing a royal ought to be wearing, but he held his tongue.</p>
<p><em>I am certainly in no position to judge.</em> Recalling the incident in the bathhouse, Leonis heaved a small sigh.</p>

<p class="noindent">“There’s no doubting it. <em>She</em>’s here…”</p>
<p>There stood a girl.</p>
<p>She gazed down at the ruined cityscape from atop the roof of a dilapidated house. Her verdant hair, tied back in a ponytail, wavered slightly in the sea breeze. Excepting her shorts, the young woman’s attire appeared wholly foreign. Her blue eyes were as clear as a lake’s surface, and the blade of the sword she gripped glinted sharply.</p>
<p>Her petite build spoke to an age of twelve, or perhaps thirteen. However, because of her half-elf heritage, she was actually over twenty years old.</p>
<p><a id="page-56"/>Arle Kirlesio was an apprentice to Shardark Ignis, renowned as a Dark Lord Slayer, and the Swordmaster of the Six Heroes.</p>
<p><em>The Sanctuary’s Elder Tree foretold the Goddess of Rebellion’s resurrection.</em></p>
<p>Arle’s slender, elongated ears twitched gently. This city had no signs of life, to say nothing of human activity. It was a place of metal and concrete, a forest all too different from her homeland.</p>
<p><em>What reduced this place to such a state?</em> the girl wondered to herself.</p>
<p>Was it the Dark Lords, who had brought ruin and devastation to the world one thousand years ago? No, it couldn’t have been them. The eight who served the Goddess of Rebellion had already perished.</p>
<p>That meant it had to have been those distorted monsters that appeared from tears in space. The invaders from the hollow darkness that hadn’t existed in Arle’s time, those so-called Voids. What were those horrible, disfigured creatures? This world had changed too much for Arle.</p>
<p><em>In the thousand years I’ve spent slumbering, everything has changed…</em></p>
<p>The half-elf took in her surroundings as she tightened her grip on her weapon. Arle’s blade was the Demon Smiting Sword, Crozax, one of the Arc Seven, the Dark Lord-slaying weapons granted by the Sanctuary’s Elder Tree. A weapon made to destroy the Goddess of Rebellion’s vessel, which had incarnated in this era.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Arle’s ears shivered, picking up on some unnerving presence.</p>
<p>“Ah. I wondered who it might be, but if it isn’t the little elf hero.”</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Swiftly turning around, Arle found that a young man clad in priestly attire had appeared out of thin air. He was slender and looked to be in his twenties. He stood atop the ruins, his blue eyes smiling and alabaster locks wavering in the open air.</p>
