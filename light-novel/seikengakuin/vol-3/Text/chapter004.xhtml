<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter004">TRAINING MATCH</a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="special">“—The enemy is holed up in their base deep in the forest field. Be careful.”</span></strong></p>
<p>“Roger that. We’re moving in, but we’ll stay alert.” Riselia turned around, answering Elfiné’s call through her communication terminal. “Let’s go, Leo.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>The two of them advanced through the woods. The combat field selected for this training match was a replica of a boreal forest. And if need be, it could be changed to adjust to any terrain or environment. What struck Leonis as most surprising was that this change of terrain could be done in a mere sixteen hours.</p>
<p><em>…Human technology truly has come a long way.</em></p>
<p>Leonis marveled, taking in the artificial, yet realistic, woodland surroundings. Sunlight coursed down through the greenery. In terms of sheer size, the area was no larger than Necrozoa’s arena. Leonis had often had ogres, trolls, and other such monsters pitted against one another there.</p>
<p>However, if Leonis had wanted naval battles in those days, water channeled from nearby lakes and rivers would have been <a id="page-22"></a>required. Similarly, desert battlegrounds meant large loads of sand needed to be hauled in. In that regard, this facility was far more sophisticated and well-equipped.</p>
<p>While Leonis thought on such things, Riselia suddenly stopped in her tracks in the middle of a small forest clearing. Her gaze was fixed forward.</p>
<p>“I think there’s a trap ahead.”</p>
<p>Thanks to preliminary research, Leonis and Riselia already knew that one of the enemy team’s Holy Sword wielders had the power to produce snares and other gimmicks. And this spot, with its good visibility, was a perfect place to set a trap.</p>
<p>“Elfiné, could you check if there are enemies ahe—?”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“There’s a sniper by the flag.”</span></strong></p>
<p>“…” Riselia considered that for a moment.</p>
<p>Leonis kept his lips sealed, not offering her any aid. Riselia understood why, though. It was more than Leonis merely gauging her abilities. Everything that went on in this match was broadcast, so he didn’t want to expose too much of his powers.</p>
<p><em>…How will you overcome this?</em></p>
<p>The rules of the bout were simple enough. Defeating an opposing team member earned you points based on that student’s grade. Additionally, each team had a base set up somewhere in the field, and capturing the enemy team’s flag from that base also earned points. Every match had a score threshold, and the first group to meet or exceed it won.</p>
<p>Sakuya was currently assaulting the rival squad’s base. She held the record for single-handedly slaying Voids, which meant the opponent was likely to be most wary of her. The opposing team had gathered their defenses to meet Sakuya’s attack. Fenris was leading them.</p>
<p>By contrast, Riselia had only recently gained her Holy Sword, <a id="page-23"></a>and Leonis looked like a ten-year-old boy. They weren’t seen as a significant threat. Seizing upon that, the two of them snuck around, intending to flank the enemy.</p>
<p>There weren’t many points they could strike at on their own, but Riselia was aiming to take down one of the opposing team’s less defended bases.</p>
<p><em>Either way, speed is of the essence here.</em></p>
<p>Elfiné and Regina had stayed behind to protect their own flag. Elfiné’s Holy Sword was significantly weaker than it had once been, and she now specialized in scouting and information gathering. Thus, the only effective defending member was Regina. Leaving the task of safeguarding the base solely to her was a bold decision. While Regina was undoubtedly skilled, a sniper operating without a partner to guard them was asking to be rushed by the enemy.</p>
<p>“I could just blow away the forest with my Drag Howl, though.” Regina had made a dangerous suggestion.</p>
<p>Despite such a foreboding statement, Regina’s anti-Void annihilation cannon, the Drag Howl, actually had its power significantly inhibited during the match. All antipersonnel Holy Swords were required to limit their strength for sparring. In so many words, it was like landing blows with the dull side of a blade.</p>
<p>However, Holy Swords took all shapes. Those that couldn’t restrain their power adequately were forbidden from participating in these bouts.</p>
<p><em>We have to swoop in and take down the enemy base at once while Sakuya has their attention.</em></p>
<p>Leonis and Riselia’s options were to either go around this clearing or push straight ahead. And they didn’t have much time to mull over their choice.</p>
<p>“—Let’s go around. This way,” Riselia decided, taking off into the nearby bushes with her Bloody Sword in hand.</p>
<p><a id="page-24"></a><em>That’s why you’re worthy of being my right-hand woman</em>, Leonis applauded silently.</p>
<p>A Dark Lord’s general would have charged forward knowingly, intent on crushing any cunning traps with sheer strength. Such was the established, ruthless practice, and doing so showed off the Dark Lord’s power and cut away at the opponent’s morale. A Dark Lord should scoff at the idea of petty tricks.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p><em>That way of thinking led to the Dark Lords’ Armies’ downfall.</em></p>
<p>Leonis preferred to charge his enemies headfirst and crush them underfoot, too. And this was why he appreciated the fact that his right-hand woman was cautious enough to avoid a trap.</p>
<p>Riselia’s choice was praiseworthy to Leonis. Still, had she chosen to charge into the trap, he likely would have complimented her for showing the pluck expected of a Dark Lord’s servant. It was relatively easy to surmise that Leonis had a soft spot for his favored minion.</p>

<p class="noindent">“Mm. They’re doing pretty well,” Instructor Diglassê said of the eighteenth platoon from a seat in the academy sports grounds.</p>
<p>When Leonis had first entered the academy, she’d overseen his duel with an upperclassman, Muselle. The current bout was being projected onto a large monitor on the academy’s premises. Students and civilians alike were allowed access to the school grounds to spectate.</p>
<p>That said, there weren’t many spectators right now. Part of the reason was that this was a morning match. The more outstanding issue was that the eighteenth platoon didn’t inspire much interest. Plus, they were up against the Fafnir dorm, one of the best at Excalibur Academy. Many had decided the outcome of the match before it had even started.</p>
<p><a id="page-25"></a>Apparently, some of the students were committing unofficial gambling, but they decided this wasn’t a match worth gambling on. Sakuya was a skilled fencer, to be sure, but she didn’t function well in team settings. Elfiné’s Holy Sword had lost its original power, and Regina’s strongpoint—her large cannon—was unusable in this match.</p>
<p>This left the leader, Riselia, who’d only recently awakened to her Holy Sword. She’d beaten Muselle in battle recently, but many believed she’d won by way of the element of surprise, since it was her Holy Sword’s first showing.</p>
<p>And lastly, there was the eighteenth platoon’s newest addition—the ten-year-old boy. He was seen as baggage that would only weigh down his team.</p>
<p><em>How will this turn out, I wonder…?</em></p>

<p class="noindent">Two shadows raced through the thicket, heedless of the poor footing. Riselia charged her feet with mana and kicked from tree to tree as she sped like the wind.</p>
<p>“Leo, can you keep up?”</p>
<p>“—Yes, I’m fine,” the Dark Lord answered, soaring right behind her.</p>
<p><em>Who do you take me for, woman?</em></p>
<p>Leonis had used a Shadow Striding spell, allowing him to move with Riselia’s shadow. So long as this magic was in effect, he was merged with the shadows and was capable of phasing through the trees. Shary had taught Leonis this spell, and it had proved quite useful over the years.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Leonis heard a something whistle through the air. A sharp bolt of light skimmed past Riselia’s cheek and disappeared into the bushes behind them.</p>
<p><a id="page-26"></a>“An archer…,” Riselia whispered.</p>
<p>Bows were a standard sort of ranged Holy Sword. Had Riselia picked a route with less cover, the archer would have shot her down. Thankfully, this roundabout path, full of curves and trees, had proven troublesome for the enemy. They hadn’t been able to get a clean shot.</p>
<p>“Did you expect the sniper to aim for us?” asked Leonis.</p>
<p>“No, it was just intuition. I got the feeling taking that route would be dangerous.”</p>
<p><em>Intuition, hmm? Wonderful</em>, Leonis thought.</p>
<p><em>Thwp, thwp, thwp!</em></p>
<p>Three more bolts whizzed through the air. Riselia kicked off the ground, her ice-blue eyes shining crimson with mana. She sprinted through the dense trees and drew her blade, accurately spotting another speeding projectile and cutting it down mid-flight.</p>
<p>“I see you’re getting used to using your vampiric eyesight,” Leonis remarked.</p>
<p>“It’s thanks to your training,” Riselia replied.</p>
<p>The young woman’s improvements weren’t only limited to a growing mastery of her undead physical abilities. Practice against Leonis’s skeletons had greatly improved her swordsmanship as well.</p>
<p><em>Seeing this minion of mine grow is fascinating.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps getting desperate, the archer unleashed another flurry of bolts, which rained down on Leonis and Riselia. However…</p>
<p>“Dimud!” Leonis fired a simple Devil Whirlwind spell to deflect the projectiles.</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!” Riselia charged forward, cutting down the trees in her way.</p>
<p>Beyond the close-knit foliage, she and Leonis found an open spot at the foot of a hill. Looking up toward the peak of the mound, they spied a girl holding a crossbow-type Holy Sword. She was stationed right beside a point flag.</p>
<p><a id="page-27"></a>“…How did she get here this fast?!” The surprise was plain on the sniper’s face. She hurriedly made to loose another bolt, but…</p>
<p>“Got you!”</p>
<p>Riselia unleashed the mana gathered in her legs and jumped up into the air. She landed lightly atop the hill and closed in on the crossbow girl. In a melee battle, Riselia had a clear advantage.</p>
<p>Unfortunately…</p>
<p><em>“Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr!”</em></p>
<p>Two wolves made of ice appeared from behind the rocks and rushed Riselia.</p>
<p>“…Miss Selia?!” Leonis called out, flying up the cliff a moment after her.</p>
<p>Riselia reflexively held up a hand to guard her vitals. One of the Frost Wolves sank its fangs into her arm, which froze solid on the spot.</p>
<p>“Heh. I knew you would come here, Riselia Crystalia! And her valet boy, too!”</p>
<p>Standing atop the rocks was a blue-eyed girl with platinum-blond hair—the eleventh platoon’s captain, Fenris Edelritz.</p>
<p>“…What are you doing here, Fenris?!” Riselia raised her voice in surprise as she leaped back to get some distance.</p>
<p>Fenris should have been busy with Sakuya, who was charging into the base from a forward position.</p>
<p>“Naturally, I came to settle the score with you,” Fenris replied, twisting a strand of hair around her finger.</p>
<p>Five Frost Wolves formed to surround Riselia.</p>
<p>“No, I mean, what happened to Sakuya—?”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh. That girl is quite strong with a sword but weak to distractions. I believe some of my pets are playing around with her right about now.”</p>
<p><em>…They lured her into the woods.</em></p>
<p>Fenris had snuck here while keeping Sakuya overwhelmed with <a id="page-28"></a>her Holy Sword’s autonomous Frost Wolves. By staying beneath the cover of the forest canopy, where she’d been hard to detect, she’d used the wolves to slip past Elfiné’s tracking.</p>
<p>“A forest is my preferred stage for battle.” Fenris smiled confidently. “Two of my platoon’s strongest attackers should be storming your base as we speak. Miss Elfiné and your maid will be no match for them. Victory is ours!”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>It was true that guarding the flag would be difficult for those two alone. However…</p>
<p>“Sakuya once told me that a battle can always be decided by claiming the commander’s head,” Riselia said, glaring up at Fenris.</p>
<p>“…What are you implying, exactly?”</p>
<p>“That I just need to defeat you before your team wins!” Riselia shouted, releasing the mana in her body. The ice around her left arm shattered with a clear, shrill sound.</p>

<p class="noindent">“Oh, is that the mishmash platoon?”</p>
<p>“Seriously? They’ve got a kid with them. They should know this isn’t some game.”</p>
<p>Students who passed by the spectator seats snickered as they watched the fight on the monitor. It was then that a girl sitting in the front row abruptly rose to her feet.</p>
<p>“…L-Leo is definitely gonna win!” she shouted at the sneering onlookers.</p>
<p><em>Hmm?</em> Diglassê found herself smiling with curiosity.</p>
<p>The one who’d spoken up was an adorable seven-, maybe eight-year-old girl with black, shoulder-length hair. Judging by her attire, she was a refugee.</p>
<p><a id="page-29"></a>“…Huh? Who’re you?” The students glared at the young girl with evident displeasure.</p>
<p>She did not back down, though.</p>
<p>“Tessera’s right! Leo and Riselia saved our orphanage!” Another girl, this one with walnut-colored hair, stood in front of the black-haired one, as if to protect her.</p>
<p>“M-Millet…!” A bespectacled boy anxiously pulled at her arm.</p>
<p>“What, are you their friends or something?” A male student shrugged and turned his eyes back to the screen. “Well, I’ve got bad news for you. There’s no way they’ll win.”</p>
<p>“Yep. Not against Fenris and the eleventh platoon,” another boy agreed, waving his hand dismissively.</p>
<p>But then…</p>
<p>“I would say these children have a better eye for this than any of you do,” a charming voice interjected.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Everyone turned to see a girl in a maid’s attire occupying one of the spectator seats and munching on a doughnut.</p>
<p><em>…When did she get here?!</em> Diglassê was taken aback. She hadn’t sensed the girl’s approach at all.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="noindent">“—Hmph! A failure like you cannot hope to win against me!”</p>
<p><em>“Grrrrrrrrrrrr!”</em></p>
<p>At Fenris’s order, the five Frost Wolves swooped down on Riselia.</p>
<p>“Hyaaah!” Riselia squatted down and brandished the Bloody Sword. She slashed through one of the frozen constructs and, spinning in place, bashed her weapon’s pommel into another. In one fluid motion, she then reassumed a defensive stance.</p>
<p><a id="page-30"></a>“What?!” Fenris’s eyes widened with shock at Riselia’s swift, precise bladework.</p>
<p><em>…She’s experienced with fighting groups of enemies after training against my skeleton beasts.</em></p>
<p>“I’m not a failure anymore!” Mana burst from Riselia’s legs as she lunged forward.</p>
<p>“…I won’t let you!” The crossbow girl, who had been lying hidden behind the rocks, fired a bolt of light at Riselia.</p>
<p>“How boorish,” Leonis whispered, and he tapped his Staff of Sealed Sins against the ground. In the blink of an eye, shadows slithered up like serpents and swallowed the projectile.</p>
<p>“…Huh?!”</p>
<p>Hidden Snake was an elementary shadowmancer’s spell. The shadowy serpents screeched as they swiftly coiled around the archer.</p>
<p>“N-noooo… Mmmg, nnng!”</p>
<p>The crossbow girl let out a shriek that was quickly reduced to muffled whimpers. The ebon snakes coiled around her, becoming a black cocoon. With the archer handily dispatched, Leonis turned his attention to Riselia.</p>
<p>She’d jumped up to the ledge and was bringing her Holy Sword down at Fenris.</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>Riselia swung with her blade’s blunt side, meaning a direct blow would still knock Fenris unconscious. However…</p>
<p>“…You’re still just as naive, Riselia!” Fenris cried, taking a backward step to evade the attack. Two Frost Wolves leaped to Fenris’s side to guard her. Riselia took another step closer, but at that moment, Fenris thrust her hands forward and shouted, “Holy Sword, Mode Shift! Freezing Knuckles!”</p>
<p>The two Frost Wolves turned into swirling spirals of ice and air <a id="page-31"></a>that enveloped Fenris’s fists. Like Regina’s Drag Howl, Fenris’s Holy Sword was capable of changing into another weapon. Fenris’s Frost Wolves growled as they settled over her clenched hands and blocked Riselia’s slash.</p>
<p>“Oh no!” Riselia gasped.</p>
<p>Fenris caught the other girl’s blade with one hand, and she threw a punch with the other.</p>
<p><em>…Despite how she looks, it seems she’s a pugilist</em>, Leonis observed.</p>
<p>“Kah… Nng…!”</p>
<p>Riselia’s body went flying and then landed on the ground with a bounce before tumbling a few paces. Yet, her grip on her Holy Sword didn’t slacken—proof of the young woman’s pride.</p>
<p>Although Riselia had been knocked to the ground, Fenris refused to let up, dashing forward. “I’m not done yet!”</p>
<p>“…!” Riselia scrambled to her feet and tried to back away, but… “…My leg…?!”</p>
<p>A Frost Wolf had bitten down on one of her legs, holding it in place.</p>
<p>“Ha, this match is finished!” Fenris exclaimed victoriously, closing in on Riselia while brandishing her Freezing Knuckles.</p>
<p><em>…I suppose a bit of help wouldn’t hurt.</em></p>
<p>Leonis, ever the softy when it came to his minion, began chanting a shadow magic spell. Before he completed it, however…</p>
<p>“…lose…”</p>
<p>Riselia’s ice-blue eyes flickered with crimson. A whirlwind of mana billowed around her body.</p>
<p>“…I…can’t lose…here!”</p>
<p>She stomped her foot, crushing the head of the frigid construct biting down on her limb. She then used her superhuman strength to leap up. Riselia loosed a few quick slashes and reduced the other Frost Wolves to powder.</p>
<p><a id="page-32"></a>“Wh-what…? What is this…?!” Fenris exclaimed in shock. Plumes of cold air rose from her Freezing Knuckles as they closed in. Riselia’s sword deftly deflected the punches, though.</p>
<p>“I’ve always…looked up to you. I always struggled to keep up with you…!”</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Riselia’s Bloody Sword began to glow a crimson shade. For so long, she had been the girl who had failed to be a Holy Swordswoman. She had yearned for years to be a knight and protect those in need, but she had never awakened to the power of a Holy Sword. That had all recently changed, however.</p>
<p>Now, Riselia was a Holy Swordswoman, pursuing her rival to greater heights. Even if no one expected anything of her, she never stopped trying. Through sneers and biting remarks, Riselia persevered.</p>
<p><em>My expectations for her weren’t misplaced.</em> Leonis confidently nodded to himself.</p>
<p>A Vampire Queen was the highest-ranking member of the undead hierarchy. While that was significant, it was wrong to attribute today’s victory solely to it. The true source of Riselia’s strength was her iron will.</p>
<p>Riselia’s Bloody Sword smashed Fenris’s Freezing Knuckles.</p>
<p>“This is my minion. My right-hand woman,” Leonis muttered proudly.</p>

<p class="noindent">“Lady Selia, you were so, so, so amazing! We beat the eleventh platoon! That’s the biggest turnabout in the academy’s history since…since it was founded!”</p>
<p>The eighteenth platoon was gathered in the corridor of a <a id="page-33"></a>massive facility built alongside the training field. Regina had wrapped Riselia up in a hug and was cheering with excitement.</p>
<p>“I didn’t do this alone. We won together.” Riselia embraced Regina back with a gentle smile on her face.</p>
<p>Taking the opposing team’s flag and knocking out their leader, Fenris, had given the eighteenth platoon enough points to win the training match. This was a crowning moment for Riselia and the others.</p>
<p>The next battle was already beginning on the field, so the group made their way to the Undine bathhouse to relax and celebrate their victory.</p>
<p>“Besides, we shouldn’t let this win go to our heads. If Fenris hadn’t been so fixated on beating me and stayed at her original position, we wouldn’t have won.”</p>
<p>“You’re so serious, Lady Selia…,” Regina said, finally releasing her friend from another hug. “But really, this is a huge victory for us. Maybe they’ll install a Jacuzzi in our dorm.”</p>
<p>“Before they do that, I’d like for them to fix the air conditioner in the living room,” Riselia replied with a shrug.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, everyone. I walked right into the enemy’s trap,” a blue-haired girl muttered, her shoulders dropped apologetically. It was Sakuya Sieglinde. She wore the Sakura Orchid’s traditional garb over her Excalibur Academy uniform.</p>
<p>“No, Sakuya, you did well,” Riselia replied.</p>
<p>“That’s right. They may have lured you into the forest, but you beat their trap expert all on your own,” a slightly older, black-haired girl walking beside them added encouragingly. This was Elfiné Phillet, the eighteenth platoon’s operator, and the team’s dependable older sister, as it were.</p>
<p>“That was just a fluke. I was hunting down Fenris’s wolves when I ran into her. I was just lucky.”</p>
<p><a id="page-34"></a>“No, if anything, she was unlucky to run into you,” Elfiné corrected.</p>
<p>When it came to melee combat, few students could match Sakuya.</p>
<p>“Aww, I wish I got a chance to shine, too,” Regina grumbled.</p>
<p>“If you ask me, your mere presence at our base was a big deterrent. The other side’s attackers had to tread cautiously,” Riselia said.</p>
<p>“Well, if they’d tried anything, I’m confident I would’ve been able to shoot them down.”</p>
<p>“And you beat the archer, Leo.” Riselia then turned around to face Leonis. “Congratulations on your first win in a training match.”</p>
<p>“I only pulled that off because you had her distracted, Miss Selia.” Leonis shrugged and shook his head. “All I did was take advantage of the opening you made for me.”</p>
<p><em>Honestly, I hadn’t planned on defeating any of them.</em></p>
<p>Still, Leonis had been powerless to resist showing off in front of his favorite minion—a bad habit from his Dark Lord days.</p>
<p>“Maaan. I’d have loved to see Leo fight,” Regina said enviously. “Elfiné, can you show me the Eye of the Witch recording later?”</p>
<p>“No problem. Oh? Actually, wait a second,” Elfiné replied, her expression turning serious for a moment as she activated her communication terminal. “Sorry, my cat’s calling for me. I’ll meet up with you later, okay?” Elfiné brought her palms together in apology and jogged down the corridor.</p>
<p>“…A cat?” Leonis cocked his head.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Elfiné takes care of a cat,” Riselia said. “Apparently, it gets lonely rather quickly, so caring for it has been difficult.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen any felines around the dorm, though,” Leonis remarked.</p>
<p><a id="page-35"></a>“It walks around academy premises. Elfiné lets it roam free most of the time,” explained Riselia.</p>
<p>“Oh, that reminds me, I’ve heard you started raising a stray dog recently, Sakuya,” Regina interjected.</p>
<p>“No, I’m not looking after Fluffymaru the Black…”</p>
<p>It was then that Leonis felt a tug on his sleeve.</p>
<p>“You’re coming this way, kid,” Regina instructed.</p>
<p>“…Huh?” the Dark Lord managed through his surprise.</p>
<p>“I mean, you’re still just ten, right?” Regina said, pointing her thumb in the direction of the girls’ bath. “Academy regulations say that children aged ten or less have to bathe with their guardians.”</p>
<p>“W-wait, I…!” Leonis tried to protest.</p>
<p>“She’s right, Leo,” Riselia added. “I’m worried about you bathing alone. You might break something in the bath.”</p>
<p>“I won’t!” Despite his protestation, Leonis had broken a shower once because he hadn’t known how to use it.</p>
<p>“Besides, you always take quick rinses when you go in alone. Your hair’s full of sand today, so I want to make sure it’s all washed out.”</p>
<p>“H-huh? W-wait, Miss Selia, I…!”</p>
<p>“Okay, kid, no more tantrums.” Regina chuckled devilishly as she pushed Leonis toward Riselia.</p>
<p>“Grrrr…!” Leonis grumbled as he was all but dragged into the girls’ bath.</p>

<p class="noindent">A layer of white steam hung over the interior of the Undine bathhouse. It was an elliptical structure equipped with multiple facilities, including a sauna, a cold bath, and a steam room. <a id="page-36"></a>The polished tile wall sported a design that depicted natural landscapes from before the Void invasion.</p>
<p>And in one corner of this veritable paradise…</p>
<p>“Your skin is so clear, kid!”</p>
<p>“Leo, stop thrashing!”</p>
<p><em>How did my life come to this?!</em></p>
<p>Having been stripped naked by Riselia and Regina, Leonis was seated on a bathing stool, absolutely at his wit’s end. The warmth in his cheeks was due to far more than hot water.</p>
<p>“We can’t wash you if you’re curled up like that, kid. Okay, up we go!” Regina, who had undone her pigtails to let her hair down, grabbed Leonis’s arms and lifted them.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>The Dark Lord could feel wet skin press against his back. A shiver ran through his body as Regina pulled his arms up.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee. What’s the matter, kid? Embarrassed?”</p>
<p>“M-Miss Regina, I can…I can wash myself…,” Leonis tried his best to reply, but his voice was so meek and flustered that the sound of running water drowned it out.</p>
<p><em>I… I am a Dark Lord… A Dark Lord who led legions of the undead, ten thousand strong…!</em> Leonis tried to muster his willpower, reminding himself desperately of his mighty status.</p>
<p><em>Scrub, scrub. Scrub, scrub, scrub.</em></p>
<p>A sponge gently rubbed against his skin, covering his body with soap bubbles.</p>
<p>“Regina, his body’s clean already,” Riselia said.</p>
<p>“Okay, okay. I gotcha, Lady Selia,” Regina replied. She finally took a step back from Leonis, who breathed a large sigh of relief. Unfortunately, the reprieve was short-lived.</p>
<p>“Leo, close your eyes. You don’t want to get shampoo in them.”</p>
<p><a id="page-37"></a>This time, Riselia’s dainty fingers started rinsing his hair. Her fingertips felt oddly cold, likely because she was a vampire.</p>
<p>“Erm… Listen, I can do it myself…”</p>
<p>“No,” Riselia turned him down flatly. “You’re not thorough enough.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>Back when Leonis had been the Undead King, he hadn’t bathed. Instead, he would just sleep in a coffin. Consequently, he’d pretty much forgotten how to wash himself.</p>
<p>“Your hair’s a little frizzy, Leo,” Riselia whispered, clearly enjoying herself as she lathered foamy shampoo and rubbed it on his head. “Tell me if there are any itchy spots, okay?”</p>
<p>“I-I’m…fine…,” Leonis replied, swallowing nervously.</p>
<p><em>I hate to admit it, but this cleansing does feel pleasant.</em> It was a sweet numbness that lulled Leonis into a peaceful sleep.</p>
<p>“Sakuya, let me wash your back—” Regina, who had been left with nothing to do, moved behind Sakuya.</p>
<p>“No, I-I can handle myself—”</p>
<p>Sakuya, who was usually casual and indifferent, refused her suggestion with unusual bashfulness.</p>
<p>“…? Oh, Sakuya…” Regina smirked mischievously. “Did your…?”</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>“Aaaaah?!”</p>
<p>Regina grabbed onto Sakuya’s breasts from behind.</p>
<p>“I knew it. They got a little bigger again. My hawk eyes don’t lie, girl.”</p>
<p>“…Aaaah, that’s not… R-Regina, you…idiot!” Sakuya, her face red, rained playful blows on Regina.</p>
<p>“Don’t you agree, Leo?” asked Regina.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>At the question, Leonis raised his face, jolting up from his nap. <a id="page-39"></a>Before he knew what was happening, he saw Sakuya’s chest hidden behind a thin layer of soap.</p>
