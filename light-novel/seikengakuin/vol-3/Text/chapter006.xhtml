<p>“…!” Sakuya let out a wordless scream. She quickly covered her front with a bath towel, her face rosy.</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry!”</p>
<p>“…H-he…s-saw my…saw my chest…”</p>
<p>“No, it’s, erm… You’re very…pretty, so…”</p>
<p>“…You!” Pouting her lovely lips, Sakuya glared at Leonis reproachfully. She swiftly pulled a towel from the top of a rack and wrapped it around Leonis’s eyes.</p>
<p>“M-Miss Sakuya, what are you—?”</p>
<p>“You might be a kid, but this is… This is still too indecent!” Sakuya regained her composure and tied the cloth tightly around Leonis’s head.</p>
<p>“Sakuya, you don’t have to worry. It’s just Leo. It’s fine. Right, Leo?” Riselia pressed, leveling a heavy question at him.</p>
<p>“I—I don’t mind! Keep my eyes covered, please!” Leonis nodded desperately.</p>

<p class="noindent">An angel with wings as black as night soared down, descending into a darkness surrounded by countless grids.</p>
<p>It was the quasi-network produced by mana particles—the Astral Garden.</p>
<p>This virtual space that linked the Assault Gardens was created sixty-four years ago by the Human Integration Project. It was initially a highly classified military secret, but it had been disclosed to the academies in recent years.</p>
<p>Of all the places in this dying world, the Astral Garden was the sole one beyond the Voids’ reach. And in this world defined by a <a id="page-40"></a>grid of light, she could move freely. She wore a sensual dress with a plunging V-neck. Anyone who knew her usual demure conduct would be struck speechless if they saw her now.</p>
<p>She was the queen of the night—Elfiné Phillet. This was her other self, the face she never showed at the academy. Basking in the sense of freedom, she landed upon one of the grids.</p>
<p>“Come on out, Cait Sith,” she called out.</p>
<p>A black cat appeared before her and mewed in greeting. This creature, Cait Sith, was Elfiné’s personal Artificial Elemental, one that existed in the network. Elfiné had created it by refining one of the orbs from her Holy Sword, Eye of the Witch.</p>
<p>It was this Artificial Elemental cat that had called for her earlier. Apparently, the Phillet Company’s headquarters in the Imperial Capital had discovered some suspicious data in the network.</p>
<p>The Phillet Company was the leading authority in producing magical apparatuses, as well as research on and production of Artificial Elementals.</p>
<p><em>The spirit used in the terrorist attack was one of the Phillet Company’s creations.</em></p>
<p>Typically, the only one who could control the <em>Hyperion</em>’s spirit was Princess Altiria. But the spirit the Demon Sword wielders had brought aboard successfully usurped control over the vessel. Regina, who drew on the royal family’s blood, had managed to regain control of the ship, but if she hadn’t, the <em>Hyperion</em> would have charged straight into a Void reef.</p>
<p><em>If those Demon Sword users are somehow connected with the house of Duke Phillet…</em></p>
<p>Elfiné had researched the matter for the last few days and discovered some unclear movement of funds within the Phillet Company. However, she hadn’t been able to learn anything more <a id="page-41"></a>precise than that. A powerful barrier guarded the central, top-secret sector.</p>
<p>Cait Sith meowed at Elfiné, and a black cube manifested in front of her.</p>
<p>“That’s the suspicious data?” Elfiné leaned forward and carefully poked the cube’s surface. The object unraveled in a geometric pattern, and the information condensed within the shape flowed into Elfiné’s mind. Within that torrent of data, she found a secured, locked file name.</p>
<p>“…D Project?” Elfiné read dubiously.</p>
<p>D Project. What did the <em>D</em> stand for?</p>
<p><em>I’ve got a terrible feeling about this…</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, a cacophonous alarm blared inside Elfiné’s head.</p>
<p><em>…An urgent call? At a time like this…?</em></p>
<p>Elfiné hurriedly cut off her connection to the Astral Garden.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She doffed the small headgear she’d placed over her head and let her sleek black hair flow behind her. Using her fingers to brush her disheveled locks down, Elfiné heaved a small sigh. She was in Excalibur Academy’s information control room, a unique facility that used a large, military-grade data terminal.</p>
<p>The school recorded all access to the network, but the Eye of the Witch allowed Elfiné to easily cloak her activities.</p>
<p><em>An urgent contact from the administration bureau? What’s this all about?</em></p>
<p>Brow furrowed in suspicion, Elfiné looked down at the terminal sitting on the table. Immediately, her eyes widened with shock.</p>
<p>“…What?!”</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page-42"></a><em>Scrub, scrub. Scrub, scrub.</em></p>
<p>“You don’t have to be so stiff, Leo,” Riselia said with a wry smile from her spot behind the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>“…!” Leonis thought being blindfolded would put him at ease, but he soon realized how major a mistake that was.</p>
<p>The sound of breathing tickled his ears. The sensation of soft fingertips against his body made jolts of pleasure run through his nerves. “Khh… Ahh…” He exhaled in hard gasps despite himself. Having his vision cut off made his other senses that much keener.</p>
<p>“Are you okay, Leo? Does it hurt somewhere?” Riselia’s voice implored.</p>
<p>“I-I’m… I’m fine…”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee. What, is it so dark your imagination’s working overtime, kid?” Regina chuckled and blew into Leonis’s ear.</p>
<p><em>Boing, boing.</em></p>
<p>Leonis also felt something decisively soft press against his forearm.</p>
<p>“M-Miss Regina, stop teasing… Haaah… Ahh…”</p>
<p>“Ah, you just moaned like a girl. So cute.”</p>
<p><em>You’re doing this on purpose, you blasted maid!</em></p>
<p>Leonis whimpered, trapped in the ebon of blindness.</p>
<p>“Next, I’ll wash your front, Leo.”</p>
<p>“M-M-Miss Selia?!” Leonis stiffened as if a petrification curse had just been placed on him.</p>
<p>Before anything could happen, however, a communication terminal started ringing. It was one of the earring devices Riselia wore.</p>
<p>“An urgent summons from the administration bureau? What’s happened?” Riselia whispered, her fingers stopping along Leonis’s back.</p>
