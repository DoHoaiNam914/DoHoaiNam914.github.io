<p class="noindent">Back on the battlefield, as skeletons clashed with distorted monsters, Leonis faced the Void Lord floating above him. The Holy Woman, Tearis Resurrectia, now contained Roselia’s soul.</p>
<p>However, that spirit both was and wasn’t the Goddess of Rebellion. With his Demon Sword held aloft, Leonis looked up to the sky. A black moon glinted ominously above. It was a seventh-order spell of the Realm of Death—Suray Gira, the Blue Moon of the Dead. The ritual magic gathered wandering souls and converted them to mana.</p>
<p>The obsidian moon sucked up the Crystalia Knights’ souls and swelled up to three times its size.</p>
<p>“Dead Ones, Let Your Mana Become My Own, as You Are Set Free From the Shackles That Bind Your Souls.” At Leonis’s command, the moon dispersed into particles of mana that gathered in the Demon Sword’s blade.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Thou Art the Sword to Save the World, Gifted by the Heavens.</p>
<p>Thou Art the Sword to Ruin the World, Made to Rebel Against the Heavens.</p>
<p class="space-break1">A Holy Sword, Sanctified by the Gods.</p>
<p>A Demon Sword, Blessed by the Goddess.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Dáinsleif let out a dark glow, its blade swirling with massive amounts of mana. But at the same time…</p>
<p><em>“Goooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhh!”</em></p>
<p><a id="page-166"></a>Many magic circles formed above the Void Lord. It was the same spell that had reduced the Central Garden to burning scrap in mere moments, the Smiting of the Heavenly Stars.</p>
<p><em>Again?! Now?!</em></p>
<p>Because he’d had to concentrate on controlling the Demon Sword’s power, Leonis was utterly defenseless. He couldn’t guard himself or chant a protective spell like last time.</p>
<p><em>Which one of us will finish first…?!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, a flash of light fired from afar cleaved into the Void Lord’s mana furnace.</p>
<p><em>What?!</em> Leonis’s eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p>A torrent of intense light blew away the spell that was on the verge of being completed, destroying the magic circles that had formed in the sky.</p>
<p><em>That attack just now… Was that Regina’s Drag Blast? Or is this Shary’s doing?</em></p>
<p>Either way, this was Leonis’s chance. He focused back on Dáinsleif. The Void Lord let out a rumbling howl. The attack it had suffered was evidently quite substantial, though still not enough to slay the Holy Woman.</p>
<p>“Perish, Tearis Resurrectia of the Six Heroes, vessel to a false god…!”</p>
<p>Leonis swung Dáinsleif down, putting all the mana he had into the attack.</p>
<p><em>Whoooosh!</em></p>
<p>The overflowing, raging black light consumed the mana furnace, shattering it to pieces…and with this, the gigantic Void Lord began to crumble, collapsing in on itself like an old castle.</p>
