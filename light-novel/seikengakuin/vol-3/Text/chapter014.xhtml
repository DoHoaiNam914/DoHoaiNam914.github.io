<p class="noindent">At the bottom of the dark, enclosed shaft, Riselia wearily cracked her eyes open.</p>
<p>“…Ngh…!”</p>
<p>Her attempt to stand was rewarded with a numbing pain that shot through her legs. Looking down, Riselia realized that the limbs had been slammed against the ground and now bent at unnatural angles.</p>
<p><em>They’re broken, huh?</em> Riselia took in the situation coolly.</p>
<p>Naturally, an average human’s body would have been crushed beyond recognition after plummeting from such a height. Riselia was a member of the undead, however—something she was thankful for at this moment.</p>
<p><em>How far have I fallen…?</em></p>
<p>Riselia strained her neck, looking around. Unfortunately, even her vampire eyes, graced with superior night vision, could hardly see anything in this darkness. This was a vast, silent place.</p>
<p>It had to be an abandoned shelter. Gigantic roots had torn through the metallic bulkheads, rendering them useless.</p>
<p>Riselia could hear the sounds of Leonis fighting in the <a id="page-80"></a>distance. She planted her hands on the ground, trying to push herself up, when suddenly…</p>
<p>“…Huh?!”</p>
<p>Riselia’s crimson glowing eyes detected something writhing in the darkness ahead.</p>

<p class="noindent">“Cut Apart Through Dragon Scales, Demonic Blades of Ice—Sharianos!” Leonis chanted a spell, his mana amplified by the Staff of Sealed Sins. This eighth-order water element magic formed countless ice blades in midair, which rained down on the opponent. But just as they were about to strike the angel-class Void, it let out an unnatural sound. A shield of light formed around it, deflecting Leonis’s attack.</p>
<p><em>Ah, so it has retained its Holy Protection ability…</em></p>
<p>Holy Protection was a sacred boon granted to high-ranking angels, capable of rendering all spells of the eighth order or below inert. Breaking through this protection wasn’t easy. It was why angels, the apostles of the gods, were said to be equal to dragons.</p>
<p>Undoing his gravity control spell, Leonis landed near the shaft’s rim. Controlling gravity required a great deal of concentration to regulate one’s mana, making it ill-suited for use in the middle of combat.</p>
<p>The floating Void let out another dissonant screech, and a radiant sword formed in its hands. It was a sixth-order holy magic spell, the Punisher’s Sword—a lightning attack that had once tormented the Dark Lords’ Armies.</p>
<p>“Tch!”</p>
<p>The angel hurled the conjured blade at Leonis, who parried it with the Staff of Sealed Sins, which he’d charged with his mana.</p>
<p><a id="page-81"></a><em>Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt!</em></p>
<p>The sword of light dispersed, releasing a shock wave that mowed through the surrounding ruins. The ripples sent clouds of dust into the air, obscuring Leonis from sight. The Void began chanting its holy magic again, forming another glowing blade in its hands.</p>
<p>In a matter of moments, six radiant swords floated in the air. With a single motion, the Void unleashed them all at once.</p>
<p><em>Boom, boom, boom, boom!</em></p>
<p>Thunderous roars echoed, reverberating all around. The Void flapped its deformed wings, blowing away the dirt and rubble in the air. However, there was no sign of Leonis below.</p>
<p>“Look up, fool.”</p>
<p>A giant, winged shadow eclipsed the angel. A skeletal dragon that rivaled the Void in size was soaring up above. Kneeling on its back was Leonis, who sneered down at his opponent scornfully.</p>
<p>“You have no right to look upon a Dark Lord, lowly angel.” Leonis then thrust forward the Staff of Sealed Sins and chanted a spell: “Crush All—Beruda Gira!”</p>
<p><em>Bwoom!</em> A condensed orb of gravitational force knocked the Void down into the ground. Its massive form sank into the earth, forming a large crater.</p>
<p>“Farga! Farga! Farga!”</p>
<p>Leonis fired third-order destructive spells in quick succession, which hit the Void and exploded. The Dark Lord didn’t give his opponent time to activate its Holy Protection. The Void spread its wings of light and took off, speeding toward the skull dragon.</p>
<p>“Oh, you are a bulky one, aren’t you?” Leonis mocked.</p>
<p>The skull dragon’s eye sockets gleamed crimson.</p>
<p><em>“Graaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</em></p>
<p>It let out a rumbling, ominous roar before sinking its fangs <a id="page-82"></a>into the Void’s arm. Then, it unleashed its Breath of Death, an undead dragon attack capable of rotting the earth and tainting the soul. The fatal vapor had decimated legions on the battlefield.</p>
<p>One of the Void’s arms crumbled away, sending the creature plummeting to the ground. Using its other arm, the Void tried to lob a Punisher’s Sword at Leonis. However…</p>
<p>“Too slow.”</p>
<p>…Leonis had already completed his own incantation.</p>
<p>“Ninth-order spell—Madia Zolf!”</p>
<p><em>Boooooooooooooooom!</em></p>
<p>Hit with a flash of heat capable of melting mithril away, the Void’s massive form tumbled limply into the enormous crater.</p>
<p>“And here’s one more to remember me by: Rias Gia!”</p>
<p>Without wasting a moment, Leonis quickly intoned another ninth-order spell. Dark bolts of lightning rained down upon the angel-class Void, utterly destroying it.</p>
<p>“A bit too spectacular of a showing for such a weakling,” Leonis spat. He then peered down into the abyss below. The skull dragon swooped down, descending into the hole with Leonis perched on its back.</p>

<p class="noindent">Leonis ventured farther into the depths, using an orb of light to illuminate his way. After flying down several hundred meters, he finally reached the bottom of the shaft. Leonis dismounted the skull dragon and returned it to his shadow.</p>
<p>Lighting a small flame at the tip of his staff, he examined his surroundings. It was a large, circular space. There were tunnels on opposite sides of the chamber, presumably for transporting cargo. Riselia was nowhere to be found.</p>
