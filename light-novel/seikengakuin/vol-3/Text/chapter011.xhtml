<p><a id="page-58"></a><em>He knows who I am?</em> Arle glared at the man. No one in this era should’ve known she had awakened. Arle felt herself breaking into a cold sweat. <em>I couldn’t even sense his presence. This is no ordinary human…</em> Her grip on the sword’s hilt tightened.</p>
<p>“…Are you the guardian of the Goddess’s vessel?” Arle asked, holding up her sword.</p>
<p>The man’s lips curled up into a sardonic smile. “‘Guardian’? Yes, I suppose that title befits me well enough. Let us assume that I am. What would you do?”</p>
<p>“I will cut you down!” Kicking hard off the ground, Arle leaped into the air and swung down her Demon Smiting Sword mid-jump. However…</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Her breakneck slash caught nothing but air. The slender man’s visage wavered like a mirage.</p>
<p>“An illusion…!”</p>
<p>“It pains me to turn down a guest, but I’m afraid Dark Lords and heroes have no place in a world filled with Voids.” The man’s voice echoed on the wind. “I ask that you relinquish the stage.”</p>
<p>And the next moment…</p>
<p><em>Crack… Crack… Crack…!</em></p>
<p>Accompanied by the sounds of shattering glass, large fissures ran through the air around Arle.</p>
<p>“This is…!”</p>
<p>It was the phenomenon that heralded the appearance of those distorted monsters.</p>
<p>“You…summoned those creatures? Who are you…?!” the half-elf demanded.</p>
<p>“I am Nefakess. Nefakess Void Lord.” The introduction’s words quickly faded away, and the arm of a large angel crept from the cracks in the air.</p>

<p class="noindent">Just as the sun was setting over the horizon, the eighteenth platoon boarded the tactical fighter Lindwyrm Mk.III, which launched from Excalibur Academy’s third military port. The Lindwyrm Mk.III was one generation older than the Knight Dragons Leonis had destroyed aboard the <em>Hyperion</em>.</p>
<p>This wasn’t to imply the academy made light of the eighteenth platoon’s mission. Rather, it was that the royal family’s private vessel was outfitted with cutting-edge prototypes that hadn’t been made available for everyday military use yet.</p>
<p>“How do you like sitting in a fighter jet?” Elfiné, who was piloting the plane, asked.</p>
<p>Floating around her were orbs that displayed various glowing symbols. They were Elfiné’s Holy Sword, the Eye of the Witch. She used it for support when piloting.</p>
<p>“It’s convenient. More spacious than I thought,” Leonis replied, looking around the vehicle’s undecorated interior. He wasn’t wrong. For an aircraft, it was quite spacious.</p>
<p>“Boys all love fighter jets, don’t they?” Regina remarked from her spot next to Leonis.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s not true. Girls like them, too.” Elfiné chuckled. She had a penchant for weapons, as well as magical apparatuses, terminals, and everything mechanical. Leonis noted that Elfiné might get along well with Linze, the younger of two siblings from the orphanage.</p>
<p><em>My skull dragon is far more dashing and exciting than this bucket of bolts</em>, Leonis thought to himself as he comfortably settled into his seat, his heart burning with an odd sense of rivalry.</p>
<p>The seats were made in rows of three. Leonis, Riselia, and Regina occupied one row. Apparently, Sakuya didn’t handle flying <a id="page-60"></a>very well. She was sitting in a different set of seats while wearing an eye mask and headphones.</p>
<p><em>That said, the trip is supposed to last ten hours. Sitting for that long is a bit harsh.</em></p>
<p>Feeling the vibrations under his feet, Leonis sighed. Back when he’d been the Undead King, he never knew fatigue, and in that regard, this human body was quite incorrigible. Leonis’s gaze wandered to the landscape beyond the window, and a question popped into his mind.</p>
<p>“Would have thought the Voids maintained control of the skies.” The comment was directed at Riselia, who was seated next to him. There were Void reefs all across the ocean. Crossing above them should have been quite perilous.</p>
<p>“Certain Voids, like the wyvern-class ones, could attack, but there are no records of anything like a reef ever manifesting in the air,” Riselia explained, holding up an index finger. “Of course, that’s not to say the skies are absolutely secure, so we only use aircraft during missions when a Holy Sword capable of long-range attacks like Regina’s is available. The plane is equipped with minimal armaments, but honestly, they’re only good for peace of mind.”</p>
<p>“I see,” replied Leonis.</p>
<p>Simply put, the Voids had usurped control of the sea and skies from humanity. In the past, the eight Dark Lords who had plunged the world into terror had held dominion over not only the oceans and air, but also the mountains where the dragons roosted and the illusory village where the spirits were born. Even the land of death had been under their thumb.</p>
<p>Rivaiz Deep Sea had ruled the oceans, and the sky had belonged to Leonis’s worthy rival, Veira Greater Dragon.</p>
<p><em>When the Dark Lords’ Armies again arise, I shall retake air and sea from those twisted beings.</em></p>
<p><a id="page-61"></a>Leonis spent some time staring out the window. Sakuya, who had her back leaned against a chair, soon fell asleep. Watching her slumber proved infectious, as Leonis began to feel drowsy as well.</p>
<p><em>I have been staying up late working on my castle’s design.</em></p>
<p>Leonis had discarded the need to rest when he’d become the Undead King, but now he had a growing boy’s body, and it demanded sleep. Ignoring that siren call was difficult; slumber did have a way of being quite pleasant.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh, you feeling tired, kid?” Regina asked, noticing that Leonis was beginning to nod off.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a while until we reach our objective, so you can go ahead and rest,” Elfiné stated from her spot in the pilot’s seat.</p>
<p>“Don’t you need to sleep, too, Miss Finé?”</p>
<p>“Once we get on a stable course, I’ll leave the steering and patrol to my Eye of the Witch and rest for a bit,” she explained.</p>
<p>“You can rest your head right here, kiddo,” Regina said, tapping on her lap.</p>
<p>“N-no, thank you!”</p>
<p>“No need to be shy. Come hither.”</p>
<p>Regina gently cradled Leonis’s head and pushed it down onto her thighs.</p>
<p>“M-Miss Regin—!” Leonis felt his cheeks flush. He tried to sit up immediately, but his head was pressed between Regina’s soft lap and her breasts, leaving him unable to move.</p>
<p>“…R-Regina, stop that!” Riselia knitted her brow indignantly.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee. Just relax and be at ease,” Regina cooed, her breathing tickling into his ear.</p>
<p>A shiver ran through Leonis’s body.</p>
<p>“I’ll clean your ears. You’ll be asleep before you know it.”</p>
<p>Regina took a large cotton swab out of her pocket.</p>
<p><a id="page-62"></a>“Th-that’s not fair. I want to clean Leo’s ears, too…,” Riselia complained sullenly.</p>
<p>“First come, first serve, Lady Selia,” Regina replied nonchalantly, and she inserted the thing into Leonis’s ear.</p>
<p>“Ah… Kuh… Nn…” All the tension drained from Leonis’s body. Despite himself, a feminine moan escaped his lips.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee. Don’t move around too much, kid.” Regina’s slender fingers held Leonis’s chin in place. The golden tips of her pigtailed hair teased the Dark Lord’s cheek.</p>
<p><em>Kuh…! How is this so…so pleasant…?!</em></p>
<p>The prideful Leonis wished sincerely to protest, but his young body wasn’t capable of resisting the pleasure. Resting on a pretty maid’s lap, Leonis could only powerlessly writhe amid sublime delight.</p>
