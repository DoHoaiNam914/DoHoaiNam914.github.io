<p>“You mustn’t be careless, princess!” chided Dorug, the grappler.</p>
<p>“Indeed! The power of the Vampire Queen is vast, but you mustn’t grow overconfident.”</p>
<p>“We shall fight alongside you!”</p>
<p>The archmage Nefisgal and the swordsman Amilas stood at Riselia’s side, their weapons in hand.</p>
<p>“Thank you! You saved me there…”</p>
<p>Without a moment to lose, Riselia rejoined the fight, her crimson dress dancing in the wind. Her Bloody Sword raged with mana, sweeping through Voids.</p>
<p><em>Six years ago, I couldn’t protect anything.</em></p>
<p>Riselia had only been able to cower and pray for salvation. Now, she had the power to protect herself and others. The Holy Sword the planet had given to her, and the might of the Vampire Queen…</p>
<p>The silver-haired girl’s overflowing mana left trails of red as it cut through the air. The Voids gathered around her, as if drawn to that glow.</p>
<p>“…Aaaaaaaaaaah!” Riselia moved to force her way out of this encirclement. But just then…</p>
<p><em>Boom, boom, boom!</em></p>
<p>Flashes of light burst forth like shooting stars, piercing through the Voids’ heads with pinpoint accuracy.</p>
<p>“…?!” Riselia turned around with a start, only to find…</p>

<p class="noindent">Four figures stood on the rooftop of a ruined skyscraper. Regina had her Drag Striker readied and was sniping the Voids from afar <a id="page-163"></a>with deadly aim. She didn’t use the more powerful Drag Blast for fear of hitting Riselia.</p>
<p>“I can’t really see anything in that huge mess. What are all those skeletons?!” Regina exclaimed.</p>
<p>“That’s probably the power of Leo’s Holy Sword…,” Elfiné answered while holding a hand up to her temple.</p>
<p>Three Eye of the Witch orbs floated around her. A stream of luminous numbers ran across them.</p>
<p>Even a skilled sharpshooter like Regina couldn’t accurately hit targets at such a great distance using only the naked eye. Elfiné’s Holy Sword calculated the trajectory of Regina’s shots to support her.</p>
<p>“How’s it going on your end?”</p>
<p>“Just a little longer…,” Arle Kirlesio replied.</p>
<p>With one of the Arc Seven—the Demon Smiting Sword, Crozax—held in her hands, she filled the blade with mana.</p>
<p>“They’re climbing up, Elfiné,” Sakuya observed, swinging Raikirimaru to cut down a force of Voids that tried to scale the walls.</p>
<p>Despite her efforts, there were too many of them. Regina moved from supporting Riselia to assisting Sakuya in staving off the Void onslaught. Raikirimaru’s blade crackled with electricity as it flashed through the air, decapitating the monsters in fast succession.</p>
<p>With horrifying howls and the sound of clashing metal echoing around her, Arle closed her eyes. Crozax was a hero’s weapon, entrusted to her to slay the goddess. The fierce sheen of the blade whited out the air around the half-elf.</p>
<p>“…Is that really a Holy Sword?!” Regina exclaimed, shielding her eyes.</p>
<p>“Roselia Ishtaris, the Goddess of Rebellion! I will strike you down!”</p>
