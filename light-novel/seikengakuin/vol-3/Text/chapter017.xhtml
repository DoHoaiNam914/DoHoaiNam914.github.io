<p class="noindent">“Are you all right? Does it hurt?” Regina asked.</p>
<p>“Ugh…” The girl lying on the ground grimaced.</p>
<p>“I treated the wound, but it still isn’t a good idea to move all that much, okay?”</p>
<p>“You seem quite accustomed to this… Are you an apothecary or healer?”</p>
<p>“I’m a maid.”</p>
<p>“What is a servant doing in such a place…?” the girl asked quizzically, looking down at her bandaged flank.</p>
<p>“Still, I’m surprised you could keep up with Sakuya in a sword fight with those injures,” Elfiné remarked.</p>
<p>The young woman looked a few years younger than the members of the eighteenth platoon. She had bound her green hair back in a ponytail, and her large eyes wavered slightly when she suffered occasional pangs of pain. Her most striking physical feature was her long, sharp ears—a telltale characteristic of elven heritage.</p>
<p>“So,” Regina began as she stowed a medical kit, “why did you try to attack us earlier?”</p>
<p><a id="page-96"></a>“I thought you were in league with those monsters.” The girl averted her gaze, sulking.</p>
<p>“Monsters? You mean Voids?”</p>
<p>“…” The girl nodded silently.</p>
<p>“I know some Voids resemble humans, but…” Elfiné trailed off, bringing her index fingers together in thought.</p>
<p>Some Voids, like the merman and Brain Eater classes, had forms that resembled people, but their outward countenances helped quickly identify them as different sorts of creatures.</p>
<p>“There are Voids that look identical to humans,” Sakuya, who had just returned from scouting out their surroundings, commented. “I’ve seen them before.”</p>
<p>“Completely humanlike Voids?” Elfiné furrowed her brow. “Nothing like that has ever been reported.”</p>
<p>“No, I’d imagine it hasn’t,” Sakuya retorted, and then she leaned forward to address the wounded girl. “That injury. Did those Voids do it to you?”</p>
<p>“…Yes,” the green-haired girl admitted with no shortage of bitterness over it. “I was careless, and they caught me by surprise.”</p>
<p>“What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“…” She seemed to hesitate for a moment, but then, “…Arle. Arle Kirlesio.”</p>
<p>“Arle. That’s a nice name,” Sakuya said with a smile.</p>
<p>Arle averted her gaze awkwardly. Elfiné quickly activated one of her Holy Sword’s orbs. In response, it began to display a sea of words.</p>
<p>“An elf called Arle… No one matching that description exists in the Seventh Assault Garden’s database.”</p>
<p>“Were you the one who sent the distress signals to the academy?” Regina questioned.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” Arle shook her head and then <a id="page-97"></a>turned her own queries to the group. “Who are you people? What are you doing in this place?”</p>
<p>“We’re a reconnaissance team dispatched by the Seventh Assault Garden to investigate this ruined city.”</p>
<p>Elfiné briefly explained their circumstances. She told Arle of how this floating metropolis had been destroyed six years ago, as well as its mysterious reappearance.</p>
<p>“An Assault Garden…,” Arle whispered to herself upon hearing the explanation. “I see. So humankind still has some strongholds left.”</p>
<p>“We’ve told you our side of things. Could you share yours?” Elfiné asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve come here to strike down the goddess,” Arle admitted after a pause, gripping the sword in her hands tightly.</p>
<p>“…Goddess?” Elfiné and Regina exchanged a look.</p>
<p>“…So the legend hasn’t survived the years,” Arle whispered to herself with a hint of disappointment upon seeing the bemused reactions. “I suppose it stands to reason. It has been one thousand years…”</p>
<p>Raising her voice, she then addressed Elfiné, Regina, and Sakuya.</p>
<p>“I have no duty to tell you. I, erm, I’m grateful for your poultice, but I implore you to leave me be.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but we can’t do that.” Elfiné shook her head. “You might be the sole survivor here. We can’t abandon you. Part of a Holy Swordsman reconnaissance team’s duty is to shelter refugees.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“We won’t mistreat you, so how about staying with us for a while?” Sakuya retrieved something from a pocket and offered it to Arle.</p>
<p>“…What is this thing?” Arle asked.</p>
<p>“It’s called a <em>monaka</em>. It’s a treat I’m fond of.”</p>
<p>“Y-you are trying to win me over with a treat?” Arle’s face twisted in anger, and she bared her small teeth. “Do you take me for a child?!”</p>
<p>As if on cue, however, her stomach let out an adorable growl.</p>
<p><a id="page-98"></a>“…” The members of the eighteenth platoon remained silent.</p>
<p>“D-do as you’d like!” Arle looked away, her cheeks visibly flushed.</p>

<p class="noindent"><em>What is that woman doing here?</em></p>
<p>As she watched over the group from the shadows of the ruins, Shary’s hands froze in midair just as she was about to take a bite of a doughnut.</p>
<p>Arle Kirlesio, the Sword Tempest Fae. A princess of the Spirit Forest and final apprentice to Shardark, the Six Heroes’ Swordmaster. Many generals of the Dark Lords’ Armies had fallen to her blade. She was regarded as a one-woman battalion on the battlefield. She’d even infiltrated Necrozoa’s Death Hold three times over and made attempts on Leonis’s life.</p>
<p><em>I’d heard she went missing after the battle for the Skeleton Fort…</em> Shary narrowed her crimson eyes. What was this swordswoman, who had menaced the Dark Lords’ Armies, doing in this era? The elves were known for their longevity, but they weren’t immortal. At best, they lived to be three hundred. Not even one of their kind could live for a thousand years.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps she was reborn as my lord was?</em></p>
<p>That couldn’t be it. The reincarnation ritual was a thirteenth-order spell, accomplished only with assistance from the goddess Roselia. Even the elven sages would not have been able to achieve such a feat.</p>
<p><em>Either way, I must investigate this carefully.</em></p>
<p>It appeared Arle was injured, but Shary’s master often warned her against acting recklessly. Swallowing a piece of her doughnut, Shary faded into shadow.</p>

<p class="noindent">Leonis’s magical light cast a soft glow over the vast warehouse. As Riselia waited for her body to heal naturally, Leonis investigated the place.</p>
<p>“I found some food, Miss Selia,” he called, carrying over a box of preserves. According to the expiration date on them, they were still safe for consumption.</p>
<p><em>They’ve been sitting here for ten years. Just what kind of marvels have humans developed?</em> Leonis thought with incredulity. He could achieve a similar result using a time fixation spell, but that was eighth-order magic, far beyond what regular people could achieve.</p>
<p>“Hmm, so how is this supposed to be eaten…?” Leonis took out one of the pouches and read the instructions.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to make it for you, Leo?” Riselia inquired.</p>
<p>“Stop treating me like a child. I can handle this on my own.”</p>
<p>“R-really? All right. I’ll leave it to you, Leo.” Riselia smiled, seemingly a bit happy.</p>
<p><em>Hmm. The instructions say to heat it with fire.</em> Leonis lit a small flame over his fingertip and tried to warm the bag.</p>
<p>“…L-Leo! A pot! You’re supposed to cook it with water in a pot!”</p>
<p>“A pot?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You boil the water and put it in.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Leonis summoned a metallic vessel from his vault in the Realm of Shadows. It was a priceless treasure called the Holy Grail. The Dark Lord had pillaged it from some country or another, but it would do fine for this purpose. Leonis poured some water he had stored and dumped the sealed pack’s contents into the liquid.</p>
<p>“That’s how it’s done…right?”</p>
<p><a id="page-100"></a>“Yep, you did it. Good on you.” Riselia patted Leonis on the head. As she did so, however, Leonis noticed that her cheeks were reddening.</p>
<p><em>Her breathing is a bit labored, too. Is something wrong with her?</em></p>
<p>“You should rest a little, Miss Selia,” instructed Leonis.</p>
<p>“Y-yeah…” She nodded with a slightly haggard voice.</p>
<p>As Leonis waited for the water to boil, he tried to put his thoughts into order. <em>First Archsage Arakael, and now</em> she’s <em>back…</em></p>
<p>Tearis Resurrectia was one of Leonis’s sworn enemies, yet he had never fought her directly during his reign as the Undead King. Her powers could heal and revive, making them the opposite of Leonis’s death-based ones.</p>
<p>She empowered the gods’ armies and resurrected human warriors time after time as they perished on the battlefield. That was the Holy Woman’s role within the Six Heroes.</p>
<p><em>I suppose that answers one question, though.</em></p>
<p>Tearis was a symbol to followers of the Holy Sect. The Voids she produced had likely been the ones that’d drawn the symbol Leonis had spotted around the Third Assault Garden.</p>
<p><em>The Holy Woman was consumed by the Voids, same as Arakael the Archsage. Why have the Six Heroes returned now, after all this time? Roselia never prophesized anything of the sort…</em></p>
<p>The mysterious invaders called Voids, humanity developing a society of oddly advanced magical technology, and the Holy Swords’ peculiar power—none of it added up. It went beyond what the Goddess of Rebellion had foreseen.</p>
<p>“L-Leo…”</p>
<p>“?!”</p>
<p>Leonis stiffened as he realized Riselia’s face was awfully close to his.</p>
<p>“M-Miss Selia?” Leonis swallowed nervously, feeling his heart skip a beat.</p>
<p><a id="page-101"></a>The silver-haired girl’s cheeks were crimson. A faint breath escaped her lovely pink lips as her watery red eyes fixed themselves passionately on Leonis.</p>
<p>“I-I’m… I’m sorry, Leo…”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“…I want your blood…,” Riselia admitted in a coaxing whisper.</p>
<p>Leonis could clearly hear her swallow.</p>
<p><em>Oh, right…</em></p>
<p>Riselia’s healing ability consumed her mana, which spurred her vampiric impulse.</p>
<p>“U-understood,” Leonis accepted, and he started rolling up one sleeve of his uniform. Before he’d finished, however…</p>
<p>“?!”</p>
<p>Riselia grabbed Leonis by the shoulders hard and thrust her small, newly formed fangs into his neck.</p>
<p>“Mmmm… Haaah… Nnng…”</p>
<p>“…M-Miss Selia… W-wait…”</p>
<p>“Mmm… <em>Schluuuurp…</em> Nha…”</p>
<p>Even when her thirst got the better of her, Riselia had always obeyed Leonis in the past. This time was very clearly different, however. She craved blood as if it was the only thing that mattered to her.</p>
<p>“W-Weoooo… I’m shorry…”</p>
<p>Riselia pushed Leonis down to the floor, nearly tearing his uniform off. This was the first time Leonis had ever seen Riselia behave this way. Perhaps the mixed emotions of returning to the ruins of her birthplace had left her unstable.</p>
<p><em>“Schlurp. Nibble. Nibble.”</em></p>
<p>The curtain of Riselia’s argent locks hung over his face.</p>
<p>“…A-aaah…!” A light moan escaped Leonis’s throat.</p>
<p>Typically, Riselia’s bloodsucking was accompanied by a sweet, <a id="page-103"></a>intoxicating pain. On this occasion, Leonis only felt a sharp stab into his neck, proof of how utterly lost to bloodlust Riselia was.</p>
