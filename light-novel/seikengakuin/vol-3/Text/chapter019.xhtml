<p><em>“Schlurp… Nibble. Nibble. Schlurp…!”</em></p>
<p>Leonis’s magic flame flickered in the darkness as the suggestive sound of wet lips echoed through the warehouse.</p>
<p>“M-Miss…Selia…”</p>
<p><em>Boing.</em> Riselia’s soft, supple breasts pressed against Leonis’s body. His fingertips reflexively grabbed tight at the back of the young woman’s uniform.</p>
<p>“…Aah… Leo… Mmm, aah. <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>” Paying no mind to her disheveled skirt, Riselia continued biting into Leonis’s neck. Her blouse came undone, slightly revealing the white underwear beneath.</p>
<p>“…Aah… W-we can’t go…any further than this…” Leonis’s fingers were gradually growing limp. Riselia had lost all reason and was now driven only by the vampiric urge.</p>
<p><em>Th-this is bad…</em> Leonis’s body was that of a ten-year-old. If this continued for much longer, Riselia would bleed him dry.</p>
<p><em>I have no choice… I have to use my sorcery to put her to sleep…</em></p>
<p>Leonis reached for the Staff of Sealed Sins lying on the ground, when…</p>
<p>“Mm… Weeeeo… Mha… <em>Schlrp…</em> Mm… <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“—lia… Selia…!”</span></strong></p>
<p>“Just…a little longer… Mm…”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Erm… Selia, can you hear me?”</span></strong> A voice spoke to her from above.</p>
<p>“Ah… Mm… Haaaaaaa?!” At the sound of that voice, Riselia came to her senses and let out a panicked screech. “Elfiné?!”</p>
<p>Looking up, Leonis saw one of Elfiné’s Eye of the Witch orbs floating nearby.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page-104"></a>“…I-I’m sorry we, erm, worried you, Miss Finé!” Riselia bowed apologetically in front of the sphere after fixing her clothes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“…Your voice is kind of high-pitched. Is everything okay?”</span></strong></p>
<p>“I-I-I’m perfectly fine! Peachy, even! You must be imagining it!” Riselia squeaked as she shook her head. Her face was practically a tomato.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“R-right…”</span></strong></p>
<p>Thankfully, Riselia somehow managed to convince Elfiné nothing untoward was happening. Meanwhile, Leonis was languishing powerlessly on the floor behind Riselia’s bowed figure.</p>
<p><em>I…really am…too soft when it comes to my minions…</em>, Leonis chided himself as he listened in on Riselia and Elfiné’s exchange. Back when he was the Undead King, he would never have allowed anyone to…manhandle him like that. A Dark Lord dying to a servant bleeding them out would undoubtedly become a shameful story mocked for centuries.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“I heard you two got into a tough scrap with some Voids. Are you injured?”</span></strong> Elfiné inquired.</p>
<p>“Y-yes. I’m a bit hurt, but it shouldn’t get in the way of the mission.”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“I’m surprised you’re fine after falling from that height.”</span></strong></p>
<p>“Er, Leo used his Holy Sword’s power…,” Riselia managed evasively.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Well, either way, I’m glad you’re both all right. Regina and Sakuya are relieved, too.”</span></strong></p>
<p>Even though the only connection Riselia and Leonis had to the others was the orb, they still felt their comrades’ sense of ease at knowing the pair was okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“You’re at the bottommost underground sector right now, right? We don’t have a way to get down there, so we’ll need to regroup somewhere on the surface.”</span></strong></p>
<p>“Roger. Ah, Miss Finé, there’s something I have to report first,” Riselia said.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“…Report?”</span></strong></p>
<p>“Yes. There’s a chance there’s a Void Lord in this city.”</p>
<p>“<strong><span class="special">What?!</span></strong>” Elfiné cried in surprise.</p>
<p>Leaving out the part about the ghosts, Riselia told Elfiné about the Void they fought on the surface and that there was a chance that a Void Lord had merged with the mana furnace beneath the Central Garden.</p>
<p>The humans of this era did not believe in ghosts or other undead. Riselia correctly assumed that telling the others about the ghosts would simply confuse and distract them.</p>
<p>“<strong><span class="special">A Void Lord… No…,</span></strong>” Elfiné whispered in a strained voice.</p>
<p>“This is all speculation, of course, but…,” Riselia began, now more composed, “since the Third Assault Garden is still advancing toward the Seventh, I think we should consider the possibility of a Stampede.”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“You’re right. If a gigantic Void appeared, it’s likely a Void Lord was behind it. Either way, we have to investigate the mana furnace in the Central Garden.”</span></strong> The Eye of the Witch orb flickered in midair, as if nodding.</p>
<p>“What about on your end, Elfiné? Anything happen?” Riselia asked.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Erm…”</span></strong> Elfiné paused for a moment before replying. <span class="special"><strong>“We…may have secured a civilian. An elf girl.”</strong></span></p>
<p>“A civilian? You found a survivor in the ruins?!” Riselia exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“No. She has a Holy Sword, so we’re not sure if she’s a civilian or not, but I think it’d be better if we tell you the details when we regroup.”</span></strong></p>
<p><a id="page-106"></a>“A-all right, understood. Where do we rendezvous, then?”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Well, this is your hometown. Do you have somewhere in mind?”</span></strong></p>
<p>Riselia paused for thought, then said, “How about the Crystalia estate at the Central Garden?”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“The Crystalia estate… Roger that. Regina can show us the way. Be careful, you two.”</span></strong></p>
<p>“Same to you all, too.”</p>
<p>The transmission ended, and the Eye of the Witch sphere lost its light as it went into sleep mode. Evidently, keeping her Holy Sword active wore away at Elfiné’s mental strength. Riselia took a deep breath and turned around to face Leonis.</p>
<p>“Finally feeling calmer?” Leonis asked with a hint of malice.</p>
<p>“…I-I’m sorry, Leo!” Riselia apologized, her face red.</p>
<p>“I told you you’re allowed to drink some blood, but if you suck too much… It’s, well, a problem.”</p>
<p>“…U-um, that was, m-my mind went blank. I wasn’t myself, and…” Riselia’s shoulders slumped. There were tears in her eyes.</p>
<p><em>That’s probably enough antagonizing.</em></p>
<p>Ever kind to his favorite minion, Leonis cleared his throat and said, “I was joking. I’m glad you’ve recovered your mana, Miss Selia.”</p>
<p>“Leo…”</p>
<p>“Let me rest a while longer, and then we can head to the rendezvous point,” Leonis said, rising to his feet. While anemic and dizzy, he could still move. Pouring some of the ration stew he’d heated up into a bowl, he handed it to Riselia.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Riselia brought her hands together in gratitude and smiled.</p>
<p>“By the way, that Crystalia estate you mentioned to Miss Elfiné…”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s my family home,” Riselia confirmed. “It’s on the <a id="page-107"></a>island at the heart of this city, the administrative ward in the Central Garden. Most buildings are destroyed beyond recognition, so we can’t use them as landmarks, but I figured Regina and I could find the Crystalia estate easily enough. And…”</p>
<p>Riselia trailed off. Even without putting it into words, Leonis understood the reason. Her father, Duke Crystalia, could be wandering the remnants of his home, just as the souls of the Crystalia Knights had been down here.</p>
<p><em>Or perhaps he’s already been turned into a Void by the Holy Woman…</em></p>
<p>Either way, Leonis was as interested in investigating the place as Riselia was. He had to uncover the truth of all this.</p>

<p class="noindent">On the lowermost underground level beneath the Central Garden, the mana furnace stood, emitting a glow that illuminated the walls around it.</p>
<p>“Aaah, soon. Soon, the goddess’s vessel shall be filled.”</p>
<p>In that quiet, templelike place, a young man in a priest’s garb—Nefakess Void Lord—enjoyed a laugh. He stood before an altar where several dozen Demon Swords that his cult had gathered were resting. He took each one and thrust it into the mana furnace, as if adding fuel to a fire.</p>
<p><em>Vnnn… Vnnn… Vnnn…</em></p>
<p>Each sword Nefakess offered was swallowed up by the mana furnace.</p>
<p>“Oh, goddess, we’ve waited one thousand long years.” Nefakess looked up, his eyes full of ecstasy. “The lofty one, the sole divinity brave enough to oppose the Luminous Powers…” His eyes were fixed on the pale form of the woman fused with the mana furnace.</p>
<p>The Holy Woman of the Six Heroes had reappeared in the same <a id="page-108"></a>era as a certain deity. Her lightless eyes gazed blankly into the air as her lips whispered a hymn.</p>
<p>“Aaah, such a sweet tone, Tearis Resurrectia. To think the song of the sworn enemy of my goddess’s armies would ever be so pleasant to my ears.”</p>
<p>The hero consumed by the Voids would now serve as the vessel of rebirth for the Goddess of Rebellion. A fragment of Roselia Ishtaris’s soul would rise again within this emptiness.</p>
<p>“…Soon. It will come soon…”</p>
<p>Just as Nefakess finished throwing the last of the Demon Swords into the furnace, a dove-shaped Artificial Elemental landed on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“What? How boorish.” He grimaced upon hearing its report, but his expression soon returned to its usual calm. “The angel was destroyed?” He’d dispatched that massive Void to dispose of the assassin from the Sanctuary.</p>
<p><em>Did I underestimate that elven hero? No…</em></p>
<p>Nefakess activated a terminal linking into the Assault Garden’s security system. After a moment, the network detected a suspicious object nearby—an imperial combat aircraft.</p>
<p>“…A Holy Swordsmen investigation team. They found this place faster than I expected.” Nefakess shrugged with a tired sigh. It was hard to believe mere Holy Swordsmen had defeated that angel. “Well, so be it. I suppose I should go and clean out the trash,” Nefakess whispered, looking up at the pulsating mana furnace with a satisfied smile.</p>
