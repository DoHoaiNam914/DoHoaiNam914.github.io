<p class="noindent">Leonis went out to the estate’s courtyard and took a seat on one of the garden rocks, polishing a dragon’s bone. It was one of his hobbies. Well-polished bones added to a skeleton’s dignity when put into use. As the Undead King, Leonis regularly made use of skeletons.</p>
<p><em>It wouldn’t do for my enemies to mistake my soldiers for those used by the average necromancer or lich.</em></p>
<p>This was something of an obsession of Leonis’s. Further complicating things was that bones were seemingly harder to come by in this era. Leonis was unsure whether dragons even existed in this day at all.</p>
<p><em>I might have tens of thousands of troops slumbering in the Realm of Shadows, but I should be frugal…</em></p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“…id… Can you hear me, kid?”</span></strong> The Eye of the Witch sitting next to Leonis lit up, emitting a crackling voice.</p>
<p>“Miss Regina?” Leonis replied, his hands stopping.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Ah, great. Where are you right now?”</span></strong></p>
<p>“We’re at the Crystalia estate.”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Huh? How did you get there so quickly?”</span></strong> Regina raised her voice in surprise.</p>
<p>“We used the underground railroad network to get directly to the Central Garden.”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“I mean, yeah, but the underground linear rail can’t move, right?”</span></strong></p>
<p>“We got it to move,” Leonis answered curtly, not feeling inclined to explain further. “Enough about that, though. Where are you?”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“We’re just heading for the linking bridge.”</span></strong></p>
<p>“I see. We’ll wait for you here.” Given how the Third Assault <a id="page-130"></a>Garden was broken up, Regina, Elfiné, and Sakuya would arrive within the hour.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Yeah, please. By the way, where’s Lady Selia?”</span></strong></p>
<p>“In the mansion. I assumed I should give her some time for herself.”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“That’s pretty mature of you, kid.”</span></strong> Leonis got the feeling Regina was smiling on the other side of the call. <strong><span class="special">“Ah, do you want to see my room? I’ll let you in once we get there.”</span></strong></p>
<p>“Oh, not really…”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“…D-don’t you want to see a girl’s room, kid?”</span></strong></p>
<p>“Erm…”</p>
<p>But just as Leonis was about to answer…</p>
<p><em>Boooooooooooooooooooooooooom!</em></p>
<p>Every window on the second story of the mansion burst out with a rumbling blast.</p>

<p class="noindent">A roaring explosion echoed as crimson flames consumed the corridors, reducing everything they touched to ashes.</p>
<p>“I may have overdone it against a mere human. A third-order spell is capable of killing a giant.” Nefakess smiled, not a speck of soot on his robe. “Now then, how many more uninvited gnats must I sweep away…?”</p>
<p>The man turned to leave, waving his hand to ward off the smoke, when…</p>
<p>“…Hmm?”</p>
<p>He stopped in place. His brow furrowed with suspicion. There, between the cinders flitting through the air, was a robed skeleton.</p>
<p>“…What…?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, this is quite taxing on my old bones,” the bony figure <a id="page-131"></a>admitted, sticking out his staff and forming a glowing, blue magical barrier.</p>
<p>Pho Rias, the magic barrier spell, was fourth-order defensive sorcery, only usable by high-ranking sorcerers.</p>
<p>“…A skeleton?”</p>
<p>“Ka-ka-ka!” The undead thing gave an eerie, rattling cackle. “Don’t lump me in with other gutless skeletons, whelp! For I am a high-ranking undead! An Elder Lich!”</p>
<p>“What…?!” Nefakess whispered.</p>
<p>The robed skeleton waved his staff, which lit up and produced dozens of mana arrows.</p>
<p>“…It can’t be!” Nefakess exclaimed as he quickly chanted a defensive spell and blocked the conjured projectiles. “Why are there undead here…?!”</p>
<p>“Hmph, insolent fool. To make an attempt on our mistress’s life!” a new skeleton, this one wielding a sword, declared.</p>
<p>“Just who is behind this…?!” Nefakess demanded. No sooner had he done so than a third warrior made of bones attacked from behind. This one was a hulking brute carrying an iron ball.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>“I am the Gelid Warrior, Amilas!”</p>
<p>“I am Hell’s Grappler, Dorug!”</p>
<p>“And I am the Underworld’s Archmage, Nefisgal!”</p>
<p>The three champions stepped forward as one.</p>
<p>“““And together, we are the illustrious Three Champions of Rognas!””” they cried in unison, each striking a unique pose.</p>
<p>“Wh-what’s going on…?!” Nefakess’s eyes darted about in confusion. “What are these creatures doing here…? How…?!”</p>
<p>The way they carried themselves was unquestionably absurd, but they were far stronger than ordinary undead. Nefakess could tell these were all seasoned warriors that rivaled heroes. Behind <a id="page-132"></a>those three skeletons, a shadow rose to its feet. Its silvery locks wavered in the surging fire. Nefakess had thought he’d obliterated the Holy Swordswoman with his spell, but he couldn’t have been more wrong.</p>
<p>“…Thank you, you three. You saved me,” she said.</p>
<p>“Do not mention it, milady!” the archmage Nefisgal replied with a flourish of one hand. “You are dear to our lord’s heart, after all! Now then, mistress, do you know who this ruffian might be?”</p>
<p>“…I have no idea.” Riselia shook her head, her eyes fixed on Nefakess.</p>
<p>“Hmm. But he does look skilled,” the warrior Amilas remarked. “It is best you retreat, my lady.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m afraid I can’t let you do that,” Nefakess declared. “I thought you were nothing but an insignificant worm, but a human who commands such high-ranking undead is rare. You’ve piqued my interest, I’ll admit. Just who are you?”</p>
<p>All at once, Nefakess’s demeanor had changed. He pointed a finger at Riselia and began chanting. The air crackled at his words.</p>
<p>“This is a sixth-order spell—sorcery that’s more powerful than anything a mere human could ever achieve.” Nefakess’s handsome lips curled up in cruel mocking. “Can you block this?”</p>
<p>“Get behind me, fair princess…!” Dorug, the grappler, called before leaping forward.</p>
<p>At the same moment…</p>
<p>“Miss Selia!”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>A boy’s shout filled the room, and a fire spell lanced forth from behind Riselia. The magic flames quickly consumed Nefakess.</p>
<p>“…Leo?!” Riselia spun around to see Leonis with his Staff of Sealed Sins in hand.</p>

<p class="noindent">“L-Leo…,” Riselia said, her ice-blue eyes wide with shock.</p>
<p>The boy was standing at the end of the corridor. “You’re all right…” He sighed in relief.</p>
<p>The Three Champions of Rognas had kept Riselia safe.</p>
<p>“What happened? Who was that…?” Leonis asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know…” Riselia shook her head.</p>
<p>Leonis peered down the burning hallway. He’d fired a third-order explosive spell, magic that should have been enough to reduce any ordinary person to ash.</p>
<p><em>How untoward. I neglected to restrain myself</em>, Leonis chided. When it came to this minion of his, the Dark Lord tended to lose his cool.</p>
<p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh…” Laughter could be heard from within the blaze.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>“So you’ve brought someone else with you. That spell just now packed a bit of a punch. I’ll grant you that.”</p>
<p>A figure rose in the swaying flames. A young man clad in a priest’s garb stepped out of the fire, brushing soot off his shoulders while wearing a composed grin. Leonis’s eyes went wide with disbelief.</p>
<p><em>What?! How can it be? Why is</em> he <em>here?!</em></p>
<p>The man didn’t regard Leonis’s reaction with much interest, however.</p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha, surprised? Yes, I suppose that sort of magic would have been enough to kill most.” Nefakess extended his arm to gesture at the surrounding conflagration, misinterpreting Leonis’s shock. “I’m sorry to disappoint, but an attack of that magnitude cannot kill me.”</p>
<p><a id="page-134"></a>He chanted another spell, forming a ball of intense flame in his fingers.</p>
<p><em>Sorcery. I knew it. It really is him…</em></p>
<p>Just as Leonis was about to tell Nefakess to wait…</p>
<p><em>Voom!</em></p>
<p>The floor they were standing on started shaking on its own.</p>
<p>“What?” “Huh?!” Leonis and Riselia exclaimed at once.</p>
<p><em>Vrrrrrr!</em> The trembling grew stronger. The tremors were so intense they rocked the manor’s very foundation, causing Leonis to lose his footing and stumble.</p>
<p>“Wh-what is this?!” “’Tis a cataclysm!” “Protect the mistress!” the skeleton warriors shouted in panic.</p>
<p><em>An earthquake? It can’t be. We’re on the ocean.</em></p>
<p>Was it that man’s doing? Leonis placed a hand on the wall to steady himself and looked up.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… Heh-heh… Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha!” The man was laughing. He spread both hands as his face contorted with joy.</p>
<p>“…What’s so funny?” Leonis asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>The question brought the man’s ecstatic guffawing to an eerily swift halt. “She has awakened. Of course I would rejoice.”</p>
<p>“…She?”</p>
<p>“Yes, the great goddess has awakened from the Holy Woman’s vessel!” The priest turned his eyes toward the heavens, his expression still frozen in manic excitement.</p>
<p>“<em>…Goddess?</em> Did you just say <em>goddess</em>?” Leonis took a step forward, demanding an answer.</p>
<p><em>Crack…!</em></p>
<p>Before he could get any reply, however, a fissure ran across the man’s face.</p>
<p><em>Crack… Crack… Crack…!</em></p>
<p><a id="page-135"></a><em>What?</em></p>
<p>The fractures expanded across his body, as if…</p>
<p>“…Hmm, I suppose the time is right. Fine, then,” the mysterious person in priest attire remarked calmly, even as his body was splitting apart. “I admit I’m a bit disappointed that I won’t be fortunate enough to see the goddess’s resurrection with my own two eyes, but that is simply how things go. My job here is complete…”</p>
<p><em>Crack… Crack… Craaaaaaaaaaack…!</em></p>
<p>Breaks ran all over the young man’s body, and the emptiness between them quickly overtook him.</p>
<p>“…Wait!”</p>
<p>“Stay where you are!”</p>
<p>Leonis and Riselia both broke into a run to catch the man, but…</p>
<p>“You shall serve as the first sacrifices offered up to the goddess.”</p>
<p>By the time the pair reached him, his form had vanished, leaving only emptiness in its wake. The priest’s disappearance hadn’t brought an end to the quaking, however.</p>
<p>“Just who was he…? What goddess…?” Riselia was at a complete loss.</p>
<p>“…I don’t know.” Leonis shook his head. Internally, his mind was racing with contradictory thoughts and doubts.</p>
<p><em>What’s going on here?</em> Leonis had recognized that slender man in white robes. <em>There’s no mistaking it. That was…</em></p>
<p>Nefakess Reizaad. A confidant of Azra-Ael, the Devil of the Underworld, one of the Goddess of the Rebellion’s most loyal servants.</p>
<p><em>I saw him a few times at the Gatherings of the Eight Dark Lords. He always shadowed Azra-Ael, not once setting foot on the battlefield. It looks like he didn’t recognize me in my present form, but…</em></p>
<p><a id="page-136"></a>Why would a Dark Lord’s confidant be at a place like this, in this age…?</p>
<p><em>And he definitely said “goddess.”</em> Leonis fell deep into contemplation.</p>
<p>“Leo, look at that!” Riselia pointed out the window.</p>
<p>A gigantic shape was beginning to rise from the Central Garden’s heart.</p>
