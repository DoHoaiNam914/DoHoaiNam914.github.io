<p class="noindent"><em>That dream again…</em></p>
<p>Riselia Crystalia awoke from her restless slumber and wiped the cold sweat from her brow with her sleeping gown sleeve. Even six years after the Voids had destroyed the Third Assault Garden, Riselia was still plagued by that terrible nightmare.</p>
<p><em>Even with my body like this, I guess I still dream…</em>, Riselia mused as she shook her head to banish the lingering unpleasantness from her mind. She sat up and opened the curtains of her window.</p>
<p>The morning sunlight shined upon the locks of Riselia’s argent hair. Stretching slightly, the young woman groggily rubbed her ice-blue eyes. Looking out the window, she spied a flock of birds perching on a tree in the courtyard.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they weren’t cute little feathered friends, whose chirping signaled the coming of a refreshing morning, but rather…</p>
<p>“Caw! Caw! Caw!”</p>
<p>A murder of large, scary-faced crows had filled the trees beyond Riselia’s window. Their eerie shrieks almost seemed to announce that Riselia had risen from bed.</p>
<p><em>…There’s more of them now…</em>, Riselia noted to herself, her <a id="page-4"></a>expression contorting into a stiff frown. Crows had started flocking around her often as of late.</p>
<p><em>…Do I really smell like a corpse?</em></p>
<p>Riselia sniffed at her clothes, but the only scent she caught was the floral aroma of her soap. According to Leonis, creatures of the night like crows and bats tended to gather around vampires, as they were the supreme beings of darkness.</p>
<p>“The fact that they like me is nice, but…” Riselia sighed, looking out the window. <em>If any more of them show up, people are gonna start spreading weird rumors about the dorm…</em></p>
<p>The Hræsvelgr dormitory rested on the outskirts of Excalibur Academy’s vast grounds. Because it looked older than its surrounding structures, people already treated it as a spooky mansion of sorts. Lately, there’d been rumors about a shadow in the shape of a girl and a large black dog wandering around the place after dark. The gossip really sounded like ghost stories. If crows started gathering around the dorm, people truly would start thinking the place was a haunted house.</p>
<p>Not that they’d be technically wrong. A vampire <em>did</em> live in the Hræsvelgr dorm, after all.</p>
<p>Brushing her fingers through her slightly disheveled hair, Riselia rose from her bed. She and Leonis planned to hold a training match this morning, so she had decided to wake up a bit earlier than usual.</p>
<p>“Leo, time to get up!” Riselia called after getting to her feet. However, when she opened the door and made to enter the adjacent chamber…</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Her hand froze on the doorknob. Standing inside the room was a girl in a maid’s outfit holding a mop and bucket. She was cleaning the floor. She had sleek black hair cut to shoulder length <a id="page-5"></a>and crimson eyes the color of twilight. Her gaze met Riselia’s straight on.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Both young women stood frozen for a few seconds. Then, the maid girl’s face screwed up in an expression that seemed to say, “Oh, drat.”</p>
<p>“…Huh…? Wh-who are you…?” Riselia blinked a few times and rubbed her eyes. Surprisingly, when she took another look, the maid girl was gone.</p>

<p class="noindent">“Shit, they’re gonna corner us at this rate!”</p>
<p>“…We have to go on the offensive here. It’s not like we can hide forever.”</p>
<p>“That’s reckless. We don’t stand a chance against Holy Swordsmen with the weapons we have…”</p>
<p>Several sets of footsteps echoed through a dark corridor, as did voices that sounded similar to bestial growls. Golden eyes shone through the darkness. This was the Seventh Assault Garden’s seventh sector—the special demi-human protection ward.</p>
<p>The underground passageways that ran beneath the artificial biotope’s forest were occupied by armed beastmen. They were remnants of the Sovereign Wolves, a terrorist organization that opposed the Integrated Empire.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, their comrades had tried to seajack the royal warship <em>Hyperion</em> in order to abduct Altiria Ray O’ltriese, the fourth princess. The Excalibur Academy students on board had opposed the Sovereign Wolves, however, and the operation had failed. The <a id="page-6"></a>radical group’s leader, Bastea Colossuf, died with several other leading members, leaving the organization on the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>And now, they were being pursued by a group of the empire’s Holy Swordsmen.</p>
<p>“If only we were compatible with the Demon Swords, too…” The beastman leading what remained of the Sovereign Wolves growled in frustration.</p>
<p>“…Dammit, they’re coming!”</p>
<p>Several figures appeared ahead of the fleeing extremists, blocking the underground passage. Their white uniforms stood out in the dark. It was an elite force of Holy Swordsmen.</p>
<p>“Remnants of the Sovereign Wolves! You are under arrest for the crime of high treason!”</p>
<p>The Holy Swordsmen totaled four. The beastmen greatly outnumbered them. However, the power of Holy Swords, a boon granted only to humans, proved enough to overturn that advantage.</p>
<p>“““Holy Sword, Activate!””” the Holy Swordsmen intoned in unison, their voices reverberating through the underground corridor.</p>
<p>“Dammit!” One beastman howled as he and his fellows charged the Holy Swordsmen in desperation.</p>
<p>It was reckless. While the demi-humans’ physical prowess exceeded the humans’, they had no way of overcoming four Holy Swords.</p>
<p><em>I know that, dammit!</em> the leader of the beastmen thought to himself bitterly.</p>
<p>That was when…</p>
<p>“Demonic Eyes, Curse These Fearless Ones—Vraid!” a new voice boomed from somewhere unseen.</p>
<p>Not a moment later, there was an explosion of light, and the Holy Swordsmen froze in place, their weapons still drawn. They now looked for all the world like silent statues.</p>
<p><a id="page-7"></a>“Wh-what just…?” The beastmen were speechless.</p>
<p>“—I’ve been looking for you… Finding you cost me valuable time.”</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>From the depths of the underground passage, a pale-blue light drifted in the musky darkness. Behind that glow, the faint sound of footsteps clicking against the floor reverberated through the close confines of the tunnel.</p>
<p>A dark, humanoid figure clad in a pitch-black overcoat appeared. There stood what looked like darkness given human form. Its face was covered by a silvery mask shaped like a skull.</p>
<p>“Wh-who the hell are you…?!”</p>
<p>The beastmen held up their weapons, their bodies trembling. However…</p>
<p>“Fools.”</p>
<p>The shade slightly raised its right hand. That simple motion was all that was needed to twist the weapons in the demi-humans’ hands as easily as dough. The useless things fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“Kneel. You are in my presence,” the shadow demanded, its voice bearing down like physical pressure and forcing the beastmen’s knees to buckle.</p>
<p>The ominous presence overflowing from this figure made their robust bodies shiver like leaves. The beastmen were the very symbol of the natural world’s law of survival of the fittest; their reactions were instinctual.</p>
<p>The shade before them was a monster of a far higher order than they—an absolute sovereign, made to reign over this world.</p>
<p>“You would raise your weapons against me…?” The shadow took another step closer. “Count yourselves fortunate, for I am <a id="page-8"></a>magnanimous. Had Gazoth, the Lord of Beasts been in my position, you would already be dead.”</p>
<p>“Aah, aaaah… Aaaaaaaaaaaah…!”</p>
<p>None of the beastmen could raise their heads in the face of the dark specter’s overwhelming pressure. The insurgents fell prostrate, and the shadow tossed a small sack in front of them.</p>
<p>“Wh-what is this?” the lion-headed leader of the remnants asked.</p>
<p>“Your leader. His name was Bastea, I believe? These are his ashes.”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“When I found him on that ship, he had already been reduced to dust. Even in such a state, my Realm of Death sorcery could have resurrected him as an undead monster, but, well, I had no duty to do so.”</p>
<p>“Who are you…? No. Who might you be, mighty one?”</p>
<p>“I am a Dark Lord.”</p>
<p>“A Dark Lord…?”</p>
<p>“The Undead King, he who reigns over death and all connected to it. The true, legitimate ruler of this world.” As the shade’s voice echoed, the sinister aura that spilled from it grew more intense. Suffocated by the fierce, encroaching presence of death, a few of the beastmen fell unconscious.</p>
<p>“U-ugh… Oooh, aaah…!”</p>
<p>“Fear not. I stand before you to repay a favor.”</p>
<p>“A—A favor…?”</p>
<p>“Not to you, but to your distant ancestors. The Shamar clan, the Zaith clan, the Zakar clan. The beastmen warriors once served bravely as vanguards for the Dark Lords’ Armies.”</p>
<p>Those few Sovereign Wolves who were still conscious answered the shadow’s words with confusion. Ancestors? What was this monster saying?</p>
<p><a id="page-9"></a>“You who oppose the empire…” The so-called Dark Lord offered his hand. “Become my subordinates and serve in the Dark Lords’ Armies.” The shade’s clear voice echoed through the underground tunnel.</p>
<p>“Y-you want us…the remnants of the Sovereign Wolves, to serve under you, great one?”</p>
<p>“Correct. You shall be my minions, acting in my name to achieve my lofty goals. I shan’t force you, however. You may choose your fates freely. However…” The Dark Lord pointed at the statues behind them. “You haven’t long to decide. Within several minutes, the petrification on those people will end.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The eye sockets of the shadow’s skeletal mask blazed with an eerie light. A wrong answer here could leave the beastmen petrified, just like these Holy Swordsmen. The beastmen exchanged glances. Either way, their alternative was to be caught by the empire and sent to the gallows. They didn’t know what this inexplicable monster was after, but…</p>
<p>“U-understood.” The lion-headed beastmen stood and bowed low before the Dark Lord. “The remnants of the Sovereign Wolves will serve you, great one.”</p>
<p>It felt as if the skull mask sneered evilly at them.</p>
<p>“Very well. From now on, you shall call yourselves the Dark Lord’s Shadows.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes. By your will.” The beastmen terrorists fell to their knees.</p>
<p>“Then I shall give you your first order—” But as the Dark Lord swung up his hand, an untimely beeping sound filled the underground passage. “H-huh, wh-what…?!” The shadowy figure recoiled in surprise.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“—eo. Leo! Where are you right now?!”</span></strong></p>
<p>The voice died down with another beep.</p>
<p><a id="page-10"></a>“…”</p>
<p>An awkward air hung over the place. The terrorists looked at each other.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh… Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!” The Dark Lord suddenly started laughing, flapping his dark overcoat. “Obey My Will, Land, and Become an Eternal Maze! Create Labyrinth!”</p>
<p>As the specter chanted some kind of spell, the ground rumbled and lit up, forming a staircase leading farther down.</p>
<p>“Wh-what is this…?”</p>
<p>“I created an underground complex here. Make it your base and operate from there for the time being,” the shadow instructed over its shoulder after turning away. It then disappeared, leaving the stupefied beastmen behind. The terrorists could only gawk at the entrance to the labyrinth, their mouths hanging open in amazement.</p>

<p class="noindent">Back in a dormitory room, a shadow bubbled up near his bed. From within rose a dark silhouette, clad in an ebon overcoat.</p>
<p>“Mantle of Illusions, Detach,” a muffled voice commanded.</p>
<p>The darkness enveloping the shade’s body came undone, and it was sucked into the shadows. A pair of small feet touched down on the floor.</p>
<p>“…My word. Keeping up that act does leave me feeling quite stiff.”</p>
<p>A ten-year-old boy sporting a school uniform had stepped out from that tall shadow. Standing in front of a full-length mirror, the child heaved a deep sigh. His face had handsome—if young and childish—features. His black hair was slightly unkempt and continually disobedient, and he wasn’t tall enough to eclipse even half the mirror.</p>
<p><a id="page-11"></a><em>When I look like this, I can’t conjure up even a lick of dignity and awe.</em> This unassuming appearance did lull his enemies into carelessness, though, and it was ideal for fitting into a crowd.</p>
<p><em>Regardless, I did manage to create a foothold toward the reformation of the Dark Lords’ Armies.</em></p>
<p>This boy, the Dark Lord Leonis Death Magnus, smirked in satisfaction. The Sovereign Wolves were an anti-imperial armed terrorist organization made up of demi-humans. A few days ago, they had lost their leader in a seajacking incident, leaving Leonis free to claim the group’s remnants for his own.</p>
<p>Their ranks included far more than just the physically capable beastmen. The Sovereign Wolves were made up of elves and lizardmen, too. Both were unique species possessing valuable traits. Leonis was confident they could be of use.</p>
<p>That said, they didn’t seem to have any direct involvement with the dark elf woman who had produced the Demon Swords, but Leonis decided he’d look into that matter separately.</p>
<p><em>Still…</em> Leonis took a terminal out of his pocket and eyed it reproachfully. <em>My minion is a bit too overprotective.</em></p>
<p>Sighing bitterly, he opened the door to the living room…</p>
<p>“Aaah! L-Leo?!”</p>
<p>…Only to find a girl standing there, clad in just her underwear. Shining silvery hair and skin as white as the virgin snow. Her hair was a bit damp, as she’d likely just got out of the shower. The young woman stood frozen, her hands still on the hook of her bra. Her face was steadily reddening by the second.</p>
<p>“Ah… I-I’m sorry!”</p>
<p>Leonis hurriedly squeezed his eyes shut and turned away, but the image of the girl’s plump breasts and lithe limbs had already been burned into his mind. The sound of shifting fabric filled his ears for some time, until eventually…</p>
