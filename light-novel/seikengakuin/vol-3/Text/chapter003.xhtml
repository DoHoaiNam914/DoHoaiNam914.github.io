<p><a id="page-13"></a>“…You can turn around now, Leo.”</p>
<p>Leonis did just that, fixing his gaze on the now fully clothed Riselia.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I must have surprised you,” Riselia apologized as she tied a hair ribbon. Her blue uniform complemented her pale skin tone perfectly.</p>
<p>“N-no, I should be the one apologizing…”</p>
<p>“Where were you, by the way? You weren’t in your room. I was looking for you.”</p>
<p>“Erm… I was out for some morning exercise…”</p>
<p>“Exercise?” Riselia pouted adorably. “I’d have come along if you’d said something.”</p>
<p>“I mean, we already have our daily training curriculum. So you shouldn’t overdo it!” Leonis shook his head.</p>
<p>Riselia’s recent growth was astounding. Not only did she possess fantastic intuition, but also a drive to improve. Training her was satisfying. However, she was also hardworking to the point of overexertion. Pushing one’s limits could lead to collapse.</p>
<p>In that regard, Leonis wished Riselia would be a bit more careful with herself. Even an undead vampire would grow exhausted if she was to deplete her mana.</p>
<p>“Are you all right, Lady Selia? I heard a scream,” Regina’s voice called from the corridor.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, I’m fine. It was just Leo,” Riselia replied hurriedly.</p>

<p class="noindent">“—I put a lot of effort into breakfast today,” Regina proudly proclaimed. She was wearing her usual maid uniform, and her hands rested confidently on her waist. “Eat up.”</p>
<p>Regina’s golden hair was tied up in pigtails, and her large, lively <a id="page-14"></a>eyes were a shade of green. If Riselia could be likened to the kind, gentle moon, Regina had the atmosphere of the bright sun.</p>
<p>“It looks great,” Riselia commented.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee. Today I made your favorite, Lady Selia! Fluffy pancakes.”</p>
<p>Sitting on the table was a batch of pancakes with lots of honey, a salad of fruit and vegetables, sunny-side-up eggs, yogurt, and coffee. Riselia usually handled breakfast, but two times a week, Regina came over to prepare it. According to Regina herself, making meals for Riselia kept her maid skills honed.</p>
<p>“After all, if I leave you to handle the food yourself, you’ll just end up eating military rations, Lady Selia.”</p>
<p>“I-I’ve been making breakfast every day recently!” Riselia shot back, her cheeks a bit rosy. “I mean, I’ve got Leo to look after, too.”</p>
<p>Riselia was a decent cook in her own right, but she was no match for a full-fledged maid like Regina.</p>
<p>“Want me to spoon-feed you, kid?” Regina asked Leonis with a smirk.</p>
<p>“I—I can eat just fine on my own, thank you!” Leonis snapped back, his heart skipping a beat. He carried a bite-size piece of a pancake to his lips. “…It really is good,” he praised with pleasant surprise as he chewed and swallowed the piece.</p>
<p>The texture was nice and soft, and the sweet taste of honey filled his mouth. Its surface was crunchy. It had been expertly prepared. Leonis always thought the human body and its dependence on food were a nuisance, but…</p>
<p><em>…This isn’t that bad</em>, the Dark Lord thought to himself, satisfied.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh. You’re so cute, kid. Makes it all worth it.”</p>
<p>“Leo, you need to eat some lettuce, too. We got it from the vegetable garden,” Riselia chided, shoveling some raw greens onto his plate. She seemed rather insistent.</p>
<p><a id="page-15"></a><em>She isn’t doing it to make my blood smoother, is she…?</em> Leonis had been suspecting as much for a while now.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Leo?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” Leonis replied evasively, bringing a mug of coffee to his lips.</p>
<p><em>…Coffee really is good in the mornings.</em></p>
<p>This beverage hadn’t existed a thousand years ago, but Leonis was growing fond of it. Its ebon color was like darkness made liquid. A fitting drink for a Dark Lord if there ever was one. Of course, it was too bitter straight, so Leonis added plenty of sugar to it.</p>
<p>“Is it just me, or have there been a lot of crows around our dorm recently?” Regina remarked, glancing out the window.</p>
<p>“R-really?” Riselia stuttered, a bit flustered. “Maybe it’s your imagination.”</p>
<p>“Should I drive them away?” Regina suggested, pantomiming the action of taking a shot with a gun.</p>
<p>“What? No! The poor things.”</p>
<p>“You’re too kind, Lady Selia. That’s what I like about you, though,” Regina appended with a wry smile and a shrug. “Still, people already call this dorm a haunted mansion. The birds aren’t going to help.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Leonis pressed.</p>
<p>“Yeah, there are rumors about some girl’s ghost and a large black dog walking around…”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s right! I actually saw the ghost girl this morning!” Riselia raised her voice after suddenly recalling the incident from earlier.</p>
<p>“You did?” Regina asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah. She was really cute, and she was dressed like a maid—”</p>
<p>“So, me?” Regina pointed at herself.</p>
<p>“No, she had short black hair. And she was cleaning Leo’s room.”</p>
<p><a id="page-16"></a>“…!” Leonis almost gagged on his coffee. “M-maybe your eyes were playing tricks on you!” he managed between coughs.</p>
<p>“…Yeah, maybe. She was gone the moment I blinked.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like you were still sleepy. Speaking of, I heard today we have a joint training session and a practice match?” Leonis was doing his best to pivot the topic of conversation to something else.</p>
<p>“Oh, right, this is your first time seeing a sparring session between different platoons.”</p>
<p>Practice matches were a central part of Excalibur Academy’s training program. They were usually held earlier in the year, but the Stampede in the Seventh Assault Garden several weeks ago had pushed back the school’s schedule.</p>
<p>“Our opponents this time are the eleventh platoon, from Fafnir dorm,” Regina told Leonis, showing him her terminal. “They’re a higher-ranked squad led by Fenris Edelritz.”</p>
<p>There was a picture of a girl projected on the device’s monitor. She looked like an affluent young lady. What’s more, Leonis recognized her. She was a student from the executive committee who had introduced herself to him during the party aboard the <em>Hyperion</em>.</p>
<p>“Erm, is there any point to having Holy Swordsmen fight each other?” The tactless question slipped from Leonis’s lips the second it crossed his mind.</p>
<p>Holy Swords were supposedly a power granted to the human race to fight the twisted creatures known as Voids.</p>
<p>“It’s said that Holy Swords competing against each other encourages their growth,” Riselia explained, holding up her index finger.</p>
<p>“Growth?”</p>
<p>“Yes. By clashing against each other, Holy Swords can change their forms.”</p>
<p>“My Drag Howl only had its cannon mode at first. It couldn’t shift into a pistol until later down the line,” Regina added.</p>
<p><a id="page-17"></a>“I see. So they do it to help the weapons mature…,” Leonis whispered to himself.</p>
<p>Holy Swords were a power granted by the planet, the tools that allowed humanity to strike back at the Voids. Their might was a fundamentally different sort than sorcery, which was based on the laws of nature. A thousand years ago, humans’ comparatively low mana capacities and weak physical capabilities had made them inferior to the elves and demi-humans. But in the end, it was humanity that survived the past millennia. They had endured and achieved a technological standard high enough to build these advanced Assault Gardens.</p>
<p><em>The evolution of Holy Swords. It’s as if the weapons are a manifestation of humankind’s strength as a species</em>, Leonis mused to himself.</p>
<p>“It’s also my first training match since I got my Holy Sword, so we have to give it our all!” Riselia proclaimed, pumping her fists. “If you get good grades during the training match, you get invited to the Holy Sword Blade Dance Festival at the capital.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Leonis asked, curious to hear more.</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s held once a year, and Holy Swordsmen are selected from every Assault Garden to participate in a celebration of swordsmanship. It’s pretty much out of reach for us, but…” Riselia trailed off.</p>
<p>“You never know,” Regina said. “You have a Holy Sword now, and we have the kid on our side, too.”</p>
<p>“You’re right.” Riselia nodded. “For now, let’s put our all into winning the sparring match today.”</p>
<p><em>…Hmm. The capital, eh? Not bad.</em></p>
<p>The capital. The first Assault Garden to be built and the central hub of the Integrated Empire. When the Dark Lords’ Armies rose again, Leonis planned to seize control of that city.</p>
<p><em>If we get selected to participate in this Holy Sword Blade Dance Festival, I could scout out the capital without drawing attention to myself.</em> Quite unlike Riselia’s pure excitement, it was malicious intent that brewed in Leonis’s heart.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dark-green light illuminated the half-circle-shaped space. At the center of the chamber, something undulated gently. The glow was coming from a mana furnace, a large, crystal-like apparatus capable of powering a massive Assault Garden.</p>
<p>The device gathered the mana flowing through underground ley lines and converted it into an enormous amount of energy—a crystallization of human wisdom. And sitting atop that container holding the mana furnace in place was something humanoid…</p>
<p>A beautiful girl. Her pale frame was completely exposed, and her long hair pulsed with light in time to the mana furnace’s flickering. Half her body was fused into the furnace, and countless cables were connected to her spinal cord, sharing the mana the immense machine supplied to the city.</p>
<p>The young woman’s eyes lacked the light of intelligence. Her hollow gaze simply stared into the dark.</p>
<p>“Yes, I see things are coming along nicely. Splendid.” An ill-fitting, cheerful voice resounded through the chamber.</p>
<p>A man appeared, the sound of his footsteps clicking against the floor. He was young and dressed in white, priestly attire. His hair was alabaster, and his blue eyes had a gentle glint to them. His mere presence made the place feel like some grand cathedral.</p>
<p>The young man looked up at the woman fused into the mana furnace and smiled.</p>
<p>“For now, it seems it’s a success. Well, we did offer up several hundred Demon Swords as a sacrifice. If it didn’t work, I’d be quite <a id="page-19"></a>livid with those old cultists.” He placed a hand on the shining mana furnace, the smirk still on his lips. “Soon, it will be time for you to awaken—our prophesized goddess.”</p>

<p class="noindent">Void habitats were at all times filled with a dense miasma. They were dark, polluted areas unsuitable for humans. It was from one such gloomy, repugnant place that <em>it</em> appeared. Sailing along the ocean’s surface was a titanic man-made structure—one of the final fortifications built to safeguard humanity from the apostles of emptiness.</p>
<p>It was a ruined city said to have been destroyed in the Stampede six years ago.</p>
