<p class="noindent"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">It was 16:00, Imperial Standard Time.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">All the survivors from the different schools participating in the Holy Sword Dance Festival had successfully evacuated from the Eighth Assault Garden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">Knights escorted them back to their lodgings. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">The Shangri-la Resort, where the eighteenth platoon was staying, opened its park as an evacuation zone for the capital’s civilians. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.4">The place was very much packed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">The knights had already cleaned up the smaller Voids rampaging through the streets, and there were no new ones appearing, but the general state was still one of confusion and chaos.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Not that I could fault anyone for feeling this way</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">, Leonis thought, gazing out the window in his room in the Golden Rafter Hotel.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">A massive tear in space had appeared over the Eighth Assault Garden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">Up until now, the Voids’ tears disappeared given time, but this rip lingered.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“Lord Magnus.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Leonis heard a voice behind him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">After turning around, he saw a large black wolf emerge from under the refrigerator.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-26"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">Leonis couldn’t help frowning. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">“Blackas, why are you coming out of there?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">Blackas Shadow Prince was a curse in animal form, but he never forgot the pride and elegance he carried while he was still a prince. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">Even if he was emerging from the shadows, coming out from under a refrigerator should have been beneath him…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">“My apologies for the rude intrusion, Lord Magnus, but this is an emergency.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">“An emergency?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">All of the shadow corridors built around the Seventh Assault Garden have been cut off.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“…I see,” Leonis said after contemplating this news for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“Do you have any idea what might have caused it?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">Blackas inquired, looking confused by Leonis’s composure.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">“I might.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">Leonis looked at the tear in the sky. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">“I can only speculate, but it’s probably due to that thing’s influence.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“The Void tear.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">I’ve been on the other side of that cleft.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“What?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Blackas’s ears twitched.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“Azra-Ael used the Azure Hold to travel between dimensions and was caught in—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">“Azra-Ael? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">The Devil of the Underworld has revived?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">Blackas cut him off.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“So it would appear.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">Leonis nodded, picked up a glass of juice, and sat down on a sofa. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">“It’ll be a long story, but I want you to listen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.4">Honestly, I need to sort this out for myself, too.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Blackas sat opposite the sofa.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“I joined forces with Veira to defeat the Lord of the Seas, Rivaiz Deep Sea. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">And soon after we did, he appeared on the battlefield, alongside the Azure Hold.”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-27"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Leonis recounted the recent events to Blackas.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Azra-Ael appeared in the form of Duke Crystalia, Riselia’s father, who was believed to have died on the Third Assault Garden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">Using the power of an unknown Holy Sword, he dominated Rivaiz’s mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">Later, in the midst of battle, he used the Azure Hold’s dimensional travel capabilities, and Leonis was pulled along for the ride.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“…Dimensional travel? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">The Dragon Lord’s flying fortress can manage such a feat?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">Blackas asked dubiously.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">“Yes, Veira herself was unaware of that power. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">She said the Azure Hold was discovered by the ancient dragon elders.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“Then it’s the same as Azra-Ael’s Otherworldly Castle?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">“In all likelihood… Regardless, I was caught in its dimensional travel and sent to another world.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Leonis took a vigorous sip from his glass.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“It was a land with a bloodred sky. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">A place where the Voids ran rampant.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“So those Void monsters are from that world you were flung to?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“I’m sure of that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">In that place, everything from the forests to the oceans was covered and polluted with Void miasma. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">What’s more, I found </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">him</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1"> there.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“Him?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“My teacher,” Leonis whispered in displeasure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">“The Swordmaster of the Six Heroes.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">The Void Lord, Shardark Shin Ignis.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">“When Shardark appeared in the Seventh Assault Garden, he emerged from a Void crack. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">His presence in that other world means it’s where the Voids come from.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">“I see.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">Blackas gazed over at the tear in the sky.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“I believe the reason this tear lingers is because the Seventh Assault Garden and the capital were dimensionally shifted.”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-28"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“So the shadow corridors are disconnected because of the jump to the Void World,” Blackas concluded.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“Probably…” Leonis nodded. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">“But for some reason, the dimensional shift is incomplete. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">Had it been fully successful, we wouldn’t be seeing this tear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.4">Instead, the area around the Imperial Capital would be swallowed up into the Void home world.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">Leonis didn’t know if this outcome was irregular or not.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“So if this is the result of an attempted dimensional shift, then why here?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Gates to other worlds didn’t open by coincidence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Someone must have done this intentionally. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">But how?</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">Was it through the power of Azra-Ael and the Azure Hold?</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Could the Devil of the Underworld have been involved in this?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">“We must investigate this tear further.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">Blackas got to his feet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">“I will go inspect it, then.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">“No, you stay here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">If this fissure is the aftereffect of a dimensional shift, it could be unstable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">You might end up trapped on the other side if the tear closes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.4">I’ll send a Shadow Demon to scout it out instead.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">No sooner had Leonis come to that decision than he heard the beep of a card key outside the room.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">“Leo, I’m back.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">“Miss Selia?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">Leonis raised his voice in flustered reply as Blackas dove into the shadows under the sofa.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">“Sorry, the report took longer than expected…,” Riselia said as she returned to the room and put her uniform jacket on the coat hanger.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-29"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">The captains of all squads that had participated in the Holy Sword Dance Festival were called to the knight headquarters in the Central Garden to report what had happened.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">“I got you the pudding you like on the way back, though.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">“Oh, thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">Leonis stood from the sofa and started brewing tea for both of them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">“They said the Holy Sword Dance Festival will be postponed until the situation is resolved. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">The administrative bureau ordered all the units in the capital to head to Excalibur Academy for the time being.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">Riselia took a seat after retrieving cups and utensils from a shelf.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">“Well, given the situation, the event being postponed doesn’t come as a surprise.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">Leonis nodded as he soaked tea leaves in the pot. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.3">“I’m sorry I didn’t make it back in time for the match. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.4">I promised.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">“No, don’t be. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">You’re back safe and sound, and that’s enough for me.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">Riselia reached out and touched Leonis’s cheek.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">“M-Miss Selia?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">“I was really…really worried about you.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">Riselia’s ice-blue eyes wavered with apparent concern.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">“It was only a few days…,” Leonis replied.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">“Nngh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">I—I mean, yes, but I was still worried!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.3">Riselia puffed up her cheeks adorably.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">And it was a very eventful few days, at that…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">Leonis fought the Lord of the Seas, Rivaiz Deep Sea, and then encountered Azra-Ael before being sent to the Void home world.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">Now, how do I tell her about that?</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1"> Leonis frowned to himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">He was conflicted over how to explain to Riselia that her father, Duke </span><a id="page-30"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Crystalia, was still alive. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">Worse yet, he was possessed by the Devil of the Underworld.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">“What’s wrong, Leo?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">Riselia inquired, sensing his hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">Leonis shook his head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">“Nothing.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">I shouldn’t tell her about that now.</span></em></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">The numbers showed that the mana furnaces were hardly functioning, which was to be expected. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.2">The Eighth Assault Garden was still halfway through its construction, thus the furnaces’ output was minimal, providing what little energy was required to host the Holy Sword Dance Festival.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">“So what of it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">“Please wait a bit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">Thirty minutes after the Holy Sword Dance Festival started…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">Alexios watched the screen, and suddenly, one mana furnace’s output spiked.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">“Don’t tell me that…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.2">The furnace’s dimensional shift mechanism activated.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">“…?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">Alexios swallowed nervously. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.2">Very few people knew this, but mana furnace cores used the remnants of what were known as gods in the ancient world, beings gathered from across the continents. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.3">This meant that different furnaces carried different powers based on the god used as a core.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">The Eighth Assault Garden’s mana furnace used the remnant of a devil capable of dimensional travel, granting the furnace limited dimensional shifting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.2">Of course, the top brass of the empire—the Sage Council—weren’t interested in using this to invade the Void home world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.3">Instead, they hoped to use this power to forcibly close Void tears.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-36"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">“Did the mana furnace react to the Voids’ presence and go out of control?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">“It’s possible, but honestly, I don’t know.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">Clauvia shook her head and shrugged. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.3">“I can only assume that, for whatever reason, the mana furnace’s dimensional shifting mechanism activated, causing part of the Void world to become exposed to our own. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.4">In other words…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">“If we activate the dimensional shifting mechanism again, we might close the tear?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">Clauvia nodded. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.2">“Theoretically speaking.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">“Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">I will propose it to the Sage Council.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.3">Alexios leaned against his chair’s backrest and stared up at the ceiling. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.4">“Still, there’s no guarantee that reigniting an unstable mana furnace will go well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.5">And it’s possible that Voids will invade again when we try.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">The capital wouldn’t survive an even larger Stampede.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">“Whatever our course of action, we need to speed up our plan.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">“You’re right…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">The D Project was the unofficial undertaking Alexios had inherited from his old friend Duke Crystalia. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">The plan was to suppress and harness the vast powers of the Dark Lords, who had once plunged the ancient world into terror, then wield those powers against the Voids via magical technology.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">That was the outline of the plan, and on secret orders from Alexios, Clauvia’s team was combing through ruins around the world, hoping to exhume the Dark Lords.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">Two months ago, they’d discovered the Dragon Lord sealed in the tundra. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.2">The Dragon Lord awakened, only to be corrupted by Voids and go berserk. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.3">As a result, the Dragon Lord was lost to them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.4">Regardless, the event proved that the Dark Lords existed, something even Alexios had half doubted.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-37"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">“Those that cast this world into chaos. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.2">To think that humanity must rely on them to survive…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">If they were to direct their power not at the Voids, but at mankind…</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">Then I’d be the greatest traitor to my species</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">, Alexios thought sardonically.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">“I have a report regarding the Dark Lords, by the way.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">“About the so-called Dark Lord Zol Vadis.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">The Dark Lord Zol Vadis was the leader of an anti-imperial activist organization on the Seventh Assault Garden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.2">He’d integrated countless smaller underground cells and was rapidly building up his faction.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">The research notes left behind by Duke Crystalia didn’t mention a Dark Lord called Zol Vadis, but the fact that this individual was aware the Dark Lords existed was puzzling.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">After all, all mention of the Dark Lords and Six Heroes had been wiped from the history books.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">Clauvia operated her terminal. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.2">“Look at this…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">The monitor switched to footage of the gigantic Void tear over the Eighth Assault Garden’s central sector, shortly after the Stampede began.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">“Was this recorded by the festival’s spectator drones?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.2">The drones near the site of the incident were destroyed when the Voids attacked, but a few stationed farther away managed to record footage.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">The video was quite low quality, likely due to the electrical disturbance caused by the Voids.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">“?!”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-38"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">While the footage played, Alexios swallowed nervously. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.2">His eyes were fixed on a figure clad in a skull mask who floated in midair. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.3">The figure brandished some kind of staff, eradicating buildings and disintegrating a swarm of Voids.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">“What is this…?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.2">Alexios whispered, staring at the monitor with rapt attention.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">“According to the reports, that’s the Dark Lord Zol Vadis.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">“Of course.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.2">Alexios nodded excitedly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.3">“I’d heard that man wears a skull mask.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">An incredible thought crossed his mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.2">What if the person in this footage, Zol Vadis, really was a Dark Lord battling the Voids?</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">When Leonis and Riselia entered the meeting room, Regina, who was standing in the kitchenette in her maid’s uniform, turned to face them.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">There was already one sandwich sitting on the kitchen tray. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.2">It looked quite tasty and was full of strawberries, kiwis, peaches, banana slices, and oranges, topped off with fresh whipped cream.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">“There’s time until dinner, so I thought these would make for a light snack during the meeting.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">“Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">Riselia saw that Regina wasn’t the only one to arrive before her and Leonis. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.2">Sakuya dozed on a sofa in the corner. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.3">She wore an eye mask.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">“She came over for a snack as soon as she returned to the hotel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.2">And after eating a whole bunch, she zonked out on the sofa…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">“I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.2">She really overused her Holy Sword’s power fighting the Voids. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.3">We should let her rest,” Riselia said, placing a coat over Sakuya.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">Leonis glanced at the sleeping girl. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">She must have used the mystic eye’s power.</span></em></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">“I’ll have juice…,” Riselia said.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">“With lots of sugar, right, kid?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.2">Regina nodded as she placed the fruit sandwiches on the meeting room table. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.3">Leonis picked one up and bit into it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.4">The soft bread and thick cream mixed with the sweet and moderate sourness of the fruit to form a harmony of flavors.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">“It’s been a while since I last had your sweets, Miss Regina. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.2">You really are a master at the craft,” Leonis praised her sincerely as he picked up a second sandwich.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">Leonis had eaten only military rations for the past few days. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.2">And while Rivaiz and Veira were satisfied with them, they hardly compared to Regina’s handiwork.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">“Not yet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.2">Probe-type Holy Swordsmen have set up a surveillance network around the tear, so if anything happens, they’ll report right away. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.3">But the problem is…” Elfiné’s expression turned severe as she spoke. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.4">“Apparently, there’s more than one fissure we have to worry about.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">“Huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.2">R-really?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.3">Regina questioned, surprised.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">“It’s true,” Riselia replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.2">“The administrative bureau’s report </span><a id="page-41"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">states that at least fourteen tears have been confirmed in the sea around the capital.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">“Seventeen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.2">They’re growing in number…,” Elfiné corrected grimly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.3">“They’re not as large as the one above the Eighth Assault Garden, but they’re still big enough for large-scale Voids to emerge. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.4">We’ll be sending in survey units to investigate those tears soon.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">“Survey units…,” Leonis whispered with a mixed expression.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">Any normal military unit will be wiped out.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">Leonis thought back to the superdreadnought-class aviating Void he saw in the other world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.2">Rivaiz had effortlessly tore it to bits, but that creature did survive one of Leonis’s eighth-order spells. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.3">If a Void of that class were to attack, mankind’s current forces would be helpless to stop it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">“It’s a dangerous mission, of course, but the empire’s council and the administrative bureau see this as a golden opportunity to decipher the secrets of the Voids’ territory. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.2">We’ve been on the defensive until now, but this might be our chance to go on the offensive.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">“Will we be included as a survey unit?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">“Students are not subject to the order. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.2">Not at present, at least.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">“Either way, the eighteenth platoon is to report back to Excalibur Academy for the time being. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.2">The administrative bureau has handed down the order.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.3">Riselia used her terminal to display the directive sent to her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.4">“We’re to pack our things tomorrow morning and move out.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">“And I was just getting used to the kitchen here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.2">What a shame…” Regina’s shoulders dropped in a show of disappointment.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">“Ahhh, how splendid. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.2">A once-fallen kingdom, revived under the mantle of a grand queen.”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-42"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1">The young, white-haired priest spread his arms in a great gesture as he praised the queen sitting on her throne.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">He was Nefakess Void Lord—the thirteenth apostle of the goddess.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">Standing silently behind him was a blue-haired girl, clad in the white garb of the Sakura Orchid. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.2">These two messengers were visiting the Shadow Castle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.3">This was the world beyond the Void cracks—the Nether Void. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.4">All the shadows that covered this forested area belonged to the queen.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">“I tire of your self-aggrandizing, priest,” the queen seated on the throne growled in displeasure.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">The Queen of the Realm of Shadows lacked a human form. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.2">She was an otherworldly mass of darkness that hovered over the throne. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.3">A set of eyes glared from the hovering shadow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.4">This was all that remained of the beauty who’d ruled the Realm of Shadows with tyranny and terror one thousand years ago.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">Behind the queen’s throne stood two girls clad in maid’s uniforms. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.2">Both were young, lovely maidens in appearance, but they weren’t human. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.3">They were a type of demon called shadowfolk, trained under the Septentrion organization to serve as assassins.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">“More importantly, I hear that your invasion plan failed.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.2">The queen’s voice rumbled through the room.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">“Indeed, we failed to manifest a complete Void Shift, but the overwriting did temporarily succeed,” Nefakess replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.2">“The tear we opened should serve well when our goddess sorties her advance guard.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">“Hmph. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.2">Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.3">I desire to reclaim the Realm of Shadows, the dominion usurped from me by that despicable black wolf.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1">The rage building in the Queen of Shadows made her two maids tremble slightly.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1">“Incidentally, priest,” the queen added. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.2">“Was it a Holy Swordsman who dispatched the ninth Apostle?”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-43"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">“We do not know who felled Lady Iris,” Nefakess replied, shaking his head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.2">“However, she was still a major commander in the Dark Lords’ Armies. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.3">While the humans may have grown significantly stronger with the power of the Holy Swords, I cannot imagine they would be able to defeat her.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">“Then who did it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.2">Was it the elf hero?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">“Arle Kirlesio? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.2">It’s hard to say. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.3">She does possess one of the Arc Seven, but when I fought her, she seemed to have lost much of her strength.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">“You can never know for certain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">She was disciple to the Swordmaster of the Six Heroes.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">“True. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.2">I can’t rule out the possibility, but…” Nefakess trailed off and dropped his voice to a whisper. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.3">“There is another who troubles me, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">“Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.2">Speak of them, then,” the queen said, seemingly interested.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">“The Dark Lord—Zol Vadis.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">“Zol Vadis?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.2">The queen repeated the name. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.3">“The Dark Lord of old, who fell to the Hero of the Holy Sword?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">That’s right.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.2">Nefakess nodded, his expression not changing one bit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.3">“Someone claiming to be a Dark Lord is hiding in the capital. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.4">It could be a pretender who’s usurped the title, of course, but no normal human knows the forgotten name Zol Vadis.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">“Indeed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.2">Fascinating. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.3">However, the prophecy of the goddess made no mention of the ancient Dark Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">“Quite true, Your Majesty. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.2">But there have already been multiple deviations from the prophecy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.3">The Dragon Lord Veira was exhumed by the humans before the time was right for her revival, and the Undead King was missing from the ruins of Necrozoa. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.4">And what’s more, the strongest Dark Lord, Rivaiz Deep Sea, has gone missing as well…”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-44"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">“If the goddess’s prophecy were flawless, the Void Shift would have been completed, and it wouldn’t be necessary to gather so many Demon Swords to awaken the one sealed in the Spirit Forest.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.2">The Queen of Shadows laughed cynically. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.3">“There’s no helping it now, I suppose. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.4">I’ve already built a firm bridgehead to that other world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.5">I will gather Demon Swords and go forth to strike down this Zol Vadis of yours.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">“Ohhh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.2">How encouraging.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.3">Nefakess bowed his head reverently.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">The Queen of Shadows’ eyes glinted in a mystical light, and an image formed with sorcery appeared in the center of the hall.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">“This is my kingdom’s bridgehead.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.2">The image depicted the well-maintained garden of a white building as magnificent and fair as a palace. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.3">“The heart of the capital, and the crucible of sacrifices, where Holy Swords gather…”</span></p>
