<p class="noindent"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“Lord Alexios, who do you intend to meet at a place like this?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">“I believe I told you not to ask.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">“Y-yes, m-my apologies. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">But still…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">“Listen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">No matter what happens here, I won’t hold you responsible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">You need only do your jobs as guards, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">The Seventh Assault Garden’s Area VI—the special demi-human protection ward. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">Three people were walking through the underground supply passage beneath it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">One was the emperor’s younger brother, Alexios, clad in a military uniform. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.4">The other two were Holy Swordsmen who served as his trusted bodyguards. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.5">All Alexios told his guards was that he would be negotiating with an underground organization.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">That a royal intended to converse with the leader of a clandestine organization felt impossible on its own. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">Who knows how Alexio’s guards might react if they heard they were marching to meet a potential Dark Lord?</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">I understand their suspicions, of course.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Alexios couldn’t very well beckon a Dark Lord to the palace, and using the Astral Garden ran the risk of the empire’s top brass </span><a id="page-64"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">learning of the exchange. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">A slight shiver ran through Alexios as he moved through the passage.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">Zol Vadis.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">Alexios had no doubts about the powers of this so-called Dark Lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">Alexios had used a broadcasting station he had influence over to add a message to the footage of the masked Dark Lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">Using the ancient text Duke Edward had researched, he requested an audience with the Dark Lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.4">Alexios had assumed that if this Zol Vadis was the genuine article, he’d send a response.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Sure enough, the answer came mere hours later, appearing above the capital. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">Ashen clouds covered the sky, producing a sudden downpour. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.3">Startled by a flash of lightning, Alexios looked out his window, and his eyes beheld a startling sight.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">Lightning ran across the hanging clouds, and Alexios instantly realized what this meant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">Bolts repeatedly flashed over the same spot, drawing ancient text over the canvas of the clouds.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">I accept your call to negotiations.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">The lightning then went on to specify the place of the meeting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">Evidently, the Dark Lord was capable of manipulating the weather. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">Zol Vadis clearly had powers that exceeded Alexios’s imagination. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.4">He felt cold sweat run down his forehead.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Depending on how the talk goes, I might not return alive.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">At worst, he could be killed on a whim. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">But if he managed to win this Dark Lord to his side…</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">He could become humanity’s hope in place of the Holy Swords.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">As the group continued through the dim corridor just barely illuminated by mana lamps, something happened. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">The shadows on the ground suddenly surged up.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“Your Grace, back away!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">one of the knights said, activating his Holy Sword.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">“Wait.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">Alexios raised his voice to stop him.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-65"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“Insolent lout.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Crack!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">A whip lashed out from the darkness, striking the Holy Sword and shattering it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">“What?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">The shadow slid over the floor like a black dress. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">A lovely girl dressed in a servant’s uniform emerged.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“A-a maid…?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">The three exchanged confused looks.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">“I am here on my lord’s behalf,” the girl in the maid’s uniform said dispassionately.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“I—I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">We apologize for any disrespect…,” Alexios replied, still astonished by the maid’s arrival.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">“I am here to greet you at the behest of my lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">My apologies, but we cannot welcome your two guards to the audience chamber.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">“Wh-what?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">one of the Holy Swordsmen cried. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">“We cannot consent to this!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“We’re His Grace’s royal guards!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“You are not permitted an audience with my lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">We ask that you vacate the premises…” The girl shrugged indifferently and snapped her fingers.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“Wh-what?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">M-my shadow, it’s…!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“My shadow is swallowing me up! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">Ahhh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">The pair were consumed by their own shadows.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“Wh-what did you do to them?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">Alexios asked, alarmed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“Rest assured, I did not kill them,” the maid replied carelessly before snapping her fingers again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">“Now then, welcome to the Dark Lord’s castle.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“What…?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Alexios looked down and realized he was sinking into his shadow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">“Ahhhhhhhhhhh!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">It felt as though he were drowning in mud… However, he collided with a cold, hard floor a moment later.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-66"></a><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">Wh-what just happened?</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“How long do you intend to keep your eyes closed?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">demanded an icy voice from above. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">“You are in the presence of a Dark Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">Alexios opened his eyes slowly.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“Ah…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">He was no longer in the underground passage, but a vast hall. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">Flickering candlesticks cast an eerie glow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">Engravings of strange creatures decorated the walls, and miasma hung about the place.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Wh-where am I…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">Was I transported here?!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">While surprised, Alexios’s sober mind worked to grasp the situation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">Did that maid use a Holy Sword ability? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">Or was it some kind of other power at play?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“Lower your head, human,” the maid commanded with a voice that struck terror into Alexios.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“…!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">This girl was no ordinary maid—she was an apex predator who wielded absolute power.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">“Raise your head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">I allow it,” another voice instructed from overhead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">The voice echoed eerily through the audience chamber.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">“…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">Alexios fearfully raised his head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">At the top of the staircase at the end of the chamber was a throne made of bones. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">A king in a skull mask sat upon it.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">The Dark Lord Zol Vadis</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">, Alexios thought, a shudder running through his body.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">“I permit you to speak your name, fearless human.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">The eyes behind the mask glinted red, and the air in the audience chamber trembled.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">Ahhh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">I really might die here…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">Intense regret gripped Alexios’s heart. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">Yet still, he was prepared.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-67"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">“It is an honor to meet you in the flesh, Your Majesty the Dark Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Alexios kneeled in a perfect display of aristocratic dignity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">His pride demanded he maintain appearances, at the very least.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">“I am the younger brother of the emperor of the Human Integrated Empire. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">My name is Alexios Ray O’ltriese.”</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">From behind his skull mask, Leonis gazed at the man like he was gauging his worth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">In truth, he knew him already. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.3">When Alexios appeared at the designated meeting spot with his two guards, Shary, who was lying in wait, identified him and sent Leonis simple documents about him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Leonis had Alexios and his guards walk around for a bit in the tunnels to confuse them and buy time so he could study his guest.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">That said, Shary’s intelligence consisted of data readily available to the public. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">Alexios was the younger brother to the current emperor, Alzeus Shida O’ltriese. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.3">Since he lacked a powerful Holy Sword, he’d chosen the path of a researcher.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">In the empire, royals without the power to fight the Voids were not given any genuine authority.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">His pedigree is fine, but the royal family sees him as a nuisance.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">Leonis was disappointed to learn of Alexios’s identity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">A trap would’ve made for a more interesting turn of events. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">Using ancient text to reach out to Leonis had made him suspect that the one responsible was a remnant of the Dark Lords’ Armies or some other survivor from a thousand years ago.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">But it’s just a mere human.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Still, this was interesting in its own way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">This man knew of the </span><a id="page-68"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">ancient text and the Dark Lords; that much was fact. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">And his connection to the current emperor meant that he might be privy to government secrets.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">“You may stand, Alexios.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">“My lord, that’s—” Shary spoke up, but Leonis raised a hand to silence her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">“It is fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">We are not equals, of course, but I will pay royalty their due respect.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">“Thank you, Your Majesty the Dark Lord.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">Alexios bowed his head deeply and rose slowly.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">He was a slender man with a well-featured face, but he certainly didn’t look like the kind to fight with a sword in his hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">However, his green eyes did contain a hint of tragic heroism.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">His pedigree means that he is technically Regina’s uncle.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1"> Leonis noted the color of the man’s eyes. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">I cannot treat him too cruelly, then.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Regina had aided Leonis more than a few times, after all.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">“Dark Lord, before I speak my business, I would like to present you with something,” Alexios said.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">“Oh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.3">Show me.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.4">Leonis nodded graciously. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.5">Alexios knew his manners.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">“This meeting was called on short notice and was kept secret, so I couldn’t prepare much, but please accept this precious token.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">Alexios carefully retrieved a small jewel box from his breast pocket.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">“Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">Shary, bring it over.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">“Yes…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">Shary took the jewel box and climbed up the stairs to deliver it to Leonis.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">“Is it a doughnut?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">she whispered.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">“Somehow, I doubt that…,” he replied quietly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">Upon opening the box, Leonis found a silver amulet inside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.3">“What is this?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">“It was excavated while digging through an ancient ruin. </span><a id="page-69"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Discovering such items in a nearly complete state is quite unusual, so it’s quite a precious part of my personal collection…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">Leonis toyed with the amulet while half listening to Alexios’s prattling explanation.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">A protective charm using a second-order spell. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">I suppose it’s valuable in its own way…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">To Leonis, this was nothing short of junk. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">His treasure vault in the Realm of Shadows held many magical tools with far greater power.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">“My Lord, this is tra—,” Shary began.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">“Silence, Shary. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">In this day and age, it carries great value.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.3">Leonis dropped the amulet into the shadow at his feet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.4">“I thank you for your wonderful gesture, Alexios.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">I trusted that you would appreciate it.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.3">Alexios bowed his head, looking somewhat pleased with himself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">Leonis cleared his throat behind the Zol Vadis mask.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">“All right, let us get down to business. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.2">First, there is something I wish to ask you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">“Wh-what is it, Your Majesty the Dark Lord?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">Alexios asked, his expression tense.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">“How did you come to know of the Dark Lords?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">Leonis questioned, his eyes glinting through the skull mask. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.3">“And where did you learn the ancient text? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.4">As far as I know, the knowledge of both has been lost to humanity.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">“If I may be so forward, Your Majesty, I am a researcher who has explored ancient ruins around the world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">The amulet I presented you earlier was discovered on one such expedition.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">“I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">Just like Riselia, then.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">“Risel…?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">Alexios asked, baffled.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">“Never mind, forget it.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">Leonis immediately retracted mention of his favorite minion’s name. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.3">“So you discovered evidence of the Dark Lords’ existence while investigating ancient structures?”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-70"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">The legends of the Dark Lords and Six Heroes had been lost to history, but when Leonis visited the ruins of Necrozoa, he did come upon surviving statues and carvings exalting his name. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">Riselia was able to read them, if only partially, and nearly found out he was a Dark Lord.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">“No, I knew of the Dark Lords before that,” Alexios said.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">“…What do you mean?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">Leonis asked, his eyes glinting again.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">“My old friend and former teacher researched the Dark Lords. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">He was an excellent Holy Swordsman and devoted his life to defending his land from the Voids, but he perished in the process. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.3">I inherited some of his research.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">“Hmm.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">The name of a certain man surfaced in Leonis’s mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.3">“Are you referring to Duke Edward Crystalia?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">“H-how did you know?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">Alexios asked, his eyes wide with alarm.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">“Fool. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">I am a Dark Lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.3">I know and see all!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.4">Leonis snapped at him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">Alexios flinched in fear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">“O-of course… I beg your pardon!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">Leonis smirked behind his mask. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">It was only by coincidence that he knew Duke Crystalia studied the Dark Lords, but bluffing about it worked in his favor.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">“Very well, you are forgiven. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">I understand now how you know of the ancient Dark Lords. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.3">Did you seek me out of mere curiosity, then?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">“O-of course not, Your Majesty the Dark Lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">I come to you on behalf of all humanity to ask for your…for the help of Zol Vadis!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">“Oh?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">Leonis laughed, amused. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.3">“You think I would wield my mighty powers for mere humans?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">Leonis let his aura of death show ever so slightly.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">“?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">Alexios shivered and nearly collapsed to his knees, yet he managed to hold his ground and continue speaking. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.3">“H-humanity </span><a id="page-71"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">suffers under an unprecedented threat—Voids. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">In the sixty-four years since the Void invasion began, we have made countless sacrifices to secure safe havens for ourselves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.3">And now, the power of the Holy Swords alone is not enough to oppose our enemy.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.4">Alexios raised his voice as he spoke, so as to not be overwhelmed by the Dark Lord’s presence.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">I may be going easy on him, but it is still commendable that he remains on his feet despite my power.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">Leonis was impressed with the man. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">Despite his scrawny frame, he had grit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.3">Leonis continued questioning him, though.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">“How familiar are you with the Dark Lords?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">“Th-the Dark Lords are…erm, enemies of humankind that cast the world into ruin and chaos… Or so Edward’s research notes claimed…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">“Correct. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">And I am one such Dark Lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.3">What reason would I have to help you humans, then?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">“B-because the Voids are a threat to you, as well!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">Alexios declared, shaking off his fear.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">Leonis made a pensive gesture. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">“You humans truly are greedy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.3">In the name of survival, you would seek the powers of the Dark Lords that sought to destroy your world?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.4">Leonis laughed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.5">“First, you beseeched the heroes for help, and now, you cling to the Dark Lords?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">Memories of his time as the Hero of the Holy Sword, Leonis Shealto, crossed his mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">One thousand years ago, Leonis was a member of the Six Heroes and dispatched the Dark Lord Zol Vadis. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.3">But after that, he was seen as an obstacle to humanity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.4">Leonis was betrayed and left for dead.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">And now, after all that, humankind prostrated before Leonis, in his Dark Lord form, begging for aid.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">“Your Majesty, I—”</span></p>

<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">The time is right…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">Alexios’s face was swiftly losing its color; if Leonis continued projecting his aura of death, the man would faint.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">“Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">I will lend you my strength, courageous human.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">Alexios looked up at the throne fearfully. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.2">“?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.3">D-do you mean it…Your Majesty?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">“Depending on what you will give up in return, of course,” Leonis added, nodding grandly.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">Alexios’s plea hadn’t moved him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.2">The Voids were an obstacle to the restoration of the Dark Lords’ Armies and a threat to the Seventh Assault Garden, which belonged to Leonis. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.3">Destroying them was a top priority regardless of this man’s wants. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.4">Plus, he needed to dispose of the conspirators behind the Void attacks, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.5">Naturally, Leonis had no intention of sharing that with Alexios.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">At best, I’ll use you like pawns.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1"> Leonis cackled, the eyes of his skull mask igniting with crimson fire.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">“Hmm, yes… First, I demand information.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">“Information?”</span></p>
