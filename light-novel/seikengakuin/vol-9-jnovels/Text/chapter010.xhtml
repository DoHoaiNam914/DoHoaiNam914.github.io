<p class="noindent"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“Dark Lord, what I am about to tell you is a guarded secret of the Integrated Empire,” Alexios began.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">“Yes, I imagine it is.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">“Please keep this secret to yourself—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">“I know.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">Leonis glanced at Shary beside him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">“This maid is my faithful right hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">She will not speak of this without my express permission.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Though she may squander her money on sweets regardless of what I tell her.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">“Yes, understood.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">Alexios lowered his head solemnly.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“Then let us begin with an explanation of this unnatural magical technology.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“Yes, Your Majesty. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">The rapid advance of magical technology and the power of the Holy Swords are intrinsically linked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">Would you permit me to explain a portion of human history that remains undisclosed to this day?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">Leonis nodded, bidding the man continue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">Alexios took a deep breath to calm himself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">“The first essential piece begins seven hundred years ago. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">The </span><a id="page-76"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">era predating that period is called the Dark History, as we only know vague facts about that era from the ruins we’ve uncovered.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">“Seven hundred years ago…,” Leonis whispered under his mask.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">The oldest books Leonis could find in Excalibur Academy’s library only went back two centuries. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">He couldn’t find any that spoke of times older than that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“What happened seven hundred years ago?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“No one knows for certain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">However, we can only trace our history back seven hundred years. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">It’s possible something happened at that time that set the age that followed in motion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.4">It’s like some destructive calamity that defies imagination occurred, wiping away all previous history…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Whether the ground split or the stars rained down from the heavens, the cataclysm that befell the world after Leonis’s sealing destroyed all life, wiping away the legends of the Six Heroes, the Dark Lords, and countless gods.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“Two centuries after that event, the surviving remnants of humanity began to rebuild civilization and lived in city-states. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">One hundred years later, the Odain Kingdom, which would later form the heart of the Human Integrated Empire, was established from three predecessor kingdoms—Kaimaru, O’ltriese, and Reinbelle.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“The ancestors of the current three royal houses.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“Correct, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“And the O’ltriese bloodline is, if I recall, capable of communicating with spirits.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">“You are well informed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">The lineages of the three royal houses are said to be descended from ancient priestesses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">I, too, bear this power, yet it seems to be weaker among male descendants, for some reason.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“Yes, that stands to reason. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">Even in my time, the most powerful spirit users were princess priestesses,” Leonis remarked.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-77"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Alexios swallowed nervously. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">Perhaps it only just struck him that he was speaking to someone from a thousand years ago.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“Let’s return to the topic at hand,” Leonis said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">“Did humanity’s magical technology emerge with the creation of the Odain Kingdom?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">“No, the people of that period still lived in stonework cities and employed mana through a technique called sorcery.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">Then your society at the time wasn’t much different from my era.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“Shortly after that, countless nations formed on the continent, leading to an age of warfare. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">The next major change took place two hundred years ago. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">All across the world, people began hearing the voice of the planet.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">“The voice of the planet?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">Leonis repeated the words, baffled.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“Strangers appeared in every corner of the world, speaking prophecies and claiming they were chosen by the planet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">At first, those who heard the planet’s voice were either worshipped or considered mad and persecuted by their countries. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">However, people quickly realized that those who heard the voice of the planet were able to manifest a strange, supernatural power.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">“A supernatural power? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">You mean…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">That power was the true identity of what we now refer to as Holy Swords.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“That differs from the story I’ve heard,” Leonis said, fascinated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">“I thought the Holy Swords first manifested sixty-four years ago, when the Voids invaded.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“That’s true, in a manner of speaking, Your Majesty. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">The Holy Swords of those who first heard the voice of the planet were trifling in strength compared to what Holy Swordsmen today wield. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">They didn’t take the form of weapons at all.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“So, originally, their power wasn’t significant enough to be dubbed Holy Swords.”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-78"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Alexios nodded. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">“Precisely. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">As the years passed by, the gifted individuals who heard the planet’s voice grew in number. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.4">And then, one day, all the gifted ones across the continent heard the same words.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">According to records, that was the day the red Star of Calamity appeared in the sky. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">The voice echoed in the gifted people’s minds in the form of a prophecy.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“Within the next two centuries, a threat to mankind will appear and destroy the world.”</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Leonis’s eyes widened behind his mask. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">“Are you saying…the advent of the Voids was foretold?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“…Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">And at the same, some of the gifted found that a vast amount of unknown knowledge flowed into their minds.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">“Unknown knowledge…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">“That information was the foundational theory that led to the sudden development of magical technology. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">Vast wisdom that would normally take us centuries, if not millennia, to accumulate was suddenly bequeathed to humankind…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">And with that knowledge, humanity’s magical technology progressed at an explosive rate. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">While it did, the sages of the old kingdom began the Assault Garden project to prepare for the arrival of the future threat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">They produced mana furnaces, causing an industrial revolution that relied on magical technology, and set up defensive installations.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“What’s more, upon realizing that the powers of the gifted passed onto offspring, nations formed blood ties between those blessed to cultivate and strengthen their abilities. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">That was how the Holy Swordsmen you know today came to be.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“And that explains why the nobility produce so many children who manifest Holy Swords…” Leonis nodded.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-79"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">Many Holy Swordsmen were created because of how their bloodlines were managed during past generations.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“And then, sixty-four years ago, the Void invasion began, and the strength of the Holy Swords awakened.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">Alexios’s voice echoed through the audience chamber. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">“And you know what followed, Your Majesty. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.4">The Voids appeared, and in response, the rate with which people awakened to the power of the Holy Swords increased exponentially. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.5">The war with the Voids continued, and now, humankind stands on the brink of extinction…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">Alexios looked at Leonis, seated on his throne, and concluded his story.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“And that is everything I know.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">After a long silence, Leonis finally replied, “Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">It seems you told me the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">“…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">Leonis reached into his jet-black robe and took out a shining crystal skull.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">“This is an ancient magical apparatus that reacts to lies by laughing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">You were wise to speak honestly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">Had you told me a single lie, I would have made you a part of my throne.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">“…?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">“Your information was very enlightening. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">You have my gratitude.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">“Thank you.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">Alexios fell prostrate, sweating profusely.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">The Voids’ true nature, the cataclysm that ravaged the world over seven hundred years ago, and the mystery of the planet’s voice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">This man didn’t hold the answers to those questions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.3">Leonis nodded in satisfaction and rose from his throne.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">“Alexios, younger brother of the emperor. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">I believe you and I will make fine allies.”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-80"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">Alexios raised his head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">“So you mean…?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">“The Voids are a nuisance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">I care little for humanity’s continued existence, but depending on the price you are willing to play, the great Dark Lord will lend you his considerable strength.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">“Th-thank you!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">Alexios fell prostrate again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.3">“I will give you anything I can provide!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">“Hmm, in that case…” Leonis placed a hand on his chin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">“For the time being, I must demand equipment and a war chest for the Dark Lords’ Armies. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.3">Also, the yielding of territory.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">“T-territory?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">Your cities are marvelous realizations of your magical technology.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">“Y-you’re not asking me to give you an Assault Garden, are you?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">“Worry not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">I’m not asking you to hand over Camelot. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.3">You have an uninhabited city destroyed by the Voids, do you not?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">“You’re requesting the Eighth Assault Garden?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">Alexios asked, flabbergasted.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">“The Ninth Assault Garden, which is currently under construction, is also an acceptable choice.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">“I—I can’t… No, that’s an impossible demand, Your Majesty. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">I lack the authority to approve that…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">“I was joking.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">Leonis chuckled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.3">“If I desired those cities, I could simply take them whenever I please.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">“…!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">Alexios gritted his teeth.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">Elfiné faced Finzel, the muzzle of her Ray Hawk still pointed at him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">Her sleek black hair fluttered in the ocean breeze.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">“What are you doing here, Elfiné?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.2">Finzel didn’t seem terribly surprised.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">His voice came across as almost casual. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.2">It had been years since Elfiné last saw her brother’s face up close. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.3">She hadn’t met him since her admittance to Excalibur Academy, when she left Count Phillet’s domain on the Fourth Assault Garden.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">“That tear…,” Elfiné muttered.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">“At the army’s request, I was using my Holy Sword to observe the Void tear,” Elfiné explained coldly.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">Two Eye of the Witch orbs floated around her like sentries. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">“And in the process, I spotted you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.3">What are you doing here?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">“Oh, just looking for something.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">“Looking for something? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.2">In a place that’s off-limits to nonmilitary personnel?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.3">Elfiné questioned, holding up an investigation warrant issued by the Imperial Knights.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">“What are you trying to say?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">Finzel replied curtly.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">“I know you’re involved in the D Project, Finzel.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">“…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">“It was originally a plan spearheaded by the military to combat the Voids. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.2">The goal was to make Holy Swords even more powerful by forcing them to go out of control.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.3">Elfiné took a step closer, the Ray Hawk still in her grip. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.4">“But the plan failed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.5">There’s no </span><a id="page-87"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">controlling the Holy Swords in that state, and some of their wielders exhibited signs of turning into Voids. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">As a result, the dangerous Demon Sword project was suspended indefinitely, never to see the light of day again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.3">That’s how it should have been anyway…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">“…But someone resurrected the project.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.2">Finzel’s lips curled up into a smirk.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">“…!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">“You’re talented, Elfiné. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">I can see why Father tried to groom you to be his successor.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.3">He clapped his hands in sarcastic praise.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">“Finzel, you…” Elfiné glared at the man. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">“You used that Sakura Orchid mercenary group for your experiments, tried to awaken Demon Swords at Excalibur Academy using an Artificial Elemental, and made Academia’s students into your test subjects, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">Elfiné had no decisive proof about any of those isolated incidents, but she knew that more people would be hurt if she didn’t stop her brother. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.2">Finzel Phillet received the accusations with a vexed click of the tongue.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">“Perhaps I’ve been a bit careless with my operations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.2">Had things only gone according to plan, the capital would be overrun with Voids by now.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">“What are you after, Finzel?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">Elfiné concentrated mana in the Ray Hawk. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.3">Liat’s face flashed in her mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.4">Elfiné had once been a member of the seventh platoon under Liat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.5">He’d sought the power to protect others, only for his soul to be corrupted by the power of a Demon Sword…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">“Ha-ha. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.2">Can you really shoot me?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">“I’m not a very good shot, but the Eye of the Witch supports my aim.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">“That’s not what I mean. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.2">Can you do this to your brother, your own flesh and blood?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">“I can. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.2">I won’t let you cause any more sacrifices.”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-88"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">A gunshot rang out, and a bullet of compressed mana was propelled from the Ray Hawk, puncturing Finzel’s shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">“Nng! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.2">Ahhh… Ahhhhhhhhh!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.3">Finzel staggered and fell to his knees.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">But the next moment, something unbelievable occurred. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.2">Black miasma spewed from the wound on his shoulder in place of blood.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">“…What?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">“Ahhhhh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.2">Ahhhhhhhh■■■■■■—”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">Squelch, squelch, squelch, squelch.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">Finzel’s body underwent a horrifying transformation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.2">His suit was torn up, and the flesh in his back swelled from the inside out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.3">His limbs grew and writhed in inconsistent sizes, as if each one were a different creature.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">“A Demon Sword?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.2">No, this is…a Void?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">“■■■■■■…!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.2">The oversized monster released an inhuman howl.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">Fragments of rubble shot out in a radial pattern, tearing through Elfiné’s uniform.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">“…Have you submitted to a Demon Sword’s power, Finzel?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">Elfiné aimed for Finzel’s head and shot. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.2">But the luminous bullet of mana was deflected by his hardened skin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.3">Normal weaponry was ineffective against Voids.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">“…?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">“Elfiné, you’ve always been beautiful. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.2">But…” Finzel smirked in Void form. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.3">“Don’t you think this body is much more appealing?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">He brought down his massive arm with a force that far exceeded anything a human was capable of.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">Screeeeeeeech…!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">The gigantic limb was deflected right as it seemed it would collide with Elfiné. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.2">The Eye of the Witch deployed a shield around her without being given an order, acting on its auto-guard capabilities.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-89"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">“What a wonderful Holy Sword. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">I wish I had one as strong as yours, toooooo!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.3">Finzel howled and kicked off the asphalt, charging for his sister.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">“Holy Sword, Mode Shift—Vorpal Ray!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">The two Eye of the Witch orbs released a blinding glow, producing a radiance around the pair of spheres.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">Screeeech!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">A beam blew off the Void’s arm and destroyed its head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">Elfiné couldn’t hold back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.3">Now that he’d relinquished his humanity and sold his soul to the emptiness, she could spare him no pity.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">However…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">“You’d never understand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">You were blessed by the Holy Swords!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">Intense miasma spewed from Finzel’s wound, and a snakelike head grew out of the remains of his arm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">Finzel’s transformed face surfaced on his chest.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">Monster! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.2">A Demon Sword can really transform someone this much?</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1"> Elfiné fired the Vorpal Ray again, but Finzel jumped away and climbed up to the rooftop of a warehouse.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">Hisssss!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">He whipped his snakelike arm like a lash at Elfiné, who reflexively summoned a third orb to deploy a shield. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.2">The serpent appendage was deflected and struck the warehouse wall, creating a shower of rubble.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">…Oh no!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">Their clash kicked up a cloud of dust. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.2">Elfiné sprinted through the cloud, blinded and holding her breath. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.3">She could only manifest up to eight orbs, but five of them were scanning and guarding the Void tear at the army’s request. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.4">Recalling them required time, and dismissing a manifested Holy Sword only to activate it again immediately consumed a great deal of stamina.</span></p>
