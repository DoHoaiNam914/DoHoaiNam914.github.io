<p class="noindent">“…It’s no use. I can’t get in touch with her at all.” Elfiné shook her head, touching the earring-type communication terminal.</p>
<p>“Maybe she’s fighting another unit…?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s what her terminal readout suggests. As best I can tell, she hasn’t been eliminated.”</p>
<p>“It’s Sakuya. She’ll be fine,” Regina assured her.</p>
<p>Riselia nodded. “R-right. Sakuya can handle herself.” Although she was worried about her friend, Riselia trusted Sakuya.</p>
<p>After eliminating the two Military Instruction School Holy Swordsmen, the eighteenth platoon took the elevator to the second underground level.</p>
<p>“There it is. A core flag,” Elfiné said. The Eye of the Witch orb floating in front of her as she led the others down the passage cast its light on a toolbox set on the wall.</p>
<p>Riselia entered their unit code into the toolbox, and it opened, revealing a jewel-shaped object. This was a typical core flag, normally used in practice matches between students.</p>
<p>“And that’s our first one. We did it!” Riselia poked it with her finger, and after it read her fingerprint and mana pattern, a point was added to the eighteenth platoon’s terminals. “This is where the <a id="page-130"></a>tough part begins. We have to protect this core flag.” She tucked the jewel into a pocket of her uniform.</p>
<p>If another group stole the core flag, the eighteenth platoon would lose half of their accumulated score. In addition to the point from the flag, their terminals also recorded the points they’d received for defeating two Military Instruction School members. Beating Kaiser, the unit’s ace, earned more than the other opponent.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s take the elevator to the surface,” Riselia decided.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m worried about Sakuya, too…,” Elfiné replied.</p>
<p>It would be harder for other units to discover them if they remained underground, but they’d be overtaken in the race to gain all the core flags. Besides, the Holy Sword Dance Festival was more than just a sports tournament. It was a celebration of the Holy Swordsmen, where each school’s representatives competed for their institute’s pride. They didn’t want to tarnish Excalibur Academy’s dignity before countless viewers.</p>
<p>When the eighteenth platoon tried to return to the elevator, Leonis, who’d been mostly silent today, whispered, “Something’s coming.”</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p><em>Clang, clang…</em></p>
<p>The sounds of shrill, metallic footsteps approached rapidly. Red lights illuminated the dark hall.</p>
<p>“Void Simulators?!” Riselia exclaimed, shocked.</p>
<p>“Is it the guy from earlier again?! You should learn when to give up!” Regina fired her Drag Striker, accurately shooting through one machine’s segmented leg joint.</p>
<p>The Metahalcum crab-like robot collapsed on the spot, sparks issuing from its internal mechanisms. However, the construct was an anti-Void weapon. Losing a single leg wasn’t enough to stop it. It rose again and charged unsteadily.</p>
<p>“…Tch, the elevator’s no good. Let’s intercept them in the open <a id="page-131"></a>space out back,” Riselia instructed. “Regina and I will guard the back. Miss Finé, Leo, you two go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Understood. Leo, come with me.” Elfiné pulled Leonis by the arm and ran off.</p>
<p>The Void Simulators weren’t much of a threat, but there were too many of them. Anyone who could control so many simultaneously had a top-rate Holy Sword.</p>
<p>The eighteenth platoon fell back toward an open chamber.</p>
<p>“Let’s clear them out here!” Riselia raised the Bloody Sword.</p>
<p>Typically, funneling enemies into a narrow passage was the superior strategy, but this area would make using large-scale destructive techniques more feasible.</p>
<p>A loud thud issued from behind Riselia.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Riselia and Regina turned around in time to see a partition at the end of the hall close.</p>
<p>“…Miss Finé?!”</p>
<p>No sooner had Riselia called out…</p>
<p><em>Brr, brr, brrrrrrrrrrrrrr…</em></p>
<p>…than the ground began to ascend with a loud noise.</p>
<p>“…Lady Selia! This whole place is an elevator for loading supplies!” Regina said, tapping on a nearby control panel with no success.</p>
<p>Riselia bit her lip. The Military Instruction School’s Holy Swordsman had chased them here using the Void Simulators then sealed off Elfiné using the partition.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Take that!”</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Take that!”</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“That’s for my friends!”</span></strong></p>
<p>The Void Simulators spoke with mechanical voices.</p>
<p>“Wh-why, youuuuu!” Riselia launched a blade of blood that destroyed a Void Simulator’s legs.</p>
<p><a id="page-132"></a><strong><span class="special">“…lia—Selia, are you all right?”</span></strong> Elfiné’s garbled voice came through Riselia’s earring device.</p>
<p>“Yes, we’re fine. How are things on your side?”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“A wall blocked the way, but I opened it with the Eye of the Witch. I guess this was a trap… Or maybe it’s better to call it a revenge prank.”</span></strong></p>
<p>The elevator carrying Riselia and Regina continued its steady ascent.</p>
<p>“Miss Finé, at this rate, we’ll end up on the surface,” Regina explained.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Understood. Leo and I will head topside, too. Let’s regroup at Point F.”</span></strong></p>
<p>“Roger.”</p>

<p class="space-break">“Hahhhhh!”</p>
<p>Sakuya sprinted across the ground, blue lightning crackling under her feet. This was Thunderclap—the peak of her Holy Sword’s acceleration power. Each time her sword cut through the air, sparking with pale lightning, a Demon Swordsman fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Her amber-colored left eye shone, allowing her to perceive potential outcomes several seconds before they occurred.</p>
<p>Sakuya could even see seven possibilities at once, using that information to evade fatal outcomes, selecting futures where she defeated her opponents. Merely possessing the mystic eye’s power wasn’t enough to accomplish this. Instantly knowing which possible result to choose and responding accordingly was a feat beyond a normal swordfighter.</p>
<p>“■■■■■■…!”</p>
<p>The Academia squad’s Demon Swords let out nondescript howls. Their blades, shaped like disgusting tentacles, twisted like <a id="page-133"></a>whips to lash at Sakuya. The weapons snapped at her like hungry beasts.</p>
<p>“Too slow. Slow enough for a fly to land on you.”</p>
<p>Switching to a one-handed grip, Sakuya pushed herself to move even faster. Cutting down the writhing Demon Swords one by one, she bolted at the Demon Swordsmen directly. The world appeared to stand still around her. Sakuya’s perception of time was accelerating.</p>
<p><em>Is this part of the mystic eye’s power?</em></p>
<p>The mystic eye of time was the perfect companion to Sakuya’s Holy Sword. Had the Dark Lord Zol Vadis known of Sakuya’s Raikirimaru and its abilities?</p>
<p>Several future possibilities converged into one, sealing fate into certainty.</p>
<p>“Mikagami-style swordsmanship—Levin Slash!”</p>
<p>Sakuya mercilessly cut down a Demon Swordsman.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Burning pain shot through her eyeball.</p>
<p><em>Forty seconds—any more than that and it’ll be too much for me…</em></p>
<p>Sakuya jumped back, cutting down the tentacle-like Demon Swords swiping at her from all directions. The amber glow left her eye, which returned to its natural blue color. Perhaps noticing this change, the remaining three Demon Swordsmen charged her.</p>
<p>“■■■■■■…!”</p>
<p>The tentacled Demon Swords fused directly with their owners’ arms, moving independently.</p>
<p>“…I see. You’ve completely discarded your humanity,” Sakuya whispered sorrowfully. She gripped Raikirimaru tightly with both hands. “Mikagami-style swordsmanship—Thundering Lightning Slash!”</p>
<p>A tremendous crash accompanied the stroke that cleaved through a tentacle and arm.</p>
<p><a id="page-134"></a><em>That’s the third…!</em></p>
<p>Sakuya transitioned seamlessly into her next attack, felling another Demon Sword behind her, and moving quickly to her next target. As she fought, Sakuya felt an unusual presence and looked up.</p>
<p>“…What?!” Her legs froze up in shock.</p>
<p>A fissure ran through the sky above the Eighth Assault Garden. Cracks formed in reality heralded the arrival of Voids, but this fissure was undeniably different. The air opened wide, like an eye, revealing a world of red.</p>
<p>This irregular tear seemed to peer down at Sakuya without blinking.</p>
<p><em>No, is that?!</em></p>
<p>The very same rip in space had appeared over the Sakura Orchid nine years ago.</p>
<p>“■■■■■! ■■■■■■…!”</p>
<p>The now monstrous Demon Swordsmen howled together. Tentacles shot through the walls of nearby buildings. The monstrous people were evidently content to ignore Sakuya, leaping from wall to wall toward the Central Garden, directly beneath the tear.</p>
<p>“Wait!”</p>
<p>Sakuya immediately activated Thunderclap to pursue.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p><em>Crack, crack, crack…!</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, multiple fissures formed around her, and repulsive creatures tore through.</p>
<p>“…Voids!”</p>

<p class="space-break">The large elevator carrying Riselia and Regina slowed to a stop as it reached the surface. Sunlight washed over the pair, forcing Riselia to squint.</p>
<p><a id="page-135"></a>“This looks like a storage sector.” Regina examined the area cautiously with the Drag Striker in hand.</p>
<p>Box-shaped structures dotted their surroundings.</p>
<p>“We need to regroup with Elfiné and Leo.”</p>
<p>“Our rendezvous spot is… Huh?” Regina stared at her terminal in disbelief, then swallowed hard.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Regina?” Riselia asked.</p>
<p>“Three core flags are moving to this point.”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>That meant a unit that had already collected core flags was on the move. To have gathered three so soon after the event began meant it was a powerful squad.</p>
<p>“Lady Selia, you don’t think—?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’ve got a bad feeling about this.”</p>
<p>“Th-the final boss has already arrived.”</p>
<p>Riselia and Regina exchanged looks, beads of cold sweat on their foreheads. This was bad. If their terminals detected the approaching core flags, that meant the enemy unit had surely noticed the one Riselia was carrying.</p>
<p>“They’re definitely coming this way.”</p>
<p>“Let’s run for now!”</p>
<p>“Right!”</p>
<p>There was no telling how many people were approaching, but Riselia and Regina doubted they’d be able to handle it on their own. They had to flee beyond the opposing squad’s detection range, but…</p>
<p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>
<p>…a rippling sound raced over their heads. A giant warehouse had been slashed through diagonally.</p>
<p>“…What?!”</p>
<p><em>Vrrrrr! Crrrrraaashhh!</em></p>
<p>The top half of the structure slid over, collapsing to the ground <a id="page-136"></a>with a great tremor. A cloud of dust rose into the air. The edifice that had stood between the two girls and the approaching threat was gone.</p>
<p>“Lady Selia! That Holy Sword! It’s definitely—!”</p>
<p>“I know…”</p>
<p>Riselia spun around, coughing from the dust. She spied a figure approaching from beyond the cloud. A girl in military attire approached slowly, carrying a broadsword-type Holy Sword.</p>
<p>The third princess of the Human Integrated Empire—Chatres Ray O’ltriese. Her dignified jade eyes beheld Riselia and Regina coldly.</p>
<p>“So this is where you’ve been hiding, Riselia Crystalia. You’ve saved me the trouble of heading underground.”</p>
<p>“Er…Lady Chatres, have I done something to offend you?” Riselia asked nervously.</p>
<p>Chatres shook her head. “No, I bear no ill will toward you. This is a personal issue. Foolish reporters have been hounding me for days, asking my thoughts on Riselia Crystalia and whether I see you as a rival. They even got in the way of my precious time with Altiria. It was truly irritating.”</p>
<p>“So you’re…venting your anger on me?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Allow me to apologize before we begin. I really want to blow off some steam.”</p>
<p>Chatres stopped in her tracks and raised her Holy Sword slowly.</p>
<p>“I will now proceed to overpower you. No one will obnoxiously compare us ever again.”</p>
<p>“Sorry about my big sister, Lady Selia,” Regina whispered.</p>
<p>“I doubt she’ll let us escape.” Riselia steeled herself and readied the Bloody Sword. “Regina, keep an eye out for any enemy snipers.”</p>
<p>“You got it.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need,” Chatres stated. “My subordinates are not here.”</p>
<p><a id="page-137"></a>“You came alone, Lady Chatres?”</p>
<p>“Of course. What would be the point of beating you if I had help? The members of the first platoon are keeping watch nearby, so neither they nor anyone else interferes.”</p>
<p>It didn’t sound like a lie, and Chatres Ray O’ltriese wasn’t the kind who resorted to deception. She’d carried three core flags to bait Riselia out of hiding.</p>
<p><em>Still, this might be a good opportunity.</em></p>
<p>Riselia glared straight at Chatres. Defeating the strongest, most famous Holy Swordswoman would mean all those core flags, pushing the eighteenth platoon that much closer to victory.</p>
<p>“Regina, cover me!”</p>
<p>“You’ve got it, Lady Selia!” Regina replied cheerfully from behind.</p>
<p>“Princess Chatres, this might be two-on-one, but I hope you won’t think us cowards. The Holy Sword Dance Festival is a team competition, and we’re desperate to win.”</p>
<p>“Of course, go right ahead. Given the difference in our abilities, this is a suitable handicap for me,” Chatres replied seriously before lunging forward.</p>

</div>
<p class="space-break">Chatres closed the distance in a single bound. If Riselia tried to block, her Bloody Sword would undoubtedly shatter. Knowing this, Riselia tilted her blade to intercept the strike.</p>
<p><em>Claaaaangggg!</em></p>
<p>The swords locked, spraying sparks into the air. Riselia slid her angled weapon, warding off her opponent’s brute strength. The locked blades separated. The two combatants had traded positions.</p>
<p><em>She’s so strong, even after I diffused some of the force.</em> Riselia’s hands felt numb.</p>
<p><a id="page-138"></a>“Remarkable. It seems I’ve underestimated you somewhat,” Chatres praised her.</p>
<p>“No need to hold back, Your Highness…” Riselia corrected her grip on the Bloody Sword and glared at Chatres.</p>
<p>“That’s a good look in your eyes.” Chatres raised her Holy Sword overhead. “I’ll take this a bit more seriously, then.”</p>
<p>The broadsword’s blade turned to light, extending to a height of twenty meltes. Chatres’s Holy Sword, the Ragna Nova, possessed incredible destructive power. It was capable of slaying gigantic Voids with a single blow, and its astounding range allowed it to eradicate Void colonies from a distance. Chatres could adjust the radiant blade freely.</p>
<p>These were simple abilities, but dealing with them in practice was difficult. Earlier, Chatres had used these powers to blow off the warehouse’s roof from a distance. The Ragna Nova was a top-class weapon for dealing with Voids.</p>
<p>Chatres brought her weapon down diagonally. The luminous streak bit through reinforced asphalt easily. Blocking it wasn’t an option. Riselia jumped and sprinted up a warehouse’s wall. She ran to the top and then launched a surprise attack from above.</p>
<p>“A petty trick!”</p>
<p>Chatres swung the Ragna Nova horizontally, cutting down the warehouse.</p>
<p>“Whoa?!”</p>
<p>Having lost her footing, Riselia nearly fumbled, but she managed to land on her feet.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, they’ll deduct points if you destroy buildings!” Riselia called out.</p>
<p>“Getting enough core flags should cancel out any penalties.”</p>
<p>“That’s a crazy way of looking at it!”</p>
<p>Perhaps that was a quality Chatres shared with Regina.</p>
<p>Riselia’s feet stopped. Chatres brought the blade of light up <a id="page-139"></a>and then abruptly turned, moving her sword as though to block something.</p>
<p><em>Ting!</em></p>
<p>A spark bounced off the Ragna Nova—Regina’s covering fire.</p>
<p>“Now, Lady Selia!” Regina loosed more shots from far away.</p>
<p>Chatres cut the bullets out of the air, and Riselia used that opening to rush in. The Ragna Nova could change its range freely, meaning that there was no benefit to Riselia keeping her distance from the princess. Her best option was to force a close-quarters battle.</p>
<p>“Hahhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>Countless blades of blood formed a spiral that converged at the tip of the Bloody Sword.</p>
<p>“Bloody Petal Spiral!”</p>
<p>Chatres watched as a blade of blood erupted before her eyes. The spiral coiled and snaked, moving in a random, zigzag trajectory toward Chatres.</p>
<p>“Enough with the games!”</p>
<p>The Ragna Nova swept the blood blades away entirely. Riselia’s attack wasn’t over yet, however. She took another step forward, not allowing the princess to back away. Her attack had been a feint to prepare a more powerful strike.</p>
<p>Riselia fought using the same sword style that Chatres did—imperial orthodox. But there was more to it than that. Riselia had studied different schools of technique for years, never knowing if her Holy Sword would manifest. Some of those methods were seen as abnormal, heretical even. In addition to more vicious sword maneuvers, she incorporated kicks and leg sweeps into her fighting, creating a fluid whole.</p>
<p>Normally, Riselia would also employ sorcery to confuse the enemy, but that was out of the question during the Holy Sword Dance Festival. Her fighting style was a blade dance, and it was overwhelming Chatres.</p>
<p><a id="page-140"></a>“Your legwork is quite strange for one of the famed Crystalia Knights…!”</p>
<p>“True, this is an unorthodox style—but my soul is still that of a Crystalia Knight!” Riselia shouted, thrusting the Bloody Sword forward.</p>
<p>However, Chatres dodged this full-force attack, albeit only just.</p>
<p>“Fascinating,” Chatres remarked, holding up the Ragna Nova. “I’ll be the judge of the quality of your soul, then!”</p>
<p>Riselia braced herself, weary of that luminous blade.</p>
<p>“Holy Sword, Mode Shift—Ragna Shadow.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Chatres’s Holy Sword shattered. No… It didn’t break; it split into multiple fragments.</p>
<p>Chatres swung her Holy Sword down, and all the shards rushed Riselia with deadly precision.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Riselia gathered magic in her legs and jumped away, but the razors pursued, their trajectories winding like whips.</p>
<p><em>Bang, bang, bang!</em></p>
<p>Sparks burst to life as shards were sent flying back, compliments of Regina’s covering fire.</p>
<p><em>The Ragna Shadow balances both attack and defense. I knew about it from the data, but…</em> Riselia gritted her teeth as she leaped away to evade.</p>
<p>Data couldn’t simulate real combat. The Ragna Nova was optimized for eliminating Voids, but its extreme firepower made it too destructive and lethal for use in the Holy Sword Dance Festival, with its many rules and restrictions. It was the same for Regina’s Drag Howl.</p>
<p>The Ragna Shadow was tricky, though. These luminous pieces of the blade tracked a target but also acted as a shield to protect <a id="page-141"></a>Chatres. In that regard, the princess’s Holy Sword was similar to Riselia’s Bloody Sword.</p>
<p>Chatres brandished the hilt of her weapon like a whip. The clean strokes from before were gone; now her strikes were constantly shifting trajectories. A flurry of small blades rained upon the battlefield, carving vehicles meant to carry supplies to scrap metal.</p>
<p><em>She’ll overwhelm me if I let her keep me at this range. I have to get at her flank!</em></p>
<p>Riselia put mana into her legs again, releasing it to propel herself forward. The longer the battle continued, the more Chatres would win out. The gap in their skills was too significant. Riselia needed to settle this fight while she still had mana.</p>
<p>“Bloody Petal Spiral!” Riselia jumped with the Bloody Sword gripped in both hands.</p>
<p>Countless razors of blood converged at the sword’s tip, forming a spiral drill.</p>
<p>“Come if you dare, Riselia Crystalia. Mode Shift—Ragna Nova!”</p>
<p>The scattered blades of light coalesced in Chatres’s hands again as the princess stood to meet Riselia’s do-or-die attack. If they were to clash, the Ragna Nova would overwhelm the Bloody Sword, shattering it.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“Don’t forget I’m still here, too. Mode Shift—Drag Howl!” Regina called out.</p>
<p>…the girl’s sniper rifle turned into a large anti-Void cannon.</p>
<p>“What?!” Chatres’s eyes shot wide.</p>
<p>An intense burst rocketed from the cannon.</p>
<p><em>Booooooom!</em></p>
<p>The target wasn’t Chatres herself, but the ground beneath her. <a id="page-142"></a>The asphalt caved in immediately, sending Chatres plummeting into the underground passages below. And as the princess tumbled, Riselia delivered a powerful slash.</p>
<p>“Hahhhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>“So this was your plan?!”</p>
<p>“Regina and I don’t need a plan to work together!”</p>
<p>They could each understand one another without any special signals. They were best friends and had been raised together since infancy.</p>
<p>The Bloody Sword came hurtling down, blowing the Ragna Nova and Chatres away.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The princess’s Holy Sword remained intact, though. Chatres landed, braced herself, and immediately corrected her posture.</p>
<p><em>I put everything into that attack. I can’t believe she stopped it…</em></p>
<p>“I admit it, Riselia Crystalia.” Chatres’s blond hair fluttered as she fixed her gaze upon her enemy. “You are a Holy Swordswoman worthy of a serious battle.” She lifted the Ragna Nova to eye level, and Riselia did the same with the Bloody Sword.</p>
<p><em>Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!</em></p>
<p>A shrill warning siren blared.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Both women reacted immediately. Every Holy Swordsman knew what that alarm meant—a large-scale Void incursion.</p>

<p class="space-break">A large creature soared over the open sea, its wings spread and its sizable shadow racing over the waves. It was Leonis’s skull dragon.</p>
<p>“…Is it much farther?” Leonis whispered in annoyance as he stood upright atop the dragon’s head, watching the horizon.</p>
<p>The skull dragon’s flight speed couldn’t match a living <a id="page-143"></a>dragon’s. Such was the result of creating it for fighting, rather than mobility.</p>
<p><em>The Holy Sword Dance Festival has surely commenced already.</em></p>
<p>Still, it was too soon for him to give up. He could swap places with Shary halfway through the event.</p>
<p>The skull dragon roared. A large city had appeared in the distance at last.</p>
<p>“There it is!”</p>
