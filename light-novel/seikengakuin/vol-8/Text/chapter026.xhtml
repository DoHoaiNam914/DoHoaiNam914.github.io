<p class="space-break">The Everdark Queen, Rakshasa Nightmare, was a devil who reigned over the afterlife, and she was the Undead King’s third minion. Long had she been sealed in the Realm Shadows. She was a match for a Dark Lord when her powers were at their full might. Because she took any chance to rebel against Leonis, he’d locked her away.</p>
<p>So while she was his minion, she was also an uncontrollable element. She was, in a sense, Leonis’s ultimate weapon. Calling upon her was strictly a last resort.</p>
<p>Shary stood surrounded by Voids, having removed her maid’s headdress. The assassin maid closed her eyes and spoke the words that would break the seal.</p>
<p>“First seal released—the lock on the Realm of Shadows has opened.”</p>
<p>A small whirlwind whipped up around her, causing her skirt to billow.</p>
<p>“Second seal released—unleash living death upon this place.”</p>
<p>The shadow at Shary’s feet spread wide, covering the entire rooftop.</p>
<p>“Third seal released—sovereign of the eternal ebon, may your wrath, may your lamentations, fill my hollow vessel.”</p>
<p>The shadows consumed Shary’s body…</p>
<p>…and the third minion appeared. The personality of Shary Shadow Assassin was wiped away, and in its place emerged the Everdark Queen.</p>
<p>Her body was clad in an ominous dress, as black as a lightless night. Her hands gripped the hilt of the Executioner’s Sword, granter of merciful death.</p>
<p>Leonis had given Shary, the guardswoman of the Realm of <a id="page-162"/>Shadows, permission to draw the Everdark Queen into her body. That was the only thing keeping this dangerous entity under control. With Shary’s body as her container, the devil’s soul was bound and restrained.</p>
<p>Deathly miasma came off her, covering the area. She floated in midair, opening her eyes soundlessly. Their dusk color gave way to a shade of ominous darkness as she beheld the Voids below.</p>
<p>“Bothersome insects,” she whispered. “Leave my sight at once.”</p>
<p>She gently swung the Executioner’s Sword with a single hand, and the swarm of Voids was silently eradicated.</p>
<p>“Is the despicable Undead King not here? Did he flee in fear of me?” the devil wondered in Shary’s voice.</p>
<p>She looked around, her attention settling on the gigantic Voids emerging from the tear in the sky.</p>
<p>“I suppose that could prove to be entertaining.”</p>

<p class="space-break">“Ah… Kuh…”</p>
<p>The spider threads dug into Riselia’s limbs and neck. As an undead, Riselia didn’t need to breathe; however, she writhed in agony regardless, for the strands were draining her mana.</p>
<p><em>This…is…!</em></p>
<p>She manipulated her blood blades in an attempt to cut her way out, but the mana-empowered web refused to budge.</p>
<p>“Don’t bother. I am a Spider Queen—one of the highest ranks of undead. A lowly undead like you lacks the strength to escape my threads.”</p>
<p>Iris Void Priestess let out a resounding laugh. Riselia’s mana dwindled, and her consciousness flickered.</p>
<p>“…Ahhh. Ahhhhhhhhhh!” Riselia mustered the last of her <a id="page-163"/>strength, throwing a blood blade at Iris. Yet before it could reach her mark, the liquid razor lost its shape and splashed upon the ground harmlessly.</p>
<p>“Heh. Looks like your mana has run out already.”</p>
<p>With her magic power depleted, the True Ancestor’s Dress began to fade.</p>
<p><em>L-Leo…</em></p>
<p>Although her mind tumbled into the dark, Leonis’s face managed to surface. This woman, this monster, was an enemy of humanity who’d summoned Voids to the city. In all likelihood, she was one of Leonis’s foes as well, much like that priest, Nefakess.</p>
<p>If Riselia were to fall captive now, Iris would reach her memories and discover the truth about Leonis.</p>
<p><em>Leo’s going to be exposed because of me…!</em></p>
<p>It was then that Riselia recalled, despite her muddled awareness, how she’d learned to control her mana before the Holy Sword Dance Festival. Shary had trained her to circulate the power while maintaining the True Ancestor’s Dress instead of outputting it. At the time, she hadn’t quite understood what it meant to do so…</p>
<p><em>Can I suppress the mana she’s trying to steal, instead of just emitting it…?</em></p>
<p>It couldn’t accomplish more than stall for time, but Riselia focused on her heartbeat, pulling in the magical energy her body emitted.</p>
<p>“Oh?” Iris had evidently recognized some subtle change in Riselia and regarded her curiously. “All out of mana already? That was unexpectedly disappointing.”</p>
<p><em>Keep the mana inside my body, as hot as a furnace…!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, the True Ancestor’s Dress changed—its color turned from bloodred to a shining, pure white.</p>
<p>“What?!” Iris’s eyes widened in alarm.</p>
<p><a id="page-164"/>Riselia was surprised, too. Not just with the garment’s transformation, but with the way the mana circulating through her body seemed to swell and overflow.</p>
<p><em>Is my mana being amplified?!</em></p>
<p>Where had this new energy come from?</p>
<p><em>With this much strength…</em></p>
<p>Riselia breathed in. “Hyahhh!” She unleashed all the power running through her at once. Bright light spilled from her body, severing all the threads binding her limbs and neck.</p>
<p>“I-impossible… A low-ranking undead…tore up my web…?!”</p>
<p>Riselia landed on the ground, her white dress billowing. The mana she unleashed was being reincorporated back into her body.</p>
<p><em>Is this the power of the dress Leo gave me…?</em></p>
<p>Riselia could tell intuitively that this was the second form of the True Ancestor’s Dress—another mode that formed a pair with the crimson one that consumed mana to reinforce her body.</p>
<p><em>It bolsters the magic power in my body by compressing it. It’s a mode specialized for spell-based combat…</em></p>
<p>Riselia’s physical abilities had returned to what they were without the dress, but the sorcerous power within her was growing mighty.</p>
<p><em>So that training was to help me master this mode.</em></p>
<p>Raising her Holy Sword, Riselia glared at the panicking Spider Queen. This woman had summoned Voids; she had to be taken alive for information.</p>
<p>“I, Riselia Crystalia, in my capacity as captain of the eighteenth platoon, am placing you under arrest!”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… You think you can talk down to me, you low-grade undead girl?” Iris began a chant: “Rise forth from defiled soil, you wandering cadavers—Create Undead Army!”</p>
<p>Several dozen magic circles formed around her, and skeleton soldiers appeared from within them.</p>
<p><em>She summoned skeletons just like Leo!</em></p>
<p><a id="page-165"/>The newly created warriors rattled as they charged Riselia, weapons ready to strike.</p>
<p>“Come forth, Shadow Wolf Summon!” Riselia chanted a spell, holding the Bloody Sword overhead.</p>
<p>The darkness at her feet warped and changed form, becoming eight ferocious beasts.</p>
<p><em>Wow! I could only manifest two last time!</em></p>
<p>The Shadow Wolves sprinted silently, lunging at the undead army.</p>
<p>“Great lord of the undead, beckon flames of darkness to my hands—,” Riselia intoned, performing a complicated gesture with one of her hands.</p>
<p>A sphere of black, crackling mana manifested at her fingertips. This was a second-order spell taught to her by the Archmage Nefisgal—the Cursed Flash, Di Farga. It was the most destructive spell in Riselia’s arsenal.</p>
<p>“My, my. You wish to challenge a dark priestess with such weak sorcery?” the Spider Queen sneered. She lifted her spider legs. “Great lord of the undead, grant my enemy death and eternal ruination.”</p>
<p>A large orb appeared over Iris’s head, a sixth-order spell—Vraz Farga. A more advanced version of Di Farga and an offensive spell of the highest caliber.</p>
<p>“Let that great man’s spell blow you to bits, giiiiiirl!”</p>
<p>Riselia had no chance of winning a clash with a spell far superior to hers. Yet she remained undaunted, fixing her eyes upon Iris and continuing to recite spells.</p>
<p>“Di Farga, Di Farga, Di Farga, Di Farga, Di Farga.”</p>
<p>Riselia produced several dozen mana spheres.</p>
<p>“…What?!”</p>
<p>“Di Farga, Di Farga, Di Farga, Di Farga, Di Farga, Di Farga, Di Farga, Di Farga, Di Farga, Di Farga, Di Farga, Di Farga.”</p>
<p><a id="page-166"/>Each time Riselia spoke the words, her white True Ancestor’s Dress glowed brightly. She wasn’t capable of magic above second order yet, but with this vast amount of newfound mana, she could launch a bombardment of lesser spells…!</p>
<p>“You low-grade undead braaaaaaaaaat…!” Iris howled.</p>
<p>Just as Riselia loosed her Di Farga volley, Iris completed her spell, hurling the massive sphere of mana.</p>
<p><em>Booooooooom!</em></p>
<p>The Vraz Farga’s force was dampened by the many Di Fargas, and it ruptured in the center of the square. The skeleton soldiers and Shadow Wolves were caught in the blast and blown away.</p>
<p>“I’m not finished yet!” Riselia began chanting again.</p>
<p>Each time the magic power circulated through her body, it was compressed, empowering her spells several times beyond their original strength. However, the True Ancestor’s Dress’s sorcery combat mode had a major flaw—cycling that energy put tremendous strain on Riselia’s body. It operated differently from the crimson version, which reinforced physical attributes, making it ill-suited to prolonged fighting.</p>
<p><em>I can see why she forced me to take basic stamina training.</em></p>
<p>Riselia pushed her power further, ignoring the pain.</p>
<p>“Very well, then I shall teach you the power of a high-ranking undead…!” Iris Void Priestess tore off her spider legs and threw them into the air. “Take this sacrifice of my flesh, and grant forbidden power unto me…!” The limbs burst into flames and turned into an incandescent fireball. “Eighth-order fire spell—Al Gu Belzelga!”</p>
<p>The burning sphere swelled to a size that dwarfed the Vraz Farga from earlier.</p>
<p><em>I…can’t block this!</em></p>
<p>Riselia reflexively hurled the Di Farga spells she cast in rapid succession.</p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha-ha! Don’t even bother, it’s useless!”</p>
