<p class="noindent">A boat bobbed along a foggy lake. Riselia sat in the little vessel, clad in a white dress. With her was Leonis, wearing his Excalibur Academy uniform. Birds chirped from somewhere beyond the misty shore.</p>
<p>“E-erm…L-Leo…” Riselia, cheeks flushed, cast an upturned look at the boy sitting opposite her.</p>
<p>“What is it, Miss Selia?” he replied while rowing.</p>
<p>“I, erm…I want a…reward…,” Riselia admitted in a bashful yet coaxing tone.</p>
<p>Leonis smiled teasingly. “You’re being indecent, Miss Selia. Aren’t you a noble’s daughter?”</p>
<p>“Ah, er…” The girl’s face reddened at the comment.</p>
<p>“Do you want it that badly?” Leonis reached out and twined a silver strand of hair around his finger.</p>
<p>“…Y-yes…”</p>
<p>Leonis’s oddly bullyish attitude was a bit different from how he usually acted, and for some reason, it made Riselia’s heart beat faster. However, she sensed something a bit off, too.</p>
<p><em>Did Leo always talk like this…?</em></p>
