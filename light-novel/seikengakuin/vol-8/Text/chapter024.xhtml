<p><a id="page-153"/><em>I don’t think I’ll be able to dispose of that many on my own.</em> Shary bit her lip as she cut down more of the approaching monsters. <em>Failure to defend my lord’s domain after he entrusted me with it is inexcusable. Only death would absolve me…</em></p>
<p>And then there was the matter of Leonis’s minion, Riselia Crystalia. Shary had to make sure nothing befell her, but locating the girl was difficult in this vast city. And with the Voids radiating intense mana, communication terminals were of no use.</p>
<p>Worst of all, Shary had a terrible sense of direction.</p>
<p>“Seriously, where is she and what is she doing…?” the assassin maid wondered aloud as she swept away a swarm of Voids with shadow whips.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the air over the Eighth Assault Garden was rent in two.</p>
<p>“…What?!”</p>
<p>The rip widened, as if it were being turned inside out, and an ominous red sky spread across the world. From beyond the opening, a gigantic hand appeared.</p>
<p>“Wh-wh-what is that…?” Shary shuddered, her dusk-colored eyes wide with shock.</p>
<p>An unimaginably gigantic Void. Judging by the arm’s scale, if a creature of that size fully emerged, it would destroy the First, Seventh, and Eight Assault Gardens completely.</p>
<p><em>I can’t do anything about that thing!</em> Shary’s assassin instincts told her that much.</p>
<p>And that was only the beginning.</p>
<p><em>Crack, crack, crack…!</em></p>
<p>The tear grew even larger. Two more gigantic limbs reached from the hole.</p>
<p><em>It…can’t be…</em></p>
<p>Shary’s expression turned to one of utter despair. Each of those <a id="page-154"/>arms belonged to different Voids. There were at least three of them now.</p>
<p>Shary stared blankly, hopelessly.</p>
<p><em>“Shary, Blackas! Answer me, I don’t care which one of you it is!”</em></p>
<p>“M-my lord?!” Shary raised her face in surprise after hearing his voice in her mind. <em>“My lord, you’ve returned…!”</em> she replied.</p>
<p><em>“Not quite yet. I can see the capital, but it’ll take me a while longer to return. Shary, inform me of the situation. Things look to be in utter chaos from what I can glean…”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes. A gigantic tear in space appeared over the Eighth Assault Garden, where the Holy Sword Dance Festival was being held</em>,” Shary explained while brandishing her whip to fell more Voids. <em>“Swarms of the monsters called Voids, and at least three gigantic specimens, are attempting to emerge on this side.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Hmm. Can you handle them?”</em></p>
<p><em>“My apologies, my lord. I cannot do it on my own…”</em></p>
<p><em>“I see…”</em> Leonis seemingly took a moment to consider. <em>“Shary, I give you permission to unleash the Everdark Queen.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The Everdark Queen?! But she—”</em></p>
<p><em>“We have no choice. We are up against monsters, so our only recourse is to meet this challenge with one of our own.”</em></p>
<p><em>“But…”</em></p>
<p><em>“Do it. Freeing her is dangerous, but I’ll manage.”</em> Leonis’s tone left no room for argument.</p>
<p><em>“V-very well. I’ll do it at once.”</em> Shary nodded and removed her maid’s headdress.</p>

<p class="space-break">“Hyahhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>Riselia unleashed the True Ancestor’s Dress’s power. Her <a id="page-155"/>argent hair shone, and her ice-blue eyes turned crimson. She surrendered herself to the overflowing mana and shot forward.</p>
<p>“Ahh.” The spider woman’s red lips quirked into a grin, and she snapped her fingers.</p>
<p>The St. Eluminas Monastery Holy Swordsmen turned their blank, emotionless eyes to Riselia and lunged at her together.</p>
<p><em>She’s controlling them?!</em></p>
<p>Riselia charged into the group. Using the power of the True Ancestor’s Dress, she converted her vast Vampire Queen mana reserves into brute strength. She caught a large man rushing her with a high kick to the jaw. Pivoting, Riselia landed a roundhouse kick to another student, knocking him to the ground.</p>
<p><em>Sorry, but I can’t hold back right now!</em></p>
<p>Riselia brandished the Bloody Sword, producing blades of blood that cut down two more students. She could only hope the wounds weren’t fatal as she sprinted for the spider woman.</p>
<p>“Oh my, my. What does this mean?” Iris Void Priestess cocked her head in confusion. <em>“Why do you have that dress?”</em> The woman’s face lost all expression, but her pupils widened. Vicious malice washed over Riselia, sending chills through her body.</p>
<p><em>She knows about this dress?!</em></p>
<p>Did she know Leonis, then? That redheaded girl, Veira, was an old acquaintance of Leonis’s. However, Riselia got the feeling that Veira was a friend. This spider woman—Iris—felt different. She eyed the True Ancestor’s Dress with a sticky, clinging sort of gaze.</p>
<p>“That garment belongs to a great man. Did you lowly humans ransack Necrozoa’s glorious treasure vaults?” Iris scowled and began mumbling to herself. “No, a human couldn’t handle that treasure. You couldn’t possibly be undead, could you? Lord Nefakess said nothing of the sort—”</p>
<p><em>I don’t understand what she wants, but…!</em></p>
<p><a id="page-156"/>Riselia moved at lightning speed, swinging the Bloody Sword down.</p>
<p><em>Clanggggg!</em></p>
<p>The spider legs deflected her Holy Sword’s blade.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>“Oh, well. I’ll just torture you for information on him. If you’re undead, I should be able to hack off your limbs. You won’t die so long as your head’s still attached, right?”</p>
<p>Iris’s arachnid legs came crashing down in succession. Riselia jumped away to evade them, and the sharp limbs crushed the rubble on the ground to bits.</p>
<p>“Bloom wildly, my blades—Bloody Petal Flurry!” Riselia ran in an arc, deploying crimson razors as she moved for Iris.</p>
<p>“Aha!” Iris evaded with surprisingly graceful movements, her spider legs parrying the blood blades. Without the True Ancestor’s Dress boosting her strength, Riselia wouldn’t have been able to keep up.</p>
<p>Riselia kicked off a building and dashed up its wall. Focusing the mana in her legs, she released it all at once, blasting herself toward Iris.</p>
<p>“Hrahhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>She focused all her strength into a single attack, empowering her hands with magic power. The cut severed a few spider legs, sending them flying through the air. However, Iris didn’t appear bothered.</p>
<p>“…Were you the one who called the Voids?!” Riselia demanded.</p>
<p>“No, all I did was help open the gate,” Iris replied. “The Void monsters are just the vanguard, drawn to this side by the Holy Swords’ power.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Riselia asked, slashing up to lop off a spider leg plunging for her.</p>
<p>“Just look at that tear in the sky. <em>The world is being overwritten.</em> <a id="page-157"/>This world, protected by the Holy Swords, is being overwritten by the great goddess’s world of emptiness…”</p>
<p>“…?!” Knocking away a few spider limbs, Riselia risked a glance at the sky.</p>
<p>The rip in space had greatly expanded, and gigantic Void arms were emerging.</p>
<p><em>They’re massive… Are they Void Lords?!</em> Riselia’s crimson eyes clouded over with despair.</p>
<p>If they got through, the capital was done for.</p>
<p>“Oh, can you really afford to be distracted?”</p>
<p>Iris opened her mouth and spat sticky threads.</p>
<p>The strands of shining mana bound Riselia’s limbs at once, rendering her motionless and pulling her to the ground.</p>
<p>“…Khh!”</p>
<p>Riselia released magical power, hoping to blow the threads away, yet…</p>
<p><em>Why…?! My mana, it’s…!</em></p>
<p>…the strands only tightened, tearing into the young woman’s slender throat.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh. Now, be honest with me, girl. Who gave you that dress?” Iris pressed one of her arachnid legs against Riselia’s cheek.</p>
<p>“I’ll never…tell you…!” Riselia answered through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“My, that’s a shame… Heh-heh. You bad girl. In that case…” Iris’s red eyes glinted ominously. “I’ll play with you in my nest until you scream and beg for mercy.”</p>

<p class="space-break">“Lady Selia…,” Regina whispered. She turned back to look. Even from afar, she felt the intermittent explosions in her eardrums.</p>
<p>“That’s…far enough…,” Chatres gasped. “Put me down…here…”</p>
<p><a id="page-158"/>Regina gently lay Chatres’s body at the foot of a crumbled building.</p>
<p>“I’ll go get a first aid kit.” Regina pulled up a map of the area on her terminal, looking for any place with medical supplies.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was a stand nearby. Regina wasn’t sure if places like that were stocked on the incomplete Eighth Assault Garden, but it was worth the attempt.</p>
<p>By some miracle, she did locate emergency treatment materials and hurried back to Chatres. A puddle of dark red had formed under the princess in Regina’s absence.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, I’ll handle your wounds now. Let me know if it hurts.”</p>
<p>“I am a…knight of House O’ltriese… Such pain is…nothing…”</p>
<p>“Don’t strain yourself…,” Regina said, quickly wrapping a bandage over Chatres’s wrist.</p>
<p>Administering medical aid was one of the first things Excalibur Academy students learned. Since Holy Swords with healing powers were rare, knowing how to treat wounds on the front lines was paramount for a Holy Swordsman.</p>
<p>Regina transmitted an emergency request for assistance, but the Stampede made it unlikely that the message would get through.</p>
<p>“What a…disaster… To think an anti-imperial organization infiltrated the Human Church… Were they disciples of the Apocalyptic Cult? What…were they…?”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, please, relax. You’ll open your wounds,” Regina said, holding the other girl’s shoulders.</p>
<p>“…This is pathetic. And I call myself royalty…? The strongest knight? My Holy Sword is meant to defend the people, yet at times like these, I…”</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Your Highness—,” Regina whispered before gently wrapping her hands around Chatres’s back in an embrace.</p>
<p><a id="page-159"/>The princess’s eyes went wide.</p>
<p>“Princess Chatres. Every Holy Swordsman out there looks up to you. You’ll go on to lead us all someday. Please, don’t say such hopeless things. The entire empire is waiting for your safe return.”</p>
<p>“…You talk like you know what it’s like to be in my position.”</p>
<p>“I apologize if I came across as presumptuous. I’m simply worried for you, Your Highness.” Regina released Chatres, a lonely smile on her face.</p>
<p><em>How could I not worry about my big sister?</em></p>
<p><em>Crack, crack, crack, crack…!</em></p>
<p>Fissures carved themselves into the space surrounding the two.</p>
<p>“Voids?!” Regina stood immediately to protect Chatres, the Drag Striker clutched in her hands.</p>
<p>“Forget about me, Regina Mercedes. Run for…safety…”</p>
<p><em>Bang!</em></p>
<p>Regina fired at one of the Voids.</p>
<p>“I refuse. I’ll protect you to my last, Your Highness.”</p>
<p><em>Crack, crack, crack, crack…!</em></p>
<p>The tears continued expanding, with more fly-like Voids spilling out of them.</p>
<p><em>I might have trouble against so many…</em> Regina felt a cold sweat run down the back of her neck.</p>
<p>She knew it was beyond her to fend off this many alone. The Voids swarmed at her, a loud buzzing overtaking all other sounds.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Just as it seemed hopeless, lightning flashed, and all the Voids rushing toward her fell lifelessly to the ground. Regina saw a familiar white garb flap softly in the corner of her eye.</p>
<p>“I see you need some help, Miss Regina.”</p>
<p>“Sakuya!”</p>
