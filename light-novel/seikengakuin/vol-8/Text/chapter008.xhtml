<p><a id="page-43"/>Elfiné cradled the black cat in her arms and accepted the information cube it held. She used the Eye of the Witch to scan it for any viruses, then accessed it carefully. The geometric cube opened up, and data on casino patrons poured into an Eye of the Witch orb.</p>
<p>Elfiné sought information to explain her brother’s, Finzel Phillet’s, connection to the Demon Sword Project. That wasn’t all, however. She was also after anything related to Deinfraude Phillet, her father and the man who killed her mother.</p>
<p>“What’s this…?” There was something unusual within the list of customers.</p>
<p>Apparently, priests from the Human Church had visited the casino multiple times. The religion advocated for eliminating the Voids, and although it didn’t preach abstinence from vice as it once had, it still felt unusual for a priest to frequent a gambling establishment.</p>
<p>Records indicated multiple people coming and going from the casino, but the names used were clearly aliases.</p>
<p><em>Is it possible they’re all the same person? I might have to look into this.</em></p>
<p>Elfiné was already aware of the army’s involvement in the early stages of the D Project. If the military, the Phillet Company, and the Human Church were all wrapped up in this…</p>
<p><em>I can’t imagine taking this on alone…</em></p>
<p>She’d set herself up against a massive conspiracy. But was it right to drag Riselia and the others into such a dangerous battle?</p>
<p>Elfiné thought of someone, and she saw a ten-year-old boy’s face.</p>
<p><em>Leo…</em></p>
<p>By now, Elfiné was confident that he was no mere refugee child. She still had data on him that should have gone to the administrative bureau.</p>
<p><a id="page-44"/>Back when the Void Stampede descended on the Seventh Assault Garden. When the Void Reef vanished. When they engaged that mysterious Void Lord in the Third Assault Garden. And when the Void hive in the ancient ruins was abruptly eradicated…</p>
<p>That ten-year-old boy was always involved somehow. Elfiné didn’t know who he really was or what he intended.</p>
<p><em>Still, he might be able to…</em></p>
<p>Somewhere, deep down, she carried a kind of expectation of him. Was he this world’s hope? Or perhaps he was…</p>
<p>Elfiné’s older sister had told her about them way back.</p>
<p>…a Dark Lord. An incarnation of destruction and chaos that burned the ancient world.</p>
<p>“Find anything interesting?” a voice inquired, disrupting Elfiné’s contemplation.</p>
<p>“…?!” The girl’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>The data cube fizzled away into particles of light and changed shape. Now it looked like a fairy just large enough to rest in Elfiné’s hands if she cupped them. It took flight and fluttered over her like a butterfly, its black wings sprinkling luminous motes as they beat.</p>
<p>“What?!” Elfiné called out in alarm.</p>
<p><em>Did the information cube conceal a backdoor access point?!</em></p>
<p>“Heh-heh, it’s nice to meet you, miss. <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/> I’ve been dying to!” The fairy stopped in midair and regarded her with a cherubic smile. “My name is Seraphim. I’m a messenger that conveys the voice of the goddess.”</p>
<p>“Seraphim…!” Elfiné froze from shock.</p>
<p>She knew that name. She’d been working to discover the truth behind it for some time. An entity called Seraphim had appeared to some of Excalibur Academy’s Holy Swordsmen, including Liat Guinness, the captain of the seventh platoon, Elfiné’s old unit. Seraphim granted them the power of Demon Swords.</p>
<p><a id="page-45"/>Evidently, Seraphim was a Phillet Company mass-produced Artificial Elemental.</p>
<p>“Oh, you know me already. I’m so happy to hear that.” The fairy girl giggled.</p>
<p>“You’re the one who gave Liat and the others their Demon Swords, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Me? No! I’m incapable of producing or granting Demon Swords,” Seraphim replied. “All I do is relay the goddess’s voice to those who seek power.”</p>
<p>“…Goddess?”</p>
<p>Many students who wielded the Demon Swords mentioned hearing the voice of some goddess, but Elfiné had assumed it to be the Artificial Elemental.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Aren’t you the one creating the Demon Swords?” Elfiné questioned.</p>
<p>Seraphim sneered. “You humans know nothing about the Holy Swords. You keep telling yourselves that lie that they come from the planet’s power, wielding them without knowing what they actually are.”</p>
<p>“What…? Wh-what are you saying?”</p>
<p>“Holy Swords and Demon Swords <em>are the same, in essence</em>.” The fairy smiled alluringly and peered into Elfiné’s dark eyes. “Tell me, Elfiné Phillet. Don’t you desire strength?”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“Open yourself to the goddess’s words. If your Holy Sword were to be reborn as a Demon Sword, you’d wield the power of a true witch. And with it, you’d surpass your brother, and even that monster, Count Deinfraude Phillet.”</p>
<p>The seductive whisper tickled her earlobe. Was it the fairy who spoke? Or was this irresistible, overwhelming voice perhaps…?</p>
<p>“Stop looking inside my head!” Elfiné glared at the Artificial Elemental. “And don’t think you can trick me that easily!”</p>
<p><a id="page-46"/>Her Holy Sword, the Eye of the Witch, loosed a flash that destroyed the grid forming the space around them and triggered a loud alarm.</p>
<p>“Demon Swords can’t be allowed to exist, and that goes for the people who create them, too!” Elfiné declared.</p>
<p>“That’s a pity,” the fairy replied from someplace unseen. “You would’ve made an excellent witch—maybe even an apostle. Let’s meet again someday, shall we? In the goddess’s world—”</p>
<p>A single black feather fluttered down to Elfiné’s feet.</p>

<p class="space-break">An upside-down palace floated in the infinite void. This was the Otherworldly Castle, a structure that belonged to one of the eight Dark Lords, Azra-Ael, the Devil of the Underworld. This mobile fortress was the only base in the Dark Lords’ Armies’ command capable of moving between dimensions.</p>
<p>At present, its owner was absent, and it couldn’t travel between planes, but it was still a sturdy bastion. This castle’s reception hall, a temple chamber that stood upside down, with a ceiling serving as the floors, was filled to the brim with gigantic eyes.</p>
<p>No, not eyes—jewels. Black gems polished like mirrors. The many eyelike stones reflected the lone visitor to this bizarre chamber. He was a tall man in a classy suit. With such handsome features, one could even call him beautiful.</p>
<p>However, dark madness burned in his eyes.</p>
<p>This was Count Phillet’s second son, Finzel Phillet, the leader of the Demon Sword Project and a traitor to humanity.</p>
<p><em>“Rejoice, ye sly fool of a short-lived race, for your accomplishments have marked you worthy of attending this banquet,”</em> declared one of the eyes above him.</p>
<p><a id="page-47"/>“I am honored, apostles of the goddess.” He fell prostrate, regarding the echoing voice with awe and respect.</p>
<p>Finzel felt like a cold blade hung above his nape. His life meant nothing to the courtiers of this place.</p>
<p><em>“You have asked to bask your flesh in the goddess’s blessing. To become a Void.”</em></p>
<p>Another spoke from the eyes. It was the clingy, viscous, and stagnant voice of a woman.</p>
<p>“Yes. That is my true wish.”</p>
<p><em>“Should you lend your ear to the goddess’s voice and bask in her blessing, you shall cease to be a man and become part of the emptiness that covers all in this world.”</em></p>
<p>“Ooh, what a glorious fate. There is no higher honor for me!” Finzel raised his head and cried out in craving, his eyes fanatical.</p>
<p><em>“Will you become a traitor to humanity and consign your homeland to be burned away by the Voids?”</em></p>
<p>“The capital was nothing but a prison to me. My father, my brother, the Holy Swords—none of them acknowledged me. The Assault Gardens, my world, even this despicable human shell! I cast them away without a single regret!”</p>
<p><em>“Very well.”</em></p>
<p>The eyes overhead gazed down upon the man, and loud laughter filled the inverted chamber.</p>
<p><em>“Finzel Phillet, he who the goddess guided to betray humankind. We shall grant you the privilege to advance into the deepest depths of the hidden temple to meet our goddess.”</em></p>
<p>“Ohhh…ohhhh! You have my everlasting thanks, gracious apostles!”</p>
<p><em>“However…”</em> An eye swiveled above the man weeping in gratitude. <em>“That will only come after you have completed the task the goddess has assigned you.”</em></p>
<p><a id="page-48"/>Finzel Phillet hung his head. “Yes. Of course. Preparations for the Pseudo-Goddess Creation, the D Project, and the Void Shift are complete. I shall be as your hands and feet, great apostles, and exact the goddess’s will.”</p>
<p><em>“The will of the goddess. For this world to be reborn in emptiness.”</em></p>
<p>“The will of the goddess. For this world to be reborn in emptiness,” Finzel Phillet echoed, chanting the words as though they were from scripture.</p>
<p>The air around him bent and warped, and his body seemed to fold up and vanish. Silence reigned in the chamber until one of the floating eyes deigned to speak.</p>
<p><em>“Will he really be of use, old one?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Worry not. Even rusted swords have a use. That man would not have advanced the Pseudo-Goddess Creation and the D Project had he lacked devotion.”</em></p>
<p><em>“But there’s still the matter of the rogue Swordmaster. That ceaselessly evolving monster still wanders about, seeking to spill our goddess’s blood…”</em></p>
<p><em>“The Divine Dragon is tracking Shardark Void Lord.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The Swordmaster isn’t our only problem. There is another out there, an unknown element. They’re trying to gather the Dark Lords before we can.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The fourteenth apostle, Zemein, went to the Undead King’s resting place, yet found that his old master was already missing. And Zemein was slain shortly afterward.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Deviations are appearing in the prophecy.”</em></p>
<p>The space in the center of the room warped, and a figure appeared, a white-haired young man wearing the garb of the Human Church. Nefakess Void Lord, the thirteenth apostle.</p>
<p>He grinned, tapping his staff against the floor. “I just saw your last guest on the way back. He was quite overjoyed at having been granted an audience with the goddess.”</p>
<p><em>“How go your preparations, Lord Nefakess?”</em> a viscous, womanly voice inquired.</p>
<p><a id="page-49"/>“Perfectly. I’ve already taken care of everything within the Human Church.”</p>
<p><em>“Oh? Good. You can leave the rest to us.”</em></p>
<p>“Of course, Lady Iris.”</p>
<p>As Nefakess bowed his head respectfully, one of the eyes overhead changed into particles of light, spreading around the upside-down chamber like grains of sand. The luminous specks coalesced together, assuming the form of a woman.</p>
<p>The stunning beauty had crimson eyes and sleek black hair that trailed to her waist. She wore a pitch-black dress adorned with skulls and a dark robe over it. This was the ninth apostle and leader of the Dark Lords’ Armies’ Necromancy Unit, Iris Void Priestess.</p>
<p>She had been a commander directly beneath the Undead King, Leonis Death Magnus. And as a dark priestess, she had been entrusted with Roselia Ishtaris’s oracle.</p>
<p>She licked her crimson lips and smiled alluringly.</p>
<p><em>“Heh-heh…I look forward to the moment when a celebration of humanity’s hope becomes the day all hell breaks loose.”</em></p>
