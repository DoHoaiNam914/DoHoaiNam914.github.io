<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter016">THE HOLY SWORD DANCE FESTIVAL</a></h1>
<p class="noindent">It was 10:30 Imperial Standard Time—the day of the Holy Sword Dance Festival.</p>
<p>The members of the eighteenth platoon boarded a large, self-driving vehicle that transported them to the stage of the festival in the Eighth Assault Garden.</p>
<p>Since the Eighth Assault Garden was still under construction, its surface area was only a third of the Seventh Assault Garden’s. It had two cutting-edge mana furnaces as its energy source, and upon completion, it was set to boast the highest mobility of all its kind.</p>
<p>“Construction is currently at seventy-eight percent, but since they’ll need to divert resources to repairing the Seventh Assault Garden, it’ll take two more years for it to be completed,” Elfiné said from the seat opposite Riselia’s.</p>
<p>“It already looks pretty much done, though,” Regina noted as she looked out the window.</p>
<p>The vehicle was driving through Area III, passing by many large buildings. They were all deserted, and it reminded Riselia of the Third Assault Garden.</p>
<p><a id="page-100"/>Despite this being an unpopulated city, destroying any structures outside the designated combat area would mean a loss of points. This rule put Regina at a disadvantage, since her Holy Sword’s Drag Blast attack was a wide-area bombardment, but the regulations were based on real urban combat, so there was nothing to be done.</p>
<p>“Where are we headed?” Riselia asked.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty far from the Central Garden,” Elfiné replied, tapping her terminal.</p>
<p>Each unit participating in the Holy Sword Dance Festival had a designated starting spot. These positions were kept secret from the participants. Each site in a team’s area had core flags in place, and by stealing them, a rival unit would score points, and the defending one would lose points.</p>
<p>A team member was disqualified when knocked unconscious or if their Holy Sword was destroyed. Baiting enemies out using the core flags would be a helpful strategy.</p>
<p>The game area appeared to be vast and included underground passages. However, as time passed, float blocks would be detached from the game area, and partitions would descend to seal off underground passages. The constantly shrinking game area would force a conflict even if a team tried to run around with a core flag and remain elusive.</p>
<p>The vehicle drove past the urban area and got on a highway. Riselia looked up at the blue sky.</p>
<p><em>Leo…</em></p>
<p>He hadn’t made it back in time. The one seated next to her right now was his body double.</p>
<p>“You want a sweet, kid?” Sakuya asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, please.”</p>
<p>Sakuya pulled a castella from her sleeve, which the body double gladly accepted.</p>
<p><a id="page-101"/><em>Is the faker worried about Leo, too?</em> Riselia wondered. “Miss Finé, has the broadcast started already?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, there are drones scattered around the city.”</p>
<p>The machines were controlled by Artificial Elementals, which used the Astral Garden to transmit what each team was doing to large screens in each Assault Garden.</p>
<p>The vehicle continued out of the urban area and entered an underground tunnel. Finally it came to a stop before a gigantic supply silo, and a voice played from inside the vehicle.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Arrived at Point E. Members of the eighteenth platoon are to stay put until they receive the signal marking the opening of the Holy Sword Dance Festival.”</span></strong></p>

<p class="space-break">“Hmm… The seats for invited guests should be around here…” Arle turned her head this way and that. She had the ticket Sakuya gave her clutched in one hand.</p>
<p>She was in a spectator stadium set up on Excalibur Academy’s premises. The arena was open to all citizens. The large screens used for student matches would instead show the festival activities. There weren’t usually many spectators here, but the Holy Sword Dance Festival had brought people out in droves.</p>
<p><em>This place is even more crowded than the Rognas Kingdom’s marketplace. It’s making me dizzy.</em></p>
<p>Arle was bad with crowds and longed for the sacred tranquility of the Spirit Forest. Honestly, she wanted to leave but refused to let Sakuya’s ticket go to waste.</p>
<p><em>Besides, I would like to see how the strongest warriors of this era fight…</em></p>
<p>It took a while, but Arle finally found a seat. Yet just as she went to sit, she spotted a familiar child a few rows ahead.</p>
<p><em>Is that Tessera? What is she doing here…?</em></p>
<p><a id="page-102"/>The young girl was from an orphanage Arle had eaten at once. She was walking along a passage in front of the many rows of chairs, unsure where to go.</p>
<p>“You there, girl.”</p>
<p>Tessera turned around, surprised. “Miss Arle…?” Her eyes widened upon seeing a familiar face. Arle motioned for Tessera to approach, and she did. “Hello,” she greeted her with a polite bow of her head. “Did you come to watch the festival, too, Miss Arle?”</p>
<p>“…I suppose. I am curious about this,” Arle replied, using a finger to play with her ponytail. “Is that why you’re here?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Big Sis Riselia gave me a ticket, but I can’t find my seat…” Tessera retrieved her ticket from a pocket, showing it to Arle.</p>
<p>“Let me have a look. I can help with your search.” Arle inspected the printed number. “Hmm… Isn’t this…? Yes, it’s the chair next to mine.”</p>
<p>“I-it is?”</p>
<p>Sakuya was in the same unit as that Riselia girl, so it followed they’d received tickets for adjacent spots. Arle and Tessera bought popcorn and drinks from a passing trolley and settled in.</p>
<p>“Did you come here alone? No one’s watching you?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m here by myself. I come to watch the matches here all the time.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>A thousand years ago, even in relatively peaceful countries like the Rognas Kingdom, abductors wandered the outskirts of the cities. A girl walking about unsupervised was unthinkable. However, things were different in the Seventh Assault Garden, and this was Excalibur Academy, likely the safest place in the city.</p>
<p><em>Although technically, I</em> am <em>in a criminal organization.</em></p>
<p>Remembering that made Arle gloomy. She’d joined to learn the Dark Lord Zol Vadis’s identity, but she’d since become the Demon Wolf Pack’s designated bodyguard.</p>
<p><a id="page-103"/>The screen displayed each school’s representatives.</p>
<p><em>How does this work, exactly? Do they use spirits or familiars to project this image through some kind of Farsight sorcery?</em></p>
<p>It boggled Arle’s mind to consider how developed present-day magical apparatuses were.</p>
<p><em>Why were the ancient ways of sorcery discarded, and how did all of this technology advance?</em></p>
<p>While she thought on it…</p>
<p>“H-hey, what’s that?”</p>
<p>“I—I don’t know. How did it get in here…?”</p>
<p>…Arle heard a minor commotion from the seats behind her. Upon turning around, she saw…</p>
<p>“What? A-a dog?!” Arle nearly dropped her popcorn.</p>
<p>…a large hound with pitch-black fur walking among the stands. It carried itself with the gait of a king, as though expecting all others to vacate its path.</p>
<p>Arle frowned suspiciously. <em>Why is there a dog here?</em></p>
<p>“Ah, Fluffymaru!” Tessera got up and waved to the beast.</p>
<p>“…Fluffy?” Arle repeated, confused.</p>
<p>The dog noticed Tessera and approached. It obediently took a spot next to the girl.</p>
<p>“Did you come to watch like we did, Fluffymaru?” she asked.</p>
<p><em>“Woof…,”</em> the great hound barked.</p>
<p>“You know this dog?” Arle questioned.</p>
<p>Tessera nodded while rubbing under Fluffymaru’s chin. “Yes. He comes to the orphanage sometimes to play.”</p>
<p>“I…see…” Arle gazed at Fluffymaru.</p>
<p>She liked animals, as all elves did, yet an instinct told her to remain on guard around this black dog. He reminded her too much of another… The Black Wolf Emperor, who was the Undead King’s trusted companion. Blackas Shadow Prince struck terror in the kingdom’s army with his jaws of death.</p>
<p><a id="page-104"/>Of course, this couldn’t possibly be him… But that dark fur, creeping night given form, and those golden eyes… Arle couldn’t help but think of that fearsome demon.</p>
<p>“D-does he bite?” Arle asked cautiously.</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid. Fluffymaru is a good boy,” Tessera replied, still scratching the animal’s chin. It closed its eyes in satisfaction.</p>
<p><em>R-right. Blindly fearing this hound wouldn’t do.</em></p>
<p>Arle calmed herself and returned her attention to the large screen. No sooner had she done so than a familiar face appeared.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s Big Sis Riselia!” Tessera leaned forward and pointed.</p>
<p>The screen showed portrait shots of each member of the eighteenth platoon, the characteristics of their respective Holy Swords, and graphs detailing statistics calculated from practice matches.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Now then,”</span></strong> a commentator’s voice boomed. <strong><span class="special">“This is a group that’s drawn a lot of attention. It’s Excalibur Academy’s special entry squad. Riselia Crystalia, the leader of the eighteenth platoon and my eternal rival, is on the screen right now. Why, I recall our first meeting. It was some ten years ago, when I was pursuing a giant lizard that escaped one of Duke Crystalia’s parties—”</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Er, Miss Fenris, please keep your commentary impartial.”</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“What are you saying, President?! I haven’t even begun my stor—mmmg!”</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“My apologies for this shameful broadcast, good listeners.”</span></strong></p>
<p>After a bit of static, the commentary ended.</p>
<p>The stadium’s spectators were all riled up by the introduction of Excalibur Academy’s representatives.</p>
<p>“Look, look! That boy is so cute. <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/> How old is he?”</p>
<p>“He’s only ten. If we just let him sit for a few more years…he might be ripe for the picking.”</p>
