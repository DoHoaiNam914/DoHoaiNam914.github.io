<p><a id="page-106"/>“Cute boys like that grow up to be Dark Lords in the bedroom.”</p>
<p>Arle overheard some nearby girls wearing Excalibur Academy uniforms discussing a boy who’d come on-screen. It seemed he was rather popular among…</p>
<p>“Leo…”</p>
<p>Arle glanced at Tessera, who gazed at the screen with rosy cheeks.</p>
<p><em>Oh my. She’s a precocious one, isn’t she?</em> Arle chuckled.</p>
<p>A girl in love. Arle envied Tessera a little. Having been raised as a hero since infancy, she had never been allowed to experience romance. Arle’s thoughts drifted to her past, one thousand years ago. The visage of her fellow apprentice, who’d studied under the same master as her, came to mind. She’d always admired him for working so hard to save the world.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps…he was my first love.</em></p>
<p>Yet the hero she’d once admired had gone on to become a Dark Lord who threatened humanity.</p>
<p><em>Wh-what am I thinking?! I can’t believe myself…</em></p>
<p>The elf girl shook her head vigorously and focused her attention on the screen.</p>

<p class="space-break">The Imperial Standard Time was 10:40.</p>
<p>Sitting beneath the glow of the underground silo’s mana lamps, Riselia and her platoon awaited the signal for the match to start. Riselia and Elfiné were huddled around their terminals, discussing strategy. Regina was leaning on a wall doing stretches, while Sakuya munched on a famous Sakura Orchid food called a sushi roll. Shary, disguised as Leonis, snuck longing glances at Sakuya’s snack.</p>
<p><a id="page-107"/>“Starting underground is kind of an advantage. The other teams are gonna have a harder time finding us,” Regina said.</p>
<p>Riselia shook her head calmly. “Not necessarily. If we had a locational advantage, you’d be right, but an Assault Garden’s underground passages are long and winding. Fighting down here will demand different tactics than if we were aboveground.”</p>
<p>They’d have to analyze countless underground routes to guess at what opposing squads might do. Compared to the surface, where large fights would break out almost as soon as the match began, this station would require the eighteenth platoon to deploy members more cautiously.</p>
<p>“Also, anywhere below the fourth underground level is considered off-limits,” Elfiné cautioned while showing everyone the map on her terminal. “The linear rail tracks are down there, and they don’t want us to damage them.”</p>
<p>The Holy Sword Dance Festival allowed participants to bring their terminals, but their communication features were limited outside specific areas. This was meant to mimic the kind of EMP (Excessive Mana Pulse) jamming they might encounter in real combat against the Voids.</p>
<p>Regina tapped her chin with a finger. “I wonder which other groups are nearby.”</p>
<p>“I think we can rule out the other Excalibur Academy representatives,” Riselia replied. “And Princess Chatres’s unit is likely on the surface, so we won’t run into them soon.”</p>
<p>Highly rated units were set on the surface so they would clash early on and get the audience excited. From the higher-ups’ perspective, it was foolish to put the winning team—Chatres’s in particular—underground. The princess was too popular and charismatic.</p>
<p>“I mentioned it during this morning’s meeting, but,” Elfiné <a id="page-108"/>said in a hushed-up voice, wary of the surveillance drones, “we should probably be careful of the Fourth Assault Garden’s Academia unit.”</p>
<p>The Academia was an institute primarily for Holy Sword researchers, and its teams rarely scored highly at the Holy Sword Dance Festival. Its top-ranked students were very capable, but they didn’t draw the same attention as the large-scale Excalibur Academy or the elite students of Halcyon Academy.</p>
<p>However, Count Deinfraude Phillet governed the Fourth Assault Garden, and Finzel Phillet was an Academia alumnus.</p>
<p>“It’s possible research for the Demon Sword Project was conducted at the Academia. I doubt they’ll try to do something during an event as major as the Holy Sword Dance Festival, but we should keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>There was a minute left until the match began. Riselia got to her feet, her expression serious. Shary, naturally still disguised as Leonis, took her sleeve.</p>
<p>“Miss Selia.”</p>
<p>“…What’s wrong, Leo? Do you want a sweet?”</p>
<p>“No,” Shary replied, exasperated. “I’ve already told you this, but remember that I will only be able to offer minimal support.”</p>
<p>Riselia nodded. “That’s fine. I’ll show you how much stronger I am from all that training.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Shary averted her gaze. “If nothing else, I will admit you have guts. You worked very hard.”</p>
<p>“Th-thanks.” Riselia smiled sheepishly.</p>
<p>At 11:00 Imperial Standard Time, the horn signaling the start of the Holy Sword Dance Festival echoed over the Eighth Assault Garden.</p>
<p>“““Holy Sword—Activate!”””</p>
<p>The members of the eighteenth platoon all spoke the words as one, manifesting their Holy Swords. Regina’s Drag Striker, <a id="page-109"/>Sakuya’s Raikirimaru, Elfiné’s Eye of the Witch, and Riselia’s Bloody Sword. “Leonis” likewise conjured the replica of the Staff of Sealed Sins, which was registered as his Holy Sword.</p>
<p>What made this event different from the usual interschool bouts was the ability to disqualify an opponent by destroying their Holy Sword. Once a Holy Sword was broken, it was forbidden for its wielder to call it back. Additionally, all competitors had to have their Holy Swords manifested constantly.</p>
<p>Riselia glanced at Regina, Elfiné, and Leonis as she spoke. “As previously discussed, we’ll head out to claim core flags.” Once the three of them nodded, Riselia’s eyes went to Sakuya. “We’re counting on you.”</p>
<p>“Yes, understood. I’ll do my best to keep moving.” Sakuya brandished Raikirimaru lightly.</p>
<p>Sakuya’s role was to go up to the surface alone and scout enemy teams. If possible, she would use hit-and-run tactics to keep opponents distracted. Essentially, she was a hyper-offensive decoy. Having the strongest member of the eighteenth platoon operating solo would hopefully disrupt the opposing squads. This kind of tactic was only possible thanks to Sakuya’s overwhelming skills and Raikirimaru’s powers over acceleration.</p>
<p>“Don’t blame me if I sweep the whole match, though,” Sakuya boasted.</p>
<p>“Be careful not to get too involved in any fights. Your main role is to scout and cause disarray,” Riselia reminded her with a strained smile. “All right. Let’s go!” Riselia raised her voice dignifiedly, the Bloody Sword in her hand.</p>

<p class="space-break">At the same time…</p>
<p>Elysion Academy’s first platoon members, led by Chatres Ray <a id="page-110"/>O’ltriese, activated their Holy Swords. They stood at the heart of the Central Garden.</p>
<p>“As expected, everyone’s eyes are on the princess,” a young man shouldering a hunting gun–type Holy Sword remarked flippantly. “I’m sure they’re getting lots of flattering pictures of you, Silver-Blooded Sword Princess.”</p>
<p>Three drones buzzed around the area.</p>
<p>“We don’t have time for chatter, Colt.” Chatres glared at the young man coldly, and he went silent immediately.</p>
<p>As frivolous as Colt appeared, he was a first-rate sniper. Unsurprisingly, each member of Chatres’s squad was a skilled elite, fully devoted and obedient to the princess. They were disciplined and moved with precision according to her orders.</p>
<p>That Chatres could skillfully unite and command a group of idiosyncratic talents was due to more than her royal status. It was because all her teammates recognized her overwhelming prowess. The members of Chatres’s platoon were her faithful pawns on the battlefield.</p>
<p>A commander couldn’t have asked for better fighters. However, that meant the blame for a loss all fell upon Chatres. She had long since accepted that intense pressure, though.</p>
<p>The three royal houses were meant to serve as a banner for humanity to unite under in the war against the Voids. If Chatres couldn’t handle this challenge, then she had no place among royalty.</p>
<p>“Ah, I’ve detected something. Some bugs hiding in a large building in Area IV,” a girl reported in a carefree tone. She was holding a terminal and used a scanner-type Holy Sword.</p>
<p>“Which unit are they from?”</p>
<p>“The St. Eluminas Monastery’s fourth choir. Their Holy Swords’ abilities are—”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, I know all their abilities,” Chatres cut in, shaking her head.</p>
<p><a id="page-111"/>“Running into us right away is pretty bad luck for them,” a tall man with a stern expression remarked. He was from a family line that served House O’ltriese. “Should I use my Holy Sword to level the enemy base, Your Highness?”</p>
<p>“No, I’ll do it. The audience needs a demonstration.”</p>
<p>To Chatres, winning the Holy Sword Dance Festival was a matter of duty. And victory alone wasn’t enough. She needed to show off her incredible power and crush all opponents directly. Doing so would boost the royal family’s authority and better secure its status as the guardian and hope of the entire human race.</p>
<p>Chatres drew her Holy Sword in a fluid motion, letting the silver broadsword reflect the sunlight. “Holy Sword—Ragna Nova.” She held the weapon up and then swung it down at once. A flash of light ran across the sky for a moment.</p>
<p><em>Booooooooom!</em></p>
<p>Far in the distance, a building was severed in half, its top section collapsing and crashing to the ground.</p>
<p>“Princess, they might scold us if you go too hard,” Colt whispered, looking exasperated.</p>
<p>“I made sure it wasn’t a direct blow. No one participating would be foolish enough to get caught and die in an attack like that.” Chatres lowered her shining sword.</p>
<p>“No, er, I mean we’ll lose points for destroying buildings…”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter. A single core flag will negate that.”</p>
<p>The princess had destroyed the building to demonstrate her might to the audience. The Holy Sword Dance Festival’s organizers wanted Chatres to put on a spectacle.</p>
<p>“Now, the hunt is on. And our target”—Chatres looked up at the clear sky—“is the leader of Excalibur Academy’s eighteenth platoon, Riselia Crystalia.”</p>
