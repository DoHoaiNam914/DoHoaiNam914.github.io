<p class="noindent">“A Void attack alarm?!”</p>
<p>Riselia and Chatres both looked up. They saw a tear form in the sky and rapidly expand.</p>
<p>“N-no… A crack that big…,” Riselia whispered in disbelief.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but it seems our match ends here.” Chatres lowered her Holy Sword, a severe expression on her face. She’d looked just as taken aback as Riselia, but only for a moment. “This is an emergency. You two are hereby under my command. We need to regroup with the units from the other schools participating in the Holy Sword Dance Festival, leave this place, and return to the capital to defend the civilians.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes! Understood!” Riselia responded.</p>
<p>The two climbed out of the pit formed by the Drag Howl shot and returned to the surface.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“You all right, princess?”</span></strong> a voice asked from Chatres’s terminal. “Looks like we’ve got trouble.”</p>
<p>“Colt, I’m joining up with the eighteenth platoon for now. Where are you?”</p>
<p>“The pesky buggers have us surrounded. There’s too many of them.”</p>
<p><a id="page-146"></a>“Any chance you can break through?”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“We’re the fearsome princess’s first platoon. So long as we have old Balthus and Mifa on our side, we’ll kick these monsters’ backsides no problem.”</span></strong></p>
<p>“Good, it’s reassuring to hear that. Then you should all go assist the other units and head for the Area III coupling bridge. We’ll regroup there.”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Huh… Wait, what about you?”</span></strong></p>
<p>Chatres ended the call without answering. Voids were gushing out of the crack in the sky overhead.</p>
<p>“Damn Voids…,” the princess spat. Then she turned to Riselia and Regina. “We’ll make for Area III as we return to the capital. Contact your allies while you still can. It won’t be long until communications become unstable.”</p>

<p class="space-break">The mana lighting in the underground passage turned red, and a shrill siren howled in the distance. Elfiné pulled Shary, who was disguised as Leonis, by the hand, as they made their way back to the surface.</p>
<p><em>It looks like the situation took a turn for the worse.</em></p>
<p>Voids must have attacked the capital.</p>
<p><em>“Can you hear me, Shary?”</em> a voice called telepathically.</p>
<p><em>“Yes, Lord Blackas,”</em> she replied.</p>
<p><em>“Those cursed monsters are threatening the kingdom. I am protecting Lord Magnus’s school with the three Champions of Rognas, so destroying the monstrosities in the capital falls to you.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Understood!”</em> Shary replied, forming a copy shaped like Leonis from her shadow.</p>
<p>She let her fingers slip away from Elfiné’s grasp and disappeared, swapping places with the decoy.</p>
<p><a id="page-147"></a><em>Let’s begin.</em></p>
<p>Shary returned to her maid-uniformed appearance, held up her Refisca dagger, and vanished into the dark.</p>

<p class="space-break">Chatres led the charge, with Riselia and Regina following close after.</p>
<p>“Miss Finé…do you read?!” Riselia had tried calling a few times.</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“…Yes…I…hear you…”</span></strong></p>
<p>The transmission finally got through. Elfiné’s voice came through Riselia’s earring, though it was heavily interspersed with static.</p>
<p>“A gigantic tear in space appeared over the Eighth Assault Garden. Regina and I are under Princess Chatres’s command and are heading for the capital as we speak.”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Roger. Leo and I will…the surface…administrative bureau…and then regroup…”</span></strong></p>
<p>“All right. Be careful out there.”</p>
<p><strong><span class="special">“Yes. You too, Selia.”</span></strong></p>
<p>After ending the call, Riselia quickened her pace to run alongside Chatres.</p>
<p>“Do you have any thoughts, Riselia Crystalia?” Chatres asked, her eyes fixed on the rupture in the sky.</p>
<p>“It looks like the prelude to a Stampede.”</p>
<p>“I see. You two have experienced a few of those, after all,” Chatres muttered. “So if this is a Stampede, it means a Void Lord is liable to appear.”</p>
<p>“Lady Selia, look…!” Regina exclaimed sharply from a few paces back.</p>
<p><em>Crack, crack, crack…!</em></p>
<p><a id="page-148"></a>A fresh fracture ran through the air directly ahead, and Voids swiftly emerged from within.</p>
<p>“Do we take a detour?” Riselia asked Chatres.</p>
<p>“No, we power through. Follow me!” the princess declared, racing forward as she held her Holy Sword ready.</p>
<p>“Hyahhhhhh!”</p>
<p>The Ragna Nova grew to a length of fifty meltes, and Chatres swiped it through the swarm.</p>
<p><em>Whooooooosh!</em></p>
<p>“Wow!” Riselia could only gawk in amazement. If Chatres had brought that power to bear against her, she wouldn’t have stood a chance.</p>
<p>“I can’t make use of that repeatedly,” Chatres confessed, shaking her head. “The larger I make the blade, the more of my power it consumes. We need to break through quickly. Regina Mercedes, cover me.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Regina looked shocked by the order.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Chatres questioned.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s just… You know my name…?”</p>
<p>“I know the names of all the Holy Sword Dance Festival participants. As one should.”</p>
<p>“Ah, r-right…!” Regina nodded hurriedly.</p>
<p>“Dance, my drenched blade—Bloody Petal Spiral!” Riselia swung the Bloody Sword, cutting down the remaining Voids.</p>
<p>Fly-shaped Voids dove from above, only for Regina to accurately pick them out of the air.</p>
<p>“Hyahhhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>Chatres forged ahead, cleaving through every foe in her way. Together, the three managed to reach Area III, and from there, they moved to the Central Garden’s main street.</p>
<p>“Wait. There’s a unit under attack somewhere,” Chatres said sharply as she slew a Void standing in her way.</p>
<p><a id="page-149"></a>“…?!”</p>
<p>At the very center of a ruined plaza at the heart of the Central Garden was a tear in space that was expanding by the second. Beneath it stood a group of Holy Swordsman, motionless and surrounded by Voids.</p>
<p>“That garb. Are they from the St. Eluminas Monastery?” Riselia wondered.</p>
<p>“Yes, so it seems. Let’s help them.”</p>
<p>“Okay!”</p>
<p>Chatres raced forward, the Ragna Nova in hand. Riselia kept the pace, deploying a barrier of blood blades… But then she paused. She sensed something amiss.</p>
<p><em>…?</em></p>
<p>She had nothing to go on but intuition, yet anxiety gripped her heart. The St. Eluminas Monastery unit surrounded by the Voids…didn’t look like they were under attack. If anything, they appeared to be commanding the monstrous things…</p>
<p>Chatres cleaved through the Voids and reached the group first. She knelt by a frightened girl wearing a cassock.</p>
<p>“Are you all right? Are any of you injured?” Chatres inquired gently.</p>
<p>“W-we’re fine. You saved us, Your Highness…” The girl looked up with terror in her eyes. “You came at just the right time. I just thought I needed more Demon Swords to add to the pyre.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“Princess Chatres!” Riselia cried.</p>
<p>The girl’s red lips twisted into a grin.</p>
<p>“Wha—?”</p>
<p><em>Slash!</em></p>
<p>Something akin to spider legs burst from the girl’s back, one of which pierced Chatres.</p>
<p>“Khhk… Ahhh…!”</p>
<p><a id="page-150"></a>Blood spurted from the princess’s body, dyeing her Elysion Academy uniform crimson. Her body was hurled through the air, collapsing hard upon the ground.</p>
<p>“Your Highness!” Riselia shouted in alarm.</p>
<p>A puddle of blood formed beneath Chatres. The girl with the spider legs sprouting from her back looked down on the princess, wearing an ecstatic expression.</p>
<p>“Oh my, my, my! You’re so foolish, Your Highness!” The facade of the girl melted away, revealing pale skin, deep red eyes, and a black dress. “How kind of you to offer yourself up as a sacrifice!”</p>
<p>“Hrahhhhhhh!” Riselia lunged with the Bloody Sword.</p>
<p>She had no idea what had just happened, but protecting Chatres was her primary instinct in this situation.</p>
<p>“Heh… Heh-heh-heh…,” the woman snickered, blocking the incoming blade at the last second. “Very good. Brave girls are the most delectable.”</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p><em>Clangggg!</em></p>
<p>The woman arranged the spider legs extending from her back in a pattern reminiscent of a rib cage to shield herself.</p>
<p>“Just who are you?” Riselia demanded.</p>
<p>“Heh. I’m an apostle. A follower of the goddess from the other side of this tear.”</p>
<p>“Apostle?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The ninth apostle, Iris Void Priestess.”</p>
<p>“Void? You mean this fracture…?!”</p>
<p>“That’s right, I opened the gate. Although in truth, I only gave the first push. The real fun is what comes next.”</p>
<p>Riselia didn’t understand a single word this woman was saying. “Regina, take care of Princess Chatres!” she called over her shoulder while pushing her sword against the spider legs.</p>
<p>“But, Lady Selia, what about you?”</p>
<p><a id="page-151"></a>“I’ll stall her here. Please hurry. Princess Chatres is a symbol of hope for all the civilians and Holy Swordsmen. We can’t afford to lose her…!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Regina hesitated for a moment and then bit her lip. “Understood. Please be careful.” She hoisted Chatres’s limp, bloodied body over her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m not going to let you get away,” Iris said before leaping into the air.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>An intense mana glow converged in the woman’s hand.</p>
<p>“Fifth-order spell—Vars Farga!”</p>
<p><em>Booooom!</em></p>
<p>The spell produced a powerful explosion, and a giant pillar of fire erupted around Riselia.</p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha-ha! Ah-ha-ha-ha! Don’t tell me that was enough to kill yo—What?!”</p>
<p>Iris Void Priestess’s shrill laughter was cut short. Crimson light—brighter than the flames—emerged. A dress billowed, untouched by the inferno.</p>
<p>“Go, Regina! I’ll take care of her!”</p>
<p>After she’d donned the True Ancestor’s Dress, Riselia’s mana surged furiously.</p>

<p class="space-break">“You irritating flies. This land will one day be my lord’s territory,” Shary spat coldly as she threw a dagger.</p>
<p>Hopping from one building’s shadow to another’s, she slew the insect-like Voids that appeared from the cracks. Landing on a rooftop, she looked up at the giant tear overhead. Voids spilled from it ceaselessly.</p>
