<p class="noindent">“—You’re still looking with your eyes. There’s no point unless you sense them with mana.”</p>
<p>“O-okay!” Riselia replied energetically under the blazing sun.</p>
<p>She and the others were at a large, anti-Void weapons training facility, part of the Shangri-la Resort and thus owned by the Phillet Corporation.</p>
<p>The exercise was quite simple. Leonis unleashed mana spheres, and Riselia had to dodge them. At first, she could keep up, but evading became more challenging as the number of orbs increased. While she escaped direct hits, she quickly grew exhausted.</p>
<p>“Haah, haah, haah…,” Riselia panted.</p>
<p>“Is this as far as you can go? If this kind of training is enough to make you throw in the towel—”</p>
<p>“…N-not yet! Give me more, please!” Riselia called out, wiping the sweat off her jaw.</p>
<p>“Well, you’ve got the right attitude, if nothing else. This time, I think I’ll get serious.”</p>
<p>“Huhhhhhh?!”</p>
<p>It was only then that Riselia understood. <em>Leo’s been holding back this whole time!</em></p>
<p><a id="page-36"></a>“Go, go, Lady Selia! Keep it up, Lady Selia!” a voice encouraged from nearby.</p>
<p>Riselia turned around, only to find…</p>
<p>“R-Regina?! What are you doing?!”</p>
<p>“I’m cheering you on, Lady Selia! <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/> Go, go, Lady Selia! <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>”</p>
<p>Regina jumped around energetically with pompoms in her hands. For some reason, she’d changed into a cheerleader outfit and appeared to be enjoying it thoroughly.</p>
<p>“S-stop it, this is embarrassing…!” Riselia chided her.</p>
<p>“If anything, I’m the one who should be embarrassed…,” Regina replied.</p>
<p>“Then apologize and stop it!”</p>
<p>“Turning your back, are you? Let’s add some more balls, then,” Leonis said, producing countless mana spheres that sped at Riselia.</p>
<p>Sometime later…</p>
<p>“Here, Lady Selia. A drink.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Regina.”</p>
<p>…Riselia, lying faceup on the ground, accepted a sports drink from Regina and gulped it down.</p>
<p>Leonis shrugged. “That should do for morning training.”</p>
<p>“M-morning training…?”</p>
<p>“That was just a warm-up. Our session later will be even more demanding,” Leonis stated mercilessly.</p>
<p>“Huh…?” Riselia whimpered. “Real Leo, please come back already…”</p>
<p>It was quite unusual to hear Riselia whine aloud.</p>
<p>“Kid, I want to rest a bit. I’m exhausted from all this cheering,” Regina said.</p>
<p>“Very well. Use this break to rest up.”</p>
<p>Immediately, Riselia sat up. “Why are you so soft on Regina?!”</p>
<p><a id="page-37"></a>For some odd reason, this fake Leonis seemed to hold Regina in high regard.</p>
<p>“We’ll be meeting up with Miss Finé and Sakuya during the afternoon, right?” Regina asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, that was the plan, but…”</p>
<p>Sakuya had turned down the offer to train together, claiming she needed to do some independent practice. Her methods were unique, so that made sense. Typically, she spent her mornings in the woods behind the Hræsvelgr dorm, cutting falling leaves before they hit the ground or jumping between the trees.</p>
<p><em>Normal training probably doesn’t cut it for her.</em></p>

<p class="space-break">Camelot’s Area VI—the undeveloped sector. It was originally a generic expansion module for construction of the Third Assault Garden’s industrial production plants. However, the Third Assault Garden’s destruction six years ago had put that project on hold.</p>
<p>At present, it was used only as a dumping site for construction material. The Linear Rail ran to it to transport supplies. People hardly ever went out there.</p>
<p>Area VI appeared deserted, save for several Artificial Elementals made by the Phillet Company, which patrolled the area.</p>
<p>However, that was only on the surface. Deep below the undeveloped section was an entire underground world. Area VI’s bowels served as a home for smugglers, criminals, hooligans, anti-royalty terrorists, and even heretical sects that worshipped the Voids.</p>
<p>“Why doesn’t the empire’s army crush all these underground organizations?” a girl wondered as she walked down a tunnel illuminated by mana lamps.</p>
<p>Her name was Arle Kirlesio, an elf warrior with beautiful, <a id="page-38"></a>pointed ears and jade hair tied in a ponytail. Outwardly, she looked pretty young, but she was, in fact, a seasoned hero. And through some twist of fate that even she couldn’t explain adequately, she’d become part of a criminal organization.</p>
<p>Sakuya, who walked beside Arle, replied, “It could stomp them all out together, but it would mean suffering losses. Plus, having them far from the capital’s center and gathered in one place makes them easier to handle. The army has quashed a few criminal sects before, but it only made them break into more extreme factions and spread to other Assault Gardens.”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>Arle recalled that the group she’d fallen in with, the Demon Wolf Pack, was originally an anti-royal terrorist organization.</p>
<p>“Looks like that’s the place.” Sakuya looked up from her map and pointed ahead.</p>
<p>An intense neon mana glow shone at the far end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>“Are we really going to charge in?” Arle asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. No offense to my upperclassmen, but normal training isn’t enough for me. I’m more suited to learning through live combat.”</p>
<p>“Er…I see. But why did I have to come along, too?” Arle eyed the other girl, pouting.</p>
<p>This was the first time Sakuya had contacted Arle via her terminal. The elf hero still wasn’t sure why.</p>
<p>“I figured I’d get lost on my own, and you looked like you had time on your hands,” Sakuya reasoned, shrugging.</p>
<p>“I—I do not have time on my hands. I’ll have you know I’ve been very busy investigating the Dark Lord’s identity!” Arle countered.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Dark Lord Zol Vadis hadn’t contacted the Demon Wolf Pack in the last few days, so her efforts had turned up little.</p>
<p><a id="page-39"></a>“Besides, you’re the only friend I have who knows this side of me.” Sakuya pulled a fox mask from her chest and smiled.</p>
<p>“Wh-what do you mean? W-wait, friend?” Arle’s ears perked up.</p>
<p>Sakuya cocked her head. “Aren’t we friends?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Hmm… W-well… Yes, I suppose? I guess we are…friends.” Arle mouthed the word awkwardly, a blush creeping over her cheeks.</p>
<p>A friend. In all her life, she’d never had anyone she could address as such.</p>
<p>Arle had been chosen at birth by one of the Arc Seven to shoulder the duty of saving the world. Her elf village had left her in the care of the Swordmaster of the Six Heroes.</p>
<p>“W-well, if you need me my help that badly, I suppose I’ll escort you…”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I don’t know if it’s appropriate compensation, but…” Sakuya grinned, pulling a ticket from her pocket and handing it to Arle.</p>
<p>“…What’s this?”</p>
<p>“A spectator ticket for the Holy Sword Dance Festival. They gave them out to the participants.”</p>
<p>“I can have this?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’d be glad if you came to watch.”</p>
<p>“H-hmph…” Arle eyed the ticket. “I-I’ll take it. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to attend, however. I mean, I am busy… But we’re f-friends…and all…”</p>
<p>The pair continued toward their objective while discussing the upcoming event. They came upon a metallic door blocked behind a few stacked crates of supplies. Loud music, clattering, and shouts were audible from beyond.</p>
<p>“Let’s go in…”</p>
<p>Sakuya donned her festival fox mask and stepped inside. The <a id="page-40"></a>room past the door was much more spacious than either girl had expected. At one point, it had likely been a supply warehouse. A melody boomed, and a throng of rough-looking people shouted over the noise.</p>
<p>Arle frowned, her long ears flicking. “What a racket. It makes my ears hurt.”</p>
<p>Sakuya pushed straight through the crowd, approaching the center of the chamber. There, she and Arle saw a large fighting ring illuminated by many overhead lamps.</p>
<p>This was an underground arena where the city’s criminals gathered to test their mettle.</p>
<p>“Oh, what’s this? I don’t think girlies like you belong here.” A werewolf man with sharp claws grabbed Sakuya by the shoulder as she approached the ring.</p>
<p>“I want to fight, too,” she replied. “It’s open to anyone, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Stop fooling around, girl! The Black Fangs run this place!” the werewolf snarled at her.</p>
<p>“Activate.”</p>
<p>Argent light flashed through the darkness. Sakuya’s Raikirimaru cut the werewolf’s whiskers short.</p>
<p>“…What?!” The beastman froze, his eyes wide with astonishment.</p>
<p>The crowd broke into an uproar. Sakuya peered into the ring, Raikirimaru still crackling with lightning.</p>
<p>“Good, there are other Holy Swordsmen here…”</p>
<p>Sakuya’s gaze settled on a hulking man with a large broadsword alight with flames. Using Holy Swords in urban spaces was strictly forbidden outside of emergencies. This man may have been a member of some anti-government organization, or perhaps just a combat junkie who wanted the chance to wield his Holy Sword to his heart’s content.</p>
<p><em>Whoever he is doesn’t matter to me.</em></p>
<p>Sakuya stepped onto the ring and readied Raikirimaru. “Now, <a id="page-41"></a>which one of you wants to try me first? Or maybe…” She looked down on the people waiting to get into the ring. “You all want to come at me at once? I don’t mind…”</p>

<p class="space-break">A cybernetic Assault Garden, made up of electronic terminals—the Astral Garden. In this infinite space formed by a grid of geometric cubes, the Queen of the Night spread her wings, sailing elegantly through the air.</p>
<p>She wore an alluring black dress that boldly emphasized her cleavage, giving Elfiné an appearance that would shock those who knew her. Elfiné herself had designed this avatar.</p>
<p><em>I can’t let Riselia and the others see me like this.</em></p>
<p>While she’d worn a witch costume during the Holy Light Festival, Elfiné wanted to don bold, sexy outfits like Riselia and the others more often. How would that boy react if he saw her as the Queen of the Night? Would his heart skip a beat, like when he saw Riselia’s provocative costume?</p>
<p><em>What a silly idea…</em></p>
<p>Before long, she discovered what she was looking for within the vast sea of information, a black cat hopping from grid to grid.</p>
<p>“Good work, Cait Sith.”</p>
<p>It was an Artificial Elemental that Elfiné had created from one of the Eye of the Witch orbs. She’d asked Leonis to slip it into a Phillet-owned casino so that it might infiltrate the establishment’s main network. The Phillet Company’s base of operations was situated in Camelot’s Central Garden, and was supremely well-defended. Accessing records on the business’s Artificial Elementals would be challenging, even for Efliné.</p>
<p><em>Hopefully, this confidential data from my brother’s casino will give me a way in, though…</em></p>
