<p><a id="page-90"/>“May my rage burn the world away, hastening the time of ruin…!”</p>
<p>Just as the ice barrier encasing Shardark shattered…</p>
<p>“Eleventh-order destruction spell—Meld Magnus!”</p>
<p><em>Boooooooooooooom!</em></p>
<p>…destructive light covered the world. A swarm of Voids that emerged from a tear in space evaporated instantly. And…</p>
<p><em>Crack, crack, crack…</em></p>
<p>…the cracks around Shardark Void Lord multiplied.</p>
<p><em>“…Leo…nis…”</em></p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Within the surging red flames, the Void Lord…called his name.</p>
<p><em>“Are you…the…successor…?”</em></p>
<p>For a moment, Leonis thought he saw his teacher’s eye regain the intellect it possessed when it still belonged to a hero. Shardark reached out, as though to grasp something, then vanished into a tear in space.</p>
<p><em>Crack, crack, crack…</em></p>
<p>The fracture that swallowed Shardark began to eat into the ground. It grew, threatening to swallow the sky. The world was breaking, transformed into a shattered palace of glass.</p>
<p>Leonis’s eyes widened in alarm as he peered overhead.</p>
<p><em>…That’s…! Could it be?!</em></p>
<p>“Leo, we have to run!”</p>
<p>“What are you dawdling for? At this rate, we’ll be overtaken, too!”</p>
<p>Veira and Rivaiz both warned him, yet Leonis stayed put and spoke with conviction. “We should let it. It’s probably…”</p>
<p>“Huh?! Leo!”</p>
<p>The canopy of the sky crumbled…and the world inverted.</p>

<p class="space-break"><a id="page-91"/>The surroundings changed immediately.</p>
<p>Leonis shook his head lightly and looked around. He wasn’t in the crater where Ironblood Castle had stood, but in a forest full of dense trees. Sunlight was beginning to color the dim sky.</p>
<p>“…Where are we?” Veira whispered behind him. Turning around, Leonis saw the crimson-haired girl eyeing him with a confused expression. “Were we thrown to another world again?” she asked.</p>
<p>“…No. This is probably our original one,” Leonis replied. “I saw the stars through the crack in space…”</p>
<p>“Stars?”</p>
<p>“Yes…” Leonis nodded and glanced up at the sky visible through the forest canopy.</p>
<p>The Star of Calamity shone ominously as the heavens grew bright. Entering that fracture in reality had been a gamble.</p>
<p><em>But we managed to find a way back.</em></p>
<p>They’d failed to pursue the Devil of the Underworld, but there was little alternative.</p>
<p>“Undead King, where did the Swordmaster disappear to?” Rivaiz descended from the air, her water mantle fluttering.</p>
<p>“If he’s not here, then perhaps he used the tear to travel elsewhere,” Leonis replied, shaking his head.</p>
<p>The Voids likely used those fractures to freely traverse dimensions, but if that was the case…it made no sense that they appeared and disappeared so irregularly, like fog. If the Voids could move so easily, humanity would have been driven to extinction by now.</p>
<p>“Why did the Swordmaster of the Six Heroes… Why did he appear there?”</p>
<p>“…Good question. I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Shardark had definitely reacted to the goddess’s voice, but what he’d come there to do was unclear. Maybe he’d long since lost all sense of purpose and had gone mad from the emptiness eating <a id="page-92"/>away at his soul, and so he’d been drawn to this remnant of his old nemesis.</p>
<p>“What was that world…?” Rivaiz muttered.</p>
<p>A red sky. A wasteland that expanded endlessly. Swarms of countless Voids. Leonis speculated that world was the source of the Voids, but what were the ruins of the Lord of Beasts’ citadel doing there? And why did he hear the voice of the deceased goddess…?</p>
<p>Leonis reflexively gripped the Staff of Sealed Sins. The Devil of the Underworld and Duke Crystalia. The Azure Hold. The Void world. The goddess’s voice. The Ironblood Castle ruins that shouldn’t have been there.</p>
<p>Something connected all these pieces.</p>
<p><em>Azra-Ael must have the answer.</em></p>
<p>For now, Leonis was back in his world, and another matter demanded his attention.</p>
<p><em>I can’t leave my kingdom unattended for long.</em></p>
<p>It wouldn’t do to leave Blackas and Shary in charge of everything. Leonis thought of his minion. It had been only a few days, yet he felt oddly wistful.</p>
<p><em>I did promise, after all.</em></p>
<p>Leonis retrieved his terminal from his pocket.</p>
<p>“All right. Where are we?”</p>
<p>He tried activating the device, but it didn’t provide any information on the surrounding area. The magical apparatuses of this era weren’t of much use unless they were within range of an Assault Garden.</p>
<p>“If you’re looking for a human city, you’ll find one that way,” Veira said, pointing toward the dawn.</p>
<p>“Are you certain?” Leonis asked.</p>
<p>“Of course I am,” the Dragon Lord replied, grinning and placing her hands on her waist. “Dragons fly by watching the positions of the stars.”</p>
<p><a id="page-93"/>“How far is it?”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know that much.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Leonis nodded. “Then I must return to the capital. I’m wary of Azra-Ael’s plans, but I have a promise to keep.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I bet that minion of yours is worried about you,” Veira teased.</p>
<p>“I will go after the Devil of the Underworld,” Rivaiz decided. “I must reclaim my leviathan.”</p>
<p>“Me too. He still has the Azure Hold… Though for all we know, Azra-Ael and the Azure Hold aren’t in this world at all,” Veira remarked.</p>
<p>“If his objective is to collect the Dark Lords, he will have to return. Knowing as much, we should inspect the lands where the remaining Dark Lords slumber.”</p>
<p>“True.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. I will seek the Lord of Beasts’ resting place.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Let us know if you find anything.”</p>
<p>Leonis summoned his skull dragon from the Realm of Shadows and hopped onto its back. “Don’t be careless. There’s no telling what Azra-Ael might be planning,” he warned the other two.</p>
<p>“Hmph. I’ll reduce him to ashes next time,” Veira declared.</p>
<p>The skull dragon flapped its wings and took off toward the sun.</p>

<p class="space-break">It was evening. Having finished her exercises for the day, Riselia returned to her room in the hotel, where she changed out of her training outfit and into her underwear. She collapsed on the sofa.</p>
<p>“I…I think…I’m done for…”</p>
<p>She whined most uncharacteristically, her hair disheveled. Normally, Riselia wouldn’t act so undisciplined, even with no one <a id="page-94"/>watching. But she was utterly exhausted from multiple days of rigorous training.</p>
<p>On top of the eighteenth platoon’s team practice sessions, which Riselia herself had scheduled, she also had to spend every morning and evening suffering through special lessons. Worse yet, her instructor was quite unforgiving.</p>
<p>Riselia had improved at handling the True Ancestor’s Dress and controlling her mana circulation, but she couldn’t say by how much or if it would matter.</p>
<p>Lying atop the sofa, Riselia fidgeted in place uneasily, turning around to look up at the mana lamp lighting the room.</p>
<p>“When’s Leo coming back…?” she muttered.</p>
<p>Four days had passed since he left the capital. She’d messaged him on each one but never received a reply. Riselia kept a cup of pudding in the fridge, waiting for him in case he returned.</p>
<p>“Leo…”</p>
<p>Riselia played with the sofa’s buttons, pushing them in. She grabbed a cushion she used as a pillow and sank her fangs into it.</p>
<p>With puffed-up cheeks, she decided, “Not good enough.”</p>
<p>Riselia was frustrated. She tossed and turned on the sofa, still hugging the cushion. Eventually, her eyes settled on the half-open window. The curtain danced from the soft breeze. Outside, the sun was sinking, and the casino’s neon lights were sparking to life.</p>
<p>The girl stared vacantly at the fluttering curtain. He’d been gone for only a few days, but she missed him desperately…</p>
<p><em>Once Leo comes back, I’m going to suck a whole lot of blood from him.</em></p>
<p>Riselia hugged the cushion tightly. Her mana sizzled, making her heart throb.</p>
<p><em>Ba-dump. Ba-dump. Ba-dump.</em></p>
<p><em>Huh? I-I’m feeling, kind of… Huh?</em> Thinking about him made her cheeks flush. <em>N-no…Leo is, well, he’s ten years old… That’s not…</em></p>
<p>Riselia’s heart beat like a drum, and she felt her face grow hot.</p>
<p><a id="page-95"/>“…!”</p>
<p>The doorknob clicked.</p>
<p>“Leo?!” Riselia sat up at once.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’m not the kid. It’s your favorite maid, Lady Selia. <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>”</p>
<p>The door opened, revealing Regina in a maid’s uniform. She struck a strange, cute pose, her twintails bobbing.</p>
<p>“…Oh. It’s just you, Regina.” Riselia’s shoulders slumped in plain disappointment.</p>
<p>“You know, Lady Selia, that reaction kind of breaks my heart,” Regina muttered dispassionately.</p>
<p>“Ah, n-no, I’m sorry! I’m glad you’re here, Regina!”</p>
<p>The maid shrugged. “Hmm. Fine, I’ll forgive you. Anyway, it’s time for the meeting.”</p>
<p>“Oh, right. I’ll go prepare.”</p>
<p>Riselia got off the sofa and hurriedly changed into her uniform. As she put on her skirt, she looked out the window again. No one was there, of course. There was only the gently billowing curtain.</p>
<p><em>Leo…</em></p>

<p class="space-break">A petite shadow stood atop the Shangri-la Resort’s rooftop. Shary had dropped her Leonis disguise and was in her usual maid’s attire.</p>
<p>“My lord…”</p>
<p>Her hands were together, as though in prayer, while she watched the setting sun. Whenever Leonis went out to battle, Shary waited on Death Hold’s balcony to wish for her master’s safety.</p>
<p>She was confident of his victory, but that didn’t mean she wasn’t concerned. After all, at present, her master was in the vessel of a child.</p>
<p><em>And his opponent this time is the Lord of the Seas, touted as the strongest Dark Lord…</em></p>
<p><a id="page-96"/>Even with all her faith in Leonis and his powers, Shary couldn’t help but wonder if he would return unscathed this time.</p>
<p>“Are you worried for Lord Magnus?” a calm voice inquired.</p>
<p>Shary turned around, her gaze settling on a black wolf with golden eyes, standing in the shadow of the setting sun.</p>
<p>“Lord Blackas…”</p>
<p>Blackas stood alongside Shary, turning his eyes to the horizon.</p>
<p>“My friend is sure to return to his kingdom. All we can do is believe in him,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes, you’re right…” Shary bowed her head reverently.</p>
<p>“Incidentally, Shary, should Lord Magnus be late for the Holy Sword Dance Festival, it will fall to you to attend as his body double.”</p>
<p>She nodded. “I’ve made the necessary preparations.”</p>
<p>Shary had studied the rules thoroughly in preparation. A human combat festival was child’s play to one with the skills of a Septentrion assassin. She could win in a manner that wasn’t too spectacular or lose in a way that wasn’t too crushing.</p>
<p>The girl didn’t intend to throw the match, but she wasn’t planning on actively fighting. A needless show of her strength would attract undue attention to Leonis.</p>
<p>“I hope nothing happens, but the trifling fools who get in Lord Magnus’s way time and again might take advantage of the celebration. Bear that in mind.”</p>
<p>“Yes, understood.”</p>
<p>The Voids weren’t the only mysterious faction in this world. Past officers of the Dark Lords’ Armies, like Nefakess and Zemein, had reappeared in this era, and conspired against Leonis. Shary herself had been attacked and suffered an embarrassing defeat at the hands of one of their demonic assassins.</p>
<p><em>I won’t let it happen again…</em></p>
<p>With resolve in heart, Shary touched the ring in her pocket. <a id="page-97"/>Leonis had given it to her. It was capable of summoning the strongest being in the Dark Lords’ Armies. She’d used it once already, so the magic had faded, but it was still a dear treasure.</p>
<p><em>My lord, please… Be safe</em>, Shary prayed, her eyes fixed on the horizon.</p>

<p class="space-break">The days in Camelot came and went. The special training intensified as the Holy Sword Dance Festival approached. Fortunately, everyone showed clear signs of improving and maturing.</p>
<p>Before long, the day of the event arrived.</p>
