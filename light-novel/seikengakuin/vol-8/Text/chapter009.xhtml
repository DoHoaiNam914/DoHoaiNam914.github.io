<p class="noindent">“Hmmm-hmmm. <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/> Hmm-hm-hmmmm. <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>”</p>
<p>A lovely humming filled the hotel bathroom, with the jovial sounds of splashing water.</p>
<p>It was the morning of the eighteenth platoon’s third day in the capital. Shary, back in her natural form for the first time in a while, was enjoying a soak alone.</p>
<p>Normally, she cleansed herself at a spring within the Realm of Shadows. This time, however, she took advantage of the fact that she was staying at a high-class hotel and decided to enjoy the tub in Riselia’s room.</p>
<p>“Hmm-hm-hmmm. <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>”</p>
<p>After spending so much time as Leonis yesterday, she felt worn out. Of course, she was honored to serve as his body double, but having to keep up a convincing act was stressful.</p>
<p>Shary stretched her legs to help her stiff calves relax. A sweet aroma wafted from the rose petals scattered in the water. The time before Riselia Crystalia awoke was a brief respite for her.</p>
<p><em>The speed with which that girl grows is astounding.</em></p>
<p>It was only a few months ago that Leonis’s sorcery made her an undead. She was already mastering second-order offensive spells, an <a id="page-52"></a>impressive feat, even for a Vampire Queen. Surely the special training from Leonis and the Three Champions of Rognas played a part, but there was no doubting Riselia possessed exceptional raw potential.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it was more accurate to call it raw spirit? Whatever the exercise, Riselia endured, making her a good student. The girl differed drastically from the nobles Shary knew in the Realm of Shadows.</p>
<p><em>It pains me to admit it, but I can see why my lord is so taken with her.</em></p>
<p>The training had worn Shary out as well. She had to balance it with investigating the capital, keeping the Demon Wolf Pack under control, and her part-time job at the confectionery.</p>
<p><em>When my lord returns, I ought to demand donuts as a special reward. O-or maybe a…p-pat on the head?</em></p>
<p>Shary’s cheeks turned red, and she submerged the lower half of her face in the water, blowing bubbles.</p>
<p><em>My lord, when will you return…?</em></p>
<p>And that’s when…</p>
<p>“Leo? Are you in the bath?”</p>
<p>…Riselia’s voice called out from beyond the door.</p>
<p>“…?!” Shary jolted in alarm.</p>
<p><em>She’s up this early?!</em></p>
<p>Riselia’s adaptability was impressive. She’d been sleeping like a baby this time yesterday.</p>
<p>“I-I’ll be right out!” Shary changed her voice to Leonis’s and stood with a splash.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’m just stepping in to take a quick shower.”</p>
<p>“O-oh, I see… Wait, what?!”</p>
<p>The sliding door rattled as it opened to reveal a nude Riselia. Her silvery hair wavered in the steam.</p>
<p>“Ah! Ahhhhhh, whyyy?!” Shary exclaimed. “Why did you come in?!”</p>
<p>“…? I always bathe with Leo… Huh?”</p>
