<p><a id="page-97"/>Fenris, however, narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>“Leonis, I hear you’re living in the girls’ dormitory?”</p>
<p>“…Erm, yes.” Leonis admitted honestly, nodding.</p>
<p>“Riselia, I must question the legitimacy of letting him live in the girls’ dormitory.”</p>
<p>“Leo’s still a child,” Riselia said in a flustered hurry.</p>
<p>“But he’s a boy. Once he’s older, he could very well be a dark lord in the bedroom.”</p>
<p>“…L-Leo’s not like that! He’s a good boy. Right?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes…” Leonis nodded again, feeling his heart skip a beat.</p>
<p>It was only a short while ago he’d felt his pulse quicken at the sight of Riselia in a swimsuit.</p>
<p>“Whatever the case, should the executive committee find you’re somehow disregarding public morals, we will act,” Fenris declared, turning away.</p>
<p>Before she left, however…</p>
<p>“…Incidentally, I’ve heard you’ve awakened to your Holy Sword.” She stopped in her tracks and spun back to face them. “So if nothing else…I suppose I should say congratulations, Riselia Crystalia.”</p>
<p>“…Huh? Ah, thanks…,” Riselia muttered, as if Fenris’s words had somehow been anticlimactic.</p>
<p>Fenris scoffed and turned again, making a quick departure.</p>
<p>“Do you two have some kind of history?” Leonis asked.</p>
<p>“She’s a…childhood friend. Though she’s more like a bad itch I can’t get rid of…,” Riselia said, rubbing her temples.</p>
<p>The young woman was usually so responsible and mature, it was odd seeing her acting so childish.</p>
<p><em>I suppose their relationship is like my camaraderie with the Dragon Lord…</em></p>
<p>Something about Riselia’s brief confrontation with Fenris <a id="page-98"/>reminded Leonis of his tumultuous relationship with his nemesis from a thousand years ago. Oddly enough, the rivalry felt nostalgic to Leonis these days.</p>
<p>“Hey kid, look at all these gifts I got for Fluffymaru the Black!” Sakuya said gleefully, presenting the food she’d hidden under her sleeve.</p>
<p>““Put that back!”” Riselia and Elfiné demanded in unison.</p>

<p class="noindent"><em>…Princess Altiria isn’t at the party yet…?</em></p>
<p>Regina was wandering aimlessly through the corridor outside the party hall. While she possessed a fabricated invitation, the young woman had hesitated to actually cross the threshold. Had she not been dressed in Excalibur Academy’s uniform, Regina would’ve looked terribly suspicious.</p>
<p><em>Even if I go to the mixer, I won’t be able to talk to her…</em></p>
<p>A set of particular circumstances had led to Regina being disowned and sent to live with the Crystalia family before Princess Altiria was born. Regina’s little sister never knew Regina’s name or what she looked like.</p>
<p><em>N-no… Even if we can’t speak, I can still look at her up close…</em></p>
<p>Mustering her courage, Regina stood in front of the entrance to the party hall when a white furball suddenly sped by her feet.</p>
<p>“Wh-what?” Regina stopped.</p>
<p>The furball let out a faint, flickering glow.</p>
<p>“Is that a spirit?!” Regina furrowed her brow.</p>
<p>It wasn’t one of the Phillet Company’s Artificial Elementals. This was an Origin Spirit; the kind you couldn’t find anywhere in the city.</p>
<p><a id="page-99"/><em>…Wait, isn’t that the royal family’s Carbuncle?!</em></p>
<p>Regina had seen such a spirit once before in the data archive. It had white, glowing fur and a red gemstone embedded in its forehead. There could be no mistaking it. It was a Carbuncle, one of the three great spirits passed down through the generations of House O’ltriese.</p>
<p>The question was, what was a spirit belonging to the royal family doing here?</p>
<p><em>Did it run off?</em> Regina wondered.</p>
<p>An installation-type Artificial Elemental was unable to wander off, but it was perfectly possible for an Origin Spirit.</p>
<p>“I should probably catch it, shouldn’t I…?” Regina whispered to no one in particular.</p>
<p>If it had run away, the princess and her attendants must surely be in a panic trying to find it. Few people could see a spirit when it chose to mask its presence, so the ship’s guards couldn’t catch it on their own. Only a Princess Priestess who drew on the blood of the royal family could do that.</p>
<p><em>And if I catch it, that could be my excuse to speak to Princess Altiria…</em></p>
<p>As soon as she realized this, Regina took off after the furry little thing.</p>
<p>“…W-wait up… Wait!”</p>
<p>Regina focused her inner eye, as if looking through a rifle’s scope. She’d taken the academy’s endurance training every day and was confident in her stamina. Following the faint mana trail the spirit left behind, Regina dashed up a staircase to the upper floor.</p>
<p>At the top of the steps was a straight corridor. Regina caught sight of the Carbuncle’s flickering form at the far end.</p>
<p><em>…Got you!</em></p>
<p>She pushed forward off the floor, her pigtailed hair flapping <a id="page-100"/>behind her with the rush of air. Just ahead of where the spirit had fled, a humanoid figure emerged from a corner.</p>
<p><em>…?!</em> Regina brought herself to a stop, startled.</p>
<p>It was one of Altiria’s uniformed royal guards. The young man raised his eyebrows upon catching sight of Regina.</p>
<p>“What’s this? I thought all the civilians were down at the party,” he said as his lips curled into a faint sneer.</p>
<p>Regina locked eyes with the guard. Something about his attitude seemed odd; he acted too coldly to be one of the princess’s escorts.</p>
<p>“E-erm…” Regina took a cautious step back.</p>
<p>The young guard approached her, not seeming to have noticed her unease.</p>
<p>“Can’t have you kicking up a racket, can we? Better finish you off…” A tangible bloodlust began welling up within the man.</p>
<p>“Activate!” Regina chanted the word to manifest her Holy Sword.</p>
<p>In the next instant, however, massive claws appeared on the guard’s right hand.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>“Demon Sword, Activate—Slash Fang!”</p>
<p>Something powerful ran across Regina’s body.</p>

<p class="noindent"><em>Being in a place full of people truly is suffocating.</em></p>
<p>Leonis snuck away from the party hall and let out a breath he’d been holding after finally escaping to the adjoining hallway. He wasn’t good with such lively places. The Undead King preferred dark, silent locales, like Necrozoa’s underground mausoleum.</p>
<p><em>No, even when I was human, I didn’t enjoy crowds.</em></p>
<p><a id="page-101"/>The corridor was silent. Leonis walked down the passageway and entered an elevator, going up to the ship’s deck for a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p><em>Leaving without saying anything might’ve been a bad idea</em>, Leonis thought as he ascended.</p>
<p>Realizing he could cause his minion undue concern, the Dark Lord summoned a skeleton servant from his shadow. As its bones clattered and assembled into human form, Leonis placed a second-order transformation spell on it. The undead soldier took on a form identical to his own.</p>
<p>It wasn’t unusual for the Undead King to need to appear on multiple battlefields at once in order to confuse enemy forces. The trick of it was, trivially enough, Leonis’s ability to create many body doubles using sorcery. The one flaw of the spell was the personality of the body double was influenced by the skeleton’s own character and idiosyncrasies, but for a temporary, makeshift solution, that was unlikely to cause much trouble.</p>
<p>“Return to the party in my stead,” Leonis instructed. “Be sure not to do anything uncalled-for, however.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord,” the skeletal puppet said, lowering its head respectfully.</p>
