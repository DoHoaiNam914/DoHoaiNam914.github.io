<p class="noindent">“In the end, militant cells within the empire were declared responsible for what happened to the <em>Hyperion</em>,” Leonis muttered idly.</p>
<p>Two days had passed since the incident. He was lying on a bed in his room at the Hræsvelgr dorm, looking down at his information terminal.</p>
<p>According to the report, remnants of the Sovereign Wolves group had abducted the fourth Princess and hijacked the battleship <em>Hyperion</em>. The incident received large-scale media coverage throughout the city. The published story differed from what had actually happened, of course.</p>
<p>After escaping the Void reef, the <em>Hyperion</em> was rescued by a fleet sent from the Seventh Assault Garden. The ringleader was recognized as Bastea Colossuf, the leader of the Sovereign Wolves, and his objective was assumed to be the kidnapping of the princess and the hijacking of the <em>Hyperion</em>.</p>
<p>Accounts went on to say the terrorists had lost control of the ship and made contact with a Void reef. Those same accounts further explained that the Voids that had attacked the ship ended up wiping out the assailants, while Holy Swordsmen from Excalibur <a id="page-172"/>Academy had seized the opportunity to retake control of the ship and escape the reef.</p>
<p>Leonis tapped the terminal with a finger and turned off the screen. Any information regarding the beastmen’s Demon Swords had been omitted.</p>
<p><em>I should’ve squeezed more information out of that woman.</em></p>
<p>Leonis recalled the image of the dark elf who’d given the beastmen their Demon Swords.</p>
<p><em>That woman definitely mentioned a goddess…</em></p>
<p>Surely it was the same person who’d granted Sharnak the Zolgstar Mezekis. Leonis closely examined the shard of the Demon Sword he’d collected. Most of it had been annihilated by Dáinsleif’s attack, but a few fragments had survived. Why had one of the lost Arc Seven become a Void Lord? Was it connected to how Arakael Degradios, one of the Six Heroes, had become one?</p>
<p>As Leonis was beginning to sink into thought, there came a knock at his door.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>It couldn’t have been Riselia; she was currently taking a shower.</p>
<p>“Hey, kid. I’m coming in,” declared a muffled voice. After which, Regina, clad in her maid’s uniform, entered.</p>
<p>“Miss Regina…”</p>
<p>“I came to pay you a visit.” Regina regarded Leonis with a bright smile and took a seat on the chair next to his bed. “How’re you feeling?” she asked.</p>
<p>“My muscles are sore, that’s all. I can’t really lift my arms yet, though…”</p>
<p>It was the recoil from wielding Dáinsleif. The Demon Sword drew out his strength as the ultimate swordsman and hero, but his young child’s body couldn’t bear that much power for very long. As <a id="page-173"/>a result, Leonis was going to have to suffer through muscle pains for a while.</p>
<p>“I baked you an apple pie today,” Regina said, producing the dish and some utensils from a basket she’d brought.</p>
<p>The scent of cinnamon and apples tickled Leonis’s nostrils, reminding him how hungry he was.</p>
<p>“Thank you. I appreciate it… Aah, ouch…” Leonis tried to lift his arms but winced as pain shot through his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Don’t overdo it. Here, I’ll feed you.” Regina gave a slightly bothered smile and cut a piece of the pie, holding it up for Leonis to eat.</p>
<p>“D-don’t do that. I can feed myself.”</p>
<p>“What, are you embarrassed? Go on, say ‘aah’…”</p>
<p>Left with no choice, Leonis bit into the piece Regina offered him.</p>
<p>“…It’s good…,” he said.</p>
<p>The pie’s dough was well baked, giving it a crisp yet moist texture. The sweet and sour flavors of the apples were perfectly balanced, resulting in a delightful taste that filled Leonis’s mouth. He couldn’t recall ever having sampled such a delicious apple pie, even when he’d been a normal human.</p>
<p>“R-really? That’s good to hear…” Regina smiled happily and offered another bite.</p>
<p>Beholding her lovely expression reminded Leonis of something.</p>
<p>“You never did end up meeting her, did you?” he asked.</p>
<p>At that question, Regina’s hands stopped. “…No, I didn’t.” She gave a short nod.</p>
<p>Princess Altiria had left the Seventh Assault Garden earlier in the afternoon, escorted by a fleet from the Integrated Empire. Apparently, Altiria had wanted to stay longer, but after the incident, she wasn’t permitted to do so.</p>
<p><a id="page-174"/>“At least we got to speak through the spirit.” Regina gave a satisfied smile.</p>
<p>“I suppose that’s true,” replied Leonis.</p>
<p>Regina stared at the boy’s face for a long moment.</p>
<p>“Thank you for saving my sister,” she eventually said.</p>
<p>“No, I…” Leonis shook his head to refuse the expression of gratitude.</p>
<p>He hadn’t done it for Regina’s sake. His pride as a Dark Lord had demanded it.</p>
<p>“As a token of my gratitude, I’ll give you a little prize,” Regina declared.</p>
<p>“More candy?” Leonis asked.</p>
<p>“No, no. Something even better…”</p>
<p><em>Smooch.</em> Regina planted a kiss on Leonis’s cheek.</p>
<p>“…M-M-Miss Regina?!” Leonis went red to his ears.</p>
<p>“Ohhh? Did your heart just skip a beat?”</p>
<p>“S-stop teasing me!”</p>
<p>“I’m… I’m not teasing you.”</p>
<p>Leonis looked up only to see Regina’s cheeks were tinged pink.</p>
<p>“Just keep this a secret from Lady Selia. Okay, <em>Leo</em>?” she asked with a mischievous smile, bringing her index finger to her lips.</p>

<p class="noindent">“Was there someone here, Leo?” Riselia emerged from the bathroom, her body wrapped in a towel as she dried her silvery locks.</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Regina came to pay me a vis— Could you stop prancing around in your underwear?!”</p>
<p>Leonis hurriedly averted his gaze.</p>
<p><em>My word. I might be a ten-year-old boy right now, but she’s being too careless.</em></p>
