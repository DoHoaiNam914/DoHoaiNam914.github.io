<p><a id="page-176"/>As Leonis struggled to keep himself from flushing a shade of crimson again, however…</p>
<p>“…Leo.”</p>
<p>A pair of dainty arms wrapped around his body from behind.</p>
<p>He could feel cold fingers against his skin. Smooth, argent locks gently tickled his face.</p>
<p>“What’s gotten into you, Miss Selia?”</p>
<p>“…E-erm…I…uh…,” Riselia stammered bashfully.</p>
<p>That was all Leonis needed to understand what was going on. He shrugged. Riselia’s vampiric impulses were getting the better of her. It was understandable. She had lost a lot of mana during the fight on the ship.</p>
<p>“Can’t you restrain yourself? I swear, you’re such a troublesome minion…” Leonis sighed with a playful frown.</p>
<p>“…Uuu… Nn…” He could feel Riselia shiver shamefully behind his back.</p>
<p>“…I’m joking. Feel free to drink my blood.” Feeling bad for his minion, Leonis cut the teasing short.</p>
<p>“R-really…? May I?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“A-all right, then… I’ll try to take only as much as I need…”</p>
<p><em>Chomp.</em></p>
<p>Riselia embraced Leonis and sank her fangs into his neck in what felt like only a nibble.</p>
<p>“Mmm… Nnng…” Leonis couldn’t help but let out a little moan. It didn’t hurt. If anything, the pain was intoxicating.</p>
<p><em>…Bite… Bite…</em></p>
<p>Riselia was in a daze, sinking her teeth into his neck again and again.</p>
<p>“M-Miss… Selia…?”</p>
<p>“…Mmm… Moooore… <em>Schlurp…</em> Mmm… <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>”</p>
<p><a id="page-177"/>Her arms wrapped tight around Leonis, Riselia sweetly begged for more. Her vampiric desires were getting stronger. Leonis tilted his neck, making it easier for Riselia to suck his blood.</p>
<p><em>…I really am too kind to my minions.</em> Leonis smiled to himself and turned his thoughts to other matters.</p>
<p><em>Voids, Holy Swords, and someone claiming to be a goddess. Could they be related to</em> her <em>reincarnation?</em></p>
<p>He didn’t have enough information to know for sure, so the question would have to wait for later.</p>
<p><em>It’s almost time for me to start making my own moves…</em></p>
<p>Leonis steeled himself. If someone was assuming <em>her</em> name…</p>
<p><em>I’ll have to crush them with all of my might.</em></p>
<p>Leonis smiled indomitably and clenched his fist.</p>
