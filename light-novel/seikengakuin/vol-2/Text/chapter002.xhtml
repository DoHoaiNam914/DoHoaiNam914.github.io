<p class="noindent">“Mm… Nn…”</p>
<p>Sunlight shone through the curtains and fell on the boy’s eyelids, stirring him from sleep. He awoke to discover himself overcome with a lethargy not unlike muscle pain.</p>
<p>The boy was only ten years old. His features were cherubic and innocent, with skin still lustrous and smooth. Currently, his jet-black hair was mussed into what could only have been described as a textbook example of bed head.</p>
<p>Sleepily rubbing his eyes, the boy yawned. Drowsiness still lingered in his dark orbs. This was Leonis Death Magnus. Once known as the Undead King, he had been recently resurrected after a thousand years and now plotted to rebuild the Dark Lords’ Armies. Using secret, forgotten sorcery, Leonis had waited in a kind of stasis until the time was right for his return, but when he’d awoken, he found his body had regressed to the form he’d worn when he was still just a boy.</p>
<p><em>…My word, having a human body is such a bothersome thing.</em></p>
<p>This Dark Lord, still clad in his pajamas, tossed about in his bed. His troublesome human form was quite prone to dreaming.</p>
<p><a id="page-4"></a>This time, the vision had been from before Leonis’s reign as the Undead King.</p>
<p><em>…If I recall, it was when the Dark Lord of the olden times, Zol Vadis, invaded the continent.</em></p>
<p>Leonis squinted at the sunlight streaming in, but just as he tried to sit up…</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>He stiffened, and his eyes widened in surprise. Before him was a pair of breasts, rising and falling in a gentle, constant rhythm. The pajamas covering them were open slightly, giving Leonis a peek of the white underwear hidden beneath.</p>
<p>Swallowing despite himself, Leonis looked up…only to be confronted by the beautiful face of a sleeping girl. Her silvery hair shone in the golden rays of the morning. The girl’s pink lips were parted as light, adorable breaths slipped from between them. Lovely eyelashes quivered as she slept, though her smooth, white skin remained undisturbed.</p>
<p>This was Riselia Ray Crystalia, a Holy Swordswoman of the Seventh Assault Garden’s Excalibur Academy. She also happened to be the girl who’d awakened Leonis from his slumber within some old, forgotten ruins.</p>
<p>Snapping to attention, Leonis felt any remnants of sleepiness completely draining from his mind. He suddenly pushed the covers aside and sat up in his bed.</p>
<p><em>…My word</em>, he thought.</p>
<p>Taking one long, deep breath, he stilled the hard beating of his heart. It was nothing more than a purely physiological reaction of his incorrigibly human body, after all. Through half-open lids, Leonis peered down at the face of the girl sleeping beside him. He then poked her soft cheek with the tip of his finger.</p>
<p><a id="page-5"></a>“Nnng… Mmm…” A carnal sigh escaped Riselia’s lips as the silver-haired girl’s eyes fluttered open. Her ice-blue eyes, like the surface of a clear lake, fixated themselves on Leonis.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Miss Selia,” he said in greeting.</p>
<p>“Ah, Leo… Good morning…,” the girl replied in a drowsy voice.</p>
<p><em>For being a vampire, this minion of mine seems to suffer from low blood pressure in the early hours of the day</em>, Leonis thought.</p>
<p>“Miss Selia, what are you doing in my bed?” he inquired.</p>
<p>“Huh? Ah, erm…” At that question, Riselia looked away in a random direction.</p>
<p>“Don’t try to dodge the question by acting cute,” Leonis chided in exasperation.</p>
<p>Riselia herself had bought this bed. Originally, Leonis had asked for something more comfortable, like a stone coffin, but Riselia had firmly denied that request. Until recently, he’d been using Riselia’s bed, as her room was right next to his own.</p>
<p>“You looked like you were having a bad dream, Leo…,” she muttered.</p>
<p>Leonis held his tongue. He did have an idea as to what she was talking about. In his sleep, the Undead King had seen Roselia.</p>
<p>“Was I tossing in my sleep…?” Leonis asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah…”</p>
<p>Riselia sat up and placed a gentle hand on Leonis’s ruffled hair. Had this been a thousand years ago, treating a Dark Lord with such insolence would’ve been met with instant annihilation. As that age was far in the past, Leonis merely frowned at the surprising gesture, but he made no attempt to push the hand away.</p>
<p>Letting Selia pat him on the head didn’t feel all that bad. Perhaps because it reminded Leonis of the old days, when <em>she</em> used to do similar sorts of things.</p>
<p><a id="page-6"></a>“I’m fine. I just had a dream about the past, is all…,” Leonis admitted, turning away in embarrassment. That’s when he noticed there was a red tint to Riselia’s eyes.</p>
<p>“…Was that really all you came in here for?” he knowingly inquired.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Riselia cocked her head.</p>
<p>“You didn’t sneak into my bed to suck my blood?”</p>
<p>Riselia stiffened. Red irises were a sign of an elevated vampiric impulse. Leonis ran a hand over his neck but couldn’t find any bite marks.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look like you bit me,” he observed.</p>
<p>“Yes, well…I promised…I wouldn’t do it without permission…”</p>
<p>“You really didn’t do anything?” Leonis was somewhat surprised. The fact that Riselia hadn’t partaken of his blood without permission meant she’d withstood an instinctual impulse in order to keep her word.</p>
<p><em>Impressive</em>, Leonis admired internally.</p>
<p>Minions who’d recently become vampires were often assailed by an intense hunger for blood every few days. While Riselia was a Vampire Queen, the apex of her kind, the allure of that desire to feed was hard to resist. This was a girl who’d trained to fight the Voids for years, despite previously being unable to manifest a Holy Sword. Her mental fortitude was far stronger than that of the average human.</p>
<p>Even with such strength of mind, Leonis didn’t doubt resisting the urge had been nothing short of torture for Riselia.</p>
<p>“Go ahead. You may suck my blood,” Leonis declared, extending his index finger.</p>
<p>“C-can I…?” Riselia asked shakily.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.” Leonis nodded.</p>
<p>Some part of the Dark Lord in the body of a child wondered <a id="page-7"></a>if perhaps he was overly kind to his minions. It wasn’t as though Riselia had willingly joined the ranks of the undead, though. She’d laid down her life to protect Leonis’s. Incapable of using holy magic, Leonis’s only choice to save the valiant young woman had been to tap into the sorcery of the Realm of Death to turn her into what she was now.</p>
<p><em>…If all she requires is my blood, then I’ll give her as much as she needs.</em></p>
<p>“Erm, I’ll try to make sure it doesn’t hurt,” Riselia said.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’d appreciate that,” Leonis replied.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much discomfort involved when the girl sucked his blood, to begin with. It was only a tinge of sweet, intoxicating pain. Riselia’s lips touched Leonis’s finger, and…</p>
<p><em>Chomp.</em></p>
<p>Her small fangs penetrated his flesh with a bite that felt both bashful and playful.</p>
<p>“Nnn…mhaa…nnng… <img alt="image" class="music" src="../Images/Art_music.jpg"/>” Riselia’s tongue coiled around Leonis’s finger ecstatically as carnal moans began to escape her mouth. The alluring slurping sounds of her licking and suckling on his finger quietly echoed through the room.</p>
<p>“…Um, M-Miss Selia…,” Leonis cut in.</p>
<p>“Nn…nhaat… (What…)?” She looked up at him with intoxicated eyes.</p>
<p>“You’re being lewd.”</p>
<p>“Aaaaah?!”</p>
<p>Riselia hurriedly freed Leonis’s finger from her lips as her face flushed red with shame.</p>
