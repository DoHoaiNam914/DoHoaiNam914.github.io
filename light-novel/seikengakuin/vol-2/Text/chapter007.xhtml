<p>“I, erm, hope you like sweets…,” Tessera stammered with a flustered expression.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Tessera.” Leonis accepted the gift. Instantly, he caught the pleasant smell of cookies.</p>
<p>“Y-you remembered…my name,” Tessera whispered in a voice so meek Leonis couldn’t hear it, and her cheeks turned rosy.</p>
<p>While a little misshapen, the cookies had clearly been otherwise well made. Leonis took a bite out of one. It tasted a touch too sweet for him, but that was likely just a matter of preference.</p>
<p>“It’s good. Just the right kind of sweet,” Leonis commented, offering his honest opinion.</p>
<p>“…R-really? Th-that’s good.” Tessera smiled bashfully.</p>
<p>“Hey, Leo, Tessera picked out the best cookies from a batch she baked for you!” Millet told him excitedly.</p>
<p>“…M-Millet!” Linze poked her in the ribs.</p>
<p>“Hmm, you came all this way just to give this to me?” Leonis asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right!” Millet said, puffing out her chest as though to boast for some reason.</p>
<p>“Ah, erm, that’s not all we came here for, um…,” Tessera muttered hastily.</p>
<p>“We came to see the <em>Hyperion</em> at the port!” Linze exclaimed with glittering eyes.</p>
<p><em>Hyperion…</em> If Leonis recalled correctly, it was the name of the ship the princess was set to arrive on for her visit.</p>
<p>“Y-yes, and while we were here, we wondered how you were doing, so…,” Tessera added timidly.</p>
<p>“You’re interested in warships?” Leonis inquired.</p>
<p><a id="page-32"></a>“Yeah!” Linze said excitedly. “It’s the capital’s newest vessel. A battleship made for anti-Void combat! It’s got the first magic catapult loaded onto it, and—”</p>
<p>“There’s gonna be a parade welcoming the princess near the ship,” Tessera added hurriedly.</p>
<p><em>…So that’s why.</em></p>
<p>Putting aside Linze’s barrage of jargon, Millet and Tessera had come to visit the princess.</p>
<p>“Tessera wanted to invite you to come with us,” Millet said cheerily.</p>
<p>“I-if you don’t mind…,” Tessera amended, her words petering out.</p>
<p><em>Hmm…</em></p>
<p>Phrenia was likely far too busy running the orphanage to escort a few of them to a parade. That said, the children were clearly eager to walk around town on their own, so Leonis decided it befit him as a Holy Swordsman to escort them.</p>
<p>In all honesty, the parade didn’t interest Leonis in the slightest. When he was the Undead King, he was worshipped and celebrated by a number of assorted heretical cults throughout the land. Such idolization quickly grew unpleasant, though, so he’d abolished them.</p>
<p><em>I admit this world’s royalty and warships do pique my interest, however</em>, Leonis thought, hiding an evil smile.</p>
<p>Setting aside the unlikelihood that Leonis would have a chance to meet with any member of the royal family, researching one of this age’s cutting-edge weapons wasn’t a bad use of his time. Attending on his own could arouse suspicion, but with the children following him, no one was likely to raise an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Leonis nodded.</p>
<p>Tessera whispered a small “Yay!” Attending the festivities <a id="page-33"></a>meant Leonis would be skipping his lectures for the day, but that was fine. Riselia was less likely to get mad at him for doing something for the kids from the orphanage.</p>
<p><em>Why am I even concerned about a minion getting mad at me?</em></p>
<p>“Then let’s go! Forward march!” Millet theatrically swung a branch she’d picked up somewhere and started walking toward the port.</p>

<p class="noindent">“…Where did Leo go off to?”</p>
<p>Having finished her lectures in the classroom ward, Riselia looked around for the boy but couldn’t find him anywhere.</p>
<p><em>I thought it’d be nice to have lunch together…</em></p>
<p>Leonis’s group tactics lecture should’ve been in the same building as Riselia’s class. She tried calling his communication device, but there was no reply. Leonis had mentioned going to the library that morning, so Riselia wondered if perhaps he was still there. Unfortunately, there was no sign of him in that building, either. Leonis was the only ten-year-old Holy Swordsman in the academy, so Riselia had thought he’d stand out and be easy to spot.</p>
<p><em>I hope no one kidnapped him or something…</em> Riselia was suddenly struck by a rather odd thought.</p>
<p>It was no secret that a lot of the girls around the academy thought Leonis was very cute. Riselia wouldn’t have been surprised to learn a classmate had decided to snatch him away.</p>
<p>Leonis Magnus. A mysterious boy found sealed in an ancient ruin. Outwardly, he appeared to be an adorable child, but his true identity was that of an ancient mage who’d turned Riselia into his vampire minion. He fought not with a Holy Sword but by using the power of ancient sorcery and a Demon Sword. Those strange <a id="page-34"></a>abilities had saved Riselia from the massive Void Lord who had kidnapped her, leaving no trace of the monstrous tree-thing behind when Leonis was finished.</p>
<p>At times, he was incredibly mature, but there were other moments when he acted like a boy his age… For some reason, Riselia found she just couldn’t leave him alone. No matter how strong he was, she saw him no differently than how she viewed the children at the orphanage.</p>
<p><em>Maybe he’s having lunch on his own?</em> Considering that possibility, Riselia headed toward the cafeteria when something else caught her attention.</p>
<p>“…Hmm?”</p>
<p>Riselia spotted one of her teammates squatting beneath the building’s staircase. The girl’s brilliant blue hair was cut in a shoulder-length, boyish style, and her piercing blue eyes were quite breathtaking.</p>
<p>She didn’t wear the academy’s uniform but was instead clad in traditional garb from Sakura Orchid. Normally, that would have, of course, been a violation of academy regulations, but a special exception had been made in this girl’s case.</p>
<p>She was a skilled swordswoman who, despite being a first-year, held the record for slaying large-type Voids. Her name was Sakuya Sieglinde, and she was sitting in front of a large, black lump.</p>
<p>“…Sakuya?” Riselia called out to her friend.</p>
<p>“Mm? Oh, Riselia…” Sakuya turned to look at her senior classmate and bowed her head in greeting.</p>
<p>Getting a closer look, Riselia realized the black lump Sakuya was squatting by was actually a very large dog.</p>
<p>“Hmm, where did this guy come from?” Riselia asked, furrowing her brow.</p>
<p>“Seems he wandered onto the academy’s premises. I thought <a id="page-35"></a>he looked hungry, so I decided to feed him,” Sakuya explained, tearing a bun she’d gotten from the cafeteria and presenting it to the black dog. He sniffed it a few times before helping himself.</p>
<p>“He’s…a bit large for a stray.” Riselia descended the staircase and eyed the dog carefully.</p>
<p>Something gave her the feeling she’d seen this animal before, but exactly where and when eluded her.</p>
<p>“Do you think he’s someone’s pet?” Riselia wondered aloud.</p>
<p>“Probably. I can’t see him being a stray. He gives off a certain noble aura,” Sakuya agreed.</p>
<p>“Now that you mention it, I guess he kind of does.”</p>
<p>The large beast’s fur was as black and sleek as the ebon of night.</p>
<p>“It looks similar to a breed of blood wolf, but…” Riselia crouched toward the dog and cocked her head.</p>
<p>A blood wolf was a species created as a result of genetic engineering, a mixture of a large-breed dog and a dire wolf. They were mostly used as military hounds. There was an upperclassman with a Holy Sword capable of controlling packs of dogs. Riselia wondered if perhaps this animal belonged to them.</p>
<p>“We should probably report this to the bureau,” Riselia declared.</p>
<p>“Right…” Sakuya nodded, placing a hand on the dog’s head. “Until we find his owner, I shall christen him with a name. He will be Fluffymaru the Black.”</p>
<p>The black dog growled in apparent dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t seem to like it,” Riselia pointed out.</p>
<p>“…Mm. Really? I think it’s a fine name.”</p>
<p>“You can’t just name random dogs you find outside, Sakuya,” Riselia chided as she rose to her feet. “By the way, have you seen Leo?”</p>
