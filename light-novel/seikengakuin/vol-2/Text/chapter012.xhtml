<p class="noindent">18:30 Imperial Standard Time.</p>
<p>In her office aboard the ship, Altiria, fourth princess of the Integrated Empire, was preparing for the mixer.</p>
<p>“The outfit suits you well, Your Highness,” complimented one of her ladies-in-waiting.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” The princess smiled gently.</p>
<p>She wore a brilliant party dress the color of white lilies, which helped accentuate her golden hair. Sitting in her arms was a spirit called a Carbuncle, wagging its puffy tail. Standing in front of a full-length mirror, Altiria brought a hand to her chest in silent contemplation.</p>
<p><em>Miss Riselia and that boy were so dashing.</em></p>
<p>The memory of the boy, Leonis, lingered in the princess’s mind.</p>
<p><em>He was younger than me, but he was already a Holy Swordsman.</em></p>
<p>Altiria had long yearned to be a student at Excalibur Academy. As it happened, she was set to join the royal knights’ academy in the Imperial Capital next year. One day Altiria hoped to be a dashing knight who rushed to the rescue, just as Riselia and Leonis had done today.</p>
<p><em>And I would love to speak to that lady with the cannon…</em></p>
<p>The pigtailed Holy Swordswoman who’d blasted that giant Void had been invited to the princess’s party as well. Regrettably, <a id="page-86"></a>that unknown girl had refused to attend. She’d said she’d only done what was necessary and departed without giving so much as her name. That one had been the most gallant of them all.</p>
<p>It was a firm wish of Altiria’s to be a Holy Swordswoman when she got older, just like that mysterious pigtailed girl. Her status as a princess prevented her from being able to fight Voids on the front lines, though.</p>
<p>“May I enter, Your Highness?” The voice of a knight of the royal guard came from beyond the door to the room.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Altiria replied, nodding to her attendant.</p>
<p>Understanding the meaning of the gesture, the servant opened the door, but then…</p>
<p>“Aaaah!”</p>
<p>The knight knocked the lady-in-waiting to the floor.</p>
<p>“…Wh-what are you—?!”</p>
<p>Before Altiria could scream, royal guards armed with firearms flooded into the room.</p>
<p>“Such insolence! What is the meaning of this?!” Despite Altiria being a twelve-year-old girl in a very confusing situation, she maintained a dignified demeanor befitting one of her status.</p>
<p>“Just getting ready for the mixer, Your Highness…,” replied the knight, peeling off his own face.</p>
<p>“What…?!”</p>
<p>Beneath the facade was a beastman with the head of a black lion. Altiria immediately recognized the man as the leader of the Sovereign Wolves, a radical terrorist organization responsible for the Parliament Hall occupation incident back in the Imperial Capital. This was the anti-imperialist Bastea Colossuf.</p>
<p>“Help! Someone, come help!” Altiria let loose the loudest shout she could muster.</p>
<p><a id="page-87"></a>None came to her aid, however, despite the royal guard being stationed on the same floor.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh, you waste your breath, Princess.” A dark elf woman entered the room with a mystifying smile on her lips.</p>
<p>In one of her hands was a pitch-black sword that gave off an eerie sort of mist, and in her other, she carried the corpse of a knight, which she carelessly let slump to the ground.</p>
<p>It was the captain of the royal guard.</p>
<p>“A-Arcus… N-nooo!” Altiria screamed.</p>
<p>Stouthearted as she may have tried to be, Altiria was still a child. Her mental fortitude had its limits.</p>
<p>“You might want to hire some better-trained bodyguards if you intend to keep yourself safe,” mocked the dark elf woman.</p>
<p><span class="special">“Suppression of the main bridge complete,”</span> said a voice from Bastea’s communication device.</p>
<p>“Understood. We’ll be right over,” the lion-headed man responded. Grabbing Altiria by the arm, he said, “I must ask you to come with me, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“L-let go of me!” Altiria demanded futilely.</p>
<p>“Be quiet,” Bastea snapped, raising his sharp claws to Altiria’s face.</p>
<p>It was at that moment, however, the Carbuncle curled in Altiria’s arms bit Bastea’s hand. The man flinched from the pain, creating a momentary opening.</p>
<p>“Run!” Altiria screamed.</p>
<p>The spirit fell to the floor and took off like a startled rabbit, disappearing into thin air. It had vanished into the spirit world, which overlaid this one. No one could see it unless they had a spirit user’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Jiraf, go after it,” Bastea said, clicking his tongue and issuing <a id="page-88"></a>an order to one of his men. Turning his attention back to his captive, he asked, “Is that spirit the <em>Hyperion</em>’s master key?”</p>
<p>Altiria didn’t answer. Her jade eyes glared defiantly at Bastea.</p>
<p>“Fret not, we have a spare prepared.” The dark elf woman grabbed Altiria by the chin and sneered. “Letting the spirit run off was a wasted effort, brave little princess. Heh-heh, heh-heh-heh…”</p>
<p>“Aaah… Nng…” Altiria’s eyes clouded over with despair.</p>
<p><em>Please, someone… Someone, save me…!</em> Altria silently pleaded. For some reason, the face that drifted to the forefront of her mind was that of the boy to whom she’d spoken earlier in the audience chamber.</p>
