<p class="noindent">“Roar and bellow! Drag Howl!”</p>
<p><em>Boooooooom!</em></p>
<p>An explosion rocked the air as Regina’s shot blasted through a bulkhead made of military-grade enchanted steel. The Carbuncle soared through the air in a hurry, with Leonis and Regina following after it. Naturally, all the elevators were inactive, so to reach the bridge, they had to use either the central staircase or the emergency one.</p>
<p><em>Busting through the ceiling with magic would be so much quicker</em>, Leonis thought. Such a tactic put the princess at risk of being caught in the crossfire, however.</p>
<p>“Miss Regina, don’t run too far ahead…,” Leonis insisted.</p>
<p>“I’m the older one here.” Regina turned around to face him as they ran up the stairs. “I can’t let you take the lead.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s just that I, erm…I can see your…”</p>
<p>“…Huuuh?!” Regina went red and pressed her skirt down over her behind.</p>
<p>Excalibur Academy’s uniform stressed mobility, so its skirt <a id="page-136"></a>was very short. Leonis got a good flash of Regina’s mature, black panties.</p>
<p>“Y-you’re a perv, aren’t you, boy?!” Regina scolded him with her eyes narrowed scornfully.</p>
<p>“I-it was an accident!” Leonis insisted, claiming innocence.</p>
<p>“I’m going to have to report this to Lady Selia, aren’t I—?”</p>
<p>“Please don’t,” Leonis hurriedly implored.</p>
<p>Their exchange was cut off as a new voice echoed from above.</p>
<p>“Who the hell are you?!” someone shrilly called out to them.</p>
<p>A pair of beastmen had appeared on a landing just ahead.</p>
<p>“Miss Regina!”</p>
<p>“Holy Sword, Exchange—Drag Striker!” Regina quickly loosed a barrage.</p>
<p>“Accuracy Augmentation, Curse Blast!” Leonis matched Regina’s timing, applying augmentation magic to her.</p>
<p><em>Booooom!</em></p>
<p>The shots hit their mark, exploding and sending the beastmen flying.</p>
<p>“Wh-whoaaaa?!” Regina teetered slightly at the force of her own attack.</p>
<p><em>Oh, curses, I bolstered her too much!</em></p>
<p>“Th-that was amazing, Miss Regina!” Leonis said, quick to feign ignorance.</p>
<p>“Those weren’t explosive shells. They were normal blasts. I think their trajectory changed slightly, too…,” Regina replied, clearly unconvinced.</p>
<p>“Y-you must have imagined it.”</p>
<p>From the landing, Leonis and Regina continued down a corridor, handily defeating any beastmen who barred their way. Again and again, Regina loosed fiery shots from her Holy Sword.</p>
<p>“Over there, that’s the bridge of the ship!”</p>
<p><a id="page-137"></a>The Carbuncle turned transparent and passed right through the door.</p>
<p>“Drag Howl!” Regina launched another powerful blast that blew the door in. “Princess Altiria!” she cried as she burst into the room. What met her eyes was not the scene she’d expected, however.</p>
<p>“…What’s… What’s going on here?” Regina whispered in shock.</p>
<p>The bridge was <em>completely deserted</em>. The ship’s control system was operating without anyone in the room.</p>
<p>“Look!” Regina beckoned Leonis over as her eyes caught sight of a console’s screen. Her expression went stiff with fear and despair.</p>
<p>“…What’s this?” There was a large blip on the display Leonis assumed to be the <em>Hyperion</em>. It looked to be on a course for a cluster of numerous, smaller dots.</p>
<p>“That’s a Void reef.”</p>

<p class="noindent">Sharnak and her subordinates had gathered on the <em>Hyperion</em>’s deck. Lightning flashed through the sky as a storm raged. Several beastmen were carrying Princess Altiria into a fighter plane’s cargo hold.</p>
<p>Each of the foolish beastmen who had accepted the power of a Demon Sword were by now Sharnak’s marionettes. More precisely, they were under the control of the Demon Sword clutched in the dark elf woman’s hands.</p>
<p>Between Sharnak’s fingers rested Zolgstar Mezekis, one of the Dark Lord–slaying weapons collectively known as the Arc Seven.</p>
<p>It was a different sort of item than the ones Sharnak had given the beastmen. Zolgstar Mezekis was a true Demon Sword and had been granted to her by a priest of the goddess. As a legendary weapon, it was said to have been wielded by a hero a thousand years ago.</p>
<p><a id="page-138"></a><em>Yes, I have been chosen by her…</em>, Sharnak thought confidently.</p>
<p>“…Where are you taking us?” Princess Altiria asked in a faint voice.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh, oh, someplace wonderful,” Sharnak replied with a sadistic smile. “You should consider yourself honored. Once I dissect your brain and pick apart the royal family’s powers, I’ll make you the plaything of the cult’s sadists. Or maybe I’ll let you serve as a seedbed for the monsters of emptiness. Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!”</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Letting out a maniacal laugh, Sharnak held the Demon Sword aloft.</p>
<p>Under the moonlight, the masterless <em>Hyperion</em> charged through the waters, moving ever closer toward the reef shrouded in a blackness that surpassed the darkness of night itself.</p>
<p>“Now, let us hurry,” Sharnak ordered the beastmen under her command. “Assuming you don’t want to be swallowed, too, of course.”</p>

<p class="noindent">Riselia and Sakuya hurried down a corridor lit only by the flickering emergency light. There was no sign of anyone else in the hall. The echoing sound of the <em>Hyperion</em>’s creaking hull was interrupted by the occasional peal of thunder.</p>
<p>The floor wavered and shook beneath the two young women. It was likely the ship was nearing its maximum cruising speed.</p>
<p>“Look over there. The bulkheads have been destroyed,” Riselia observed, pointing ahead.</p>
<p>There was a large hole in the center of the massive, military-grade barricade. Debris and shards of metal littered the floor around it.</p>
<p><a id="page-139"></a><em>Did Leo do this…?</em></p>
<p>“Miss Riselia…,” Sakuya called as she ran to catch up.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Riselia stopped and turned around.</p>
<p>“They’re coming.” Narrowing her eyes, Sakuya turned to face what appeared to be empty air. Despite the apparent lack of any opponent, she drew Raikirimaru.</p>
<p>“…Huh?” Riselia wasn’t aware of any unusual presence, but it seemed obvious the younger swordswoman could see something. There was a heavy rumble of thunder from outside the <em>Hyperion</em>, and then…</p>
<p><em>Crack, crack!</em></p>
<p>The sound of fracturing glass began to ring out, as though the air itself was starting to give way.</p>
<p>“Voids?!” Riselia manifested her Bloody Sword and wrapped her hands tightly around its grip.</p>
<p><em>Crack, crack, crack!</em></p>
<p>Countless fractures tore themselves into being, and as they widened, a creature robed in dark-gray vapors began to emerge.</p>
<p><em>“…Urrr… Rggggl…”</em></p>
<p>Sturdy limbs with claws and fins pulled a slippery gray body from the fissures in space. What should’ve been the Void’s face bore no nose or eyes, only a large, horizontal tear lined with teeth.</p>
<p>“…A merman class…”</p>
<p>This was a type of Void that appeared on the seafloor. It was highly intelligent and capable of moving rapidly not just underwater but also on land.</p>
<p>“It’s coming!” Sakuya called out, and she kicked off the ground.</p>
<p>Unsheathing her sword, Sakuya loosed a horizontal slash in one elegant motion. The Void dissolved into a miasma and disappeared before it could even let out a final cry of death. Surges of <a id="page-140"></a>electricity ran across Raikirimaru’s blade. Unfortunately, there were already new tears forming around Riselia and Sakuya.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Once more, the electrified katana flashed forth, cleaving another Void that had appeared from a floating fissure. Sakuya then used the backswing to move into another swipe and from there into a rising horizontal cut. With each swing of the blade, Sakuya’s movements grew more agile.</p>
<p>“Ultimate Blade Technique, Third Form—Sakura War Flurry!”</p>
<p>Sakuya’s blade roared. The ability of her Holy Sword—Raikirimaru, Blade of Lightning—was acceleration. The electricity it produced was just a by-product. Its true power was that it enveloped Sakuya in super-electromagnetic energy, allowing her to move faster the more she cut into her foes. The girl herself looked like a blade of blue lightning as she sped toward the swarm of Voids.</p>
<p>“Hyaaaaaah!” Riselia let out a battle cry as she charged at the Voids as well, Bloody Sword in hand.</p>
<p>A merman class emerged from the wall and was immediately cut clean in half. Riselia thrusted the tip of her blade into the special fissure, slaying another Void that had only just started to crawl out.</p>
<p>Using her superior vampire strength, Riselia leaped into the air, instantly closing in on a new group of Voids as she brought her Holy Sword to bear. Her training with the skeletons had proven fruitful; she was clearly far more accustomed to fighting groups now. As she struck, Riselia unleashed the large stores of mana coursing through her body, fighting in a manner truly befitting a Vampire Queen.</p>
<p><em>Why are Voids appearing inside the ship?!</em> Waving away the miasma that clouded the air, Riselia peered out the window…</p>
<p><a id="page-141"></a>A timely bolt of lightning illuminated the water’s surface, revealing a thick layer of gray vapor hanging over the sea.</p>
<p>“Is this a Void reef?!” she exclaimed, incredulous.</p>
<p><em>Void reef</em> was the term used to describe a Void nest that formed in the sea. They were said to be hellish places from which there was no escape.</p>
<p><em>What are those beastmen thinking…?!</em></p>
<p>The <em>Hyperion</em> should’ve had a radar capable of detecting and evading the Voids. Riselia could only guess at whether the hijackers had plotted an incorrect course or if they’d done this intentionally.</p>
<p>Thankfully, for the moment, only smaller classes of Voids seemed to be appearing. If the <em>Hyperion</em> was drawn any deeper into the reef, however, the risk of a larger class showing up was high.</p>
<p>“At this rate, we’ll—!”</p>
<p>Yet another crack formed in the air, from which a new type of Void crept out. It was humanoid but larger than the merman-class Voids. Disgusting, mollusk-like tentacles grew out of its head, as if multiple sea creatures had made their home inside its cranium.</p>
<p>“A Brain Eater!” Riselia exclaimed.</p>
<p>It was a much stronger type when compared to the merman class. Not only was it more intelligent, but it was also capable of using mysterious powers. It was said Brain Eaters had a high likelihood of becoming Void Lords.</p>
<p>Excalibur Academy classified them at a rank-A danger level, meaning it was a Void considered too dangerous to be challenged by a single Holy Swordsman. Riselia swallowed nervously as she stood facing the creature. Sakuya slashed at another Void and leaped over to Riselia so the two young women were now standing back-to-back.</p>
<p>“Miss Riselia, you should go on ahead. Leave these guys to me.”</p>
<p>“…No. I’m going to stay and fight with you,” Riselia declared.</p>
