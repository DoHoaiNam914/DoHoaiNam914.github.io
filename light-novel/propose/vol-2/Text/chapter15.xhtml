<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 101. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_101" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Anviet grunted in frustration, before sitting up straight and turning to face his visitor.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>So what do you want, Erulka?” he demanded.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm? Oh, yes.” She nodded, as though having forgotten her reason for reaching out to him. “There’s something I want you to do.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? And if I don’t like it?” he spat back with a venomous glower.</p>
<p class="TX">Erulka, however, wore a quizzical look. “Oh? Knowing you, I doubt that,” she retorted, fixing him square in her sights.</p>
<p class="TX">Judging by her tone, she seemed to honestly believe he couldn’t possibly turn this request down.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Tch.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>This was why he hated dealing with that moldy old mage.</p>
<p class="TX">He let out an irritable click of the tongue and cupped his chin in one hand as he motioned for her to continue.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">After announcing the winner of the first round—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Round two</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">will be all about sharing your true feelings!</span>” Silvelle declared to the audience from the center of the stage.</p>
<p class="TX">Incidentally, Clara’s smartphone was floating in front of her a short distance away. As to be expected of two machines, they were operating in perfect tandem.</p>
<p class="TX">“Sharing your true feelings<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Mushiki repeated curiously.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Yep!</span>” came Silvelle’s enthusiastic response. <span class="ITAL">“It’s a beautiful thing when two people can understand each other implicitly, but there are some feelings that you can only convey through words and actions! So, Saachie, Clarin—I’m asking you to express your feelings for Mukkie. The time limit is five minutes, so if you need anything, now is your chance to prepare. The winner will be the one who most effectively touches Mukkie’s heart.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“I—I see<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Given that Mushiki already liked Saika, this second round would probably offer no more real competition than the first one. Even so, he was still nervous.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 102. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_102" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>At that moment, Clara raised her hand. “Yep, yep! Sis! I have a question!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“What is it, Clarin?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Are we allowed to do anything we want? You know, so long as we appeal to him?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Yes. You’re free to take any approach you like. Please convey your feelings to Mukkie in the way you find most natural.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse">…</span> So the one who makes Mushipi’s heart beat faster wins, right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Yes</span>,” Silvelle answered.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Clara trailed off there, then licked her lips.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki found himself shuddering involuntarily at her bewitching expression. He couldn’t pin down the precise cause, but something about her attitude struck him as dangerous.</p>
<p class="TX">Silvelle, however, was either unaware of Clara’s gesture just then or else chose to ignore it, and instead she clapped her hands together.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, in perfect coordination, the kitchen set and food pantry onstage descended once more below the floor.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Now, Saachie went first in the last round, so let’s start with Clarin this time</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">Is there anything you need?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm. Right. How about<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">After sinking deep into thought for a moment, Clara whispered something into Silvelle’s ear—though the AI was just a three-dimensional projection, there must have been microphones somewhere nearby to pick up what was said.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Understood</span>,” she responded. <span class="ITAL">“I’ll get everything ready.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">She snapped her fingers—and a large three-seater sofa rose up from beneath the stage.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“How about this?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Yep, it’s perfect. Way to go, Sis!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Hee-hee-hee.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">Silvelle’s cheeks turned bright red from the compliment, making her look kind of cute.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 103. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_103" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“All right, Mushipi! Clara here is going to win your heart, so stand right over there!” she said, pointing to the freshly delivered sofa.</p>
<p class="TX">“Um<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Though still concerned about what she might be planning, Mushiki made his way to the couch as instructed.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">The time limit is five minutes. Let’s get started!</span>” Silvelle announced as a buzzer rang out.</p>
<p class="TX">A large countdown timer appeared on the overhead projection screen, slowly ticking down to zero.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hee-hee-hee, yeah, let’s do this!” Clara approached, her face tinged slightly red. “Hey, Mushipi. I know we just met, but Clara here really likes you, you know<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” she said flirtatiously.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Whoa</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_exclamatory">…</span><span class="ITAL">!</span>” echoed countless grief-stricken voices in the audience. <span class="ITAL">“Oh my god</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_exclamatory">…</span><span class="ITAL">!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">But Clara acted as though she couldn’t hear those lamentations and did not shift her gaze once—as if there were no one else present but the two of them.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">She was clearly serious about this, which was quite out of character, given her usual frivolous personality. Her stare pierced him through, and he found himself catching his breath.</p>
<p class="TX">“I told you, didn’t I? Clara here, well, I’m the kind of person who goes all out. I’ll do <span class="ITAL">anything</span> for you, Mushipi—and I’ll let you do <span class="ITAL">anything</span> to me<span class="ellipse">…</span> You don’t believe me? You think I’m just saying all this without meaning it<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Then let me prove it to you.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">As Mushiki stared back wide-eyed, Clara’s lips curled into a mysterious smile, her cheeks turning scarlet as she placed a hand on the hem of her skirt.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, without warning, she pulled it up at one side.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse">…</span> H-hold on<span class="ellipse">…</span> Um<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">His vision swirled at this sudden and unexpected development.</p>
<p class="TX">The hall was abuzz with excitement. In the corner of his vision, he <span aria-label=" Page 104. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_104" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>spotted Ruri, attempting to leap onstage with a terrifying expression—and Hizumi desperately trying to hold her back.</p>
<p class="TX">But he didn’t have the luxury of paying attention to them right now.</p>
<p class="TX">His whole body stiffened, pinned down by Clara’s movements.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hee-hee!”</p>
<p class="TX">She seemed to find his reaction amusing, as she rolled her skirt up faster to her thigh.</p>
<p class="TX">“Cl-Clara<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” He wheezed, forcing his eyes shut.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, as his vision darkened, he heard her laugh. “Mwah-ha-ha! Don’t worry, Mushipi. I’m wearing a swimsuit.”</p>
<p class="TX">“A swim—?”</p>
<p class="TX">He opened his eyes—and sure enough, peeking out from beneath her skirt was the very same swimsuit she had worn in the video when she had taken a bath with some slimes.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’d really love to show you more, but I’m in the middle of a live stream. If I was wearing normal underwear, the video would get taken down, you know? It’s weird, don’t you think? I mean, they show the exact same amount of skin. It’s discrimination against undies if you ask me,” she said absentmindedly.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, ill at ease, glanced away. “Y-yeah<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Well, that certainly was a swimsuit, but as she said, it didn’t look all that much different from actual underwear. It was still powerfully stimulating.</p>
<p class="TX">Perhaps having noticed his discomfort, Clara’s face relaxed as she broke out into a grin.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh no! Are you embarrassed, Mushipi? You’re so cute!” she said jokingly.</p>
<p class="TX">With that, she began to loosen her uniform tie and set about undoing the buttons on her blouse one by one.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! Wh-what are you—?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oooh. I’m wearing a swimsuit on top as well, so don’t worry. Buuut<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Pausing there, she took off her school uniform—her pale stomach and breasts hidden behind no more than a flimsy swimsuit.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 105. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_105" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">It was a bathing suit, all right—but all the same, it was unbelievable and somehow immoral to see it come to light from under a school uniform. If anything, it would have been more appropriate just to be wearing the swimsuit by itself.</p>
<p class="TX">“See? Pretty erotic, don’cha think?” she asked, emphasizing her chest as she drew closer.</p>
<p class="TX">Without even realizing it, Mushiki took a half step back.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wha—?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Before he knew it, he stumbled over, landing flat on his butt with a soft plop.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes, this was the sofa that Silvelle had prepared just a moment earlier.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, perfect. I couldn’t have hoped for a better position,” Clara said, wriggling her hips to lean into the sofa as though to block his escape route.</p>
<p class="TX">The sweet fragrance of her hair and skin as well as her faint breath seemed to caress his every pore.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki found himself short of breath, his heart pounding in his chest.</p>
<p class="TX">This was getting too dangerous. If he had been in his Saika mode, all this stimulation would have immediately triggered a state conversion back into his original form.</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushipi<span class="ellipse">…</span> If you choose me, I’ll show you <span class="ITAL">everything</span>, you know<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Away from the camera, where it’s just the two of us<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Clara whispered in a sweet, seductive voice as she leaned in closer.</p>
<p class="TX">Her cherry-colored lips were directly before him.</p>
<p class="TX">“No<span class="ellipse">…</span> N-no<span class="ellipse">…</span> We can’t<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, the buzzer sounded throughout the hall.</p>
<p class="TX">Her five-minute allocation to appeal to his heart was up.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">And that’s it! Hmm, Clarin, you were so bold there! As your big sister, I think even</span> I <span class="ITAL">felt a slight thrill!</span>” Silvelle said, twisting her body shyly as her cheeks turned red.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 106. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_106" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>With that, the audience let out their collective breath, as though only now remembering that this was all just a contest.</p>
<p class="TX">“Well, those five minutes went by pretty quickly, huh? But you know what? I got to see Mushipi acting cute, so I’m happy,” Clara said with a laugh as she jumped down from the sofa.</p>
<p class="TX">She still hadn’t buttoned her blouse back up, and a barrage of camera flashes came from the spectators.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm? Oh yeah! Peace! Double peace!”</p>
<p class="TX">Yet when Clara realized how exposed she was, instead of covering her chest, she started posing for the photographers. A truly terrifying mental fortitude, that was for sure.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki was unable to move for a few seconds, but finally, as though breaking loose from his bonds, he managed to breathe again and rise to his feet. His legs were still trembling.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Kuroe approached him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Are you okay, Mushiki?” she asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“Y-yeah<span class="ellipse">…</span> Somehow. But<span class="ellipse">…</span>a game just to appeal to me<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? <span class="ellipse">…</span>Really?”</p>
<p class="TX">“There are various methods. The difficult part will be not overstepping the rules. By the way<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes?” he asked with his head tilted.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, out of nowhere, Kuroe pinched the back of his hand.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Ow?!”</p>
<p class="TX">It had happened so suddenly that he ended up crying out in alarm.</p>
<p class="TX">Silvelle, startled, blinked a few times. <span class="ITAL">“Is something the matter, Mukkie?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> No, it’s nothing<span class="ellipse">…</span>” He tried to brush the question aside, turning to Kuroe in confusion. “What was that about<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“There was a mosquito on you.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Shouldn’t you swat it then, instead of pinching?”</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s Saika’s turn next,” she said lightly, ignoring his remarks as she approached the back of the stage. “Lady Saika should return in a moment. Mushiki, please wait out there.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Ah, right.” He nodded.</p>
<p class="TX">With those words, Kuroe vanished backstage.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 107. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_107" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Of course, he knew better than anyone that Saika wasn’t there waiting to reappear. No, the Saika who had been participating in this contest thus far was none other than himself.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe seemed to have a plan of some kind, but what on earth could it be?</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">Before he knew it, he cried out in a wild voice.</p>
<p class="TX">Just a few minutes after Kuroe had left, a hand poked out from beyond the door at the back of the stage, delicately wriggling its fingers.</p>
<p class="TX">“Th-that hand—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Is that Madam Witch<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">Hushed murmurs began to course through the audience.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes, it was clear as day from its majestic movements that the hand belonged to Saika Kuozaki herself.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Um</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">Saachie? Won’t you come onstage?</span>” Silvelle asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">To all appearances, Saika’s hand beckoned to him slowly, bewitchingly.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Hmm, well</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">I suppose this should be okay</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">Saachie is on the offensive, so let’s start the countdown!</span>” Silvelle declared.</p>
<p class="TX">With that, the hand motioned elegantly with a casual fluidity even more mesmerizing than before.</p>
<p class="TX">It was practically calling out to him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">His eyes widened, and like a moth drawn to flames, he found himself staggering unsteadily toward the gesturing hand.</p>
<p class="TX">He knew full well that it wasn’t Saika who was waiting for him. Yet he could only see the hand as belonging to her.</p>
<p class="TX">Then—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>What are you doing, Kuroe?” he whispered softly after disappearing backstage to an area where he could see her in her entirety.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes. The hand that everyone had taken for Saika’s actually belonged to Kuroe, who had vanished from sight a few minutes earlier.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Well, it was only natural that everyone had fallen for it. After all, <span aria-label=" Page 108. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_108" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>that hand <span class="ITAL">was</span> moving according to Saika’s own will, complete with her own peculiarities and mannerisms.</p>
<p class="TX">“Due to the nature of the contest, both Saika and Mushiki must be present onstage at the same time,” Kuroe explained. “This is the only way.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> I guess that makes sense,” he murmured, lowering his voice so no one outside could overhear.</p>
<p class="TX">“By the way,” she added, her eyes narrowing. “You seemed to enjoy Clara’s charms just now.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“You’ve been acting like you would naturally choose Saika, but that looked like a close call to me. Wouldn’t you say?”</p>
<p class="TX">“N-no, I was just<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m not blaming you. No, rather, I should commend Clara for putting up such a good fight.” She paused for a moment. “The word <span class="ITAL">defeat</span> doesn’t belong in the same sentence as the name <span class="ITAL">Saika Kuozaki</span>. Even in a match as ridiculous as this. You understand that, I trust?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Y-yes, of course. Once the time limit is up, I’ll go back onstage and say Saika won—”</p>
<p class="TX">“That won’t be enough.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">His eyes bulged from their sockets as Kuroe began to unbutton her uniform.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! K-Kuroe?! What are you<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">He had been left stunned by how quickly this was all proceeding, but that didn’t stop her from removing her uniform<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
<p class="TX">She must have been wearing two layers of clothing, as underneath, she had on a bathing suit.</p>
<p class="TX">In the dimly lit space behind the stage, only two dependable pieces of clothing protected her naked body, which otherwise would have been completely exposed. The sight was so extraordinary that Mushiki felt himself swooning.</p>
