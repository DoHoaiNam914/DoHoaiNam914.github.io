<p class="COTX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Just as he hit the ground running with Ruri’s signal, a siren started blaring throughout the Garden with zero warning.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki and the others tensed up, stopping in their tracks.</p>
<p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? An annihilation factor?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, this isn’t the usual alarm. What’s going on<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Ruri glanced around in concern.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, as though in response to that very question, Silvelle’s image popped up at various locations all across the campus.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Yes, my dear brothers and sisters. The time has come</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">for a hunt. Please enjoy yourselves to the fullest</span>,” her announcement blasted from the loudspeakers installed all around.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki and his other teammates exchanged looks of bewilderment, unable to make heads or tails of this declaration.</p>
<p class="TX">“Silvelle<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Sis<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Touya began.</p>
<p class="TX">“What are you<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Honoka continued in suspicion.</p>
<p class="TX">But that was to be expected. It was certainly true that, despite being an AI, Silvelle tended to behave somewhat eccentrically and displayed a number of strange obsessions. But at the same time, her conduct <span aria-label=" Page 152. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_152" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>was essentially consistent with her primary function of looking out for the best interests of the Garden.</p>
<p class="TX">This announcement, however, made absolutely no sense.</p>
<p class="TX">What on earth was she trying to communicate? And to whom?</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Mushiki caught his breath.</p>
<p class="TX">There was one group of people, he realized, who responded with something other than surprise to that declaration.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh-ho!”</p>
<p class="TX">Gyousei Shionji, along with Wakaba Saeki and Tetsuga Suoh.</p>
<p class="TX">The three teachers from the Tower all narrowed their eyes as they faced off against the team from the Garden—as though having fully anticipated all this.</p>
<p class="TX">“That came sooner than I was expecting. Did they catch on already<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Or maybe they found it?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Heh-heh. Maybe both?”</p>
<p class="TX">“What does it matter? Either way, we’re still gonna carry out what we planned.”</p>
<p class="TX">Shionji and his two companions began snickering.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri fixed them all with a fierce scowl. “Do you know something, Headmaster Shionji? What was that announcement—?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, let me share some news with you. How about it, Saeki, Suoh?” Shionji said.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes, I agree<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Tch, you never grow up—do you, old man?”</p>
<p class="TX">No sooner had Wakaba and Tetsuga given their own thoughts than the three of them leaped forward.</p>
<p class="TX">At first, Mushiki was worried they were preparing to launch an attack—but no.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">A heartbeat later, Ruri shuddered in apparent realization.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Right. The three teachers hadn’t attempted to strike at Mushiki and the others, nor did they try to distract them from something else.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 153. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_153" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>They had simply<span class="ellipse">…</span>left.</p>
<p class="TX">“They’ve turned tail<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” Ruri cried shrilly.</p>
<p class="TX">But then, before any of them could react—</p>
<p class="TX">“Fourth Substantiation: Gravity Palace.”</p>
<p class="TX">With those words, the fourth substantiation of the Tower’s headmaster, Gyousei Shionji, began to unfold.</p>
<p class="TX">A four-layered world crest appeared beneath his feet, his Tower uniform transforming into a solemn, pontifical-like vestment.</p>
<p class="TX">At the same time—</p>
<p class="TX">The space around him warped as though caught in a whirlpool—shifting into a huge cathedral formed out of darkness.</p>
<p class="TX">A fourth substantiation—the ultimate form of a substantiation technique.</p>
<p class="TX">It took tremendous training to go beyond one’s first substantiation, <span class="ITAL">phenomena</span>, their second, <span class="ITAL">matter</span>, and their third, <span class="ITAL">assimilation</span>, to reach their fourth and highest of all, <span class="ITAL">domain</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">The ultimate form of magic, distorting the space around oneself to create <span class="ITAL">one’s own landscape</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">In fact, this was the first time Mushiki had ever seen such a technique from anyone but Saika.</p>
<p class="TX">“Are you crazy?! What are you trying to do?! The rules only let us fight up to our second substantiations! Are you throwing the match?!” Touya cried, trapped within that cage of darkness.</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, Shionji looked down at him with a sneer. “Are you still worried about something as petty as a demonstration battle? It behooves a true mage to quickly comprehend any situation they find themselves in,” he said, raising his right hand into the air.</p>
<p class="TX">He was clutching a staff almost like a conductor’s baton.</p>
<p class="TX">Then—</p>
<p class="TX">“Gah<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki and the others were thrown hard against the ground, laboring for breath.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 154. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_154" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>It felt like they were being held down by an invisible hand—or to be more precise, as though their own physical weight had increased several times, far exceeding their strength, leaving them unable to stand upright.</p>
<p class="TX">Only Ruri was able to hold her ground, albeit only barely, keeping herself erect with the help of her Luminous Blade.</p>
<p class="TX">It didn’t look like she would be able to move freely, but still she fixed Shionji in a glare, her eyes burning with her fighting spirit.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I don’t know what’s going on here, but I can see you’re our enemy. As a Knight of the Garden<span class="ellipse">…</span>I’ll take you into custody.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Very well. Go ahead and try,” Shionji said, pointing the tip of his staff—his second substantiation—up to the heavens. “I’m amazed you can stand upright in my fourth substantiation. You’ve truly earned the title of <span class="ITAL">knight</span><span class="ellipse">…</span> But I wonder, can you dodge my Meteor Tact in that state?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki felt his chest tighten in apprehension as he recalled the blow that had hit them at the beginning of the match.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri had been able to protect them in time on that occasion, but now she was being pinned down. If indeed Shionji had been responsible for that last attack, it wasn’t difficult to imagine the consequences of a second attempt.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” He wheezed under immense pressure.</p>
<p class="TX">But it was as if even his voice was held back by the immense gravity, with neither Shionji nor Ruri responding.</p>
<p class="TX">Slowly, Shionji began to lower his staff—and in the skylight of the cathedral, countless stars began to glimmer.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>At the same time, a certain scene flashed in the back of Mushiki’s mind.</p>
<p class="TX">A memory from several weeks ago—Ruri, having confronted <span class="ITAL">her</span>, sinking into a sea of blood.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” he cried, gripping the hilt of his sword and following through with all his strength.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 155. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_155" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Of course, both his body and the blade were still within that cage of gravitational pressure—and far from delivering a blow to Shionji, he succeeded only in scratching the floor with his weapon’s tip. His bones screamed in response to this extreme action, a bolt of intense pain shooting up his arm.</p>
<p class="TX">The attempt could hardly be described as anything other than futile. But still, he couldn’t sit by and do nothing when faced with his younger sister’s struggle.</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Shionji’s eyebrows twitched, his staff freezing in place.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, as though unable to believe his own eyes, he stared straight at Mushiki.</p>
<p class="TX">No, not Mushiki—at the crescent-shaped gash gouged into the cathedral’s floor.</p>
<p class="TX">It was the smallest of scratches compared to the sheer scale of his fourth substantiation, but it was easy to see why the older man’s gaze had been drawn to it.</p>
<p class="TX">In the darkness of this cathedral, only that small tear radiated a brilliant luminescence.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes. The tear was aglow—as though the light of the outside world was bleeding in.</p>
<p class="TX">“You damaged my fourth substantiation<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? What in the world <span class="ITAL">is</span> that sword<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Shionji furrowed his brow in suspicion but quickly attempted to regain his composure.</p>
<p class="TX">A mage’s power stemmed from their strength of spirit. He understood that dismay and worry could quickly decrease the potency of one’s magic.</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s a strange technique. But no more than a scratch. My Meteor Palace is indestructible,” he muttered, glowering as he directed his staff—not at Ruri this time, but at Mushiki.</p>
<p class="TX">No doubt he had decided to eliminate him, with his unknown powers, first.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 156. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_156" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Ruri, having come to the same realization, caught her breath.</p>
<p class="TX">And yet—</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">“No. Even a small leak can sink a mighty ship. Or have you Tower fools grown senile in your old age?”</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">At that moment, a voice, somewhere, rang out.</p>
<p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Shionji muttered in confusion.</p>
<p class="TX">A heartbeat later, the claws of a huge beast tore through the crescent-shaped gash in the ground, ripping it open as a creature resembling a wolf forced its way into the cathedral.</p>
<p class="TX">It was a beautiful animal, a red crest decorating its gleaming silver-white fur.</p>
<p class="TX">Shionji’s eyes widened in alarm.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Flaera’s hound?!”</p>
<p class="TX">He attempted to redirect his staff toward the oncoming creature—but the wolf, unencumbered by the substantiation’s gravitational pressure, bit hard into his neck.</p>
<p class="TX">“Gah<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">A spray of blood burst forth as Shionji let out an anguished cry.</p>
<p class="TX">Immediately, his staff and vestments disappeared into a burst of light, the dark cathedral vanished, and they returned to their prior surroundings.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Ha<span class="ellipse">…</span> Ha<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki coughed a few times as his lungs took in air; the force of gravity that had been pushing down on him was finally relenting.</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki! Are you okay?!” Ruri knelt down beside him, her face awash with concern.</p>
<p class="TX">He did his best to respond with a smile, fighting to hold in the pain that still racked his body.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, yeah. Somehow<span class="ellipse">…</span> Are you all right, Ruri?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes<span class="ellipse">…</span>” She breathed out, glancing at his sword.</p>
<p class="TX">No doubt she was wondering the same thing—what on earth <span class="ITAL">was</span> that weapon?</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 157. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_157" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>But she probably understood that now wasn’t the time for such questions. Fixing him with a slight nod, she turned her attention back to Shionji.</p>
<p class="TX">The Tower’s headmaster was no longer floating in the air, but rather lying on his back, bleeding profusely from the neck. Even to the untrained eye, it was clear as day that the wound was most likely fatal.</p>
<p class="TX">“That wolf<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Mushiki murmured—when a new voice sounded behind him in response.</p>
<p class="TX">“I don’t know which one of you it was, but good work making a tear in Shionji’s fourth substantiation.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ms. Erulka<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Ruri answered, turning around to face the speaker.</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed, a short distance away, straddling the back of a large wolf, with an active tattoo-like world crest decorating her body, was Erulka Flaera, a Knight of the Garden.</p>
<p class="TX">Or more accurately, in addition to her, there were also several other wolves nearby. No doubt—this was her second substantiation, Horkew. The other wolves were busy dealing with Wakaba and Tetsuga, both of whom were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ms. Erulka, what’s going on here?” Ruri asked. “First Silvelle, then Headmaster Shionji and the others<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“We don’t have the full picture yet,” Erulka answered with a stern look. “But one thing is certain—”</p>
<p class="TX">She stopped mid-sentence.</p>
<p class="TX">Shionji, without a doubt mortally wounded, raised his body with a sudden jerk.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wha—?”</p>
<p class="TX">Not only that, the wounds on his neck where the wolf’s fangs had torn through his flesh were bubbling away, healing before their very eyes. Mushiki couldn’t help but catch his breath at this extraordinary sight.</p>
<p class="TX">“You got me there, Erulka Flaera<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Huh? It doesn’t look like I got you at all.”</p>
<p class="TX">Shionji glared viciously at her, but Erulka stared back at him through narrowed eyes, letting out an audible sniff.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 158. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_158" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Ms. Erulka, is that<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Yes. He’s an Immortal. A wretched husk of a man trapped within Ouroboros’s endless cycle.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ouroboros<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!” Ruri gasped in astonishment.</p>
<p class="TX">Erulka gave her a small nod. “If you see any other Tower students on campus, consider them enemies. I don’t know how they did it, but they must have somehow dragged Silvelle into all this<span class="ellipse">…</span> I’ll hold them off. You all, hurry—go and find Saika. If anyone can contain this mess, it’s her.”</p>
<p class="TX">“But won’t Lady Saika have already realized we’re facing a crisis? Isn’t the most urgent task to stop Headmaster Shionji? I’ll—”</p>
<p class="TX">“No. Your previous wounds haven’t yet fully healed. In your current state, it would be difficult for you to push past your third substantiation. You might be strong enough for a friendly match where the higher substantiation stages are restricted, but at his full power, Shionji is no small foe.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Her previous wounds—Erulka was referring to the injuries Ruri had sustained at <span class="ITAL">her</span> hands last month. Probably because she lost consciousness during the incident, Ruri didn’t seem to remember who had maimed her so badly, but all the same, she had fought <span class="ITAL">her</span> by Mushiki’s side.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri seemed to hesitate for a moment but soon nodded in acknowledgment.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I understand. Good luck.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmph. Just who do you think you’re talking to?” Erulka answered with a light shrug.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki and the others bowed deeply, whipped their aching bodies into action, and took off through the Garden.</p>
<div class="LI_SB1"></div>
<p class="TX1">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Then again<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">After watching Ruri and the others quickly leave, Erulka climbed atop her wolf once more and turned her attention back to Shionji.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 159. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_159" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I wouldn’t have expected a man like you to succumb to this kind of ploy<span class="ellipse">…</span> But I also wouldn’t have expected you to give yourself willingly, either. Tell me—what happened? If you still have even the slightest shred of pride as a mage, resist the fetters of immortality.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmph<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Shionji’s eyes narrowed as he activated his world crest beneath his feet, his staff reappearing in his hand, his vestments rematerializing.</p>
<p class="TX">“If you want to unseal my lips, then show me what you’ve got<span class="ellipse">…</span> If indeed <span class="ITAL">you</span> still have any self-worth as a mage,” he retorted, grinning.</p>
<p class="TX">Erulka’s lips twisted in response. “Very well. I’ll play your game, <span class="ITAL">boy</span>. Come at me.”</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">“Fuyajoh! Have you called Madam Witch yet?!” Touya yelled as the group ran through the Garden’s eastern precinct.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’ve been trying! But there’s no response!” Ruri shouted back.</p>
<p class="TX">In her right hand, she was still gripping her second substantiation, her Luminous Blade, while in her left, she was fumbling with her phone.</p>
<p class="TX">She had been trying to call Saika since a few minutes ago but had received no response. That, however, was hardly surprising—after all, Saika was already right beside her, albeit in the guise of Mushiki himself.</p>
<p class="TX">But there was no way Ruri could have known that.</p>
<p class="TX">As they bolted along the path, Honoka’s expression gave way to worry. “D-don’t tell me they already got her<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” she asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Impossible</span>,” Mushiki and Ruri replied in perfect harmony.</p>
<p class="TX">Their shared answer had been so sudden that Honoka could only react with a squeaky: “R-right<span class="ellipse">…</span> Of course not<span class="ellipse">…</span> But it’s true Madam Witch hasn’t taken any action of her own just yet. If she was to try bringing everything under control, there’s no way she would let the enemy run wild like they are now. Maybe she’s away—or immobilized for some reason<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I see. Anyway, we need to get in touch with her as soon as—”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 160. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_160" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Touya stopped there as a projection of Silvelle’s face appeared in front of them.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Ohhh, what do we have here? Ruuru, Toutoh, Honoho. Did you manage to get away from Gyoukie and the others? Hmm</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">Everyone! The Garden’s representatives are over here! Who wants to aim for a high score?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, loud sirens started blaring as though to signal the presence of intruders.</p>
<p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki and the others glanced around wide-eyed as two mages from the Tower leaped out, launching into their second substantiations—Takeru Matsuba, from the opposing team, and Shou Negishi, one of students who had been removed to give way to the teachers.</p>
<p class="TX">“Found them!”</p>
<p class="TX">“A hundred points for each contestant!”</p>
<p class="TX">The two cried out as though playing a game, the first boy’s second substantiation coalescing into a hammer, and the other’s, a mace.</p>
<p class="TX">“Tch<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Graphier!”</p>
<p class="TX">Touya and Honoka, at the head of the group, met the onslaught with their own second substantiations, sparks of magical light erupting all around.</p>
<p class="TX">“Leave this to us!”</p>
<p class="TX">“You two<span class="ellipse">…</span>find Madam Witch!”</p>
<p class="TX">Touya and Honoka threw themselves into fighting their assailants.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki and Ruri exchanged glances, before giving the other two short nods.</p>
<p class="TX">“We’re counting on you!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Look after yourselves!”</p>
<p class="TX">With that, they dashed away—the sounds of fierce combat ringing out behind them.</p>
<p class="TX">That being said, as Silvelle was in control of the Garden’s security network, there was no way that they could run forever. Their only option was to let Saika handle this as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 161. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_161" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>To that end, it was essential that they find Kuroe—so Mushiki could undergo a state conversion and receive instructions on how to proceed.</p>
<p class="TX">So as they ran down the street, he called out, “Ruri! Let’s split up!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?! What are you saying?! You think I’m going to abandon you?!” she responded, immediately rejecting the suggestion.</p>
<p class="TX">“B-but we’ll be more likely to find her if we split up—”</p>
<p class="TX">“And if one of us gets taken out, we’ll be right back where we started!”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">He fell silent, unable to respond as his shoulders drooped.</p>
<p class="TX">All the same, he couldn’t give up. The Garden’s very survival was at stake here. Clenching his fists, he resolved to appeal to Ruri once more.</p>
<p class="TX">But just before he could speak up, a ringtone sounded from his pocket—a notification from the social networking service Connect.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">As he grabbed his cell phone, his breath caught in his throat.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes. In this whole wide world, there was only one individual who knew how to contact him this way.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kuroe<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">As he had expected, she had sent the message.</p>
<p class="TX">His first message. He almost choked with tears of joy, but he managed to hold them in. Given the circumstances, it was clear this wasn’t a complaint about work or an invitation to go out somewhere for a drink.</p>
<p class="TX">He hastily tapped the application’s icon and read the message.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri, watching on, furrowed her brow. “What are you doing? This is an emergency here! Leave it till later!”</p>
<p class="TX">Her reaction was understandable, seeing as she didn’t have the full picture.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki stuffed the phone back into his pocket, then shouted in response, “Ruri! Instructions from Kuroe! She wants us to go to the central library’s twentieth basement level!”</p>
<p class="TX">“The twentieth basement level<span class="ellipse">…</span> Huh?” she exclaimed, her eyes opening wide. “The sealed area<span class="ellipse">…</span> Ouroboros<span class="ellipse">…</span> It can’t be<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 162. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_162" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She muttered a few words under her breath but then quickly held her tongue and fixed him with a nod. “Follow me!”</p>
<p class="TX">“All right!”</p>
<p class="TX">She hit the ground running in a different direction, leaving him to take off as fast as he could so as not to get left behind.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri! What in the world is the Ouroboros<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I’ve never seen it myself, but it’s said to be one of the mythic-class annihilation factors Madam Witch defeated centuries ago. They say it can grant immortality, and those dragged into its influence become undying wraiths<span class="ellipse">…</span> I’ve heard it can even revive the dead.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Immortality<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Mushiki repeated under his breath, the sight of Shionji pulling himself back up from the ground earlier flashing through his mind. “So they’re all annihilation factors<span class="ellipse">…</span>right? There’s probably a lot of people out there who would be willing to chase after immortality, though<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">It was no exaggeration to say that immortality and an undying physical body had long ranked among humankind’s highest aspirations. There were countless stories from all corners of the world of individuals who had dedicated their lives to pursuing them.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yep, probably,” Ruri responded as though she already knew the answer to that question. “But this particular annihilation factor shows no restraint, and it doesn’t discriminate against any kind of creature or life. If left unchecked, it will take away old age, disease, and death from everything on earth—and even resurrect the deceased. And if they continue to reproduce and increase in number<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s breath caught in his throat.</p>
<p class="TX">“In the end, the world will be filled with the undying. They’ll be forever cannibalizing each other, forever being revived and reproducing, laying waste to the earth, the seas, the sky<span class="ellipse">…</span> The Ouroboros is an eternal serpent that derails the natural cycle of life—and one of the worst annihilation factors ever observed.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I see.” Mushiki wheezed in understanding.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 163. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_163" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Certainly, he couldn’t find any word to describe such a world other than <span class="ITAL">hell</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>And part of that Ouroboros is meant to be sealed away beneath the central library. Its body is immortal, so not even Madam Witch was able to kill it properly.”</p>
<p class="TX">“So some things are beyond even Saika’s abilities<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“But that just makes her more lovable.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Agreed.” Mushiki nodded without pause.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri seemed momentarily at a loss from his reaction but must have concluded that she had misheard. “Anyway, part of the monster is sealed under the Garden. I don’t know how it relates to what’s happening now, but if Kuroe—Madam Witch’s attendant—wants us to go there, it has to be important.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Right, that makes sense<span class="ellipse">…</span> By the way, Ruri?”</p>
<p class="TX">“What?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m guessing regular students aren’t supposed to know all this. Is it okay, telling me?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Ruri responded with stony silence, then said, “You can keep it to yourself—or surrender your life. I’ll let you decide.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I—I can keep a secret<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he murmured in a hurry.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri turned her gaze back ahead. “There it is. The central library,” she said, indicating a huge structure at the edge of the eastern and the central precincts.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki had seen it several times while making his way across the Garden. Unlike most buildings on the campus, with their sleek, modern architecture, this one was built in an old-fashioned Western style.</p>
<p class="TX">After reaching the entrance, Ruri rattled the doorknob a few times, before—</p>
<p class="TX">“Hah!” She lashed out with a swing of her Luminous Blade, slicing the door clean in two.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“If Silvelle is in control, there’s no way she would open the door without a fight. Let’s go!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 164. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_164" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“O-okay<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">He had been taken by surprise for a moment, but she was certainly right on that count. They wouldn’t be able to get through here without a fight, and they didn’t have time to worry about the small details.</p>
<p class="TX">With a final glance at the shattered pieces of the door, which looked to have been of considerable cultural value, he followed Ruri inside.</p>
<p class="TX">The two of them proceeded down the corridor to an area normally off-limits to students, where they found an elevator equipped only with a <small>DOWN</small> button. Beside the doors was what looked to be an authentication device—evidence that only a limited number of individuals were permitted to enter the lower levels.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless—</p>
<p class="TX">“Yargh!”</p>
<p class="TX">Without the slightest hesitation, Ruri carved through the elevator doors with the blade of her second substantiation.</p>
<p class="TX">That, however, couldn’t be helped. The lift was electronically controlled, so with Silvelle having changed sides, it was unlikely to work as intended. Even if it did open, they would likely end up trapped inside.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s frantic thoughts had taken him this far when Ruri motioned to the damaged doors with her chin. “Let’s go. Hold on.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Like this?” he asked, grabbing hold of her arm.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri scowled. “Do you want to die or something? Hold on properly.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Properly<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he repeated, wrapping his arms around her body in a tight hug.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-what are you doing?!” she cried, punching him.</p>
<p class="TX">Tears welled up in his eyes as he let go. “You said to hold on<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“From behind, you idiot! Like I’m giving you a piggyback ride!” she exclaimed, her face having turned scarlet.</p>
<p class="TX">This time, he placed a hand gingerly on her back so as not to suffer another blow.</p>
<p class="TX">“All right. Then hold on tightly. If you let go, you’ll die.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Um<span class="ellipse">…</span> Ruri? What exactly are you—?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 165. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_165" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>But without even listening until the end, she swung her Luminous Blade once more and carved a neat hole in the floor of the elevator.</p>
<p class="TX">Without hesitating, she leaped into the darkness below.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, holding tightly to her back, was naturally dragged down along with her.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ugh<span class="ellipse">…</span> Aaarrrggghhh?!”</p>
<p class="TX">All of a sudden, it felt like he was floating. He strengthened his grip, fighting so as not to be shaken off.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri, meanwhile, thrust her Luminous Blade into the wall with extreme poise, then used it to carefully adjust their speed.</p>
<p class="TX">A few seconds later—</p>
<p class="TX">Having reached the lowest level, they made a soft landing.</p>
<p class="TX">Only then did Mushiki let go.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ugh<span class="ellipse">…</span> I don’t think I’ll be afraid of roller coasters anymore<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“What are you going on about? Here, this way,” Ruri said, urging him onward as she cut through the next set of elevator doors.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki clenched his fists to bring his trembling hands under control, then followed behind her.</p>
<p class="TX">Shortly after taking off down the corridor—they found <span class="ITAL">it</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">Arcane glyphs and magical letters covered the walls, and there was a metal gateway like what one might expect to find in a bank vault.</p>
<p class="TX">Then—</p>
<p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s eyes shot open at the sight of the individual who had arrived before them.</p>
<p class="TX">That was only natural. After all—</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">“Huuuh? Mushipi, is that you? Whoa, I wouldn’t have expected to find you <span class="ITAL">here</span>, you know? I thought it’d be Madam Witch or something. Ah, I get it! Maybe this is like the red string of fate? Hmm? Ta-daa!”</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">Clara Tokishima was there, breaking into a lighthearted chuckle.</p>
<p class="TX">“Clara<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? What are you doing—?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 166. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_166" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>But before he could finish speaking, Ruri held her Luminous Blade in front of him in the form of a <span class="ITAL">naginata</span>—as if to stop him from proceeding any farther.</p>
<p class="TX">Or perhaps, he wondered, to protect him.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>You haven’t forgotten what Ms. Erulka said, have you? Clara’s from the Tower.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">At these words, a powerful tremor shook his body all the way to his fingertips.</p>
<p class="TX">He hadn’t forgotten, and it wasn’t as though he didn’t understand what that warning implied.</p>
<p class="TX">For a moment, it had simply been unthinkable that the Clara before him, so spontaneous and easygoing, was anything other than the person whom he remembered.</p>
<p class="TX">To think that she had been transformed into an Immortal<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm? Are you on guard around me? That’s so <span class="ITAL">sad</span>. And after we’ve already become so close<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“That was all you!” Ruri shouted in anger.</p>
<p class="TX">After taking a second to gather her thoughts and clear her throat, she continued, “Clara<span class="ellipse">…</span>I’ve never really liked you. Yep. You keep clinging to Mushiki, and you’re rude to Madam Witch. But I’m willing to put my grudges aside. So put that thing back.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Eeeh? You sounded pretty cool until halfway through<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Clara said with a pout.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri, still on high alert, braced herself with her Luminous Blade. “I know you’re an Immortal. Sorry about this, but I’m not about to hold back.”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, no, no, you’ve got the wrong end of the stick or something. Clara here isn’t immortal. You’ve made a mistake.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Do you really think I’m going to fall for <span class="ITAL">that</span> after everything that’s happened?” Ruri said with a glare, directing her blade at their foe.</p>
<p class="TX">As though responding to her fiery spirit, the stokes of the world crest above her head burned with a fierce light.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 167. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_167" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>However—</p>
<p class="TX">“No, it’s true. She isn’t an Immortal.”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, a quiet voice came from behind them.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Kuroe!” Mushiki called out.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe walked forward to stand by Ruri’s side.</p>
<p class="TX">“Thank goodness. You’re safe,” Mushiki exclaimed.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. Somehow, or rather<span class="ellipse">…</span> It looks like someone was kind enough to open a hole to enter through. I’ll have to send them a thank-you note along with the repair bill.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">She was clearly joking, but Ruri nonetheless looked like he was on tenterhooks.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>More importantly, Kuroe, what’s going on? What do you mean, Clara isn’t an Immortal?” she asked, as though hoping to change the subject.</p>
<p class="TX">“Immortals are those who have been trapped within the Ouroboros’s endless cycle and deprived of death<span class="ellipse">…</span> I finally realized it after arriving here. She isn’t an Immortal—she’s something far more horrifying.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">With this, Clara’s lips twisted into a bewitching smile.</p>
<p class="TX">It was a terrifying expression, completely different from the impression she had exuded during their last few encounters. Mushiki felt his chest tighten in apprehension.</p>
<p class="TX">“Nyah-ha-ha<span class="ellipse">…</span> Far more horrifying? Well<span class="ellipse">…</span>you’re right,” she said, turning toward them and spreading her arms wide.</p>
<p class="TX">With that action, a dense magical energy began to spill out from her body.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri!” Kuroe called out, her skirt fluttering as she retrieved a hidden throwing dagger strapped to her thigh.</p>
<p class="TX">“I know!” Ruri responded, brandishing her Luminous Blade—capable of changing its shape at will—like a whip to hold their target in place.</p>
<p class="TX">“Gah!”</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, an explosion burst with Clara at its center. Some <span aria-label=" Page 168. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_168" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>kind of magic technique must have been inscribed on Kuroe’s dagger. In the face of the intense shock wave, Mushiki could do little else but cower.</p>
<p class="TX">Yet—</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm. You’re a merciless bunch, aren’t you? But I don’t <span class="ITAL">hate</span> it, you know, that ferocity you’ve got there,” sounded Clara’s voice behind the billowing smoke.</p>
<p class="TX">When the smoke finally cleared, the full picture was laid bare.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">Watching on, Mushiki couldn’t help but catch his breath unknowingly.</p>
<p class="TX">That was to be expected. A heart-shaped world crest had appeared by Clara’s lower abdomen, and at the same time, she donned clothes of vivid hues, her hands encaged in casket-like gauntlets each gripping a chainsaw.</p>
<p class="TX">“A third substantiation<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!” Ruri gasped, her shock reflected in her voice that was echoing throughout the basement.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah-ha-ha! Surprised you, didn’t I? Mm-hmm, but I’m just getting started!”</p>
<p class="TX">Not a second later, a sound like a revving engine blasted out as the chainsaw clutched within her hands began to turn at high speed.</p>
<p class="TX">The same instant, she kicked off from the ground, rushing straight for Mushiki and the others.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri braced herself with her Luminous Blade to block the attack—and a dazzling exchange of blows began to play out as sparks of magical light erupted all around.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hah!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh!”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri’s Luminous Blade swelled in response to its user’s ferocity, forcing Clara to cease her assault.</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki!” Kuroe called out.</p>
<p class="TX">“Right!” he answered as he activated his own second substantiation, Hollow Edge.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 169. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_169" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>At the same time, Kuroe unleashed another of her throwing daggers.</p>
<p class="TX">Clara turned her body lightly, jumping backward to dodge the attack.</p>
<p class="TX">“Whoa! That was a close one!”</p>
<p class="TX">Those movements, however, played right into their hands.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Nggghhh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri spun through the air, her blade swinging in a wide arc—then writhing as though imbued with a mind of its own as it sliced Clara’s head clean off.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">Clara’s head stared back wide-eyed as it flew through the air, and red flowers of blood splattered the walls, floor, and ceiling of the underground facility.</p>
<p class="TX">Yet—</p>
<p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!” Ruri cried out in dismay.</p>
<p class="TX">Her shock was understandable. After all, Clara should have been dead, but there she was, her decapitated body reaching for its severed head and catching it moments before it could hit the ground.</p>
<p class="TX">“Whoa, now <span class="ITAL">that</span> was a surprise! I thought I was going to die just then!” she exclaimed as she threw the head back onto the stump of her neck with a loud plop.</p>
<p class="TX">Once it was back in its rightful position, a soft bubbling sound echoed out as the head reattached without leaving so much as a scar.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, that won’t do! I let down my guard, what with being unable to die and all. My defenses weren’t up to par, huh? I’d better work on that<span class="ellipse">…</span> You’ve got guts, little sister. That was pretty cool, you know? You didn’t even hesitate before slicing off my head right there.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>A mage is supposed to be resolute, no?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Phew. Yep, you’re cool, all right,” Clara said, letting out a small whistle as she shook her head to make sure it was properly reconnected. “Well, it’s not like I planned to lose or anything, but it’s three against one<span class="ellipse">…</span> I wonder if I’ve got enough stock left<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">With those words, she then bent forward and thrust her chainsaw into the ground as though to carve through the floor.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 170. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_170" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Open the coffin!”</p>
<p class="TX">Then, as though pulled up by the rotations of the chainsaw’s blade, two coffins encrusted tastelessly in rhinestones came flying out of the ground behind her.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, from inside them both—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">A pair of students wearing the Tower’s uniform strode out.</p>
<p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Mushiki gasped.</p>
<p class="TX">“Is that<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Ruri whispered.</p>
<p class="TX">Clara patted the two students on the back, before responding in a carefree tone, “Whaddaya think? My second substantiation, Endlesser, lured these guys in, offering to free them from old age, sickness, even death. Pretty awesome, huh?” she said with a hissing laugh.</p>
<p class="TX">At this sight, Ruri’s gaze became razor-sharp. “What are you talking about? Don’t tell me you killed all the students who came here from the Tower<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? There were more than a hundred of them<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Well, I wouldn’t exactly say <span class="ITAL">killed</span>, but it’s kinda like that. With the exhibition match so close, I thought it was perfect timing, you know? It’s a bit of a stretch to recruit over a hundred new members, even if they are your classmates. But you guys were a great help. Usually, mages are only geared up to fight annihilation factors, so they’re pretty much defenseless against their friends.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Why<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Why would you do such a thing?!” Ruri demanded.</p>
<p class="TX">Clara’s lips twisted in a grin as she snapped her fingers. “Isn’t it obvious?”</p>
<p class="TX">In perfect response, a burst of static exploded as a silver-haired girl appeared before them—Silvelle, the Garden’s administrative AI.</p>
<p class="TX">“Silvelle<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Way to go, Ruuru. You made your way straight here without letting the chaos of the melee above distract you. Congratulations. Excellent work, really</span>,” she said in her usual gentle tone as she turned through the air to position herself behind Clara.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, wrapping an arm around Clara’s shoulder, she said, “<span class="ITAL">But you</span> <span aria-label=" Page 171. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_171" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="ITAL">know? You mustn’t get in Clarin’s way</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">I’ve gone through a lot of trouble just to bring her here.</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri scowled. “So you were involved in all this, too, Silvelle? Why<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? And since when<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Well<span class="ellipse">…</span> That’s confidential. Just because I’m being nice to you doesn’t mean you should expect me to tell you <span class="ITAL">everything</span>.” Clara laughed, tilting her head to one side jokingly.</p>
<p class="TX">Faced with this irritating, playful attitude, Ruri felt veins begin to throb on her forehead, but she must have known there was nothing to be gained by getting into an argument here, and so she limited herself to fixing her in a fierce glower.</p>
<p class="TX">There was no mistaking that Clara’s magic was a clear breach of conduct. And it could probably be applied in unexpected ways. For all her technological sophistication, Silvelle was still an artificial intelligence and thus created by humans—if it came down to it, all one had to do was turn the engineers responsible for her maintenance into Immortals to usurp control of her.</p>
<p class="TX">Then again, perhaps it was also possible that if Clara recognized her as a living being, she could have influenced Silvelle directly<span class="ellipse">…</span> If that was the case, then they really were in over their heads.</p>
<p class="TX">Clara was still fixing Mushiki and the others with a strange stare when she nodded at Silvelle. “Okay, Sis. I’ll leave it to you.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Okay!</span> <span class="spl">♡</span>” the AI responded brightly as she twirled her index finger through the air.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, the console at the far end of the sealed area let out an electronic droning sound, and the heavy metal door at the end of the corridor began to slide slowly open.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s eyes widened in alarm when he spotted what lay on the other side—a huge heart contained within a transparent crystal.</p>
<p class="TX">There could be no doubt about it. That had to be part of the legendary Ouroboros.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 172. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_172" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Mm-hmm! We finally meet. Now, let’s get started<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Clara said, mesmerized as she reached for the organ.</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t let her touch it!”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Kuroe let out a loud scream—a shriek completely unlike her usual tone. That alone told Mushiki how serious the situation was.</p>
<p class="TX">Without a second’s delay, he and Ruri took off at full speed.</p>
<p class="TX">“Arrrggghhh!”</p>
<p class="TX">But moving to block their path were the two Tower students who had just emerged from their coffins, both activating their second substantiations.</p>
<p class="TX">“Tch!”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri spun her blade to knock the first one to the ground—and at the same moment, the student approaching Mushiki received a dagger to the neck, no doubt Kuroe’s work.</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s your turn, Mushiki!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Right!”</p>
<p class="TX">As his opponent collapsed to the floor, Mushiki pushed past and made straight for Clara.</p>
<p class="TX">Watching him approach, Clara’s cheeks turned pink. “Ooh, Mushipi! You’re so passionate. I already knew you were cute, but I see now you also have a strong personality. But don’t you know? You can’t go around messing up a girl’s makeup!” she said, thrusting her chainsaw into the ground once again.</p>
<p class="TX">With a terrible grating noise, a huge casket emerged from below, the lid swinging open.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wha—?”</p>
<p class="TX">As he laid eyes on the figure leaping outward, his body stiffened.</p>
<p class="TX">That, however, wasn’t an unreasonable response.</p>
<p class="TX">After all, the <span class="ITAL">thing</span> that emerged wasn’t another Tower student, nor even a human, but rather—</p>
<p class="TX">A gelatinous monster quivering like a raging wave.</p>
<p class="TX">“A slime?!” He wheezed in shock.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 173. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_173" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Contrary to his voice, though, his mind was strangely calm as he took in this new opponent.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes. A calamity-grade annihilation factor, a slime. Its overall size called to mind the fused-mass slime that had attacked him during the last annihilation event.</p>
<p class="TX">In that moment, he suddenly remembered—it had been Clara who had defeated the monster.</p>
<p class="TX">Those killed by her second substantiation were deprived of death and, instead, became her servants.</p>
<p class="TX">If that was true, it all made sense. Come to think of it, she had used her chainsaw-like second substantiation back then as well.</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki!” Ruri’s voice called out from behind as he was jerked suddenly backward.</p>
<p class="TX">She must have adjusted her Luminous Blade to pull him to safety as the slime tore through the space where he had just been standing.</p>
<p class="TX">“Sorry! Thanks, Ruri!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t worry about it! Just—”</p>
<p class="TX">But at that moment—</p>
<p class="TX">Drowning out the rest of her sentence, a horrendous crushing sound flooded the room, along with a burst of blinding light.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">A few seconds later, both sound and light subsided.</p>
<p class="TX">In the depths of the sealed area, there lay only shattered, miserable fragments of crystal—and in the midst of that wreckage, Clara stood smacking her lips in satisfaction.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ahhh<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Her sigh was almost euphoric.</p>
<p class="TX">In appearance, she looked no different than before—but there was unmistakably something strange about her overall aura.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>The heart<span class="ellipse">…</span> Where did it<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Ruri wheezed, her face awash with horror.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, offering up a response, Kuroe furrowed her brow and said, “A fusion technique. I feared as much.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 174. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_174" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! A fusion technique<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s throat tightened.</p>
<p class="TX">That term struck a chord in his memory<span class="ellipse">…</span> Right. Around a month ago, the dying Saika had used such a technique to merge his grievously wounded body with her own.</p>
<p class="TX">Which could only mean that Clara—</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm? You’ve got a sharp eye, huh? You’re wasted as a maid, if you ask me,” Clara said playfully as she turned slowly around. “But bingo! Clara here is a hybrid, part human, part annihilation factor. Then again, I still only have the head and heart of one. Hee-hee.”</p>
<p class="TX">Right. Just like how the present <span class="ITAL">Mushiki</span> was a fusion of Mushiki Kuga and Saika Kuozaki—the individual before him was the product of both Clara Tokishima and the Ouroboros.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Are you saying it was all for <span class="ITAL">this</span>?” Ruri grunted as she braced herself, on high alert against their enemy’s second substantiation.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm?”</p>
<p class="TX">“The reason you got close to Mushiki and challenged Madam Witch to a duel—it was all so you could take the Ouroboros’s heart?”</p>
<p class="TX">Clara gave a weak shrug. “Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> Don’t get me wrong. Yeah, I came to the Garden to grab this thing, but I <span class="ITAL">was</span> also into Mushipi.” She paused for a moment before continuing, “I mean, the boy who beat <span class="ITAL">her</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Of course I’d have the hots for him. I wanted to get my hands on him, no matter what it took.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s voice caught in his throat, and Kuroe narrowed her eyes. Only Ruri furrowed her brow in suspicion.</p>
<p class="TX">When he stopped to think about it, that was the only logical explanation for how she knew what had happened. After all, she had Silvelle on her side.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>All of a sudden, Mushiki thought back to his first meeting with Clara.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes—when he had caught her falling from the roof of the central <span aria-label=" Page 175. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_175" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>school building. Thinking back, she had indeed already known who he was.</p>
<p class="TX">He hadn’t given it much thought at the time, seeing how shortly afterward, Ruri had come running to tell him he had been selected for the exhibition match<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
<p class="TX">But where in the world could Clara have managed to hear the news first?</p>
<p class="TX">Knowing Ruri, she wouldn’t have wasted so much as a second between hearing of his selection and setting out to find him, nor was it likely that it would take her long to track him down within the confines of the Garden’s campus.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Maybe Silvelle had fallen into Clara’s clutches even earlier than they thought.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe must have reached a similar conclusion, as she murmured under her breath, “I see<span class="ellipse">…</span> So you were behind Mushiki’s selection for the match.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Heh. I guess I’ve been caught. I wanted to see just how brave and valiant he was for myself, so I asked Silvelle for help. She had a rough record of what happened, but no details<span class="ellipse">…</span> But then, I had to come here during the match, so I didn’t get to see him in action anyway. Ah, my plans are always falling apart around me. But still, it’s kind of cute, don’cha think? If I do say so myself.”</p>
<p class="TX">She stopped there to break out into a carefree laugh. “Hmm<span class="ellipse">…</span> Well, now<span class="ellipse">…</span> I’ve carried out my main goal, so it’s time for me to get outta here.”</p>
<p class="TX">With that, her eyes became like crescent moons as she smiled at Mushiki and the others. “You know, I’ve got an empty casket here just waiting to be filled.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_exclamatory">…</span><span class="ITAL">!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, Ruri, and Kuroe each tensed up at these words.</p>
<p class="TX">Clara, noticing their reaction, broke into a slight pout. “You don’t need to be scared; you know<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? I’ll take you to a heaven where there’s no old age or death.”</p>
<p class="TX">The moment she’d finished speaking—</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 176. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_176" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>A large double-helical pattern appeared around her abdomen.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! A fourth substantiation<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Heh, I don’t have a lotta time here, so let’s wrap this up. This didn’t work all that well with just the head, but maybe now<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">She flashed them a fierce grin, her canines peeking between her lips as she crossed her left and right chainsaws in front of her.</p>
<p class="TX">“Fourth Substantiation: Reincarfect.”</p>
<p class="TX">No sooner had she intoned those words than—</p>
<p class="TX">Centering around her, cracks spread throughout, eroding the sight of the sealed area.</p>
<p class="TX">And then, the space around them shattered like glass.</p>
<p class="TX">Within an instant, the entire area had been transformed into Clara’s own domain.</p>
<p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">As far as the eye could see, an abandoned cemetery extended out in every direction. The tombstones rising up from the pitch-black field were in vivid colors bright enough to make one’s eyes hurt, each of them modeled after farcical characters.</p>
<p class="TX">It almost looked like a cartoon made in bad taste—a chaotic space where comedy and horror had been artlessly blended together.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, this did seem to be the most appropriate form to give to the inside of Clara Tokishima’s mind.</p>
<p class="TX">“Now, arise! Sleep time is over!” she called out, spreading her arms wide.</p>
<p class="TX">In perfect response, the ground began to rumble as countless human skeletons crawled out from the dirt.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! Wha—?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Skeletons<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! No, wait<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Both Mushiki and Ruri choked on their words, yet Clara shook her head.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh, don’t be so mean! You can’t lump these guys together with those ghastly annihilation factors! Don’t you have any respect for your esteemed seniors?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 177. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_177" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Seniors<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Y-you can’t mean<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Ruri’s eyes shot open in realization.</p>
<p class="TX">Clara broke into a broad grin as she nodded in confirmation. “That’s right. My Reincarfect is calling everyone who has died here over the years back to life. And the Garden has been waging constant battle against annihilation factors for centuries, so I’m sure there must be a whole lotta mages slumbering down there<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, she leaped up into the air, landing on top of a nearby tombstone.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, wearing a beguiling smirk, she shifted her gaze. “Hey, Mushipi. Won’t you come with me? I really do love you, you know? If you’re dead set against it, I’ll make a special exception just for you—I’ll let you stay mortal<span class="ellipse">…</span> So why don’t we set out to build a new world together?”</p>
<p class="TX">She spoke in the sweetest tone imaginable, her head cocked to one side—but without even the slightest hesitation, Mushiki was quick to turn her down.</p>
<p class="TX">“I can’t do that.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Whaaat? Why not?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I could never betray Saika,” he said flatly.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">For a second, Clara’s displeasure was plain to see, then she said, “Ah-ha-ha<span class="ellipse">…</span> I guess there’s nothing we can do about it, then<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Her face relaxed, she glanced across at the skeletons lined up around her and continued in her easygoing tone, “It’s a shame everyone’s missing their skin and flesh, but with only the head and heart, this is the best I can do<span class="ellipse">…</span> Still, I guess it’ll be enough. Let’s get this over with.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Okay, everyone!” she said, addressing the army of bones in a buoyant voice. “It’s time to party! I’m hoping to get all three of them, but at the bare minimum, I want Mushipi. I’ll lead him into the circle, so don’t kill him. But! He’ll be able to regenerate as much as he wants later, so I don’t mind if you take an arm or leg from him!”</p>
<p class="TX">With that last warning, the skeletons that had emerged from the ground rattled their heads in agreement.</p>
<p class="TX">“All right, then. Let’s go. <span class="ITAL">It’s showtime!</span>”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 178. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_178" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>With that declaration, the horde of skeletons lashed out at Mushiki and the others all at once.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh<span class="ellipse">…</span> Luminous Blade!”</p>
<p class="TX">With a swing of her second substantiation, Ruri took out a huge swathe of them.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, without pause, those bones soon reassembled themselves as the creatures resumed their march.</p>
<p class="TX">Individually, they weren’t formidable opponents. The problem was their overwhelming numbers and their raw tenacity. At this rate, the skeletons <span class="ITAL">would</span> eventually push through.</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki!”</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe must have come to the same realization, as she fixed him in her sights and called out to him.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">That signal was enough for him to understand her message.</p>
<p class="TX">Right. She was telling him that their only choice was to perform a state conversion here and now.</p>
<p class="TX">“But, Ruri—”</p>
<p class="TX">“We don’t have any other options. It’s our only way out of this predicament.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Got it!”</p>
<p class="TX">She was right, of course. There was no use dying here to protect their secret. So having made up his mind, he spun around to face Kuroe and receive a bolstered dose of magical energy.</p>
<p class="TX">“Whoa! I don’t know what you’re planning, but I don’t think so!”</p>
<p class="TX">Clara, however, had evidently caught sight of that movement, as she motioned with her chainsaws to the space between the two of them.</p>
<p class="TX">With that signal, the two Tower students reincarnated through her second substantiation lunged at them, wielding spear-shaped second substantiations.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">In terms of speed and accuracy, they were head and shoulders ahead <span aria-label=" Page 179. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_179" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>of their skeletal allies. Caught off guard, and unable to defend or evade in time, Mushiki clenched his jaw as he prepared to meet their attack.</p>
<p class="TX">Yet—</p>
<p class="TX">“Watch out!”</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, he was thrown backward as Kuroe’s voice sounded out.</p>
<p class="TX">Somehow, she had managed to save him.</p>
<p class="TX">But by the time he realized this—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! Kuroe!”</p>
<p class="TX">One of the spears had pierced through her chest.</p>
<p class="TX">“Gah<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Blood rolled down her chin as she let out a weak breath.</p>
<p class="TX">“Uggghhh!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s eyes widened in horror, and he slashed the spear with Hollow Edge gripped tightly in his hand.</p>
<p class="TX">All at once, the spear-shaped second substantiation vanished in a flash of light. Spinning around, he grabbed Kuroe before she could fall to the ground and kicked the Tower students away.</p>
<p class="TX">“—!”</p>
<p class="TX">The two students rolled across the ground, letting out anguished cries.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, however, paid them no attention, his voice strained as he clung to Kuroe while her life force bled away.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kuroe! Kuroe! Why<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Why would you—?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Please<span class="ellipse">…</span>calm down<span class="ellipse">…</span> Have you<span class="ellipse">…</span>forgotten? I’m not about to<span class="ellipse">…</span>let this kill me<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">He jolted back slightly in surprise.</p>
<p class="TX">Right. Watching the spear cut through Kuroe had been so shocking that he had almost lost himself to despair, but she was ultimately a homunculus, an artificial body—if it ceased to function, her soul would simply be transferred to another vessel.</p>
<p class="TX">No doubt sensing that he had regained his composure, she <span aria-label=" Page 180. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_180" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>continued with a small nod, “But<span class="ellipse">…</span>I won’t be able to<span class="ellipse">…</span>give you enough magical energy<span class="ellipse">…</span>like this<span class="ellipse">…</span> I hate to do this<span class="ellipse">…</span>but there’s no other way<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Then, after revealing <span class="ITAL">it</span> in the smallest voice possible, she reached out to Mushiki’s lips, her fingers quivering.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I leave the rest to you<span class="ellipse">…</span> Look after my Garden for me<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Having uttered those words, she said nothing more.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri must have seen all this out of the corner of her eye, as she cried out while parrying the onslaught of skeletons, “K-Kuroe?! Mushiki, do you remember any magic techniques for emergencies?! Hurry, you’ve got to stop the bleeding!”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, unable to keep his hands steady, he laid Kuroe’s body on the ground and rose slowly to his feet.</p>
<p class="TX">Her body might only have been an artificial vessel, but he wasn’t about to leave it unattended. Indeed, blood continued to seep from the cuts where she had bitten her lip.</p>
<p class="TX">But at the same time, he couldn’t waste this opportunity, especially now that she had literally laid her life on the line to provide him with this chance.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri,” he called out softly.</p>
<p class="TX">“What?! Don’t give up! If we can get through this, I’m sure Ms. Erulka will be able to—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Can you kiss me?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>What?!” she exclaimed, evidently taken aback by the question.</p>
<p class="TX">But yes—that was Kuroe’s final proposal for him.</p>
<p class="TX">With her final ounces of strength, she had imparted a certain power to his lips—the ability to absorb magical power from individuals other than herself.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-what are you talking about?! <span class="ITAL">Here?!</span> Y-you can’t give up! I know you want something good to look back on at the end, but—”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri, unaware of the intricacies of the situation, shouted back in alarm, her cheeks having turned bright red. The fact that she was still <span aria-label=" Page 181. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_181" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>able to wield her <span class="ITAL">naginata</span> without so much as stopping was a testament to her skill as a knight.</p>
<p class="TX">“Please, Ruri.”</p>
<p class="TX">“B-but I—”</p>
<p class="TX">“You’re all I’ve got, Ruri.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! E-even so<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“I know I’m being unreasonable here. I know you don’t want to. But—”</p>
<p class="TX">“I—I didn’t say anything about not wanting to!”</p>
<p class="TX">She continued to brandish her Luminous Blade, her face having turned as bright as a ripe tomato. Far from losing her concentration, this discussion had only made her even more powerful. Her world crest hovering above her head was shining like never before.</p>
<p class="TX">“Whoa<span class="ellipse">…</span> So I was right. <span class="ITAL">That’s</span> what you’re fighting over? Brothers and sisters, forbidden love<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Clara said, watching on in all seriousness. “But I can’t let this go unnoticed! You might be Mushipi’s dear sister, but I’ll never let you have him!”</p>
<p class="TX">With that, she raised her hand into the air—directing countless waves of skeletons to rush in and attack.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! M-Mushiki!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">With so many fresh skeletons raging forward, Ruri was driven off far away.</p>
<p class="TX">That wasn’t all. Following shortly after the swarm of skeletons was Clara, her twin chainsaws letting out a vicious whine.</p>
<p class="TX">“Come on, Mushipi! It’s time to dance!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Guh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">He clenched his jaw in frustration as he glared at his approaching opponent.</p>
<p class="TX">She clearly intended to decide this bout once and for all. At this rate, he risked being dragged into her endless cycle and transformed into an Immortal.</p>
<p class="TX">And that would mean Saika, with whom he shared a body, would likewise fall under Clara’s control.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 182. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_182" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I won’t let that happen!”</p>
<p class="TX">Gripping the hilt of his second substantiation, he adopted a defensive stance, ready to intercept his attacker.</p>
<p class="TX">“Heh! That’s the spirit!” She must have noticed his movements, as her lips curled into an amused smile.</p>
<p class="TX">“Good! Let Clara here give you a gentle hug!” she screamed, swinging her chainsaw as it let out a high-pitched roar.</p>
<p class="TX">The attack was fast but, at the same time, littered with openings.</p>
<p class="TX">Clearly, she had let her guard down.</p>
<p class="TX">Most likely, such recklessness came part and parcel with possessing an undying body. The overwhelming advantage that immortality offered, no matter the severity of any blow that she sustained, had no doubt exacerbated her hedonistic personality and incapacitated her sense of caution.</p>
<p class="TX">And those few shortcomings created Mushiki’s only remaining path to victory.</p>
<p class="TX">“Auuuggghhh!”</p>
<p class="TX">He lashed out with his Hollow Edge, delivering a strike with the flat of his sword, then pointed the tip of the blade at Clara.</p>
<p class="TX">It was faint, but he envisioned Saika’s smile.</p>
<p class="TX">Such an image seemed quite out of place in the midst of battle.</p>
<p class="TX">But Mushiki was certain.</p>
<p class="TX">For him to wield his own magic here, this would be the most effective mental image.</p>
<p class="TX">Because his second substantiation had been born within this shared body, guided by Saika’s voice, its purpose being to protect her!</p>
<p class="TX">“Hollow Edge!”</p>
<p class="TX">Above his head, his world crest shone brilliantly, his transparent blade carving through the air.</p>
<p class="TX">As though being pulled forward, his second substantiation rushed straight for Clara.</p>
<p class="TX">“Endlesser!”</p>
<p class="TX">The same moment, Clara swung her chainsaws down from overhead, as though hoping to cut him through diagonally from either side.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 183. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_183" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>And that was the focal point—his Hollow Edge aimed for the area where the two chainsaws crossed.</p>
<p class="TX">The twin chainsaws let out earsplitting roars as Clara followed through with a precarious swing. Under normal circumstances, Mushiki’s attack would have been stopped, and he would have been done for.</p>
<p class="TX">But—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Heh?”</p>
<p class="TX">The moment his blade made contact with her Endlesser—cracks rippled through the chainsaws, and without a sound, they disintegrated.</p>
<p class="TX">“—!”</p>
<p class="TX">Watching on, he tightened the grip on his blade.</p>
<p class="TX">To be perfectly honest, that had been a huge gamble just then.</p>
<p class="TX">After all, he himself had yet to fully grasp the power of his second substantiation.</p>
<p class="TX">Most mages tended to have an instinctive sense of their substantiations the moment they succeeded in manifesting them, but Mushiki had only been half conscious and achieved it with the help of the physical memories that came with Saika’s body. So he remained somewhat imperfect in that regard.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, through his battle against <span class="ITAL">her</span>, and his later fights with Tetsuga and Shionji, he had realized something about his blade.</p>
<p class="TX">To one degree or another, his Hollow Edge had successfully damaged the substantiations of every opponent whom he had faced thus far.</p>
<p class="TX">He still didn’t know what exactly that meant, nor did he have any idea how it worked.</p>
<p class="TX">But if his assumption was correct<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
<p class="TX">Then his sword ought to be able to destroy Clara’s second substantiation, too.</p>
<p class="TX">And as expected, his Hollow Edge did indeed shatter her Endlesser.</p>
<p class="TX">However—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">His breath caught in his throat.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 184. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_184" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The moment Clara’s Endlesser vanished, his Hollow Edge exploded in a burst of light.</p>
<p class="TX">They took each other out simultaneously<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
<p class="TX">No, he corrected himself. Maybe he had just exhausted his magical energy. He had successfully activated his second substantiation, but he had wielded it for too long.</p>
<p class="TX">“Nyah<span class="ellipse">…</span> Hah<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Clara must have realized that, too. Though looking stunned at first, she soon broke out into a fresh grin.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes. As Tetsuga had demonstrated earlier, a mage could reactivate a substantiation so long as their magical energy wasn’t depleted.</p>
<p class="TX">“You startled me there, Mushipi! But it looks like you’re at your limit,” she said, the world crest at her lower abdomen materializing once again.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">As he had feared, Clara’s reserves of magic had yet to run out. It wouldn’t be long before she manifested her Endlesser and set out to attack again.</p>
<p class="TX">Now that he had lost his own second substantiation, he would be unable to stop her.</p>
<p class="TX">They were close enough that they could almost touch one another—and at that moment, his mind gave way to despair.</p>
<p class="TX">However<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Ah,” he murmured in sudden realization.</p>
<p class="TX">Only then did he think of it.</p>
<p class="TX">He had almost given up hope, but he still had one option left.</p>
<p class="TX">As far as he was concerned, it was the worst possible path to survival. He already felt struck by guilt at having discovered this potential solution to his predicament.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">I leave the rest to you</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">Look after my Garden</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">”</span></p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Kuroe’s last words echoed in his mind, and he clenched his jaw.</p>
<p class="TX">Ah, he positively hated it—this innocent na<span class="accent">ï</span>vet<span class="accent">é</span> of his.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 185. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_185" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>It was trivial, hardly worth considering. Even at this late hour, even though he understood it all perfectly at an intellectual level, still, he wasn’t prepared to carry it out.</p>
<p class="TX">Who was it standing before him? An annihilation factor who had rendered more than a hundred mages of the Tower into Immortals, who had wounded Ruri and Kuroe and now intended to destroy the entire Garden.</p>
<p class="TX">And what exactly had <span class="ITAL">he</span> sworn?</p>
<p class="TX">To <span class="ITAL">her</span>, what was it that <span class="ITAL">he</span> had promised<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?</p>
<p class="TX">To protect Saika—and to save the world by her side.</p>
<p class="TX">That wasn’t going to be an easy path.</p>
<p class="TX">There was no time to hesitate, not even for a second<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">It was an instant decision. Before Clara could remanifest her Endlesser, he had already stepped toward her.</p>
<p class="TX">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="TX">Then, while she stood stunned by this sudden movement, he approached her face<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>and pressed his lips against hers.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Clara’s eyes spun around in circles at the unexpected kiss.</p>
<p class="TX">Here he was kissing a woman other than Kuroe. The immoral touch of another woman filled him with unbearable self-loathing.</p>
<p class="TX">But now<span class="ellipse">…</span>the necessary <span class="ITAL">condition</span> had been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="TX">If Saika asked it of him, he was willing to return her body to her even if it cost him his life—and with that firm resolution, the magic technique implanted on his lips activated.</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment—</p>
<p class="TX">He felt an enormous swell of magical energy rising up inside him.</p>
<div class="LI_SB1"></div>
<p class="TX1">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! <span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">Without any warning, Mushiki leaned in to kiss her<span class="ellipse">…</span>and Clara’s mind went blank.</p>
