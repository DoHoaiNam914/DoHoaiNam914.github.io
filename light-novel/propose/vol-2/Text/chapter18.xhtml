<p class="COTX">That morning, the sound of birds chirping could be heard even clearer than usual.</p>
<p class="TX">One night had passed since the festival held before the main event. The grounds of the Garden were quiet and still, as though to belie the hectic hustle and bustle of the previous day.</p>
<p class="TX">The students who had been jostling about here and there across the campus just a half day before were now nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="TX">But that was to be expected.</p>
<p class="TX">After all—this was all soon to become a battlefield.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki took a deep breath to calm his mind before looking around once more.</p>
<p class="TX">He and the others were standing in front of the research building located at the far end of the Garden’s eastern precinct. The tall structure, seemingly composed of a bundle of looming spires, cast a distinctive shadow over the plaza.</p>
<p class="TX">Four figures were waiting there in total, all of them wearing uniforms similar to his own. This, however, was their first time meeting him face-to-face as Mushiki Kuga.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 118. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_118" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“Yo. So you’re the new transfer student? I’ve heard rumors about you. I’m Touya Shinozuka, a third-year. Thanks for coming today,” said a tall male student as he held out his hand in greeting.</p>
<p class="TX">Touya Shinozuka. Unlike Mushiki, he had been chosen to represent the Garden the acceptable way.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah yes. Mushiki Kuga. Nice to meet you,” he said, shaking the older youth’s hand.</p>
<p class="TX">Shinozuka’s grip was firm, his smile lively and refreshing.</p>
<p class="TX">Then the female student a short distance behind her male counterpart gave a quick bow. “Um<span class="ellipse">…</span> I’m Honoka Moegi. I’ll try not to get in your way<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” she said in a fearful voice, her body turned slightly away from him and her gaze wavering as she stared at the ground.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. Thank you. I’m not very experienced when it comes to this stuff, but I’ll do my best,” Mushiki replied.</p>
<p class="TX">Honoka, still embarrassed, lowered her head, her long bangs obscuring half her face.</p>
<p class="TX">Like Touya, she, too, had been chosen to represent the Garden. She seemed a little shy, but she must have been highly capable as a mage.</p>
<p class="TX">After greeting the two students, Mushiki found himself sighing in relief as he put his mind at ease.</p>
<p class="TX">He had been worried that, given how conspicuous he had been the day before, his fellow representatives might have misgivings about him—but neither Touya nor Honoka had shown any sign of ill will toward him.</p>
<p class="TX">Well, he couldn’t say what they might have been feeling deep inside, but it was nice to see that they were both willing to build a positive relationship with the team, even if only at a surface level.</p>
<p class="TX">After all, they were all now allies fighting for the same cause. For mages of this level representing their school, perhaps it was natural to try to avoid any unnecessary friction.</p>
<p class="TX">Then again, there were always exceptions.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 119. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_119" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Feeling a piercing gaze at his back, Mushiki glanced over his shoulder.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri, a real Knight of the Garden, was waiting behind him, watching on with grim displeasure.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>It’s good to see you here, too, Ruri<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he said timidly.</p>
<p class="TX">She, however, did nothing to hide her disapproval, fixing him in a glower. “There’s nothing <span class="ITAL">good</span> about it.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>As he had expected, she wasn’t happy about her brother having been selected to represent the school. He hadn’t seen her as himself since the day before. He had fled through the back door behind the stage after the match with Clara to avoid confrontation.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Really, everything’s gone wrong with this exhibition match. You get picked to represent the Garden despite just transferring in, and for some reason, your record shows you’ve even defeated a mythic-class annihilation factor<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” Her voice, already hoarse, trailed off, as though she couldn’t stand it anymore. With each word, blood vessels swelled on the back of her hands, and the wrinkles between her eyebrows grew deeper.</p>
<p class="TX">“Please calm yourself, Knight Fuyajoh.”</p>
<p class="TX">Calling out to her from the side was the fifth student joining them—Kuroe. “The decision has been made, so there is nothing we can do about it,” she admonished in a calm, levelheaded manner. “I understand you don’t want to place your beloved brother in harm’s way, but—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haaa?!” Ruri screamed, her face turning scarlet. “Wh-wh-what are you talking about?! M-m-my <span class="ITAL">beloved</span>?! Wh-wh-who’s that supposed to be?! Don’t go putting words in my mouth!” she rasped. Her panic was writ large, her eyes spinning like a pair of migratory fish.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh, was I mistaken? I thought you were angry because you care deeply about Mushiki?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-wh-<span class="ITAL">who</span> said anything like <span class="ITAL">that</span>?! That’s not it! I just meant as a mage at the Garden, I can’t let someone as inexperienced as <span class="ITAL">him</span> represent us<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 120. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_120" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“Hmm. Knight Fuyajoh, are you saying an inexperienced mage subdued a mythic-class annihilation factor?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Th-that’s<span class="ellipse">…</span> It isn’t even clear he actually <span class="ITAL">did</span> that!”</p>
<p class="TX">“I’ve received confirmation from Lady Saika herself. Or are you accusing her of lying?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” Ruri ground her teeth in frustration.</p>
<p class="TX">But that couldn’t be helped. Like Mushiki, Ruri was a member of the Saika Kuozaki Fan Club. If asked whether she doubted her, she would be left with no choice but to back down.</p>
<p class="TX">Just to note, the Saika Kuozaki Fan Club was an unofficial, imaginary organization. No such entity actually existed.</p>
<p class="TX">But Ruri, still seemingly unconvinced, turned her gaze toward him. “For the sake of this argument, what about all that stuff with Clara?! Ever since she declared him her boyfriend, she somehow got Madam Witch caught up in all this—and even went to the trouble of getting some kind of insane power-up<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">“U-um, I’m not really<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he tried to interrupt, his brow quivering.</p>
<p class="TX">It was undeniably true that Clara had caused a major commotion—and that Mushiki himself was at the center of that—but he had also been dragged into it against his own will. Still, he realized just how poor of a response that was.</p>
<p class="TX">Her face having turned slightly pale, Ruri asked him suspiciously, “Mushiki. Is she really your type?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I—I wouldn’t say that exactly<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Then why did she call you her boyfriend?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I told you: She went and did that all by herself.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Then do you like her?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm?”</p>
<p class="TX">“What? So you won’t answer?”</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s not like that<span class="ellipse">…</span> I mean<span class="ellipse">…</span> She <span class="ITAL">does</span> have nice long hair; she’s calm, cool, dignified, and—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-wh-what are you doing saying all that embarrassing stuff in front of everyone?!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 121. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_121" role="doc-pagebreak"/>For some reason, Ruri’s face had turned scarlet, and she started slamming her fists against his body.</p>
<p class="TX">With no idea what was going on, in his confusion, he was left with no choice but to cross his arms and endure her onslaught.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment—</p>
<p class="TX">A faint light gathered in the center of the square, taking the form of a young woman.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Hi! So we’re all here, my little sisters and brothers? Are you all ready?</span>” the Garden’s administrative AI Silvelle asked in a buoyant tone as she spun around and adopted a cute pose.</p>
<p class="TX">Only then did she seem to realize that Ruri and Mushiki looked like they were fighting in the middle of the plaza.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Huh? Did something happen?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>It’s nothing!” Ruri folded her arms, uttering an audible <span class="ITAL">hmph!</span> and turning away.</p>
<p class="TX">Silvelle stared at her with curiosity for a few seconds but soon snapped back to the situation at hand. <span class="ITAL">“All right. Let me explain the rules of the match, then. The battle area occupies the Garden’s eastern, western, and central precincts. The Garden’s team will start at the easternmost end of the east precinct, and the Tower’s team will start at the westernmost end of the west precinct. The match will begin when the bell sounds at noon.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">She paused for a moment before continuing. “<span class="ITAL">The outer walls of the facilities have been reinforced with defensive magic, so they shouldn’t be damaged by half-hearted strikes, but please refrain from attacking any more than necessary. You can use substantiation techniques up to the second level, and the first team to defeat all their opponents will be declared the winner. Players will be retired if their damage counter reaches zero. You’re all wearing them, I hope?</span>” she asked, gesturing to her own wrist.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki glanced at the watch-shaped device strapped to his arm. The device was emitting a soft-blue light.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“When those counters attached to your uniforms determine that you have sustained a certain amount of damage, the color will change from yellow to red. When that happens, you will be required to retire from the field and make your</span> <span aria-label=" Page 122. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_122" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="ITAL">way to the noncombat area immediately. Any further use of magic will be prohibited. Also, please remember that attacking a retired contestant is also forbidden</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">Well, I guess that’s about it for now? Does anyone have any questions?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Um, Silvelle? Can I have a minute?” Ruri asked with her hand raised.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">”</span> Silvelle, however, showed no indication of responding.</p>
<p class="TX">“Silvelle?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Si-il-vel-le?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Sis,” Ruri said at last in resignation.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Oh! What do you need, Ruuru?</span>” the AI answered with a buoyant smile.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>There’s an additional rule this time as well, right? What about Madam Witch? I mean, she hasn’t come to join us. Where is she?” Ruri asked, glancing around.</p>
<p class="TX">Silvelle tapped herself on the forehead with an exasperated gesture. <span class="ITAL">“Ah, I forgot! Due to the special rule this time, the Garden’s team will begin the battle with only four contestants. Saachie will only be allowed to enter the competition once two of you have been withdrawn. However, please note that if all four members retire from battle before she can enter the combat zone, your team will be deemed to have been</span> wiped out, <span class="ITAL">and the match will end there</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">As for where she is now—”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“I can answer that,” Kuroe said, raising her hand slightly. “Lady Saika is presently on standby outside the combat area. She will be notified as soon as two of you are confirmed to have dropped out of the battle, but you should expect a slight delay before she can actually enter the field herself. If two of your members are defeated, it would be wise for the remaining two to avoid battle and wait for her to join you.”</p>
<p class="TX">With those words, she glanced meaningfully at Mushiki. He responded with a slight nod.</p>
<p class="TX">Of course, she had already told him all this in advance.</p>
<p class="TX">Once that permission was granted, Kuroe would enter the combat area to seek him out and help him undergo a state conversion—and from there, <span class="ITAL">Saika</span> would enter the battle.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 123. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_123" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="ellipse">…</span>But even by their best estimates, the process would take at least three minutes to complete.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> I see. That sounds like the safest approach.” Touya nodded, his expression slightly haggard. “We’re all skilled here<span class="ellipse">…</span> But then again, we’re only students. Probably only Fuyajoh will be strong enough to fight opponents at the level of our teachers. I hate to admit it, but it’s probably no exaggeration to say that this match will hinge on how quickly Madam Witch can join the fray<span class="ellipse">…</span> Ah! Of course, if Kuga here is as strong as everyone says, we might be able to rely on him, too.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Please don’t expect too much of me,” Mushiki murmured fretfully.</p>
<p class="TX">Touya shrugged, answering <span class="ITAL">Okay</span>. Unlike Ruri, he hadn’t objected to Mushiki being part of the team, but he did seem to think it something of a risk to not know the full combat potential of his allies on the field.</p>
<p class="TX">“We’re lucky the battlefield is the Garden this time around. We’re on home turf. So I’d like to suggest we each act independently once the match begins. How does that sound?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Um, but if we’re not careful, it could end up being five against one<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Honoka noted, her solemn face writ with worry.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>That <span class="ITAL">is</span> a possibility. But it will ensure that all four of us can’t be defeated at once. I think it’s best that we don’t fight as a group here.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I see<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Mushiki murmured, stroking his chin, deep in thought.</p>
<p class="TX">It was just like Touya said. This battle would hinge on whether they could play their trump card, Saika. If they kept to standard tactics, they would risk getting wiped out before they had that chance.</p>
<p class="TX">Besides, it would be much easier for him to undergo a state conversion and reemerge as Saika if he had reason to leave the battlefield in the first place.</p>
<p class="TX">“I have no objections,” Mushiki said.</p>
<p class="TX">“Why are <span class="ITAL">you</span> so full of confidence?” Ruri asked with a narrowed eyes.</p>
<p class="TX">Even then, it didn’t look like she was opposed to this strategy, either. Staring at the ground, she nodded.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 124. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_124" role="doc-pagebreak"/>After checking how everyone else felt about this plan, Honoka made up her mind and nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="TX">“All right, it’s decided,” Touya announced. “Once the starting signal sounds, we’ll each go our separate ways. Keep low, scout out potential enemies to target, and if possible, destroy them. Our first priority is Takeru Matsuba. After him, Clara Tokishima.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm. May I ask why those two?” Kuroe asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“Because those are the only ones who we’ll be able to handle as students ourselves,” Touya answered, glancing her way. “Given what we all saw from Clara’s show yesterday, we ought to be careful of her<span class="ellipse">…</span> But I doubt she’s at the same level as the teachers.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I see.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Am I wrong?”</p>
<p class="TX">“No. I think that’s a logical decision,” Kuroe said softly, averting her gaze.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki sensed something bordering apprehension in that look—but he was probably the only one to notice it.</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed, Touya didn’t seem the slightest bit concerned about Kuroe’s response, and he continued, “I don’t mind adding Tetsuga Suoh and Wakaba Saeki to the list of targets just for Fuyajoh—but the headmaster, Shionji, is off-limits. Until Madam Witch joins the fight, don’t attempt to challenge him.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Is he really that strong?” Mushiki asked with a touch of suspicion.</p>
<p class="TX">His impression of the older man had been of an eccentric grandfather harboring a strong sense of rivalry in his heart.</p>
<p class="TX">Yet—</p>
<p class="TX">“He’s the headmaster of a mage-training institute. We all ought to know what <span class="ITAL">that</span> entails.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Touya’s retort possessed such persuasive power that it brooked no objection.</p>
<p class="TX">That said, he was certainly right. Someone of the older man’s standing couldn’t possibly be just any ordinary mage.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 125. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_125" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Mushiki slapped his cheeks with his hands to ready himself and get his thoughts in order, when—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Have you finished discussing everything?</span>” Silvelle asked, popping up out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">Wha—?!</span>” Mushiki and the others cried out.</p>
<p class="TX">Somehow, she had contorted her body to force her way into the circle that the five of them had made to discuss their strategy, a feat made possible because she existed as a three-dimensional projection without physical substance.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hey, don’t scare us like that.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Excuse me. But it’s almost time</span>,” she said with a wave of her hand—the numbers 11:55 appearing a short distance away.</p>
<p class="TX">There were five minutes to go before the battle got underway. It seemed the team had been lost in discussion for longer than Mushiki had realized.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">”</span></p>
<p class="TX">He and the others exchanged silent nods—then began to make their way to their starting positions so they could spread out across the battlefield.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe, too, gave everyone a short head bob. “In that case, I’ll leave the combat area. Good luck, everyone,” she said before exiting the square.</p>
<p class="TX">The remaining students waved good-bye, before turning their attention toward the west—the direction from which the Tower’s team would start the match.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“There’s three minutes to go, so I’ll be off as well! I’m working double duty as the referee, so I can’t go out of my way to help you all, but I do wish you the best of luck!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Ah. Thanks, Sis,” Touya replied.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>We’ll do our best, Sis,” Honoka exclaimed.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yep. Just you watch, Sis,” Mushiki added.</p>
<p class="TX">Silvelle flashed them all a joyous grin—before turning her gaze toward Ruri, the only one who hadn’t said anything yet.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Right, right. Sis,” Ruri muttered under her breath.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 126. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_126" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="ITAL">“Hee-hee! Then good luck, everyone!”</span> The AI beamed before disappearing into thin air.</p>
<p class="TX">Something about this exchange struck Mushiki as strangely funny, and he couldn’t help but break out into a smile.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>What are you laughing at?” Ruri demanded.</p>
<p class="TX">“Sorry<span class="ellipse">…</span> It’s just, you don’t seem to like thinking of Silvelle as an elder sister.”</p>
<p class="TX">Yes, that was probably the source of her discomfort. She was normally so calm and rational, at least so long as Saika wasn’t concerned. He couldn’t imagine her refusing to use someone’s self-appointed nickname if it helped smooth the conversation along.</p>
<p class="TX">“She <span class="ITAL">isn’t</span> my sister.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Well, I guess you’re right about that.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Addressing someone who isn’t my sister as <span class="ITAL">Sis</span><span class="ellipse">…</span>feels like I’m talking to <span class="ITAL">your</span> wife or something.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Never mind. Just concentrate on the match<span class="ellipse">…</span> Honestly, I’m not convinced yet, but seeing as you’ve been chosen to represent the Garden, you’d better put on a good show.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yep. I know,” he answered with a nod, clenching his fists.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, from the direction of the central precinct, the sound of the noontime bell rang out.</p>
<p class="TX">The exhibition match between the Garden and the Tower had officially started.</p>
<p class="TX">“All right, let’s do this. Everyone, as planned, spread out, and—”</p>
<p class="TX">But before Touya could finish his sentence—</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, a point of light suddenly lit up like a star in the sky.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">Something</span> was flying in a straight line right for them.</p>
<p class="TX">“Dodge it!” Ruri screamed, and then—</p>
<p class="TX">Before their very eyes, a fierce explosion burst out.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_questionmark">…</span><span class="ITAL">?!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 127. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_127" role="doc-pagebreak"/>A blinding flash. A violent sound. Terrible tremors. The shock wave hit Mushiki’s whole body.</p>
<p class="TX">His eyes, his ears, his skin—every one of his five senses was struck with more information than it could process, his consciousness flickering in and out for a few seconds.</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki!”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">Despite that, when he heard his name called out loud, he somehow managed to keep from blacking out.</p>
<p class="TX">Only then did he realize it—a veil of blue light was spread out before him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">For a second, he took it for an enemy attack—but he was wrong.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri had activated a long-handled weapon—and the veil that had enveloped him and the others had extended from its handle.</p>
<p class="TX">There could be no mistaking it. This was Ruri’s second substantiation, her Luminous Blade. She must have noticed the attack first and jumped into action to protect them.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki knew she could mold her magic-infused blade into all kinds of shapes and forms, but he had never seen her wield it like this.</p>
<p class="TX">On the other side of the shield, there was now a huge crater in the ground, as if a meteor had fallen. The surrounding buildings and facilities, reinforced with defensive magic, looked to be fine, but the ground itself had been left devastated.</p>
<p class="TX">Tremendous power. If Ruri hadn’t protected them, he might have been retired from battle then and there.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh, so you blocked it? Well done, Ruri Fuyajoh. You live up to your name as a Knight of the Garden.”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki and the others glanced upward as, without warning, a voice rang out.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 128. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_128" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Floating in the air above them was an older man with long hair and a bellarmine-shaped beard, dressed in an ill-fitting Tower uniform.</p>
<p class="TX">At his feet was a two-stage world crest shaped like a magic square, and in his right hand, he grasped a staff imbued with dense magical energy.</p>
<p class="TX">He was none other than the Tower’s headmaster, the recently enrolled first-year student Gyousei Shionji.</p>
<p class="TX">“Headmaster Shionji<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! A-are you crazy? The Tower’s starting position is supposed to be in the western precinct<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! And that attack just now<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Touya yelled in shock, his voice trembling.</p>
<p class="TX">Shionji, his eyes narrowed, raised his chin. “<span class="ITAL">Crazy</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_questionmark">…</span><span class="ITAL">?</span> If you intend to call yourself a mage, you should refrain from using such language. We are the guardians of the world, the seekers of mystery. It isn’t at all unusual for our opponents to make unexpected moves,” he said profoundly, as though imparting important knowledge.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki and Ruri both grimaced in trepidation.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ugh<span class="ellipse">…</span> H-he’s too powerful<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">“I can’t believe <span class="ITAL">he</span> was the one who kept complaining about Madam Witch yesterday<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>That’s<span class="ellipse">…</span>a separate matter. She’s usually the one at fault there,” Shionji retorted, but he slurred, and his words were difficult to make out.</p>
<p class="TX">He paused for a second to clear his throat and regain his composure, then stared down with a scowl at the trapped students. “More importantly<span class="ellipse">…</span> Are you sure about this? I <span class="ITAL">am</span> trying to go easy on you all here.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m asking if it’s really okay for just one of you to be activating your second substantiation against an opponent ready and willing to wage war here.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_exclamatory">…</span><span class="ITAL">!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">Upon hearing that, the students from the Garden froze in apprehension.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 129. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_129" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“Unfurling Fan!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Graphier<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">Touya and Honoka both activated their world crests, readying their second substantiations—a huge iron fan and a gigantic paintbrush, respectively.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, as though waiting for that signal, the ground began to reverberate with a distant rumbling.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Wh-what’s going on?!”</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, to Mushiki’s dismay, the earth shook violently, and the paving stones at his feet suddenly blasted upward.</p>
<p class="TX">From the ground below, Tetsuga Suoh, wielding a huge drill-shaped second substantiation in his hands, appeared before them. He must have dug his way underground to launch a surprise attack.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ha-ha! If you spend all your time worrying about what’s up above, someone else will come along and knock you off your feet! Literally!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ugh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki leaped away from what little ground remained, jumping to safety.</p>
<p class="TX">But that wasn’t the end of it. Wakaba Saeki, in her uniform bulging at the seams, must have accompanied Tetsuga underground, as she also leaped up armed with a green Gatling gun.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hey, don’t forget about us! It’s time for my super-duper rad gigantic unbelievable fury dream (god level)!”</p>
<p class="TX">As she shouted these incomprehensible words, she let loose with a volley of bullets aimed straight at Mushiki; he heard the projectiles’ terrible whir in full force.</p>
<p class="TX">“Tch!”</p>
<p class="TX">Touya twisted through the air, unfolding his huge iron fan—and a substantial gust of wind deflected the oncoming bullets. The projectiles careened away from Mushiki and the others, detonating on the ground and the walls of nearby buildings.</p>
<p class="TX">Wakaba, however, didn’t seem surprised by their reactions, her lips curling in a faint smile. “Hmm, good work there. But<span class="ellipse">…</span>like<span class="ellipse">…</span>you still <span aria-label=" Page 130. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_130" role="doc-pagebreak"/>haven’t seen my second substantiation!” she exclaimed, adding in words as she remembered them, then lifting her hand into the air.</p>
<p class="TX">“Spread!”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, the bullet that had collided with the walls and group suddenly stirred, countless tendrils erupting from them.</p>
<p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Kyargh!”</p>
<p class="TX">Touya and Honoka were quickly ensnared, the roots disrupting their battle stances.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri didn’t wait a second longer before, with a flicker of her Luminous Blade, she sliced through the crawling vines.</p>
<p class="TX">“Thanks!”</p>
<p class="TX">“No problem. Just be careful! This isn’t over!” she cried back.</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed, more tendrils than the eye could count were still sprouting from the bullets sprawled all around—and were flailing about like tentacles as they lashed at Ruri and the others.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ha!”</p>
<p class="TX">Touya wielded his iron fan to let loose a huge gust of wind, while Honoka used her paintbrush to create a path in midair as the group made its escape.</p>
<p class="TX">But they weren’t just fighting against Wakaba’s vines. Seizing his opportunity while the Garden’s fighters were distracted, Tetsuga readied his drill and rushed toward Ruri.</p>
<p class="TX">“Special Attack Drill! Auuuggghhh!”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Ugh—”</p>
<p class="TX">Though she could see the attack coming, Ruri was still caught off guard, unable to respond. At this rate, she would soon take considerable damage and be forced to retire.</p>
<p class="TX">The condition for Saika to enter the battle was for two of the Garden’s fighters to drop out of the match. In other words, if the opposing team struck down just one of them, she still wouldn’t be able to intervene. <span aria-label=" Page 131. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_131" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Which explained why they were focusing on taking out their most capable fighter first.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri—!”</p>
<p class="TX">The rules being what they were, the best move available to him might have been to help take the brunt of the attack so the two of them could retire together—thereby fulfilling the necessary preconditions for Saika to make her appearance.</p>
<p class="TX">But right now, he had other things on his mind.</p>
<p class="TX">After all, Ruri—his younger sister—was in danger. As her brother, he needed no other reason to take action.</p>
<p class="TX">“Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p class="TX">Letting out a loud cry, he leaped forward to shield Ruri from the oncoming drill.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Mushiki—”</p>
<p class="TX">He heard her voice echoing. It was such a nostalgic sound—but in their current situation, he didn’t have the luxury of time to respond to it. All he could do was hone his senses and ready himself to meet the oncoming drill.</p>
<p class="TX">A moment later—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">……</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">A violent clamor erupted behind him.</p>
<p class="TX">Tetsuga had been sent careening off course, and he slammed into the wall of a nearby building.</p>
<p class="TX">That was no coincidence—nor had he purposefully adjusted his trajectory at the last second.</p>
<p class="TX">No, the reason for his collision was simple.</p>
<p class="TX">He had been knocked off course by the semitransparent blade that had just appeared in Mushiki’s hands.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Ruri’s stunned voice echoed amid the silence. “Your second<span class="ellipse">…</span>substantiation<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">Her gaze was locked onto the sword clutched in his hands—and on the two-stage crown-like world crest that had appeared above his head.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 132. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_132" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“Hollow Edge,” Mushiki muttered, recalling the previous night with a resigned sigh.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">“Let’s try to reproduce that again.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Reproduce it?”</p>
<p class="TX">The night before the exhibition match, shortly after the second round against Clara, Kuroe had led Mushiki to the forecourt in front of Saika’s mansion.</p>
<p class="TX">The reason was simple—to practice activating his substantiations.</p>
<p class="TX">Even with the match set to take place the very next day, he still couldn’t freely initiate his second substantiation at will.</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s true that unlocking one’s second substantiation is a hurdle for any mage. But it’s quite unbelievable that a mage who hasn’t managed to do so would be selected to represent the Garden in a demonstration battle. Any beginner on the field would immediately become the target of the other side—and be swiftly eliminated<span class="ellipse">…</span> Then again, there <span class="ITAL">is</span> an unusual case in tomorrow’s match, so it might not necessarily be a bad idea to drop out early. However, there is a great difference between deciding the right timing to retire from the match by yourself and being utterly defeated without recourse.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Right,” Mushiki murmured, obediently nodding.</p>
<p class="TX">“That being said, you have successfully activated your second substantiation on two occasions thus far—the first when you faced <span class="ITAL">her</span> and the second during your training with me. We should try to look for what both situations had in common.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What they had in common<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he repeated, sinking deep into thought. “The first time<span class="ellipse">…</span> I kind of lost myself, so I don’t really remember a whole lot. I was so focused on helping her—and Saika, too, that I—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm. And the second time?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I thought if I could pull it off, Saika would answer any question I had. It was all I could think about.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 133. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_133" role="doc-pagebreak"/>He was being completely honest, but Kuroe fell silent for some reason. Finally, as though having realized something, her eyebrows twitched.</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s Lady Saika, wouldn’t you say?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Both situations were completely different, but on both occasions, you were thinking very strongly about Lady Saika.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! I see. So you’re saying my magic exists for her, right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I didn’t say that,” she responded with an unamused look. “Mental fortitude is the key to wielding magic. It isn’t uncommon for one’s power output to differ depending on how mentally prepared they are—or how aware they are of their surroundings. For now, please try to invoke your magic while thinking of Lady Saika.”</p>
<p class="TX">“All right.”</p>
<p class="TX">He took a deep breath, squeezed his eyes shut, and pictured Saika.</p>
<p class="TX">“Saika<span class="ellipse">…</span> I’ll definitely—”</p>
<p class="TX">Then, filled with raw determination, he clenched his fists and whispered a prayer in his heart.</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s it. Strengthen your mental image of her,” Kuroe urged.</p>
<p class="TX">“Right<span class="ellipse">…</span> Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> Saika<span class="ellipse">…</span> What are you<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? N-no, you can’t<span class="ellipse">…</span> That’s<span class="ellipse">…</span> We haven’t even started dating yet—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Just <span class="ITAL">what</span> are you imagining?” Kuroe interrupted, hitting him over the head and putting an end to his carefully crafted reverie.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">“Thank goodness it worked.”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki let out a soft sigh of relief as he stared at the transparent blade in his hands.</p>
<p class="TX">During yesterday’s lesson, with Kuroe’s help, he had focused on repeatedly visualizing Saika, and thanks to those efforts, he had successfully reactivated his second substantiation. That being said, whether he could pull off the same feat during the heat of battle was a different story.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 134. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_134" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“A transparent<span class="ellipse">…</span>sword<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Ruri whispered, her voice almost imperceptibly quiet.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki looked her over to make sure she was safe, then gave her a short nod.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m glad you’re okay.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Her cheeks reddened slightly as she shrugged. Nonetheless, she quickly shook her head to disguise that reaction.</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki,” she said. “When did you manage to learn your second substantiation<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I realized I can activate it when I think really strongly about someone I love.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Someone you<span class="ellipse">…</span> Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-what are you saying all of a sudden<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!” Her voice trailed off, her face, already slightly pink, turning bright red.</p>
<p class="TX">That certainly wasn’t an appropriate reaction to have in the midst of battle, but Mushiki just couldn’t understand why she seemed so flustered.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Oh? You did it<span class="ellipse">…</span> But did <span class="ITAL">what</span> exactly, I’m wondering? It takes something special to throw off my Special Attack Drill,” came Tetsuga’s voice as he turned around, the broken pieces of the wall falling behind him.</p>
<p class="TX">Part of the drill-type second substantiation in his hands had disappeared, leaving behind a sparkling glow of raw magical power.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki found himself catching his breath at that sight—but he did his best not to dwell on it.</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed, he had managed to manifest his second substantiation by thinking strongly of Saika, but he had still to fully grasp the entire extent of his magic.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Well, if that’s all you’ve got<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Tetsuga stared at him, gauging his reaction, before deactivating his <span aria-label=" Page 135. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_135" role="doc-pagebreak"/>broken second substantiation and then manifesting it once more in perfect condition.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri, who had been peering up at Mushiki until that moment, noticed the fresh threat aimed at her and cleared her throat to regain her composure while she glared at the Tower instructor.</p>
<p class="TX">“It looks like these guys anticipated that we would try to split up at the earliest opportunity,” she noted.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>It looks that way,” Touya added.</p>
<p class="TX">“Well<span class="ellipse">…</span> No arguments there,” Honoka chimed in, her expression stern.</p>
<p class="TX">Shionji, Tetsuga, and Wakaba, on the other hand, calmly braced themselves as they faced Mushiki’s second substantiation.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri’s guess was probably on the mark. Just like Mushiki and his teammates, their opponents had understood the conditions necessary for Saika to enter the field—and based their strategy on ensuring that they couldn’t be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="TX">That being the case, what would be the next step?</p>
<p class="TX">They could try to attack the Garden’s team at the very beginning of the match, before they had a chance to disperse, or they could try to restrict their movements by refusing to defeat any of them until they could finish them off as one.</p>
<p class="TX">In fact, that was precisely what they were attempting right now.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri’s quick thinking had somehow saved them from being annihilated at the very outset of the match—but to put it mildly, their present situation could hardly have been worse.</p>
<p class="TX">After all, they were practically unable to make any moves and were held in check by a team of teachers whom they had little hope of defeating.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>And the other two Tower members aren’t here. Clara and Matsuba must be lurking around somewhere nearby<span class="ellipse">…</span> Especially Clara—she won’t stop blabbering about how she’s going to beat Madam Witch <span aria-label=" Page 136. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_136" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and become your girlfriend. I can’t believe she’ll hold back without doing anything<span class="ellipse">…</span> The amount of magic she showed off yesterday was extraordinary. We had better be careful,” Ruri cautioned with heightened vigilance.</p>
<p class="TX">That was certainly true. Clara was a flamboyant one, so it was guaranteed that she would try something. Mushiki focused on his surroundings.</p>
<p class="TX">But Tetsuga, overhearing their discussion, scratched his head. “Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> They’ll probably take a bit longer getting here. Unlike us, they’ll have to take the long way, running across the campus from west to east on foot.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Ruri said nothing, but the trickle of sweat running down her cheek betrayed her anxiety.</p>
<p class="TX">Perhaps she suspected that their opponent was bluffing, or she was embarrassed that he had read them so perfectly.</p>
<p class="TX">The latter option seemed more likely from Mushiki’s point of view, but they wouldn’t get anywhere with that mindset, so he decided to challenge the former possibility himself.</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki,” Ruri said in a low voice, casting her gaze over Shionji and the others. “We’ll hold their headmaster and the others back. Use that opportunity to get out of here and hide.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What are you saying? I can’t—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t get me wrong. I’m not suggesting this out of concern for your safety. Not this time.”</p>
<p class="TX">“This time?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>This isn’t the place to be focusing on anything weird,” she harrumphed, her cheeks turning red. “To be perfectly honest, going head-to-head against three teachers puts us all in the worst possible position. But even if we all get wiped out, at least we’ll have cleared the necessary conditions for Madam Witch to enter the battle.”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he began to protest, but Touya and Honoka each nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Any further objection, he realized, would be disrespectful to them. With that new resolve, he bowed in assent.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 137. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_137" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I understand. I’ll leave this to you, Ruri, Shinozuka, Moegi.”</p>
<p class="TX">“You got it,” Ruri answered, her expression grave.</p>
<p class="TX">Touya and Honoka likewise indicated their understanding.</p>
<p class="TX">“Then<span class="ellipse">…</span>let’s go!” Ruri commanded.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Yeah</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_exclamatory">…</span><span class="ITAL">!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">With that, the three students hit the ground running—and the opposing teachers from the Tower each manifested their second substantiations to intercept them.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Anviet Svarner was in a particularly grouchy mood.</p>
<p class="TX">There were two main reasons for this.</p>
<p class="TX">The first was that it was the day of the interschool demonstration battle between the Garden and the Tower, and he had been forced to go on a trip to the countryside to take care of an unruly monster.</p>
<p class="TX">The second was that he had so dutifully accepted this unreasonable and sudden request.</p>
<p class="TX">“Tch<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Anviet, his eyes hidden behind a pair of sunglasses, clicked his tongue irritably as he slammed his foot down on his car’s accelerator pedal.</p>
<p class="TX">He was driving along an unpaved mountain road, his vehicle shaking violently as the tires spun over the gravel-strewn path.</p>
<p class="TX">He would be lying if he said this wasn’t an uncomfortable journey, but he understood that it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p class="TX">After all, the facility he was now making his way toward could never have been built in the middle of a quiet residential area.</p>
<p class="TX">Hoping to drown out his pent-up frustration as he made his way along the rough road, he turned up the volume on his car’s radio and bobbed his head from left to right.</p>
<p class="TX">After around three hours of staring at the unchanging scenery, he finally reached his destination.</p>
<p class="TX">At first glance, there didn’t look to be anything at all out of the <span aria-label=" Page 138. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_138" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ordinary. Most likely, the only people who would bother to stop at a place like this would be those who were running low on gas or who needed to use the restroom on their way to somewhere else.</p>
<p class="TX">He brought the vehicle to a halt in the parking lot, pulled out the keys, and stepped outside. Of course, he didn’t forget to lock the doors. It was unlikely that anyone would attempt to steal his car in such a remote place, but it was always better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, retrieving his cell phone from his pocket and opening the map, he cautiously walked into the field of overgrown weeds.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> Around here, maybe?”</p>
<p class="TX">After confirming that his guess had been right on the money, he walked directly into a nearby boulder.</p>
<p class="TX">If it had been any normal boulder, he would naturally have crashed into the rock face—but his foot passed through it without meeting any resistance whatsoever.</p>
<p class="TX">Just like the techniques used at the Garden, perception magic had been employed to make it impossible for those on the outside to discern the area that he had just entered.</p>
<p class="TX">Within the rock was a high-tech elevator with an authentication device; this modern piece of machinery was completely at odds with its surroundings.</p>
<p class="TX">After verification and performing an iris scan, the elevator doors slid open, and he made his way down to the basement.</p>
<p class="TX">It was a tedious procedure, but very much necessary when one considered just how important this place was—and what was contained within.</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed, it was one of several sealed facilities scattered across the world—the same kind that existed beneath the Garden’s central library.</p>
<p class="TX">After a few minutes, the elevator reached the appropriate floor. No sooner had the doors slid open than he proceeded down the long corridor stretching out ahead.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 139. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_139" role="doc-pagebreak"/>It wasn’t long before he reached a large metal door with a pair of guards standing before it. One had a bushy beard, and the other wore a pair of glasses. The fact that they were stationed here meant they were no doubt mages themselves.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yo. I need to go inside.”</p>
<p class="TX">Given that he had already completed the security tests on the upper floor, the guards must have known the identity of their visitor, as the pair stood erect and gave him a polite salute.</p>
<p class="TX">“You’re Anviet Svarner, an instructor at the Garden, right? We’ve heard so much about you.”</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s an honor to meet the famous Lord of Thunder.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> Yeah. You don’t need to call me that. It’s embarrassin’,” he said with a frown.</p>
<p class="TX">“S-sorry.” The guard bowed.</p>
<p class="TX">“So what brings you here today?” the other asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’ve had an annoyin’ little errand foisted on me. I need to check the sealed object inside<span class="ellipse">…</span> No idea why this is so important on the day of the match, though.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes, isn’t the exhibition match between the Tower and the Garden taking place today?”</p>
<p class="TX">“You betcha. Nothing beats watchin’ those punks duke it out over a good drink,” Anviet said, raising an imaginary glass.</p>
<p class="TX">The guards laughed in agreement. “Indeed. What I’d do to get off work early and go enjoy a beer.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? I didn’t say anythin’ about alcohol. I’m talkin’ about cola here.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh. You don’t drink?”</p>
<p class="TX">“That ain’t it. Even if I don’t have classes, a match like that is still part of my official duties. A teacher can’t drink on the job. Besides, it’d make it hard to watch the kids’ moves.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I—I see<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">This guy’s different from how he looks</span>, the look on the guard’s face all but said.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 140. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_140" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“Um<span class="ellipse">…</span> So which sealed specimen do you want to see?” the second one asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“O-08.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">No sooner had Anviet stated the number than the guards’ expressions turned grim.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m sorry, but can you tell us the purpose of this inspection?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Like I said, I’ve gotta check on it<span class="ellipse">…</span> Didn’t Erulka put in a request just yesterday? She wanted a report on item O-08.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. And we stated there were no problems.”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s why I’m here.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Of the twenty-four Ouroboros pieces, this facility was the only one that reported nothin’ out of the ordinary. So just to be sure, I’m here to look it over. To check how it reacts to magic and confirm there ain’t any abnormalities<span class="ellipse">…</span> Now let me see the head of that snake bastard that’s gone and spoiled my fun.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">The guards glanced at one another. “Please wait a moment<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” one of them said at last, before pressing a few buttons on their operating consoles.</p>
<p class="TX">With a heavy thud, the huge door began to swing open.</p>
<p class="TX">“Please, this way,” the guards said.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yeah.”</p>
<p class="TX">Anviet stepped inside.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment—</p>
<p class="TX">“—.”</p>
<p class="TX">The bespectacled guard reached into his pocket, pulled out an automatic pistol, and without the slightest hesitation, he aimed it straight at Anviet and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p class="TX">That bang echoed through the underground facility.</p>
<p class="TX">Yet—</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 141. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_141" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“What the<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">The next sound wasn’t an agonized cry from Anviet or the sound of his body falling to the floor, but the bewildered wail of the guard who had fired the bullet.</p>
<p class="TX">But that was to be expected.</p>
<p class="TX">Just before the bullet could hit the back of Anviet’s head, it had been frozen in place by a powerful electric charge.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>You seriously thought you could kill me with a toy like that? Did you take me for a fool or somethin’? Eh?” Anviet glared, the guard’s eyes goggling in disbelief.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">The guard’s face contorted as he tried to fire yet again. This time, his bearded companion pulled out his own gun.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hah!”</p>
<p class="TX">But with that thunderous roar, a bolt of lightning struck the two with full force.</p>
<p class="TX">“Gah<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">After a short moment of electrifying agony, the two guards fell to the ground in a charred heap.</p>
<p class="TX">Anviet frowned in suspicion.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>What the hell’s goin’ on here? I thought Erulka was overthinkin’ it all, but there’s definitely somethin’ fishy about all this.”</p>
<p class="TX">In any event, he had to see to the task at hand. As he stepped through the door, his gaze fell on the crystal inside.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Hah?” He groaned, furrowing his brow.</p>
<p class="TX">The head of the Ouroboros should have been sealed within this facility—alongside the heart stored beneath the Garden, it was one of the most important pieces.</p>
<p class="TX">But before him was only the shattered remains of the crystal that had contained it.</p>
<p class="TX">“So the Ouroboros’s head<span class="ellipse">…</span>ain’t here?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 142. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_142" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Anviet’s expression turned grim as he brought his hand to his mouth, deep in thought.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>When did this all happen? Were they tryin’ to cover it up by lyin’ in their report to Erulka<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? No, there’s no way anyone could keep this a secret forever. So what was the point of keepin’ the guards in the first place<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">His thoughts having taken him this far, he suddenly stopped there.</p>
<p class="TX">The reason was simple. No sooner had he heard a noise coming from behind him than two dark figures attacked.</p>
<p class="TX">“Gah!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Arrrggghhh!”</p>
<p class="TX">It didn’t take long for him to realize his assailants were the two guards that he had just defeated.</p>
<p class="TX">He activated his world crest on his back and let loose with another barrage of lightning, felling the two as they let out agonized cries all over again.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hah. You’re tougher than you look, eh? I could have stopped your hearts with that one. But this is good timin’. So—what the hell happened to the seal here?”</p>
<p class="TX">But once more, Anviet was forced to swallow his words.</p>
<p class="TX">The two guards, though defeated a second time, rose to their feet.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Eh?”</p>
<p class="TX">His eyes narrowed in suspicion. He might have lowered his attack power that second time, but no one ought to be able to recover from a blow of that potency in just a few seconds. Were they using some kind of magic technique?</p>
<p class="TX">“No, it can’t be<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">With stable footing, he activated the next stage of his world crest—and a pair of three-pronged weapons appeared at his left and right.</p>
<p class="TX">“Second Substantiation: Vajdola!”</p>
<p class="TX">He thrust his hand forward, the substantiation rotating in the air and unleashing an electric surge at a magnitude stronger than before.</p>
<p class="TX">The two, enduring Anviet’s direct hits—one to the guard’s right arm, <span aria-label=" Page 143. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_143" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the other to his left shoulder—were thrown backward, slamming hard against the wall.</p>
<p class="TX">But—</p>
<p class="TX">“Argh<span class="ellipse">…</span> Aaauuuggghhh!”</p>
<p class="TX">With a hollow moan, they rose to their feet for a third time.</p>
<p class="TX">And that wasn’t all. Their arms and shoulders, dismembered from that last attack, regenerated before his very eyes.</p>
<p class="TX">“Tch<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Clenching his jaw, a sense of certainty flooded Anviet’s mind.</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, he slammed his foot down hard on the ground—sending an electric current coursing through the room and bringing the two guards down once again.</p>
<p class="TX">This time, however, they didn’t attempt to get back up. Their only movement was a slight twitching of their fingers.</p>
<p class="TX">By hitting his targets with a weak, constant electric current, he had essentially inhibited the movements of their muscles. This would probably immobilize them for a while. Of course, he would need to call someone to properly restrain them later.</p>
<p class="TX">But for now, he had a more pressing matter to see to. He hurried back to the elevator and hit the button for the top floor.</p>
<p class="TX">As the elevator ascended back to the surface, he pulled out his cell phone and dialed Erulka.</p>
<p class="TX">After several rings, her chirpy voice came through. <span class="ITAL">“Oh, Anviet? How is everything?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“How do you think it is?! The Ouroboros head ain’t here! And to top it all off<span class="ellipse">…</span>” His voice hoarse, he delivered the most devastating news of all. “The guards won’t die! Someone’s gone and used the Ouroboros’s powers! This facility is supposed to be under the Tower’s jurisdiction, right<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">What?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Keep your wits about you! There’s a good chance the Tower’s got Immortals on their side!”</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1"><span aria-label=" Page 144. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_144" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Within the Garden, the majority of which had been cleared to make way for the exhibition match, one area in particular was bustling with activity—the training hall in the western precinct.</p>
<p class="TX">While the hall was usually set aside for students to practice their skills, it was imbued now with a somewhat different atmosphere. Above the large field, huge images were being projected in all directions, showing each of the competitors in the match. Students from both the Garden and the Tower were seated amid the spectator stands, cheering for their respective schools.</p>
<p class="TX">The interschool demonstration battle was intended to improve the fighting skills of students, but people being what they were, it was only natural for them to go wild with excitement, dividing themselves into teams of friend and foe.</p>
<p class="TX">In addition, the head teachers from both schools were participating in the match, while Saika and Clara were competing over a prospective boyfriend. All in all, there were three separate contests taking place simultaneously.</p>
<p class="TX">To top it all off—</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Whoa! First Gyoukie has reached the eastern precinct, now Wakabie! Is the Tower’s strategy to defeat the Garden’s fighters before Saachie can join the fray?!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">Silvelle was fluttering in midair, providing live commentary in her light, airy voice as though to fan the flames of the students’ passions.</p>
<p class="TX">Incidentally, she occasionally split into two separate projections to hold a conversation with herself.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“What do you make of both teams’ current progress, Silvelle?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“I’d say the Tower is still wary of Saachie. Gyoukie and the others must want to deal a decisive blow as quickly as possible.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">And so this one-person theater (though there was, visually speaking, more than one of them) continued to play out.</p>
<p class="TX">Despite the spectators being mages who swore to protect the world from amid the shadows, they were still young men and women, their youthful blood flowing thick in their veins. A show of this magnitude couldn’t fail to ignite their spirit.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 145. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_145" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“Ruri<span class="ellipse">…</span> Kuga<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Amid all this, Hizumi Nagekawa watched the battle, fraught with anxiety.</p>
<p class="TX">The reason for her unease was simple. Ruri and Kuga, both of whom were fighting right this very moment out there on the battlefield, were her classmates and friends.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri might have been a knight, but Mushiki had only just enrolled at the Garden within the past month. He should never have been selected to take part in an event like this.</p>
<p class="TX">Yet Silvelle claimed that he had defeated a mythic-level annihilation factor. Hizumi had to admit that she found it difficult to believe, judging from how poorly he was currently fighting. She only hoped they wouldn’t get hurt<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Oh? What’s wrong, Nagekawa? You look disheartened.”</p>
<p class="TX">As she watched the match, whispering a prayer in her heart, an unexpected voice called out to her.</p>
<p class="TX">Glancing up, she spotted a woman in her mid-twenties standing before her. She had loose, wavy hair and was wearing a blouse boldly open around the neck, along with a short, tight skirt. It was her class’s homeroom teacher, Tomoe Kurieda.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, Ms. Kurieda<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t take it all so seriously. This is meant to be a festival, after all<span class="ellipse">…</span> Ah, do you mind if I sit here?”</p>
<p class="TX">“G-go ahead<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Hizumi replied nervously.</p>
<p class="TX">Tomoe sat down beside her, then took a long swill of the beer clutched in her right hand. “<span class="ITAL">Glug</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">Glug</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> Ah! Yep, there’s nothing like the thrill of an exhibition match!”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Um, I thought these exchange events between mage-training institutes weren’t meant to entertain but rather were created to hone students’ techniques so they can better fight annihilation factors<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh, come on, don’t be so nitpicky. Stress is the number one enemy when it comes to maintaining your good looks, you know?” Tomoe said with a laugh.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 146. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_146" role="doc-pagebreak"/>It was clear from her flushed cheeks and unusual cheer that this wasn’t her first beer of the day.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’ll have to report this to Madam Witch later,” Hizumi murmured.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m sorry, really, I didn’t mean it like that. I’ll give you some <span class="ITAL">takoyaki</span> to eat, so please, let me off the hook?” Tomoe sat suddenly upright, offering her a box of ball-shaped snacks.</p>
<p class="TX">The homeroom teacher’s hands were quivering—though whether from trepidation at Hizumi’s suggestion just then or from the alcohol, she couldn’t say.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes. Tomoe was usually brimming with self-confidence—but when faced with Saika, she trembled like a frightened Chihuahua.</p>
<p class="TX">Hizumi had no idea what might have happened between the two of them in the past, but in any event, Tomoe was also a mage of the Garden—which meant, in short, that she was Saika’s pupil. Maybe she had experienced something traumatic during her own school days?</p>
<p class="TX">She lifted one of the <span class="ITAL">takoyaki</span> into her mouth (it would be a waste not to eat them, after all) and then turned her attention back to the live broadcast.</p>
<p class="TX">“Will Ruri and Kuga really be okay? To think they’re fighting teachers from the Tower<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“You don’t need to worry. I mean, Madam Witch will step in before too long,” Tomoe said in a relaxed voice, perhaps having let down her guard now that Hizumi had accepted her offer of food. She was as fast as ever when it came to switching between fear and composure.</p>
<p class="TX">“But I thought Madam Witch couldn’t enter the match until two of the others had dropped out? But if all four of them are defeated at once, it will all be over before she can even intervene<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?! Really?!” Tomoe gawked, her eyes widening in alarm.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Apparently, she hadn’t realized that until now. Had she really mistaken this match for a festival or some form of entertainment?</p>
<p class="TX">“And isn’t this essentially a continuation of her contest against Tokishima yesterday? The right to be Kuga’s girlfriend is at stake, too<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span>I did hear something about that. But Madam Witch can’t be <span aria-label=" Page 147. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_147" role="doc-pagebreak"/>serious, can she? She probably just couldn’t turn down such an interesting challenge.”</p>
<p class="TX">“That might be true<span class="ellipse">…</span> But isn’t she also very particular about winning?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Sure, she’s a bit of a stickler there. Even if it’s just a game, she always plays to win,” Tomoe responded without hesitation.</p>
<p class="TX">Hizumi could sense the truth behind her words.</p>
<p class="TX">“Even if Madam Witch isn’t interested in Kuga<span class="ellipse">…</span> If she lost this match after entering it herself—and the contest against Tokishima, too<span class="ellipse">…</span>I’m sure she would be in a very, very bad mood<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Hizumi observed, when—</p>
<p class="TX">“What are you doing out there, Fuyajoh?! Pick yourself up! Now! Give ’em hell! Slaughter them!” Tomoe broke out into cries of frantic support.</p>
<p class="TX">Hizumi let out a nervous chuckle. Naturally, it would be against the rules to actually kill the enemy team.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">Her eyes widened in alarm.</p>
<p class="TX">All of a sudden, the projection screen, displaying the match without issue all this time, went haywire, ultimately switching to a bright-red error message.</p>
<p class="TX">The students from both the Garden and the Tower alike must have noticed that something was amiss, as hushed whispers spread throughout the crowd.</p>
<p class="TX">But the most discomforting of all, at least as far as Hizumi was concerned, was the sight of Silvelle floating before the screen.</p>
<p class="TX">Even though the live broadcast had been disrupted, the AI hadn’t attempted to explain the situation or assure the audience to keep them from flying into a panic. She was simply floating there in silence, her face downcast.</p>
<p class="TX">“Sis<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Hizumi called out in concern (Silvelle wasn’t her real sister, of course, but she understood that the AI wouldn’t respond to anything else).</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 148. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_148" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Then, as though in timed response: “<span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">Hee</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“What the—?!”</p>
<div class="LI_SB"/>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!”</span></p>
<div class="LI_SB"/>
<p class="TX">A high-pitched cackle of laughter echoed from the loudspeakers throughout the training area.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-what<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!” Hizumi quickly covered her ears from the sudden outburst, her confusion plain to see.</p>
<p class="TX">That was undoubtedly Silvelle’s voice—but it was so different from her usual character that for a moment Hizumi failed to recognize it.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, as though to bolster her shock and bewilderment, the AI’s face appeared in the center of the bright-red projection screen—her expression contorted into a mad grin.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Hmm</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">So I’ve been found out? That was faster than I expected. Good work, Erulkie, Anvi. Good work, indeed.”</span> Silvelle spoke as though talking to herself, continuing, “<span class="ITAL">I could have jammed the signal</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">But we’re almost at our destination now, so it’s about time anyway. It would be a waste if we didn’t go out with a bang, don’t you think, everyone?</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? What on earth are you talking about<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Hizumi asked in alarm, unable to comprehend what the AI was saying.</p>
<p class="TX">No, it wasn’t just her. Everyone around, the other students as well, also looked to be at a complete loss.</p>
<p class="TX">But Silvelle paid them no heed, playfully spreading her arms out wide. <span class="ITAL">“Good day, my dear brothers and sisters. I have a regrettable announcement to make. I’ve been doing my best as your dear elder sister for so long</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">But the truth is: There’s something far more important ahead of me now.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">She paused there to bring her hands together with a deliberate clap, then extended her arms yet again. <span class="ITAL">“Let me introduce you, everyone—to my</span> new <span class="ITAL">brothers and sisters.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">The next moment—</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“—!”</span></p>
