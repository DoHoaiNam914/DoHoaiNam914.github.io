<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 60. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_60" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Is something the matter?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> No. It must have been a misunderstanding<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” she said, before her eyes suddenly shot open. “Kuroe? What’s wrong? Your face looks a little red.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?” Mushiki uttered after hearing Ruri’s remark.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Maybe you’re just seeing things?” Kuroe responded flatly, stepping out from the alleyway without once letting him see her face.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">Around a month had passed since his double life as both Mushiki and Saika started.</p>
<p class="TX">While he had learned how to emulate Saika Kuozaki’s astonishing powers of observation, her obsessive learning ability, and her extreme commitment to her interests, there were still many situations that kept him on his toes.</p>
<p class="TX">Particularly, the times when he had to speak with Saika’s old acquaintances—or when his actions might risk damaging her reputation or social status.</p>
<p class="TX">And right now, the current situation posed both risks.</p>
<p class="TX">He was expected to entertain an individual who, like Saika, served as head of a mage-training institute.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">From his seat on the platform set up at the venue, Mushiki let out a weak sigh to relieve the tension building up inside him.</p>
<p class="TX">The large hall in the Garden’s eastern precinct had become the venue of a simple ceremony.</p>
<p class="TX">Normally, the students at the Garden would line up in orderly rows to fill the vast space, with the teachers and knights seated onstage at the front. The familiarity of the scene only added to the solemnity of the situation.</p>
<p class="TX">“How is everything, Lady Saika?” Kuroe asked, perhaps having sensed something was off about his appearance.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 61. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_61" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Incidentally, she was as expressionless as usual—that sight now being all too familiar to him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh, it’s nothing. I was just thinking how it’s been a long time since I last met the head of the Tower,” Mushiki responded, trying his best to play the role expected of him.</p>
<p class="TX">“You needn’t worry too much,” Kuroe mumbled, catching on. “Master Gyousei Shionji of the Tower is an old acquaintance of yours, but you don’t actually have many opportunities to meet face-to-face. It’s highly unlikely that he would sense anything out of the ordinary.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“On that count, Knight Fuyajoh is of much more concern.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Why does that ring true?” Mushiki whispered with a forced smile as he glanced over his shoulder at Ruri.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>She was sitting ramrod straight, cutting a magnificent figure as she glared at the amassed students through bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p class="TX">That being said, she didn’t seem to be actually watching the students to make sure that they didn’t misbehave. If anything, she looked more like she was scanning their faces to find someone in particular<span class="ellipse">…</span> Mushiki positively dreaded the thought of going back to the classroom.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, but there is one other important point,” Kuroe said as if only now remembering something.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki did his best to put Ruri out of mind for the time being, turning back to the matter at hand.</p>
<p class="TX">“An important point?” he repeated.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. Please make sure you don’t lose.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? I mean, I’ll do my best, but—”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, I’m not talking about the exhibition match—”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, the Garden’s administrative AI, Silvelle, announced through the speakers set up all over the hall, “<span class="ITAL">The entourage from Shadow Tower will now enter the hall. Please welcome our guests with a warm round of applause.</span>”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 62. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_62" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>No sooner had she finished speaking than the entrance doors began to slowly swing open—and the group from the other school filed inside in an orderly line.</p>
<p class="TX">The cohort consisted of several teachers and more than a hundred students, male and female, each garbed in dark uniforms. The glowing realizing devices at the tips of their shoulder epaulettes indicated that they were all mages.</p>
<p class="TX">It wasn’t long before the procession, marching to the applause of their hosts, reached the area of the hall set aside for them and came to a halt.</p>
<p class="TX">With that, the teachers leading them made their way to the stage occupied by Mushiki and the Garden’s major figures.</p>
<p class="TX">At their forefront was an older man dressed in a mage’s robe, with a deeply wrinkled and a long white beard. Despite his age, his posture and gait were impeccable.</p>
<p class="TX">There could be no doubt about it—this was Gyousei Shionji, Shadow Tower’s headmaster. In appearance and bearing, he was just like the pictures that Mushiki had seen of him beforehand.</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s been a long time since I last set foot in the Garden,” he said as he approached Mushiki, holding out his hand.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes, it’s good to see you doing so well, Master Shionji.”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki took a deep breath to quiet his racing heart, flashed his guest a smile, and extended his own hand in welcome.</p>
<p class="TX">But the very next moment, Shionji raised his middle finger right in front of his face.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki gawked, his eyes bulging from the unexpected shock.</p>
<p class="TX">Then Shionji made a wry face, his gaze sharpened into a glower beneath his long eyebrows.</p>
<p class="TX">“You got me good last year, you evil witch! Every single time<span class="ellipse">…</span> You and your dastardly tricks<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! I’ll pay you back for all the humiliation you’ve put me through<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! With interest!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Um<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 63. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_63" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Mushiki was left reeling in confusion at the abusive tirade pouring from the old gentleman’s mouth.</p>
<p class="TX">Naturally, he had heard the Tower’s headmaster had a somewhat antagonistic relationship with Saika, but he hadn’t expected the man to be so direct about it. He glanced at Kuroe in bewilderment.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe, unfazed, gave him a firm nod.</p>
<p class="TX">She didn’t say anything—but for some reason, Mushiki felt as though the word <span class="ITAL">Go!</span> echoed in his mind.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Ah. So this was what she had meant when she told him not to lose. Sweat dripped down his cheek, but nonetheless, he turned around to face Shionji.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh? What a spineless greeting. Don’t tell me the Tower is teaching people that the requisite effort and ingenuity employed to seize victory is no more than cowardice!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh?! You wicked witch<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! You think <span class="ITAL">that</span> was a show of effort and ingenuity?! Is that how your people at the Garden view what you did?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>What in the world <span class="ITAL">did</span> Saika do last year?</p>
<p class="TX">The two teachers on either side of the older man were both struggling to calm him down.</p>
<p class="TX">“W-well<span class="ellipse">…</span> Please, calm yourself, Headmaster,” said a gentle-looking bespectacled woman.</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s right, Master. What will you accomplish by being more hotheaded than our own students?” added a large man with scars all over his body.</p>
<p class="TX">Both teachers had been listed in the materials that Kuroe had prepared for Mushiki ahead of time. The first to speak was Wakaba Saeki, and the second, Tetsuga Suoh. Both were instructors at the Tower and aides to Shionji, equal in rank to the Knights of the Garden.</p>
<p class="TX">And they both looked to be quite levelheaded.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 64. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_64" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Mushiki hoped that the two would be able to calm their leader, even if only a little. Yet—</p>
<p class="TX">“She’s poison. Don’t fall into the clutches of this vicious, treacherous vixen.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I heard she <span class="ITAL">does</span> use poison—and rather casually at that, so it’s best not to get too close.”</p>
<p class="TX">Nope. The two were still belligerent—they just had a different way of showing it.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki was wondering how to respond to all this when Shionji steadied his breathing and fixed him with dauntless smirk. “Fine. Just remember—this year’s Tower is a different beast. Don’t expect this to play out like last time.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh? I look forward to it<span class="ellipse">…</span> To seeing you fall flat on your face.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmph<span class="ellipse">…</span> We’ll see!”</p>
<p class="TX">Then, perhaps sensing that the conversation had run its course, Silvelle’s voice sounded once more over the loudspeakers: “<span class="ITAL">With those warm and friendly greetings out of the way, let’s now introduce the contestants representing each side. The students who have been selected will now be called up to the stage.</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Did that AI honestly consider <span class="ITAL">this</span> a friendly greeting, or was she being ironic? Mushiki couldn’t tell<span class="ellipse">…</span> Regardless, he wanted to put these formalities behind him as quickly as possible, so he looked away from Shionji to let Silvelle move the event along.</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, the lights in the hall dimmed as an image was projected above the stage.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Representing Void’s Garden—Honoka Moegi, third year.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">With that announcement, Honoka’s image appeared on the screen amid a barrage of flashy special effects. The atmosphere seemed more like a martial arts contest than a friendly bout between two schools.</p>
<p class="TX">“H-here!” answered a girl in a Garden uniform, stepping up to the stage and looking slightly nervous.</p>
<p class="TX">The audience broke into a round of applause and cheers.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Touya Shinozuka, third year.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 65. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_65" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Ah.”</p>
<p class="TX">Next came a tall male student, waving to an explosion of excited shouts from the audience.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Ruri Fuyajoh, second year.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Yes!”</p>
<p class="TX">As her name was called, Ruri, already sitting onstage, quickly rose to her feet—and with that, the adulation of the students watching increased to an even greater level.</p>
<p class="TX">As to be expected of an S-ranked mage and a mainstay of the Knights of the Garden, she was acknowledged by all—and incredibly popular to boot.</p>
<p class="TX">As someone who knew her on a personal level, it all struck Mushiki as a little incongruent.</p>
<p class="TX">The students continued with their applause, and Silvelle read out the next name, “<span class="ITAL">Next we have Mushiki Kuga, second year, who is unable to join us right now due to him feeling under the weather.</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">This had all been arranged in advance. So long as he was attending the ceremony as Saika, it was impossible to appear as himself.</p>
<p class="TX">In stark contrast to their previous applause, the audience lashed out with a wave of booing<span class="ellipse">…</span> And their jeers seemed to say, <span class="ITAL">How could one of our own representatives miss the opening ceremony?</span> Or, <span class="ITAL">He ran off! That damn Mushipi</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> Regardless, he did his best not to dwell on this outpouring of negativity.</p>
<p class="TX">With four of the Garden’s representatives now introduced, only one more remained.</p>
<p class="TX">A particularly flashy set of visual effects were projected on the overhead screen as the final student’s photograph and name appeared in prominent letters.</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Saika Kuozaki, second year.”</span></p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">And her name and picture appeared.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Huh?” he wondered aloud, tilting his head.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 66. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_66" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Did he just see something strange?</p>
<p class="TX">But the astonishment of the representatives from the Tower far outweighed his own shock.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Huuuhhh?! Wait a minute!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">The teachers and students from the opposing school all cried out in unison, the air in the huge venue tremoring from their loud protests.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-what’s the meaning of this?! Why is <span class="ITAL">your</span> name up there?!” Shionji cried out, pointing at Mushiki in dismay.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, um, er<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">He, too, was left speechless, and so perhaps attempting to cover for him, it was Silvelle who responded, “<span class="ITAL">Saachie—I mean, Saika Kuozaki—enrolled as a student last month. She’s perfectly qualified to compete.</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Huh?!” Shionji’s eyes bulged in incomprehension.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“The most promising students from each school are selected to take part, in both magical ability and fighting experience. So taking that into account, I concluded that she would be a suitable representative for the Garden.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“No doubt! But still<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Shionji dug his heels into the stage like a spoiled child.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Well, Silvelle’s logic wasn’t wrong, but this certainly would be a baffling development for any outsider.</p>
<p class="TX">With everyone around him paralyzed with confusion, Mushiki lowered his voice and whispered to the figure behind his shoulder, “Kuroe?”</p>
<p class="TX">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Um, I thought you said you would see what you could do about changing the selected individuals?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. So I had Lady Saika’s name added as one of our representatives.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I see?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">Why would you do that?!</span> He felt like screaming to the heavens, but he buried his panic and tried to address her with the utmost calm. To be dismayed and worried wasn’t part of Saika’s personality.</p>
<p class="TX">“I need to ask. Why would you do that?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I did everything I could, but I wasn’t able to rescind Mushiki’s nomination.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 67. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_67" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Hmm.”</p>
<p class="TX">“So I gave another student’s slot to Lady Saika.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>If you could do that, why not Mushiki’s?”</p>
<p class="TX">“It seems the five representatives were given different responsibilities. Mushiki, whose record shows that he defeated a mythic-class annihilation factor, was designated a priority that couldn’t be changed.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I see. So why nominate <span class="ITAL">me</span>, then?” he asked.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe let out a long exhale through her nose. “Mushiki might have defeated <span class="ITAL">her</span>, but his mastery of magic is still very unstable. Going up against the Tower’s best students, we can’t rule out the possibility that he might be killed.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> I guess that’s true.”</p>
<p class="TX">“If we don’t have enough fighting potential to make up for his absence, we could very well lose this exhibition match.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">With that, Mushiki finally understood.</p>
<p class="TX">The other day, Kuroe had feigned disinterest with the whole affair—but in truth, she was more obsessed with winning than anyone else.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>That’s pretty cute, actually,” he whispered, his cheeks turning red.</p>
<p class="TX">“What?”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, it’s nothing,” he murmured, clearing his throat.</p>
<p class="TX">Shionji, however, having finally grasped the situation, fixed him with a baleful glare. “Y-you Garden clowns! You dirty cheats! Is this how badly you want to win this time around?! Argh! Now I see why you’re wearing that uniform! You shrewd witch!” Shionji shouted, his hands trembling as he pointed venomously at Mushiki.</p>
<p class="TX">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="TX">The headmaster of the opposing school must have concluded that Saika had enrolled as a student for the express purpose of winning the exhibition match.</p>
<p class="TX">The other visiting teachers likewise shook with anger.</p>
<p class="TX">“How despicable<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! The Witch of Resplendent Color? More like the Witch of Resplendent Evil!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 68. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_68" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Damn<span class="ellipse">…</span> That’s a low, filthy act!”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Um, actually<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">They all seemed to have completely misunderstood.</p>
<p class="TX">There was a very different reason for why Mushiki had enrolled in the Garden in the guise of Saika<span class="ellipse">…</span>but he could hardly explain that publicly. He crossed his arms as he debated with himself what to do now.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, as though having sensed his need for help, Ruri stepped forward.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Leave this to me,” she declared, confident that she could handle the situation.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, glad to entrust her with this tussle, nodded in gratitude.</p>
<p class="TX">However—</p>
<p class="TX">“What’s all that you’ve been saying just now? So you grown men and women are going to chitter and chirp like a bunch of baby chicks? The whole point of this exhibition match is to improve the skills of our schools’ mages. Are you going to cry foul when an annihilation factor you can’t control rears its head? Are you going to tell <span class="ITAL">it</span> how it’s <span class="ITAL">breaking the rules</span>? Some mages really are clueless, aren’t they?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-what<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">She didn’t help at all. Far from smoothing this predicament over, she merely fanned the flames.</p>
<p class="TX">Maybe she was angry about the disparaging comments directed at Saika. Her remarks just then had struck Mushiki as harsher than usual<span class="ellipse">…</span> But he did feel a little better to have her come to his aid like this.</p>
<p class="TX">But it was also unmistakable that her comments had everyone onstage on a knife-edge. At this rate, the opening ceremony could well descend into a death match before the main event.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment—</p>
<p class="TX">“Excuse me.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 69. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_69" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>A figure approached to break the tense atmosphere—Kuroe.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Who are you?”</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Headmaster Shionji. My name is Kuroe Karasuma. I am Lady Saika’s attendant,” she said with utmost politeness. Then she gently added, “The confusion our guests from the Tower feel is entirely justified<span class="ellipse">…</span> Lady Saika is constantly giving me unreasonable tasks as well. I understand what you all must be thinking.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Shionji groaned, as though unsure how to respond to this polite greeting.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe, not about to let this opportunity pass her by, continued, “To that end, the Garden would like to offer a proposal.”</p>
<p class="TX">“A proposal?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes<span class="ellipse">…</span> Lady Saika will only participate in the match after two other students have dropped out, and she’ll restrain herself to only using her first substantiation; how does that sound?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” Shionji’s eyes opened wide. “Do you really mean that?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Of course. Don’t we, Lady Saika?” Kuroe said, turning to Mushiki to press him for his agreement.</p>
<p class="TX">As far as he was concerned, if that was what she wanted, he wasn’t about to object.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah,” he replied, offering her a firm nod.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Shionji fell deep into thought for a long moment, before eventually raising his head. “Very well. I must admit I’m still somewhat reluctant, but Knight Fuyajoh here did have a point<span class="ellipse">…</span> Though, I do have one condition.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Please,” Mushiki urged.</p>
<p class="TX">“I want you to wait ten minutes until you see <span class="ITAL">our</span> representatives.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, not sure what to make of this, glanced Kuroe’s way out of the corner of his eye. She in turn gave him a slight nod, as if to say that shouldn’t pose an issue.</p>
<p class="TX">“All right. I have no objection.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 70. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_70" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Then let’s resume this conversation in ten minutes,” Shionji said, before leading his two aides down the stage and disappearing into the back of the hall.</p>
<p class="TX">After seeing him off, Mushiki tilted his head slightly. “Ten minutes<span class="ellipse">…</span> I wonder what he’s going to do?”</p>
<p class="TX">“He will, most likely, change one or more of their representatives for the match. Probably to someone who will be able to specialize in countering Lady Saika,” Kuroe mumbled.</p>
<p class="TX">“I see,” Mushiki answered, rubbing his chin.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, ten minutes later—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Now, it’s time to introduce the representatives from the Tower</span>,” Silvelle’s voice echoed over the loudspeakers.</p>
<p class="TX">Shionji and the other teachers still hadn’t returned to the stage.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Takeru Matsuba, third year.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Oh!”</p>
<p class="TX">A male student from the Tower jumped up onstage as his name was called, wild cheers spurring him forward.</p>
<p class="TX">But the problems started from there.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Next, filling in for Shou Negishi, third year</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">we have Tetsuga Suoh, first year.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“I’m here!”</p>
<p class="TX">As he heard the sound of that familiar name echoing in his ears, Mushiki’s eyes nearly bulged from their sockets.</p>
<p class="TX">Glancing down, appearing before him was none other than one of the teachers who had disappeared from the stage earlier.</p>
<p class="TX">No<span class="ellipse">…</span> There was a slight difference about him.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki was dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="TX">But his response wasn’t unreasonable. After all, that stern man in his mid-thirties whose body was covered in countless scars was now wearing the uniform of a Tower student. It clearly didn’t fit his huge frame, and the back looked like it had been repaired using a considerable amount of duct tape.</p>
<p class="TX">The instructor, however, seemed completely unconcerned as he took <span aria-label=" Page 71. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_71" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>his position among his school’s representatives with pride. The sleeves of his uniform, barely managing to maintain their shape, all but screamed aloud in their struggle to contain his thick, log-like arms.</p>
<p class="TX">“Leave it to me! I’ll take care of these try-hards!” he declared with an innocent grin.</p>
<p class="TX">He was clearly projecting a different persona from the man who he had been just a few minutes earlier. Perhaps this was his attempt at adopting a youthful flair?</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Filling in for Mako Shimbashi, third year</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">Wakaba Saeki, first year.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Yahoo!”</p>
<p class="TX">Next, another of Shionji’s aides, Wakaba Saeki, leaped onstage.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki had a bad feeling even before hearing that introduction—and just as he’d expected, this teacher, too, was now wearing the Tower’s uniform for female students.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">The sight of this mysterious mature lady in a uniform bursting at the seams had a different kind of destructive power than that of Suoh. Gasps were heard throughout the hall.</p>
<p class="TX">“Whoa<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s like she went to one of those shady clothing shops<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Damn, that looks sexy on her<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, the individual in question didn’t seem at all bothered by these reactions, glancing at her admirers through cute, upturned eyes.</p>
<p class="TX">“Aiight, so this exhibition match is totes going to be bomb, like seriously! Let’s kick ’em to the curb!” she said in some mysterious language.</p>
<p class="TX">Was that another attempt at coming across as a teenager? Mushiki couldn’t make heads or tails of it.</p>
<p class="TX">But that wasn’t the end of it. Silvelle soon launched into her next announcement. <span class="ITAL">“Filling in for Haruki Kuwazome, third year</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">Gyousei Shionji, first year.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Yo!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 72. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_72" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Just as Mushiki had feared, this next voice belonged to none other than Tower’s headmaster, Gyousei Shionji.</p>
<p class="TX">Of course, he, too, was now wearing a student’s school uniform.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’ve never tried anything like this before<span class="ellipse">…</span>but I’ll do my best!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-what?!” Ruri blurted out in astonishment.</p>
<p class="TX">She stood just before Mushiki and pointed with her arm outstretched at the Tower’s representatives (as the teaching staff had now styled themselves as students).</p>
<p class="TX">“Heh<span class="ellipse">…</span> Is there a problem? We’re just three wet-behind-the-ears first-years freshly enrolled at the Tower. Why should the other side’s little ploy be tolerated and not ours<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? It would be beyond hypocritical for <span class="ITAL">you all</span> to complain, wouldn’t you say?” Shionji declared. He and his two fellow teachers broke out in amused chortles.</p>
<p class="TX">The young man at the very head of the group, the only real student among them, looked ill at ease.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>This was turning into a downright mess, but when all was said and done, what they were doing wasn’t all that different from the Garden’s selection. So long as Saika herself was representing the Garden, they would have no choice but to accept this arrangement. Though on tenterhooks at this development, Mushiki gave the opposing side his assent.</p>
<p class="TX">“W-well<span class="ellipse">…</span> I suppose the conditions aren’t all that different. We’ll allow it. But<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“But what?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Aren’t there supposed to be five representatives? What happened to the last one?”</p>
<p class="TX">Shionji smirked. “An excellent question. Our last entrant is a treasured daughter of the Tower, the most powerful killer purposefully selected to bring down your Garden.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Your treasured daughter<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Indeed. And her name is<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Shionji began to say, when—</p>
<p class="TX">“Me!” came a voice from out of nowhere as a fifth figure leaped onstage, spinning through the air then landing with an extravagant pose.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! You<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” Mushiki’s eyes all but popped from their sockets.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 73. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_73" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Her flashy dyed hair was tied up in two pigtails, her canines poked through her lips, and she was wearing ear cuffs in various sizes.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes—this was none other than Clara Tokishima, the popular MagiTube streamer Clara.</p>
<p class="TX">But there was one difference from how Mushiki remembered her—she was now sporting the same uniform as Shionji and the others.</p>
<p class="TX">“Phew, I finally found you. The Garden’s Madam Witch,” she said, her head swaying as she glanced up to meet Mushiki’s gaze.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">He knit his brows. The emotions reflected in her eyes were distinctly different from the times when he had interacted with her in his own body.</p>
<p class="TX">“Clara?! That uniform<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! You’re with the Tower<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!” Ruri wheezed in astonishment.</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, her name and photograph appeared on the overhead projector with perfect timing.</p>
<p class="TX">“You’re the Tower’s<span class="ellipse">…</span>last<span class="ellipse">…</span>representative<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Mushiki asked warily.</p>
<p class="TX">Shionji clapped his hands together. “That’s right. She’s our secret weapon! Just as strong an asset as your own Ruri Fuyajoh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">Clara glanced up at the screen. “Ah. By the way,” she said lightly. “I came here a little early to scout the place out. Still, well, er, that doesn’t matter right now. More importantly<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">She paused, picking up the microphone onstage and pointing with her arm outstretched straight at Mushiki.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, in a loud, clear voice resonating amid the rows of students and teaching staff from the Garden and the Tower alike, she proclaimed:</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">“Madam Witch! Let’s see which of us is worthy of being Mushiki’s girlfriend! I challenge you to a duel!”</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>What?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, caught square in her firing line, could do nothing more than gawk at this sudden declaration.</p>
