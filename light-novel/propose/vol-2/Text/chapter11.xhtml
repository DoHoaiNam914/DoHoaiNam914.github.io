<p class="COTX">Throughout human history, two main themes have constantly risen above the rest.</p>
<p class="TX">The first is struggle.</p>
<p class="TX">The second, romance.</p>
<p class="TX">Since the dawn of time, people have always been enthralled by tales of gallant heroism, their hearts stirred by the words of beautiful love stories.</p>
<p class="TX">No matter the turning of the ages, irrespective of the extent of technological innovation and changes in the world, these two fixations have remained unchanged.</p>
<p class="TX">That is to be expected. After all, both pleasures are rooted in the fundamental desire for human beings to live and connect with others.</p>
<p class="TX">So long as people live in the midst of social groups, they are obliged to compete with one another to protect their lives, their friends, their properties, and to find reproductive partners in order to beget offspring.</p>
<p class="TX">But of course, in real life, it is quite unlikely that each of these challenges will turn out exactly as one might hope.</p>
<p class="TX">And yet—no, for that very reason—people tend to let themselves <span aria-label=" Page 76. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_76" role="doc-pagebreak"/>get carried away, fascinated by stories of a mysterious <span class="ITAL">other</span> that makes their blood gush with excitement, pulled along by romantic tales of beauty and ugliness.</p>
<p class="TX">The mages in this hidden corner of the world were no exception—they, too, were merely human.</p>
<p class="TX">So in short<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
<p class="TX">This situation encompassing both of these gripping elements—two skilled mages competing against one another for the sake of love—couldn’t fail to rouse an outpouring of passion.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>We’re in trouble now<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Mushiki murmured.</p>
<p class="TX">“We certainly are<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Kuroe added.</p>
<p class="TX">The two of them grumbled under their breath as they returned to the headmistress’s office, their expressions strained.</p>
<p class="TX">Well, strictly speaking, it was only Mushiki who wore a bitter expression—Kuroe was as expressionless as ever. It was clear, nonetheless, that beneath that visage, she was indeed deeply troubled by what had happened.</p>
<p class="TX">Of course, the source of their mutual consternation was none other than Clara.</p>
<p class="TX">Around thirty minutes ago, as the Tower’s final representative for the interschool demonstration battle, she had stood up onstage and proposed a public showdown between her and Saika, with Mushiki as the spoils.</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s all over WeSPER. It’s already trending,” Kuroe said as she glanced at her phone screen.</p>
<p class="TX">“WeSPER?” Mushiki repeated uncertainly.</p>
<p class="TX">“Another social networking service exclusive to mages. Unlike the last one I showed you, this one is for publishing short posts for other users to see,” she explained, showing him her phone display.</p>
<p class="TX">An article titled <span class="ITAL">The Witch of Resplendent Color vs. Clara, Showdown for Love?!</span> jumped out at him, followed by more comments than the eye could count<span class="ellipse">…</span> As was to be expected of modern-day magicians, they had taken to sharing information in a very contemporary way.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 77. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_77" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“Why didn’t you turn her down more clearly?” Kuroe asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I’m sorry<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Mushiki moaned, raising a hand to his forehead.</p>
<p class="TX">Although everyone was taken aback, Clara had persisted with her challenge, and before he knew it, the conversation seemed settled—at least in the eyes of everyone who was watching.</p>
<p class="TX">Even though he hadn’t exactly given her a concrete response, everyone was acting as though the duel was decided. In fact, the entire Garden was already bursting with rumors and speculation.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>But if I had said I didn’t know what she was talking about, Clara probably would have claimed victory then and there and insisted that I belong to her<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“You<span class="ellipse">…</span>may be right<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Kuroe sighed.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki let out a heavy breath as well.</p>
<p class="TX">Everything really had gone haywire. To think that he had been challenged to a <span class="ITAL">duel for Mushiki</span>, a fight over himself<span class="ellipse">…</span> What was he supposed to do? It was like being faced with a philosophical conundrum.</p>
<p class="TX">He was still deep in thought when Kuroe glanced at him, her face lighting up with an idea. “How about this—you publicly declare that you and Mushiki won’t allow Clara to come between you two. If both Lady Saika and Mushiki are unanimous, Clara won’t—”</p>
<p class="TX">“I can’t do that!” he found himself shouting.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe stared back in surprise, and he fought to calm his heaving shoulders. “I’m sorry,” he said. “For shouting like that. And for my tone<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“It doesn’t matter. Go ahead, tell me in whatever way is most comfortable for you. There’s no one here but us,” Kuroe urged.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki bowed. “Yes, I’m in Saika’s body right now. As far as most people are concerned, anything I say is practically the word of Saika herself. So if I did that, Clara <span class="ITAL">could</span> give up quietly. There’s that possibility at least.” Nonetheless, he clenched his fists. “Still, I’m just borrowing her body, looking after it for a while. I can’t ignore her wishes or do anything that could affect her future life<span class="ellipse">…</span> Especially when it comes to this sort of thing.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 78. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_78" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe fell silent for a moment, before letting out a soft sigh. “I see. That was thoughtless of me. I apologize.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! No, you don’t need to<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Mushiki paused, his eyes widening.</p>
<p class="TX">Behind her expressionless mask, Kuroe’s face seemed to have relaxed slightly.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kuroe<span class="ellipse">…</span> Is that a smile?”</p>
<p class="TX">“What are you talking about?” she deflected, averting her gaze, returning to her usual placid look.</p>
<p class="TX">She soon regained her composure and peered straight into his eyes. “In that case, we will have to consider our response carefully. Clara’s comments have already taken off among the staff and students both at the Garden and the Tower. Of course, from Lady Saika’s point of view, they can be ignored, but<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“That wouldn’t be like Saika, though<span class="ellipse">…</span> Would it?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Precisely.” Kuroe nodded in agreement. “Fortunately, Lady Saika has yet to say anything definite. Thus far, only Clara herself has suggested that Lady Saika has feelings for Mushiki. Lady Saika has effectively just been caught in the middle. But even so, it wouldn’t be like her to run from a challenge.”</p>
<p class="TX">She paused for a moment, before adding, “Lady Saika would be amused by the provocation and accept it head-on, then defeat her opponent with ease. As for the implication that Lady Saika is Mushiki’s girlfriend, that accusation was only made by Clara without any form of corroboration. If Lady Saika wins, she shouldn’t be obliged to do or admit anything. She was simply accepting Clara’s challenge<span class="ellipse">…</span> However, if Clara loses, given that she initiated all this, no doubt she will have to give up on Mushiki.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I see.” He nodded as he rose from his chair. “That does sound<span class="ellipse">…</span>like <span class="ITAL">me</span>,” he said in Saika’s voice as he looked himself over in the mirror.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Well, I can’t say I really understand the meaning of fighting over yourself, though,” Mushiki chuckled.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 79. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_79" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“Let’s not go too far,” Kuroe remarked with a noticeable lack of amusement as she tapped at the screen of her phone. “Pre-event festivities are currently taking place throughout the Garden in advance of the match tomorrow<span class="ellipse">…</span> It seems that Clara is setting up a special stage for her confrontation with Lady Saika. She has even put in an official application to use the multipurpose hall.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Well, well. She’s a fast one, isn’t she?” Mushiki continued, still adopting Saika’s personality. “She doesn’t have the slightest doubt I’ll turn down her challenge.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Perhaps she hasn’t considered that possibility, or she might think Lady Saika is obligated to accept<span class="ellipse">…</span> Either way, she’ll be a bothersome opponent. Even so—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Let’s go, Kuroe. We’ll of course snatch victory and then make a triumphant return. No matter the battle, Saika Kuozaki would never run away or accept defeat.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Indeed. I’ll accompany you.” Kuroe nodded in satisfaction as the two of them approached the door at the back of the headmistress’s room.</p>
<p class="TX">The doorway was on the back wall, at the far end of the top floor of the central school building. Normally, one would have expected it to lead to thin air, perhaps intended as a joke by the architects or builders, or a trap to lead the unwitting into a steep fall.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, when Kuroe gripped the knob and swung the door open, it wasn’t the emptiness outside the building that appeared before them.</p>
<p class="TX">“After you,” she urged.</p>
<p class="TX">“Thank you,” Mushiki said, passing through at a leisurely pace.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe followed a second later, closing the door behind them.</p>
<p class="TX">The two of them had stepped out into the multipurpose building in the Garden’s western precinct.</p>
<p class="TX">At the other end of the hall was a large stage, before which an audience was spread out in a wide arc.</p>
<p class="TX">The seats were already fully occupied, taken up by students in the uniforms of both the Garden and the Tower.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 80. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_80" role="doc-pagebreak"/>And in front of them all—</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Hiya there! Thanks for coming, everyone! Your good friend Clara is just gonna wait here onstage until Madam Witch decides to show her face! How’s that sound?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">Standing in the eye of that whirlpool was none other than the mage Clara Tokishima, speaking into a microphone to enliven the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="TX">On closer inspection, Mushiki could see her winged smartphone floating nearby, just as it had been when she had gone to subdue the slimes. This had to be another of her live streams.</p>
<p class="TX">Then—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Yowza?!</span>” she exclaimed, her eyes shooting open.</p>
<p class="TX">It didn’t take much thought to guess what must have prompted this.</p>
<p class="TX">After all, at that moment, Clara’s and Mushiki’s gazes met.</p>
<p class="TX">She broke out in a broad grin and, with an exaggerated gesture, urged her audience to take in their new visitors.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Everyone, take a look at our guests! The headmistress of Void’s Garden, the strongest mage in the whole wide world—Saika Kuozaki herself!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_exclamatory">…</span><span class="ITAL">!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">As prompted, the audience turned as one toward Mushiki—and the building erupted in a round of thunderous applause and earth-shattering cheers.</p>
<p class="TX">He felt more than a little self-conscious, but without stepping out of character as Saika, he gave the hall a graceful wave.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, at a relaxed pace, he made his way through the aisle and approached the stage.</p>
<p class="TX">“Madam Witch!”</p>
<p class="TX">Just before he could step into the limelight, he heard a familiar voice coming from nearby.</p>
<p class="TX">He glanced around for a second. “Ah, Ruri. And Hizumi, too. Have you come to watch this little bout?”</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed, Ruri and Hizumi were both there, looking restless in their seats in the front row.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 81. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_81" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“Yes. That Clara woman<span class="ellipse">…</span> It wasn’t enough for her to strut about with that boyfriend nonsense, and now she had to drag you into this, too<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! I wish I could crush her myself<span class="ellipse">…</span> But she’s challenged <span class="ITAL">you</span>, Madam Witch, so I won’t rob you of that right,” Ruri said, shaking her fist.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, in her agitated voice, she added, “Please, give that insolent woman a taste of what she deserves!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ha-ha. I’ve been handed a major role to play, haven’t I? Well, I’ll do my best,” he said somewhat lightly. That seemed the closest to a Saika-like response.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri seemed to have a similar take on the situation. She nodded in response, her stern face conveying her trust and agreement. “By the way, Madam Witch<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Clara was just mouthing off, right? When she said the match was to see who’s worthy of being Mushiki’s girlfriend?” she asked, her expression composed of 99 percent trust and 1 percent concern.</p>
<p class="TX">For a moment, Mushiki was at a loss for an answer, but he nodded in response.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Th-that’s right. For some reason, she seems to think if she can beat me, she’ll be able to date him.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I thought so! There’s no way Madam Witch would be into my brother!” Ruri said, her face lighting up.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Well, that <span class="ITAL">was</span> the impression he had set out to convey, but to hear someone say it so bluntly made the words reverberate through his whole body. He did his best to maintain his calm facade and offered an ambiguous response.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, from a seat on the other side of the aisle, a dry chuckle rang out.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hee-hee-hee, so you’re planning to teach her a lesson? Let’s see how well that works out, eh?”</p>
<p class="TX">Seated not too far away was an older man, complete with white hair and beard, wearing the uniform of a Tower student.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 82. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_82" role="doc-pagebreak"/>There was only one individual who fit that description— Gyousei Shionji, the headmaster of the Tower and a fresh-faced first-year student. Looking closely, Tetsuga Suoh and Wakaba Saeki were similarly dressed in crisp school uniforms by his side.</p>
<p class="TX">“Master Shionji? And your lackeys, too? So you’re still dressing up like that?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Still? It’s only natural for students at the Tower to wear their uniform.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes, well, I suppose that’s true<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s also natural for freshmen like us to support Tokishima, too. She’s our senior, after all.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Your senior?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Isn’t that how students refer to those in higher grades?” Shionji asked, his head tilted to one side.</p>
<p class="TX">The word might have made sense in some situations, but it certainly didn’t feel right coming from the mouth of a gentleman so advanced in age.</p>
<p class="TX">Suddenly, Ruri, no doubt having overheard all this, shouted from her seat across the aisle, “Headmaster Shionji, are you really going to let her get away with this? She’s already made a huge mess of things.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I have no issue with it. At the Tower, we respect the autonomy of our students.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>And your <span class="ITAL">real</span> reason?”</p>
<p class="TX">“That firecracker of a girl doesn’t listen to anyone, but at least this way she might be able to exhaust the Garden’s strength a little before the match—”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ahem.” He shrugged, averting his gaze. “Well done, Knight Fuyajoh. You managed to extract an improper remark from me.”</p>
<p class="TX">“No<span class="ellipse">…</span> I didn’t do anything<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Ruri responded with hesitation.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>It sounded like the Tower had its hands full with Clara, too, then<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
<p class="TX">But that didn’t mean Mushiki could tuck his tail between his legs and admit defeat.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 83. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_83" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Because right now, he <span class="ITAL">wasn’t</span> Mushiki. As Saika Kuozaki, it was his responsibility to defend the name of the Garden.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">With renewed determination, he approached the stage with Kuroe by his side to confront the waiting Clara.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh-ho-ho<span class="ellipse">…</span> So you came, Madam Witch<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? I was actually a little worried about what I’d do if you just up and ignored me. <span class="ITAL">That</span> would have been seriously awkward. So I s’pose I owe you one?” she said with a dauntless grin.</p>
<p class="TX">Incidentally, Clara whispered the second half of that greeting. She was certainly a headache, but it was hard to hate her sense of tact at least.</p>
<p class="TX">“But a match is a match! I’ll beat you, Madam Witch, and win Mushipi’s heart for myself!” she declared, pointing at him with an exaggerated flourish.</p>
<p class="TX">No one, least of all any student of the Garden, would dare talk to the Witch of Resplendent Color in that way. For better or for worse, Clara clearly had considerable pluck.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki glanced at Kuroe, who was standing slightly behind him.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, having guessed what he hoped to ask, she offered him a short nod.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki forced a soft smile, turned back to Clara, and declared loudly, “Oh-ho, I’ll humor you. I won’t shy away from this challenge. I’ll defeat you, which I suppose would qualify <span class="ITAL">me</span> to be Mushiki’s lover.”</p>
<p class="TX">At this pronouncement, the entire hall began to buzz with excitement.</p>
<p class="TX">Of course, he didn’t really mean all that (though personally, he would have loved for it to be true).</p>
<p class="TX">However, if Saika was to ever find herself in this kind of situation, the most typical course of action for her would be to attempt to brighten up the situation—to effortlessly defeat her foe, take the spoils for her own, and leave with a stinging remark along the lines of: <span class="ITAL">That was fun.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 84. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_84" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Mushiki had no doubt that the real Saika Kuozaki would have done just that.</p>
<p class="TX">As it happened, Kuroe had agreed with his assessment, and Ruri, watching from the front row, didn’t seem at all surprised by how he had chosen to deal with this call to arms.</p>
<p class="TX">If anything, she even went so far as to lean over to the astonished Hizumi, seated beside her, and explain, “Hee-hee, calm down. Madam Witch is just working the crowd.”</p>
<p class="TX">Strictly speaking, Mushiki hadn’t been able to make out her exact words, but he was certain that was the sort of thing she would have just murmured. He had an extremely high success rate at gauging his sister’s reactions.</p>
<p class="TX">Clara, on the other hand, wore an expression that all but said: <span class="ITAL">Huh? Is Madam Witch really gunning for Mushipi, after all</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_questionmark">…</span><span class="ITAL">?</span></p>
<p class="TX">It seemed she still had only a shallow understanding of Saika Kuozaki.</p>
<p class="TX">“So what kind of match is this going to be? A mock battle? What level substantiation shall we go up to?”</p>
<p class="TX">“H-h-hold on<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Clara mouthed, spreading her hands wide as though put on the spot. “Um, hang on a sec, let’s save that for tomorrow’s party! You’re such a tease, Madam Witch <span class="spl">☆,</span> ” she said with a myriad of cute gestures.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, she couldn’t hide the fact that her forehead was dripping with sweat.</p>
<p class="TX">Her anxiety was only natural. She clearly wasn’t confident about winning a one-on-one mock battle against Saika.</p>
<p class="TX">“Then why did you issue your challenge?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Um, you see—”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“One moment. I’ll take over from here—to adjudicate.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">Before Clara could finish her sentence, the center of the stage let out a bright burst of light as a young girl appeared before the audience—the Garden’s administrative AI, Silvelle.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 85. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_85" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“Huh?! Wow! Isn’t she that AI girl?” Clara exclaimed.</p>
<p class="TX">“Silvelle?” Mushiki whispered.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Yoo-hoo! Oh, Saachie! Just call me</span> Sis <span class="ITAL">like you always do!</span> <span class="spl">♡</span><span class="ITAL">”</span></p>
<p class="TX">Silvelle shuddered, as though the sound of her full name made her feel uncomfortable—and with that movement, her ample breasts swayed from side to side, triggering a volley of audible gasps from the audience.</p>
<p class="TX">According to Kuroe, the AI was abnormally peculiar about being addressed as <span class="ITAL">Sis</span>, and it seemed that rule held true even with Saika.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Saachie</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">”</span> Mushiki let the sweet sound roll around his mouth.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Right. So even Saika had a cute nickname.</p>
<p class="TX">He felt a thrill course through him at the discovery of this heretofore unseen side belonging to the target of his affections.</p>
<p class="TX">But if he let himself get too excited, he would risk reverting to his own body. Taking a deep breath, he worked to calm himself, before turning to Silvelle.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah yes, that’s right, Sis<span class="ellipse">…</span> So what are you doing here?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">If you’re going to have a match, you need a neutral third party to set the rules, no? That’s where everyone’s favorite big sister Silvelle comes in! Or do you want to let Clarin decide everything?</span>” Silvelle asked questioningly.</p>
<p class="TX">So her nickname for Clara was <span class="ITAL">Clarin</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Well, she was right. If they were going to compete against one another, they would need a moderator and referee. And if Clara was allowed to decide the rules by herself, she would no doubt choose something that gave her the upper hand.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, it wouldn’t be like Saika to disagree with this proposal.</p>
<p class="TX">“I don’t mind,” he responded with a soft, confident smile.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Oh-ho, you’re always so cool, Saachie! I love it!</span>” Silvelle said. <span class="ITAL">“As the Garden’s big sister responsible for watching over everyone here, I can’t overlook an unfair match. Is that okay, Clarin?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Um, yes. I’ll let you decide. I mean, if you don’t win fairly, it isn’t a <span aria-label=" Page 86. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_86" role="doc-pagebreak"/>true victory, you know? Not that I was planning anything dishonest, okay? It’s all about fair play, don’cha think?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Very well. Then, unworthy as I am, I, Silvelle, will stand witness to this match between Saachie and Clarin here. You’re both my cute little sisters, so it’s painful to have to watch you fight each other, but I’ll be here to console the loser, all right?</span>” the AI said with a gentle smile.</p>
<p class="TX">Although Clara was a student of the Tower, she didn’t seem to have any issue playing along with Silvelle’s sister act.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Now, please allow me to explain the rules. The match will be divided into three rounds. Once we reach the end, the entrant with the most points will be declared the winner</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">And the first round will be the ultimate cooking duel! The way to a man’s heart is through his stomach!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">With Silvelle’s announcement, dramatic audio blasted through the hall’s loudspeakers and the stage lit up with a spectacle of special lighting effects, the name of the challenge appearing on the projected screen. The production quality and use of equipment were impeccable.</p>
<p class="TX">“A cooking showdown<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Yes. People always say that the strongest relationships between men and women are forged through the stomach. Cooking requires a multitude of skills, so in this round, Saachie and Clarin will show off their culinary prowess.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse">…</span> So how will the winner be decided?” Mushiki asked.</p>
<p class="TX">Silvelle gave him a firm nod. <span class="ITAL">“Of course, we’ll be asking our special judge.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Special judge?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Mukkie.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Bah?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki choked violently at Silvelle’s response—leaving the audience watching abuzz at this unusual scene and Kuroe glaring at him from behind.</p>
<p class="TX">But his reaction wasn’t unreasonable. After all, he was already present as Saika. Given that this competition was ostensibly meant to win his heart, having him judge the results might certainly seem fair, and yet<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
<p class="TX">No doubt, imagining Mushiki’s response to her food, Clara’s lips <span aria-label=" Page 87. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_87" role="doc-pagebreak"/>curled into a fearless grin. “Mwah-ha-ha, what’s the matter, Madam Witch? Is there something wrong with letting Mushipi decide? Maybe you’re worried about your ability to whip up something tasty?”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s not it<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he demurred, his expression strained.</p>
<p class="TX">Lowering his voice, he glanced over his shoulder. “Kuroe<span class="ellipse">…</span>is that possible?”</p>
<p class="TX">“If you undergo a state conversion immediately after preparing the food, it shouldn’t be <span class="ITAL">im</span>possible<span class="ellipse">…</span> Though contrary to Silvelle’s intentions here, I do think it’s extremely unfair,” she murmured, looking somewhat dissatisfied with it all.</p>
<p class="TX">He had sensed it before, but her unexpected obsession with winning struck him with renewed force. It was probably second nature for her to want to confront her foes in a fair and aboveboard manner.</p>
<p class="TX">He had thought he had understood all aspects of her personality, as he had to pose as her every day—but here she was showing him a side of herself he hadn’t yet witnessed. She was truly a terrifying woman—and cute, too.</p>
<p class="TX">“Well<span class="ellipse">…</span> That’s true. No doubt <span class="ITAL">my</span> food would taste a hundred times better to Mushiki’s palate. But this does put me at a disadvantage to Clara.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? What makes you say that?” Kuroe asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm? What do you mean? It doesn’t?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>If the player and the judge are one and the same, you can freely decide the outcome regardless of the food’s quality,” Kuroe whispered.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s eyes snapped open in surprise. “You’re a genius.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What kept you from thinking of that yourself?”</p>
<p class="TX">“My head was filled with the words <span class="ITAL">home cooking</span><span class="ellipse">…</span> There isn’t room for anything else<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe looked stunned for a moment. “Well, I’ll leave you to it, then,” she said with a nod.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Now, let’s get the venue ready</span>,” Silvelle said with a snap of her fingers, having seemingly decided that everything was settled.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 88. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_88" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Of course, being just a three-dimensional projection, she didn’t actually have fingers to snap—but nonetheless, an audible click sounded from the hall’s loudspeakers.</p>
<p class="TX">With that, the stage slid open as a platform began to rise up from the basement.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Is this<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki frowned at the sheer suddenness of this development.</p>
<p class="TX">It wasn’t long before two well-equipped kitchen sets, complete with shelves stuffed full of ingredients, appeared onstage.</p>
<p class="TX">“Whoa! This is awesome!” Clara swayed from side to side, her eyes gleaming—and as she did so, her flying smartphone darted around to capture the range of foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="TX">How on earth did that device even operate?</p>
<p class="TX">Silvelle puffed out her chest with pride. “<span class="ITAL">I prepared for this eventuality ahead of time. Please feel free to use the food and facilities. We also have aprons, so don’t hold back</span>,” she said, indicating the countertop, where as promised, there was indeed a neatly folded kitchen apron.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh, awesome! It’s the small details that make a world of difference, you know?” Clara said, cheerfully wrapping the apron around her waist.</p>
<p class="TX">The fabric was adorned with a strange mascot, a creature that somehow resembled both a kitten and a skeleton at the same time. Looking carefully, it seemed to be the exact same character on Clara’s hair ornaments.</p>
<p class="TX">Incidentally, Mushiki’s apron was emblazoned with the kanji for <span class="ITAL">Resplendent Color</span> and was dyed in a wide range of hues<span class="ellipse">…</span> Silvelle might have intended for the two items to match their respective personalities, but his apron was much more eccentric or surrealistic in design.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Now, are you both ready? The theme is</span> One Dish to Please Mukkie, <span class="ITAL">and the time limit is sixty minutes. Are the contestants ready? Well then—Battle Start!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">Silvelle made a finger-gun gesture and then: <span class="ITAL">Poof!</span> The bang of a starting pistol echoed through the hall.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hi, yoo-hoo! I’ve gotta win first!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 89. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_89" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Clara didn’t waste so much as a moment before hitting the ground running toward the pantry area, before proceeding to throw ingredients into a basket seemingly at random.</p>
<p class="TX">Was her strategy to monopolize all the best items first to limit Saika’s available options? Or was she really intending to use all that?</p>
<p class="TX">At this stage, he couldn’t claim to understand her intentions, but only pray that they weren’t the latter.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">A few seconds after her, Mushiki likewise picked up his basket and headed for the pantry area.</p>
<p class="TX">Although it had nothing to do with the match, Mushiki looked at himself wearing an apron and carrying a basket in his hands, and this new Saika struck him as the spitting image of a newlywed bride. He would have to make sure to watch the recording of Clara’s live stream later.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>No, not now.”</p>
<p class="TX">It wasn’t the time for such thoughts. He shook his head, hoping to clear his mind.</p>
<p class="TX">In the eyes of everyone watching, he <span class="ITAL">was</span> Saika. More important than winning or losing, he was determined not to do anything that could drag her reputation into disrepute.</p>
<p class="TX">Well, a clumsy Saika fumbling around the kitchen would be endearing in its own way—but it was better not to contemplate such thoughts for the time being.</p>
<p class="TX">“Right<span class="ellipse">…</span> Let’s take this<span class="ellipse">…</span>and that,” he murmured, tossing various ingredients into his basket.</p>
<div class="LI_SB1"/>
<p class="TX1">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>This is bad,” Ruri moaned, her worry writ large on her face as she watched from her seat in the audience.</p>
<p class="TX">“What’s bad<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Hizumi asked from beside her.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>The type of match,” Ruri answered without taking her eyes off the scene in front of her. “If it was a battle using magic, there isn’t anyone in the world who could beat her. But Madam Witch doesn’t do a lot of cooking by herself.”</p>
