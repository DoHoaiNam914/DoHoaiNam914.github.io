<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 110. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_110" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? U-um<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">His sense of reason couldn’t keep up. As he stared at her, he could feel his face burning up.</p>
<p class="TX">Then Kuroe glanced down at her outfit and said plainly, “Oh, this? I got it ready during Clara’s five minutes.”</p>
<p class="TX">“N-no, I mean, why would you even<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he stammered.</p>
<p class="TX">She stepped forward, pressing him up against the wall. “I told you. Just <span class="ITAL">saying</span> Saika won isn’t enough. That isn’t true victory. It’s a pity I’m not in my real body, but I want you to <span class="ITAL">mean</span> it when you say Saika took the prize.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hold on a—”</p>
<p class="TX">He lifted his hand, hoping to stop her from coming any closer—but alas, it soon met something soft.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe opened her lips, her cheeks faintly pink as she gave him a soft smile.</p>
<p class="TX">“Let’s cry out in a loud voice at least—for I will make of you my bride.”</p>
<div class="LI_SB1"/>
<p class="TX1">“Wh-what’s going on<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? That hand<span class="ellipse">…</span> Are you sure it was Madam Witch’s?” Hizumi asked in confusion.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri, sitting beside her, stroked her chin as she narrowed her eyes in thought. “Yes, there’s no doubt about it. You could tell from her atmosphere. That was definitely Madam Witch,” she said confidently.</p>
<p class="TX">“I—I see<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Hizumi responded with trepidation.</p>
<p class="TX">The students sitting around them nodded along, reassured by Ruri’s strong conviction. <span class="ITAL">If Fuyajoh thinks so, it must have been her</span>, their expressions all but declared.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Um, so Kuga was lured backstage by Madam Witch<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. Knowing Madam Witch, she must have had some profound reason,” Ruri continued, when—</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> Aaaaaaaahhhhh!!!” Mushiki cried out loud enough for everyone in the audience to clearly hear him.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 111. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_111" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! Eh?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri’s eyes shot open at this unexpected reaction.</p>
<p class="TX">It wasn’t long before the buzzer sounded to announce the end of Saika’s five minutes, and an exhausted-looking Mushiki staggered back onstage.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“M-Mukkie. Are you all right? What happened back there</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_questionmark">…</span><span class="ITAL">?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>A hundred percent<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Saika wins<span class="ellipse">…</span> A hundred percent<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he murmured before collapsing with an audible thud.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Ah!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki woke up with a start, suddenly lurching upright from the floor.</p>
<p class="TX">It looked like he had lost consciousness for a moment. Glancing around, he recognized that he was onstage in the multipurpose hall.</p>
<p class="TX">With that realization, it all came flooding back to him. He was supposed to be judging a competition between Saika and Clara.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Are you okay, Mukkie?</span>” Silvelle asked worriedly.</p>
<p class="TX">He placed a hand on his forehead. “I’m all right<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he answered. “How long was I out for?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Only around a minute</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">But we were worried. What happened?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“What happened<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">He suddenly frowned, his thoughts going in circles<span class="ellipse">…</span> He couldn’t help but feel that <span class="ITAL">something incredible</span> had taken place, but he couldn’t quite remember what.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ugh, my head<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Oh, don’t overdo it, Mukkie. Anyway, you said the second round also goes to Saachie, right?</span>” Silvelle asked, hurrying him along.</p>
<p class="TX">Come to think of it, he did recall having declared Saika the winner. He gave a weak nod.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 112. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_112" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In short, Saika had won two of the three rounds—in other words, she had won the match.</p>
<p class="TX">But just as he was about to clench his fist in triumph—</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“That’s our Saachie! She’s snatched victory yet again, winning another two points! But! The match isn’t over yet! The winner of the third round</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">will be awarded a full hundred points!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Huh?! Why?!” he stammered, taken aback by this nonsensical allocation of points.</p>
<p class="TX">Silvelle, however, tilted her head as though she didn’t quite understand the question. <span class="ITAL">“Eh? Why what?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“No, it’s just, Saika already won two out of three<span class="ellipse">…</span>” But he stopped himself there.</p>
<p class="TX">Silvelle’s earlier explanation resounded in the back of his mind: <span class="ITAL">Once we reach the end, the entrant with the most points will be declared the winner.</span></p>
<p class="TX">Yes. She hadn’t said that the winner would be whoever won the most rounds, nor did she actually specify how many points would be awarded each time.</p>
<p class="TX">“But that’s<span class="ellipse">…</span>not<span class="ellipse">…</span> Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he murmured, feeling threatened by this odd revelation.</p>
<p class="TX">“Phew<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Clara, however, let out a sigh of relief. “Ah, I totally thought I was done for. Lucky! I’m gonna wager everything on the third round!” she declared to the audience’s roaring cheers.</p>
<p class="TX">It looked like there were a few individuals who felt uncomfortable with the dubious rules, but their misgivings were drowned out by the excitement of those around them.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki glanced toward Kuroe, his gaze all but asking what he should do now.</p>
<p class="TX">She looked away, letting out a weak sigh. “I do agree it’s somewhat unfair, but Silvelle has decided the rules, so we don’t have any other choice but to play along.”</p>
<p class="TX">Then, after a short pause, she added, “No matter how many rounds it takes, Saika will never allow herself to be defeated.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 113. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_113" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The audience, overhearing this, only grew even more heated.</p>
<p class="TX">Clara gave a soft whistle. “Wow<span class="ellipse">…</span> You sound so cool saying that. Almost like Madam Witch herself.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m honored,” Kuroe responded coldly.</p>
<p class="TX">A poised comeback after being caught off guard. Mushiki would have expected no less of her.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Well, if she was willing to go along with this, then he had no right to complain. In the first place, he was currently in his own body, not Saika’s.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Isn’t Madam Witch coming back?” Clara asked, glancing over her shoulder to the back of the stage.</p>
<p class="TX">“She had to go save the world again,” Kuroe responded without the slightest hint of unease.</p>
<p class="TX">“Seriously? The world’s always in danger, huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki couldn’t tell whether she had actually accepted this hollow excuse. No one else but Saika would have been able to get away with such a paper-thin pretext.</p>
<p class="TX">Perhaps hoping not to prolong this discussion, Kuroe turned to Silvelle. “So she won’t mind if we move on. Silvelle—Sis. What <span class="ITAL">is</span> the final round?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Right!”</span> The AI beamed, positively overflowing with energy. <span class="ITAL">“The third round</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">is the power to protect those who matter most to you in times of crisis!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Those who matter most to you<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Kuroe repeated.</p>
<p class="TX">“Power<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Clara echoed in turn.</p>
<p class="TX">Silvelle gave the two a firm nod as she spread her arms wide. <span class="ITAL">“Yes. Funnily enough, both Saachie and Clarin are taking part in tomorrow’s exhibition match. We’ll decide the outcome of this competition there. The winner will be the one whose school comes out on top!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Huh?</span>” echoed a mix of voices in perfect unison. <span class="ITAL">“Whaaat?!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">It wasn’t just Mushiki and Clara—the entire hall cried out in mutual shock.</p>
<p class="TX">But that was to be expected.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 114. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_114" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Of course, they might end up inviting considerable criticism, using the exhibition match to settle a personal dispute.</p>
<p class="TX">But on the other hand, the entire affair had already descended into little more than a tenuous excuse to challenge Saika Kuozaki’s proficiency in magic.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Heh-heh.”</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless—</p>
<p class="TX">Clara didn’t seem the slightest bit flustered or concerned, her lips curling into a faint smile.</p>
<p class="TX">“Clara<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he tried calling out uncertainly.</p>
<p class="TX">“No, I’m fine,” she answered with a wave of her hands. “There’s nothing wrong with me. It’s just<span class="ellipse">…</span> I mean, can this kind of thing actually happen?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? What do you mean?” he asked with a confused grimace.</p>
<p class="TX">“I mean, you know,” she said with a deep nod. “I don’t think I’d really stand much chance against Madam Witch in a <span class="ITAL">real</span> fight. But tomorrow’s match is gonna be different. Her participation is conditional, and we’ve got our <span class="ITAL">new students</span> to lend a hand. And most of all<span class="ellipse">…</span>” She paused, raising her right hand overhead.</p>
<p class="TX">With that, her flying cell phone fell straight into her palm, as though sucked from the air. Then—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!” Mushiki gawked in disbelief.</p>
<p class="TX">The magical energy emanating from her body suddenly swelled, rising sharply in intensity.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, Madam Witch. Thanks to you, I’ve got more viewers now than ever before. This live stream of us duking it out over Mushipi—well, I would have been shocked if it <span class="ITAL">hadn’t</span> taken off. Still, if I’m being honest, this is even better than I was expecting.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Clara? Your magical energy, it’s<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Mushiki began.</p>
<p class="TX">She broke into a grin. “Yep. There’s no need to hide it anymore. Clara here knows a little something called Influenster—a technique that keeps on increasing my strength and power as more people take an interest in me. And you know what? I’ve never been more popular!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 115. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_115" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>In other words, you challenged Lady Saika just to live stream this whole affair and boost your own strength?” Kuroe asked, her gaze piercingly cold.</p>
<p class="TX">Clara shook her head. “Don’t get me wrong, I really am head over heels for Mushipi, you know? I’m not about to give him up—heck, I’m completely serious about this! But you see, the thing is, I’m still a student at the Tower, right? What was the saying? If I can power up <span class="ITAL">and</span> beat the Garden at the same time, it’ll be killing two birds with one stone? Or is it running after two hares?”</p>
<p class="TX">She paused there, holding her phone from above as she positioned herself in the camera frame.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes—she was taking a selfie.</p>
<p class="TX">“So thanks to Madam Witch, I’m ready to go! Claramates, tomorrow’s exhibition match is gonna be a must-see event!” she said with a wink.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, turning her gaze to Mushiki and flashing him a mysterious smile, she added, “It’s time to go witch hunting!”</p>
