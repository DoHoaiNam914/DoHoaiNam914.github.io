<p class="COTX">Hiya there! It’s Koushi Channel Time!</p>
<p class="TX">So there we have it, Volume 2 of <span class="ITAL">King’s Proposal: The Crested Ibis Demon</span>. How was it? I hope you enjoyed it.</p>
<p class="TX">We have another wonderful piece of cover artwork this time around. Yep<span class="ellipse">…</span>a pretty incredible character design. I thought it would be a bit bold to use a new character who’s making her first appearance, but being miserly doesn’t do anyone any favors, and she <span class="ITAL">is</span> one of my favorites, so we decided to introduce her front and center on the cover.</p>
<p class="TX">By the way, her name is Clara Tokishima. I know what you’re thinking—<span class="ITAL">Really?</span></p>
<p class="TX">I like to put little hints in my character’s names, like how Saika’s is written with the kanji <span class="ITAL">sai</span> for <span class="ITAL">multicolored</span> and <span class="ITAL">ka</span> for <span class="ITAL">calamity</span> or <span class="ITAL">disaster</span>. In the same way, Clara’s is composed of <span class="ITAL">kura</span> for <span class="ITAL">devour</span> and <span class="ITAL">ra</span> for <span class="ITAL">good</span>, and the <span class="ITAL">toki</span> in her last name means “crested ibis.” You could probably say these kinds of names only really work for fictional characters. That being said, if they’re too unique, they can end up leaving too strong an impression, so I try to keep them relatively simple when possible.</p>
<p class="TX">One example of a slightly peculiar pronunciation would probably be Kuroe’s name, written with the characters <span class="ITAL">kuro</span> for <span class="ITAL">black</span> and <span class="ITAL">e</span> for <span aria-label=" Page 204. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_204" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="ITAL">garment</span>. It seemed natural to me, as the author, that this is supposed to be pronounced similar to the French name <span class="ITAL">Chloe</span>, but I wonder if the written form fully conveys that to readers<span class="ellipse">…</span> In any event, I’m making a note of it here.</p>

<p class="TX">Once again, many people have helped bring this title to publication.</p>
<p class="TX">To my illustrator, Tsunako. Thank you as always for your superb illustrations. I’m sure Clara was a more difficult character to draw than most, but you pulled it off with incredible results. Hats off to your ability to bring her to life.</p>
<p class="TX">To the designer, Kusano. You’ve produced another cool cover this time around. Given how we had a huge number one on the cover of the first volume, I can breathe a sigh of relief now that the second book is out, too.</p>
<p class="TX">To my editor, I’m indebted to you as always. I’ll make steadier progress next time, I promise<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! (My resolution is as firm as that of the Four Heavenly Kings who serve Almighty <span class="accent-S">Ś</span>akra!)</p>
<p class="TX">To all those in the editorial staff and involved in sales, publishing, and distribution, along with everyone who picked up this book and gave it a chance, I’m so grateful that I could offer you all bouquets of flowers.</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">Let’s talk again in the third volume of <span class="ITAL">King’s Proposal</span>.</p>
