<p class="COTX">Hey there! And we’re back—it’s Clara Channel Time!</p>
<p class="TX">Are you having a <span class="ITAL">ca-razy</span> day, my Claramates?</p>
<div class="LI_SB"/>
<p class="TX">So that’s how it is. We’re streaming at a different time than usual today. But you know how it is with your good friend Clara, don’cha? These things are bound to happen.</p>
<p class="TX">And thank you for all your comments.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Hmm? What’s with all the close-ups of my face? Ah, did you notice?</p>
<p class="TX">Well, you know, I’m not actually wearing anything from the neck down. If you wanted a full-body pic, I’d have to blur the bits out, or I’d be banned on the spot, no questions asked.</p>
<p class="TX">Oh? You don’t believe me?</p>
<p class="TX">How’s this, then? Check out my shoulder! Totally bare, see?</p>
<p class="TX">Huh? Maybe I’m wearing a tube top?</p>
<p class="TX">I told you: I’m not! Fine, then. I’ll go as far as I can.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>See! Any more and I’ll be in trouble!</p>
<p class="TX">It <span class="ITAL">is</span> safe to show this much, right<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?</p>
<p class="TX">Whoa, the chat’s full of horn dogs today, huh?</p>
<div class="LI_SB"/>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 2. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_2" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Well, that doesn’t really bother me that much. Don’t make me start going on a tangent, ’kay?</p>
<p class="TX">So let’s move on to today’s topic.</p>
<p class="TX">Yep, my dreams for the future.</p>
<p class="TX">You know, as a young woman in our modern world, I think we all ought to have a goal to keep working toward.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Hmm? You don’t think I’m being serious here? You can’t trust someone who’s nude? Hurry up and go back to the previous match? Shut up. What’s wrong with doing things this way every now and then?</p>
<p class="TX">This is going nowhere. Anyway, here’s your good friend Clara’s top three dreams for the future!</p>
<p class="TX">Number three! To get more subscribers for my channel!</p>
<p class="TX">Number two! To fall in love with a guy and become a couple!</p>
<p class="TX">And number one<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
