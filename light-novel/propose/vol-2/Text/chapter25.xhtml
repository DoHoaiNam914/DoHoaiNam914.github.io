<p class="COTX">“Ruri, are you okay?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Yes. I don’t know how, though.”</p>
<p class="TX">Shortly after Saika’s fourth substantiation engulfed everything and vanquished Clara, Mushiki ran over to Ruri, in a corner of the basement.</p>
<p class="TX">Incidentally, he had returned to his Mushiki mode. Perhaps there was something irregular about absorbing magical energy from anyone other than Kuroe, as no sooner had he deactivated his fourth substantiation than he reverted to his original form. Surely it couldn’t be only Saika’s body that most excited him<span class="ellipse">…</span> Right?</p>
<p class="TX">In any event, now that the sealed area had been returned to normal, the only figures present were Clara, who was lying on the ground battered and bruised, Ruri, and him. Given that Clara had an Immortal’s body, she couldn’t be dead and had no doubt merely lost consciousness. Nonetheless, it would be best to restrain her while they still could.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Ruri’s expression showed deep regret. “Kuroe<span class="ellipse">…</span> If I<span class="ellipse">…</span> If I had only been in top condition<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>It’s not your fault, Ruri. Don’t blame yourself,” Mushiki said, trying to console her.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 194. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_194" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“But I—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Did you call me?”</p>
<p class="TX">But before she could finish her sentence, Kuroe poked her head out from behind Mushiki.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-whaaat?!” Ruri cried out in alarm.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe, however, seemed utterly unperturbed, tilting her head quizzically. “Oh, are you all right, Knight Fuyajoh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“H-h-how are you still alive?! N-no way, don’t tell me you’re an Immortal, too<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Who are you calling an Immortal?” she responded with a slight pout.</p>
<p class="TX">Of course she wasn’t. Standing before them now was a fresh homunculus that her soul had just been transferred into. Her clothes were covered in bloodstains, but her skin seemed unmarred. The fallen artificial body must have been recovered somehow or hidden away in the shadows.</p>
<p class="TX">But Ruri, unaware of all this, pointed a finger at Kuroe in panic.</p>
<p class="TX">“But you were one hundred percent dead! Didn’t that spear go right through your chest?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“You were busy fighting, so you must have misread the situation. The wound wasn’t particularly deep, in fact.”</p>
<p class="TX">“R-really<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri still looked suspicious, but given that Kuroe herself seemed so full of life, she must have decided to take that explanation as the truth. A moment later, she accepted the other young woman’s proffered hand as she rose to her feet.</p>
<p class="TX">After helping her up, Kuroe gave Mushiki and Ruri a short nod.</p>
<p class="TX">“More importantly, you did well today, Knight Fuyajoh. You too, Mushiki. It’s no overstatement to say that the Garden was saved through your efforts.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>You’re exaggerating. Clara had us at her mercy the whole time. If Madam Witch hadn’t shown up at the end<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Ruri paused there, frowning as though suddenly remembering something, before turning her gaze to Mushiki.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 195. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_195" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> No. It’s nothing. But where did Madam Witch go? I was surrounded by skeletons, so I couldn’t see clearly<span class="ellipse">…</span> But that fourth substantiation <span class="ITAL">was</span> hers, right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> Yeah. She must have had something else to see to after neutralizing Clara,” Mushiki lied.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri knit her brows. “So she showed up at the last minute, infiltrated Clara’s fourth substantiation from the outside, defeated her in the blink of an eye, and then left without even saying anything?”</p>
<p class="TX">“W-well<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">He had to admit, it did all seem a little too good to be true. He felt himself breaking out into a nervous sweat, when—</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s just too cool<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri held Saika in high regard, and that must have been enough to blow away any sense of incongruity or discomfort she felt. Mushiki, still slightly on edge, breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri likewise let out a light exhale as she regained her composure, before turning to face him. “I’m glad you’re all right<span class="ellipse">…</span> Really, when Kuroe got hurt, I was at a complete loss<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">She paused, her cheeks turning bright red.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri? What’s wrong? Your face<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“N-no, it’s nothing<span class="ellipse">…</span> Um, it’s just when Kuroe collapsed, I<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, his shoulders trembled as he suddenly recalled what happened.</p>
<p class="TX">Right. He had asked Ruri to kiss him, though she hadn’t granted that request.</p>
<p class="TX">As soon as he remembered this, Mushiki fell to his knees, propped his hands on the ground, and bowed as deeply as he could.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m sorry!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Eh<span class="ellipse">…</span> Eh?!”</p>
<p class="TX">The sudden apology must have taken her by surprise as Ruri <span aria-label=" Page 196. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_196" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>practically flinched in response. Mushiki, however, paid that no heed and remained prostrate before her.</p>
<p class="TX">“It couldn’t be helped at the time<span class="ellipse">…</span> But I’m still really sorry for saying that, without considering your thoughts, Ruri.”</p>
<p class="TX">“You don’t need to apologize<span class="ellipse">…</span> But it’s not like I don’t understand your feelings or anything<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” she answered.</p>
<p class="TX">During the course of this exchange, a chime sounded as the elevator arrived.</p>
<p class="TX">After a short moment, Erulka, still straddling one of her summoned wolves, appeared through the doors. She herself must have been involved in some fierce battle, as the hem of her lab coat was scorched black.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm, it looks like you’ve both had a hard time of it, too. But you must have managed to work it out.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ms. Erulka<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri pulled herself together to stand up straight as their visitor approached.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m glad to see you’re safe. What happened to Headmaster Shionji?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I managed to restrain him, so others can keep him under tabs for now. We’ve detained the students from the Tower, too, for the most part, and physically cut Silvelle’s servers off from the network<span class="ellipse">…</span> I’m not looking forward to evaluating the damage, though,” Erulka said as her gaze fell on Clara farther inside the sealed area. “Oh? Was she the mastermind behind all this?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes<span class="ellipse">…</span> She seems to have fused herself with the mythic-class annihilation factor, the Ouroboros<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Why in the world would she do something so stupid? The fool,” Erulka said with a grimace as she stepped down from the wolf’s back and approached the fallen Clara.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, as she reached out to touch her—her eyebrows twitched.</p>
<p class="TX">“What on earth<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Is something wrong?” Mushiki asked.</p>
<p class="TX">Erulka grabbed Clara by her clothing to turn her over and laid her on her back.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 197. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_197" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Then, placing a hand on her neck, she said with a shudder, “She’s dead.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Eh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">Both Mushiki and Ruri widened their eyes and stared in shock.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">Outside the grounds of Void’s Garden, a strange <span class="ITAL">something</span> was crawling through a deserted field.</p>
<p class="TX">It was a gelatinous object with an eyeball-like sphere fixed in its center—it couldn’t have been any bigger than twenty centimeters in length.</p>
<p class="TX">Eventually, the creature came to a stop at a certain place, its body quivering as it spat out the eyeball.</p>
<p class="TX">A brief moment later, the surface of the eyeball began to bubble and swell as it rapidly expanded in size.</p>
<p class="TX">An optic nerve began to sprout from the back of the orb, new flesh came into being, blood flowed, and bones took shape—then smooth skin formed, from which hair began to sprout.</p>
<p class="TX">Within a few minutes, a girl was born—without so much as a thread of clothing.</p>
<p class="TX">No. Not <span class="ITAL">born</span>. Perhaps <span class="ITAL">reborn</span> would be a more appropriate term.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes. Having anticipated defeat, Clara had entrusted a part of herself to a piece of slime that she let escape from the Garden.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Phew<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Now back in human form, she threw herself down on the ground, stretching her arms and legs as she let out a deep breath.</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s Saika Kuozaki for you. I guess I’ll need more than the head and heart to beat her, huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">This was a clear admission of defeat—and yet there wasn’t the slightest hint of disappointment or pessimism in her voice.</p>
<p class="TX">But why should there be? After all, she had already achieved her initial objectives.</p>
<p class="TX">The first was to send Immortals into the Garden so she could capitalize on the chaos to seize the Ouroboros’s heart.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 198. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_198" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The second was to use the Garden’s administrative AI to obtain information on the whereabouts of the remaining twenty-two pieces.</p>
<p class="TX">And the third—</p>
<p class="TX">“Welp, this harvest produced a good yield, all right<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Her lips twisted into a grin as she sat up and brought her hand to her face to whistle through her fingers.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, as though summoned, a winged smartphone flew down before her.</p>
<p class="TX">“Now, then<span class="ellipse">…</span> Everyone in the Garden probably knows all about me by now<span class="ellipse">…</span> I s’pose I might as well go with something flashy then, huh? I <span class="ITAL">am</span> naked, though<span class="ellipse">…</span> Heh, I guess I can just shoot from the shoulders up. Let’s treat this as fan service!”</p>
<p class="TX">Flicking through the screen on her smartphone, she started a fresh MagiTube live stream.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hiya there! And we’re back—it’s Clara Channel Time!</p>
<p class="TX">“Are you having a <span class="ITAL">ca-razy</span> day, my Claramates?</p>
<p class="TX">“So that’s how it is. We’re streaming at a different time than usual today. But you know how it is with your good friend Clara, right? These things are bound to happen.”</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1"><span class="ITAL">“This is getting nowhere. Anyway, here’s your good friend Clara’s top three dreams for the future!</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Number three! To get more subscribers for my channel!</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Number two! To fall in love with a guy and become a couple!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">With unbelieving eyes, Mushiki found himself watching a certain MagiTube live stream.</p>
<p class="TX">Already taken aback by news of Clara’s death, he was now even more stunned to hear from the grapevine that she was presently airing a new live video.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“And number one</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 199. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_199" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She was naked, bursting with excitement, and flashing a venomous smile at the camera.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“To collect all the remaining pieces of my body, crush that witch from the Garden, and get my hands on a new world!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki and everyone around him suddenly frowned at this abrupt declaration.</p>
<p class="TX">It had come out of nowhere, and the comments below the video were filled with displays of raw astonishment. Clara, her eyes moving left and right as she perused her viewers’ reactions, brought her thumb to her neck in a throat-cutting gesture.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“My name is Ouroboros—a mythical annihilation factor once defeated by your witch.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“I’m being perfectly serious. Just you wait, Mushipi. Clara here ain’t about to give you up.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“But don’t worry, I’m not about to expose you. Sharing secrets is all part of having a</span> special <span class="ITAL">type of relationship, right? Heh-heh.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“All right, that’s it for today. Clara out!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">With that, the live stream came to an abrupt end.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri sat there in stunned silence for a moment, before letting out an indignant sigh. “Always joking around. What’s her problem?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Should we take that as a declaration of war?” Kuroe wondered aloud. “We should mobilize a search team to locate her immediately. It’s too dangerous to let her run loose.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Very well<span class="ellipse">…</span> I’ll take part. You’ll need a wolf’s nose if you’re to sniff her out. Ruri should come with us, too,” Erulka said, climbing once more onto her wolf’s back.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri gave her a nod as she took a seat behind her. “Yes. I’ll be the one to—”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, we’ll treat your injuries first. What’s your current condition?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri squeezed her lips firmly shut at this order.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 200. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_200" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Erulka must have taken her silence as a sign of acceptance, as she fixed her with a nod. “Good<span class="ellipse">…</span> In that case, we’ll go on ahead. Kuroe, I’ll arrange a team to seal it away, so stay here for the time being to keep an eye on the corpse. We’re dealing with the Ouroboros, so there’s no telling what it might do.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Leave it to me<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” she replied. “I need to have a discussion with Mushiki, in any event.”</p>
<p class="TX">With that, Erulka led her wolf back the way they had entered.</p>
<div class="LI_SB1"></div>
<p class="TX1">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri was mulling over her thoughts as she clung to Erulka’s back atop her summoned wolf. How on earth did Clara manage to escape? How spineless, how cowardly could she be? And was Kuroe’s wound <span class="ITAL">really</span> nonfatal? So many stray thoughts and questions kept spinning around inside her head.</p>
<p class="TX">But one of them occupied her mind the most.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes. The moment Clara attacked Mushiki, Ruri had seen something, albeit only for the briefest of moments, behind the throng of skeletons closing in on her.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki had kissed Clara<span class="ellipse">…</span> And somehow, he looked like he’d been <span class="ITAL">replaced</span> with Saika.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Ms. Erulka<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Hmm? What is it?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>No, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed, it was simply too absurd. This could have been no more than a simple misunderstanding brought about by the commotion of Clara’s fourth substantiation unfolding. She might also just have been seeing things.</p>
<p class="TX">With a shake of her head to clear her mind, she tightened her grip around Erulka’s waist.</p>
<div class="LI_SB1"></div>
<p class="TX1"><span aria-label=" Page 201. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_201" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Mushiki.”</p>
<p class="TX">After seeing Erulka and Ruri off, he and Kuroe were left alone in the sealed area beneath the library (though strictly speaking, Clara’s corpse was still there, too).</p>
<p class="TX">“Thank you again,” Kuroe said. “You did well. I’m glad you understood my message and were able to stop her.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. But I<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">He stopped, a look of regret washing over his countenance.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe shook her head. “It wasn’t your fault that she escaped<span class="ellipse">…</span> It <span class="ITAL">is</span> alarming that she seems to have realized your secret, though. But at least she doesn’t seem intent on divulging it for the time being. So long as we catch her before she shares it with anyone, we should be okay.”</p>
<p class="TX">“No<span class="ellipse">…</span> Well, yes. I guess there’s that, too.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Kuroe tilted her head.</p>
<p class="TX">“I<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Mushiki began to say with a heavy heart, fighting to keep his hands steady. “I know it couldn’t be helped<span class="ellipse">…</span> But I kissed<span class="ellipse">…</span>another woman<span class="ellipse">…</span> Other than you<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Kuroe stared back with a look of amazement. “That’s what you were brooding over? Don’t worry about it. If you hadn’t, you wouldn’t have been able to replenish your magic. You made the right decision.”</p>
<p class="TX">“But—,” he began, only to be cut off as she gave an exasperated shrug.</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki. You said you would save both the world and me, yes? Was that promise a lie?” Kuroe asked in Saika’s voice.</p>
<p class="TX">He shrank back at these words. “<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! No, I—”</p>
<p class="TX">“The path you’ve chosen cannot be traversed without resolve and determination. If you can defeat an enemy as strong as that using no more than your lips, then why hesitate? Frankly, I’m glad you didn’t leave everything to chance at the last minute.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">He fell silent, when Kuroe continued teasingly, “Or does kissing someone else make you question your feelings for me?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Impossible,” came his immediate response.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe was startled for a moment, before letting out an amused <span aria-label=" Page 202. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_202" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>laugh. “In that case, what’s the problem? If something’s necessary, don’t hesitate. Just come back to me at the end. That’s all that matters.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Right.” He nodded, clenching his fists as he affirmed his strength of will.</p>
<p class="TX">But at that moment, a new question suddenly came to mind. By the time he knew what he was doing, he was already asking it aloud. “So that’s it<span class="ellipse">…</span> Has Saika been living her life by that rule all this time?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm?” Kuroe slightly tilted her head, watching him through expressionless—though seemingly amused—eyes. “Is that question meant to be your use of a certain right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">His eyes widened in surprise. Right, he had won the right to have her answer one question of his during their training the other day—but in the end, he had been so busy debating what he should ask that he hadn’t had a chance to use it.</p>
<p class="TX">He paused there, swallowing deeply before clearing his throat—and finally gave her a hesitant nod.</p>
<p class="TX">With a sudden jerk, Kuroe pushed Mushiki up against the wall.</p>
<p class="TX">“Eh? U-um<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“We’ll need to turn you back into Saika to clean up this whole affair, no? Let me help you undergo a state conversion.”</p>
<p class="TX">With those words, she slowly drew nearer to his face—</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>You’re the first person I’ve ever kissed.”</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">She said in a whisper just before their lips touched.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, Mushiki’s response was smothered by the touch of Kuroe’s mouth pressing against his own.</p>
