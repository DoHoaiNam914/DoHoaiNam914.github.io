<p class="COTX">“What the<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">A barrier wall encircled Void’s Garden to separate the school from the outside world—and Mushiki, alongside countless other mages, stood atop the fortification, looking down at the scene unfolding before them.</p>
<p class="TX">His voice was strained, but that was to be expected.</p>
<p class="TX">After all, the city outside the Garden was filled with countless gel-like substances.</p>
<p class="TX">No, the term <span class="ITAL">substance</span> was a misnomer, as the viscous masses crawling all over the ground and walls were living things.</p>
<p class="TX">“Annihilation Factor No. 329: Slimes.” Ruri breathed out, watching the city through narrowed eyes from atop the barrier wall.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>They’re calamity-class annihilation factors. Individually, they’re not all that powerful—the problem is when they swarm together, like they’re doing now. If left unchecked, this whole area could be consumed. The window for reversible annihilation is twenty-four hours. If we don’t deal with them all within that time, what we’re seeing now will be recorded in the history of the world as the <span class="ITAL">result</span>.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 42. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_42" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She sounded strangely like she was trying to explain the situation, prompting Mushiki to tilt his head as he looked at her askance.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Huh? Are you saying all that for me?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huuuh?! Wh-wh-what?! A-a-are you an idiot?! It’s just a habit I’ve got! Stop thinking everything’s always about you!” she cried with a threatening air.</p>
<p class="TX">“R-right. Sorry<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">She was saying things that any mage ought to know, so he had wondered whether she was trying to help him out, seeing how he had only just recently entered the Garden<span class="ellipse">…</span> But it looked like he had been overthinking it. Still, that was an incredible habit of hers, he thought with a nod.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri puffed out her cheeks. “Anyway, why were <span class="ITAL">you</span> called up to help deal with them?! Isn’t <span class="ITAL">that</span> weird?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“You don’t need to tell me<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he murmured nervously as he scratched at his cheek.</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed. Probably on account of the large number of annihilation factors this time around, a full thirty students had been selected to eradicate them—and for some reason, his name was listed among them. Which meant this was essentially his first official mission.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri must have realized that, too. She clicked her tongue in displeasure and stepped boldly forward, the epaulets on her uniform flapping in the wind.</p>
<p class="TX">“Anyway. Just shut up and watch. We’ll come back to this conversation when I’m finished<span class="ellipse">…</span> Ruri Fuyajoh, heading out!”</p>
<p class="TX">With that, she took off from the top of the barrier wall with a mighty leap.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, her feet lit up with magical light as she stepped over the edge—her body defying gravity as it traced a gentle arc and descended into the city.</p>
<p class="TX">“Second Substantiation: Luminous Blade!”</p>
<p class="TX">A clear voice echoed, and though she was already a speck in the distance, a blue light erupted by her side.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 43. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_43" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>That ever-changing blade forged of pure magic traced a path through the air like a supple whip or the tail of a raging beast—and as it did so, countless slimes slithering around her vanished in bright bursts of light.</p>
<p class="TX">“Whoa<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">Such was the overwhelming figure of Ruri Fuyajoh, the Garden’s most powerful knight.</p>
<p class="TX">Her actions were uplifting enough to inspire the other mages lined up on the barrier wall, several of whom promptly leaped down after her.</p>
<p class="TX">While not quite at her level, they were all highly capable in their own right, and they set about steadily defeating the milling annihilation factors.</p>
<p class="TX">As Ruri had said, they probably would be able to take care of all this even without Mushiki’s help.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">Feeling a strange gaze watching him from behind, he spun around.</p>
<p class="TX">Some of the remaining mages were whispering among themselves as they watched him guardedly.</p>
<p class="TX">“Is <span class="ITAL">he</span> the guy everyone’s talking about? Mushiki Kuga<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah. You know Ruri Fuyajoh, the S-ranked mage? He’s her elder brother, and after just one month of transferring into the Garden, he got picked for the exhibition match<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“I heard he defeated a mythic-class annihilation factor all by himself<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“You’re kidding! Just what kind of magic is he using<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Heh<span class="ellipse">…</span> Let’s see how he does<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Why did it feel like the weight of expectation was bearing down on him?</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">He wasn’t about to let himself get dragged into a dangerous situation just because of a little gossip, but he couldn’t just watch idly from the sidelines after having been selected as part of the team to put down the monsters.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 44. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_44" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Of course, he couldn’t endanger Saika’s body, either—but being a mage himself, he would inevitably be called to an actual battle sooner or later.</p>
<p class="TX">As he made his decision—fists clenched and stepping forward—he heard shocked gasps behind him.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">But he came to a stop at the edge of the barrier wall. The city was much farther down than he had thought.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri and the others had focused their magic into their legs to soften the fall, but to be perfectly honest, he wasn’t confident enough to pull that off just yet. If he wasn’t careful, he might not even manage to land the jump properly.</p>
<p class="TX">“All right.”</p>
<p class="TX">So long as he was inhabiting Saika’s body, he couldn’t overdo it. He nodded as he made up his mind and headed for the staircase.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? He’s taking the stairs?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t tell me he was too afraid to jump<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Are you kidding? That guy took down a Mythologia. He’s gotta have some reason for doing this<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“L-let’s go with him!”</p>
<p class="TX">With that buzz of excitement at his back, Mushiki reached the bottom and ran through the gate into the city—the remaining mages following behind him.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">He found himself catching his breath at the sight of the cityscape stretching out ahead.</p>
<p class="TX">Seen from the ground, the peculiarity of the situation was even more readily apparent.</p>
<p class="TX">Strange gooey creatures were swarming all over the familiar city streets. Maybe the people had escaped indoors, or perhaps they had all been absorbed by the slimes, but there was no sign of human activity—as if the position of the dominant species at this locale had just been completely usurped.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 45. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_45" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="ITAL">“—”</span></p>
<p class="TX">The slimes had clearly noticed them, as no sooner had Mushiki and the others stepped outside the Garden than they stirred in alarm.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh! Here goes!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Argh!”</p>
<p class="TX">The mages, too, must have sensed the slimes’ heightened caution, as they each called out, readying themselves and activating their world crests and second substantiations.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“—!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">The slimes launched into their assault all at once.</p>
<p class="TX">In the blink of an eye, the area was transformed into a mage’s battlefield.</p>
<p class="TX">The slimes with their huge bodies expanded more, colliding with the mages’ second substantiations as chaos ensued.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, late to the party, focused on attempting to manifest his sword.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>But that sword, his second substantiation that he had activated so easily during his training with Kuroe, didn’t appear.</p>
<p class="TX">“This<span class="ellipse">…</span>isn’t right<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“—!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">As he turned around, a slime leaped up to engulf him from above.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-what<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">He dived to the ground, rolling to dodge the attack, while the slime crashed down right where he had been standing.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ow-w-w<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">He was still reeling from the impact and rubbed the ache from his head.</p>
<p class="TX">But he understood well enough that this was no place to dawdle.</p>
<p class="TX">All at once, the area around him turned suddenly dark.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>As though a huge <span class="ITAL">something</span> had blocked out the sun.</p>
<p class="TX">“Eh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">Stunned, he glanced upward.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 46. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_46" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Countless slimes were coalescing right before his eyes, eventually forming a towering silhouette.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?” he rasped, when—</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“—!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">The huge slime let out a deafening high-pitched roar, its body expanding as it spread out like a tidal wave.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki was so shocked that he could do little but accept the oncoming attack.</p>
<p class="TX">Yet—</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, that won’t do! I won’t have any of that!” said an echoing voice.</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, in the shape of a cross, the slime’s gigantic body was sliced clean.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“—?!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">The huge annihilation factor let out a shrill shriek, then collapsed into a mass of liquid.</p>
<p class="TX">It spread over the ground, before finally stopping motionless.</p>
<p class="TX">“Eh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">Unable to comprehend what had just happened, he simply blinked repeatedly in mute shock.</p>
<p class="TX">Then a young girl gently landed right where the massive slime had been a short moment ago.</p>
<p class="TX">“I got here in the nick of time, huh? Are you okay?”</p>
<p class="TX">“You<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s eyes bulged from his head as he recognized the individual standing before him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Tokishima?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Yep. Standing before him was none other than Clara Tokishima, who was gripping a dangerous chainsaw-like weapon with her heart-shaped world crest activated around her lower abdomen.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hiya! Just call me Clara!” she said, twisting her body and turning her gaze upward.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki followed suit—and found what appeared to be a winged smartphone floating in midair.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 47. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_47" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“So I decided to butt into this annihilation factor mission! If you’re enjoying the show, hit the <small>LIKE</small> button and subscribe to my channel!” She paused to pose before the camera.</p>
<p class="TX">“A-are you<span class="ellipse">…</span>filming this?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm, more like streaming, I guess? I mean, think of the number of viewers you’d get streaming an annihilation factor takedown mission!”</p>
<p class="TX">“R-right<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">So that last scene, in which he had been helplessly overwhelmed, had also been broadcasted to the world? He did his best not to dwell too much on that thought, at least for the time being.</p>
<p class="TX">He would be lying if he said he wasn’t embarrassed, but he couldn’t complain to the very person who had just saved his life.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, I’m glad you’re safe! Can you stand?” Clara asked, approaching with light steps as she reached out to him with a helping hand.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> Yeah. Thanks.”</p>
<p class="TX">He took her hand in his own and climbed to his feet.</p>
<p class="TX">Then Clara pointed back to the smartphone still hovering in the air.</p>
<p class="TX">“Now, look up here! Give us a radiant, winning smile!”</p>
<p class="TX">“U-um<span class="ellipse">…</span> Okay.”</p>
<p class="TX">If she was acting the part of a hero who had just rushed in to save a helpless civilian, it somewhat made sense that she would want to take a picture.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Well, he couldn’t exactly say that wasn’t how it had all played out, though. So as instructed, he forced a smile as he glanced up at the camera.</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, Clara wrapped her arm around his shoulder and pulled him close.</p>
<p class="TX">And then—</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">“Hee-hee-hee. It’s time for an introduction! This is Mushiki Kuga! My new boyfriend!”</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Huh?!”</p>
<p class="TX">How could she blurt out something so ridiculous to the entire world?!</p>
