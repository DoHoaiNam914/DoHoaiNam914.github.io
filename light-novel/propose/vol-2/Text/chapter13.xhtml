<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 91. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_91" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“Whaaat? Then that means<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Yes. Clara’s brimming with confidence. She might actually be a decent cook.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hee-hee-hee<span class="ellipse">…</span> Bwah-ha-ha-ha!”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri’s apprehension was plain to see—but across the aisle, Shionji let out a raucous guffaw.</p>
<p class="TX">“I see, I see. I didn’t realize the Garden had such a glaring weakness. Shall we see her defeated as a prelude to tomorrow’s battle, then?” he scoffed, already seemingly assured of victory.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Ruri pulled a bitter face.</p>
<p class="TX">But at that moment—</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Oh, Saachie is getting to work. Look how steady her hand is. She’s peeling the potatoes, cutting them into quarters</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">and she hasn’t forgotten to bevel the edges, either! It’s a small detail but one that makes all the difference in the finished product!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Shionji’s smile froze over as Silvelle’s commentary echoed throughout the room.</p>
<p class="TX">“Eh?” Ruri stared agape.</p>
<p class="TX">Next, it was Clara’s voice that rang out. “Hmm<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? You look like you know what you’re doing, Madam Witch! But Clara here isn’t about to throw in the towel! It’s time for my secret technique—Yamata no Orochi!” she said, crossing her arms in front of her face.</p>
<p class="TX">Bottles of various spices and seasonings were sandwiched between each of her fingers, numbering eight in total. The powders danced through the air in line with her movements.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ugh<span class="ellipse">…</span> A-a-achoo!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Oooh, Clarin, isn’t that a little much? But it’s so cute, acting a little careless like that! You’ve earned cute little sister points!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">Clara’s sneeze followed by Silvelle’s play-by-play had the audience roaring with laughter.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Um<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 92. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_92" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Her eyebrows raised, Ruri glanced at Shionji, only to see him holding his head in his hands as he leaned forward in his chair.</p>
<p class="TX">Pretending not to have noticed, she turned back to the stage with a grin.</p>
<p class="TX">“Well<span class="ellipse">…</span> She seems okay. Madam Witch really is cooking like a normal person,” Hizumi murmured with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri, however, stroked her chin with a serious look. “Yes<span class="ellipse">…</span> This is a lucky miscalculation. But there’s still at least one big problem.”</p>
<p class="TX">“A-a big problem<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? What do you mean<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Hizumi asked, catching her breath.</p>
<p class="TX">“There are two ways to make sense of this. Either she’s a perfect Madam Witch who’s actually good at cooking<span class="ellipse">…</span>or she’s a hardworking Madam Witch who has been practicing her cooking in secret<span class="ellipse">…</span> And both options are endearing in their own way<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” she said in all honesty.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>You know, I envy your way of thinking sometimes,” Hizumi muttered weakly.</p>
<div class="LI_SB1"/>
<p class="TX1">“Okay, it’s finished,” Mushiki called out.</p>
<p class="TX">“We’re done over here, too!” Clara added.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, a buzzer sounded to announce the end of the first round.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Good work, Saachie, Clarin. I was moved to tears watching my two little sisters working so hard</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">Now then, let’s bring in the judge before the food gets cold. Mukkie?</span>” Silvelle called out.</p>
<p class="TX">Naturally, there was no way Mushiki could answer her.</p>
<p class="TX">And so he pulled his cell phone from his pocket and pressed it against his ear.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hello<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Hmm, I see. Got it. I’ll be right there.”</p>
<p class="TX">With that little charade out of the way, he turned to Silvelle and Clara.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 93. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_93" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“I’m sorry, but there’s some business I need to attend to. I’ll be right back, so please start judging the dishes.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Business? Did something happen?” Clara inquired.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah yes. Apparently the world will be in terrible danger if I don’t act.”</p>
<p class="TX">“That sounds pretty serious!” Clara exclaimed with shock.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki waved his hands to reassure her. “Yes, it’s a <span class="ITAL">very</span> serious situation. It might take me<span class="ellipse">…</span>around twenty minutes to resolve<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Besides, I’m sure Mushiki will be more comfortable sharing his thoughts without me breathing down his neck,” he added as a joke.</p>
<p class="TX">Clara, clearly on edge, whistled as she let out her breath. “Huh<span class="ellipse">…</span> Why do you hafta be so cool?”</p>
<p class="TX">He had simply meant to give a plausible excuse, but Clara seemed to have taken it as a provocation. He just hoped it wouldn’t sound strange if Saika left the hall.</p>
<p class="TX">“In that case, I’ll be back soon<span class="ellipse">…</span> Kuroe, would you come with me?” he called after her.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="TX">With that, the two of them made their way backstage.</p>
<p class="TX">A few seconds later—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki Kuga, in his original form, followed Kuroe nervously back the way that they had come.</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed. Within a minute of approaching the secluded space behind the stage, he had forcefully undergone a state conversion from his Saika mode to his Mushiki one.</p>
<p class="TX">It had happened so fast that he felt a little embarrassed.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Still, he did think Kuroe’s actions were somewhat underhanded, pushing him up against the wall and whispering in his ear, “I’ll teach you how to wear a bra.” There was no way he could possibly resist such an assault. If this had been a formal competition, that would have been a clear breach of the rules. He would have to request a video recording to keep as evidence.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 94. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_94" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“Mushipiii! I’ve been waiting for you! Did you see how brave your Clara was?”</p>
<p class="TX">The moment he showed himself onstage, Clara blew him a kiss. He forced a smile as he waved back.</p>
<p class="TX">The audience was booing him at the top of their lungs, but he just didn’t care anymore. If anything, he was more terrified of Ruri, shooting him a murderous glare from the front row.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Now, Mukkie, please take a seat here,</span>” Silvelle said, urging him to sit down.</p>
<p class="TX">He did as instructed, taking the chair that had just appeared at the back of the kitchen set.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">It’s time to judge our two contestants. Let’s start with Saachie’s dish!</span>” the AI announced, quickly lifting her hand into the air.</p>
<p class="TX">With that signal, Kuroe stepped forward holding a tray covered with a domed silver lid.</p>
<p class="TX">“Since Lady Saika is currently absent, I’ll serve her dish in her place,” she said, placing the serving tray in front of him and removing the lid—and all the while, a dramatic drumroll reverberated through the hall. “Enjoy.”</p>
<p class="TX">As soon as the lid was removed, a spotlight shone on the tray’s contents, and the tableware seemed to sparkle.</p>
<p class="TX">Before him was his own carefully crafted serving of <span class="ITAL">nikujaga</span>, a Japanese meat-and-potato stew.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“What a surprise! It’s</span> nikujaga! <span class="ITAL">Meat and potatoes! The taste of home, of childhood, the number one item on any young man’s list of dishes he’d like a prospective girlfriend to cook for him! Saachie, what a surprisingly simple menu! Will this nostalgic taste really melt Mukkie’s heart?!”</span> Silvelle’s voice was overflowing with excitement.</p>
<p class="TX">“Um<span class="ellipse">…</span> I guess I’ll dig in.”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki put his hands together in thanks, picked up his chopsticks, and brought a helping of the stew to his mouth.</p>
<p class="TX">A gentle flavor. The rich aroma of good broth. Soft ingredients that still maintained their shape<span class="ellipse">…</span> Everything tasted just as he expected it would.</p>
<p class="TX">But that wasn’t what mattered right then.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 95. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_95" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The important thing was that this serving of <span class="ITAL">nikujaga</span> was personally prepared by Saika Kuozaki herself.</p>
<p class="TX">Of course, he might still have been the one who had selected the ingredients and done the cooking, but that was such a minor detail. The key to all this rested in the imagination. It was a simple fact that Saika’s body had put this meal together just for him—and frankly, that was enough.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ahhh<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki felt a powerful swell of emotions within his chest, and before he knew it, a warm sensation was trickling down his cheeks.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Delicious<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Delicious! There you have it! Mukkie has been moved to tears! That’s our Saachie! The world’s strongest mage is also an outstanding cook!</span>” sounded Silvelle’s invigorating voice.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wow! Madam Witch!” echoed cries from among the audience.</p>
<p class="TX">Even Kuroe, still expressionless, seemed somehow pleased. It was a cute expression.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">In response to this outpouring of adulation, Clara, not ready to give up, curled her lips. “Madam Witch<span class="ellipse">…</span> You’re not lacking as an opponent, but Clara here isn’t about to accept defeat!” she declared confidently, bravely placing her own lid-covered tray in front of him.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki held his breath.</p>
<p class="TX">He had been so focused on his own cooking that he had no idea what she had whipped together.</p>
<p class="TX">“Feast your eyes! Clara’s very own plat du jour!” she declared, pulling a pose as she removed the lid with an extravagant flourish.</p>
<p class="TX">No doubt, thanks to Silvelle’s artistic direction and special effects, the tray lit up with a brilliant glow of light.</p>
<p class="TX">Within a few seconds, his vision cleared, revealing<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>A sludgy, incomprehensible broth—or perhaps a stew<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
<p class="TX">“I-is this<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 96. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_96" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="ITAL">“Nikujaga.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Huh?!” he shouted, looking startled.</p>
<p class="TX">Clara, gauging how to respond to this reaction, crossed her arms and leaned forward. “Ah, I get it. You’re surprised. You didn’t think Madam Witch and I would compete with the same dish, right? Right? We must have been on the same wavelength, huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">That</span> wasn’t why he was so taken aback, but she was so full of confidence that he could hardly tell her the truth. He did his best to sugarcoat his words as he said, “Um<span class="ellipse">…</span> It looks very unique<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh, you noticed? I was really focusing on the <span class="ITAL">appearance</span>. It’s basically like a work of art, you know?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>What’s the theme?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Dreams</span><span class="ellipse">…</span>or something like that,” she said with a grin.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">He could feel himself breaking out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p class="TX">But why? His hands refused to move, as though some bodily instinct rejected the thought of ingesting the <span class="ITAL">substance</span> laid out before him.</p>
<p class="TX">There was no telling how Clara interpreted his inaction. Nonetheless, she put her hands together with a loud clap and then reached for the spoon.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh, Mushipi! You’re such a child! Here, open up!” she said, scooping a spoonful of the <span class="ITAL">nikujaga</span> and lifting it to his mouth.</p>
<p class="TX">The distinctive aroma of so many miscellaneous spices tickled his nasal passages.</p>
<p class="TX">To be honest, he wasn’t keen on the idea of tasting it—but if he was supposed to judge this contest, then he had no choice. His body trembling, he forced his mouth slowly open.</p>
<p class="TX">“Here goes!” Clara exclaimed brightly and, without hesitation, plunged the spoon into his mouth.</p>
<p class="TX">A strange mix, bittersweet but at the same time spicy, burned his tongue. The smell was so pungent that he almost choked.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 97. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_97" role="doc-pagebreak"/>He could tell, at some vague level, that there was a lump of meat, but he didn’t have the courage to bite into it, and so he gulped it down trying as hard as he could not to focus on the flavor.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ha<span class="ellipse">…</span> Ha<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“How is it, Mushipi?! Did you like it?!” Clara asked, her eyes sparkling.</p>
<p class="TX">His shoulders heaved as he struggled to breath. He had to use all his strength to even say the next few words.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Wins<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Saika’s<span class="ellipse">…</span>wins<span class="ellipse">…</span>” He gasped, sweat trickling down his face.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“It’s decided!”</span> Silvelle squealed with excitement. <span class="ITAL">“Saachie wins the first round! Which gives her a one-point lead!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">She spun about, raising her hand to point to the winner—and the spotlight fell suddenly on Kuroe, sitting in as Saika’s substitute.</p>
<p class="TX">So by some strange coincidence, it turned out that the real Saika was ultimately given the credit for this victory.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Good work, everyone! Mukkie, what was the deciding factor for you?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>An ordinary kind of love, I guess?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“I see. Such a deep response.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">It wasn’t clear whether Silvelle had understood the true meaning of his words, but she folded her arms and nodded knowingly.</p>
<p class="TX">Standing beside them, Clara craned her neck in wonder. “Huh? That’s weird. I thought I sprinkled in all the best seasonings<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“The best seasonings<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Love</span>, I mean! Hee-hee!” she said with a blush.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Her love, it seemed, was simultaneously sweet, bitter, and spicy.</p>
<p class="TX">Why did he feel like he had learned an important lesson about life as an adult?</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>What the hell are those guys even doing?”</p>
<p class="TX">In the cafeteria of the central school building, Anviet Svarner, a <span aria-label=" Page 98. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_98" role="doc-pagebreak"/>member of the Garden’s teaching staff, was staring at his smartphone’s screen with raised eyebrows full of disbelief.</p>
<p class="TX">The man was in his mid-twenties and had tan skin and ferocious, beast-like eyes. He had his long hair tied back in a braid. His elegant attire—a well-tailored shirt, vest, and slacks—was punctuated by several sets of gaudy golden accessories.</p>
<p class="TX">Regular classes had been canceled for the day to make way for the welcoming ceremony for their guests from the Tower, along with the festivities on the eve of the exhibition match.</p>
<p class="TX">Anviet hadn’t been able to attend the welcoming event due to other business, but that hadn’t stopped rumors of a certain <span class="ITAL">incident</span> from reaching him.</p>
<p class="TX">It seemed that Saika Kuozaki, the Garden’s headmistress, and a female student from the Tower were both fighting over a male student.</p>
<p class="TX">It was utterly ridiculous. To be perfectly frank, he had doubted its veracity from the start. And yet—</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Now then, everyone, let’s move on to the second round. Will Saachie, having snatched victory in the first contest, establish a winning streak? Or will Clarin even the score? Don’t look away!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Watching the contest being streamed live on MagiTube, Anviet scratched his cheeks as he listened to the audio playing from his phone.</p>
<p class="TX">Glancing around the cafeteria, he saw that countless other students who hadn’t been able to grab seats in the multipurpose hall were similarly watching the live video feed on their phones and tablets. If anything, they outnumbered those who had actually come here to eat.</p>
<p class="TX">In fact, the number of live viewers displayed at the bottom of the screen had swelled to a level that he had never before seen. Saika was famous, of course—but this MagiTube streamer looked to have a considerable following of her own.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>What a joke,” he murmured under his breath, before closing the app and shoving his phone back into his pocket. He found the idea of <span aria-label=" Page 99. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_99" role="doc-pagebreak"/>himself watching a video of this caliber on this sort of platform more than he could stomach.</p>
<p class="TX">He still had plenty of work that needed to be done. He took a bite of the clubhouse sandwich he had ordered and began to wolf it down, when—</p>
<p class="TX">“Wait, seriously?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“They’re doing <span class="ITAL">that</span> for the second round<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">His ears twitched as the students seated at the tables all around him broke out into conversation.</p>
<p class="TX">“I wonder who’ll win<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Is it really okay to stream this, though<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I—I can’t tear my eyes away<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>His curiosity got the better of him.</p>
<p class="TX">Clicking his tongue in disgust, he snatched his phone once more and tapped the MagiTube icon.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh, there you are, Anviet. I was looking for you.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Wha—?!”</p>
<p class="TX">But at that moment, a voice called out to him, and he fell forward from shock. The smartphone slipped from his hand and arced through the air, forcing him to chase after it as though practicing a strange dance of some kind.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>What are you doing?”</p>
<p class="TX">The person who had called out to him—Erulka Flaera—watched through narrowed eyes. She clearly wasn’t amused.</p>
<p class="TX">Somehow, Anviet managed to catch the device just before it could hit the floor, then sharpening his gaze, he fixed Erulka in a glare.</p>
<p class="TX">“Sh-shuddup. What do you think you’re doin’, callin’ out to me like that?! I wasn’t tryin’ to watch the live stream! I was just checkin’ my schedule; you hear me?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“No one asked anything about that.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
