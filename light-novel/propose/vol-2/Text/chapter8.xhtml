<p class="TX1"><span aria-label=" Page 49. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_49" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">The day after their skirmish against the slime annihilation factors, Mushiki was making his way down the path to the central school building when he was overcome with a feeling of intense discomfort.</p>
<p class="TX">He was simply walking along the sidewalk, but the eyes of every student and teacher who he passed seemed to widen in surprise, and they started whispering among themselves.</p>
<p class="TX">There were two main reasons for their reactions.</p>
<p class="TX">The first was—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Huh? Isn’t that Mushiki Kuga?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Eh? You mean from the exhibition match?”</p>
<p class="TX">“So apart from Madam Witch, he’s the only person who’s ever managed to defeat a mythic-class annihilation factor?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Yes, rumors of his selection to represent the Garden in the interschool demonstration battle and of his takedown of a mythic-class annihilation factor had spread.</p>
<p class="TX">The second reason was—</p>
<p class="TX">“Did you see Clara’s live stream?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I saw it, dammit. What the hell? A boyfriend<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? I mean, it’s not like I thought she would ever go out with the likes of <span class="ITAL">me</span>, but still<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Tch. Is that him, over there? Is <span class="ITAL">he</span> Mushiki Kuga?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Kuga? You mean her new boyfriend?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Seriously? Whoa<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed, Clara’s comments on her previous live stream had kicked up a scandal.</p>
<p class="TX">After being recognized the first time, Mushiki started hiding his face—but it was already too late. His name and photographs were all over MagiTube’s most popular channel.</p>
<p class="TX">Just one of those rumors would have caused enough trouble, but two at the same time? He had become the center of attention overnight.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 50. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_50" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“You’re in a little trouble, aren’t you?” Kuroe remarked, appearing by his side with the blankest expression.</p>
<p class="TX">Like him, she, too, was wearing her Garden uniform.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yeah<span class="ellipse">…</span> I never expected this to happen,” he replied with a frown.</p>
<p class="TX">“I apologize for your selection in the demonstration match,” she continued, maintaining her pace by his side. “I was careless. I had no idea <span class="ITAL">she</span> had been identified as an annihilation factor,” she mumbled.</p>
<p class="TX">Well, her reluctance to say <span class="ITAL">her</span> name out loud wasn’t unreasonable. <span class="ITAL">She</span> was a well-known figure at the Garden—and if anyone was to overhear them mention her true identity, they would end up with another problem on their hands.</p>
<p class="TX">Which was precisely why Mushiki couldn’t shake his anxiety.</p>
<p class="TX">Turning to Kuroe, his expression grim, he asked, “If that AI—Silvelle, right?—knows about my fight, that means she also knows about <span class="ITAL">her</span>, doesn’t it<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I can’t rule out the possibility<span class="ellipse">…</span> But the fact that the details have been classified as confidential suggests that Silvelle understands the risks involved. I think it highly unlikely that any information will be made public.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I see<span class="ellipse">…</span> I wish she kept the details about me a secret as well<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“I suspect she thought it would be a major loss for the Garden not to properly evaluate a mage strong enough to defeat a mythic-class opponent<span class="ellipse">…</span> In any event, the Garden takes information confidentiality very seriously. If anyone was to try to access any records without permission, they would have to be prepared to face severe punishment.”</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe paused for a moment, then averted her gaze. “Well, probably only Knight Fuyajoh would be willing to go that far.”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s what I’m most afraid of,” Mushiki answered with a nervous sweat.</p>
<p class="TX">“Good luck. She <span class="ITAL">is</span> your younger sister, yes?” Kuroe added with an unreasonable degree of faith in the strength of their familial bonds. “Anyway, we have no choice but to keep it a secret. Records will remain, but everyone will eventually adapt to the situation. Do be <span aria-label=" Page 51. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_51" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>careful about undergoing any state conversions while the spotlight is on you.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Right, I understand. So um, what should we do about the exhibition match?” he asked.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe hesitated for a moment, deep in thought. “Yes<span class="ellipse">…</span> I don’t know if it will be possible to change the selection now that it has been announced<span class="ellipse">…</span> But I’ll see what I can do.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Sorry,” Mushiki whispered. “I know this is probably a handful.”</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe cleared her throat. “More importantly, Mushiki. I would like to ask you something.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Yes?”</p>
<p class="TX">She hadn’t said anything yet, so why did he feel like he knew exactly what she was about to say? Ill at ease, he responded with a short nod.</p>
<p class="TX">Her cold eyes became even colder as she murmured under her breath, “I didn’t expect you to be such a flirt.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m not! Ugh, Kuroe!” he protested, desperate to salvage her image of him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Is that right? Am I mistaken? That display of <span class="ITAL">mutual affection</span> was conveyed very clearly.”</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s all a mistake! Clara just went and said that all by herself!”</p>
<p class="TX">“When I introduced you to MagiTube, I never expected you to use it that way. And on the very day I showed you how to access it.”</p>
<p class="TX">“You have to believe me!” he cried, but just before he could properly explain himself—</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah!” He heard the buoyant, lively voice from behind him. “There you are! I’ve been looking all over for you! You disappeared right after the battle yesterday!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Um<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">As though hit over the head by that voice, he turned around—and as he did so, his whole body stiffened.</p>
<p class="TX">But that was to be expected. After all, it was none other than the very person at the center of their current conversation, the MagiTuber Clara Tokishima.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 52. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_52" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“You left me feeling so lonely! But that’s okay. We should get to know each other a bit more. So let’s chat. Or maybe I’ve got the order wrong? Nah, that can’t be right. It’s important to follow the set rules, right? You’ve got to finish making a jug before you can pour water into it, huh? Relationships are pretty similar, don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="TX">She spoke in an easygoing manner as she drew close, then linked her arm through his as though it was the most natural thing in the world. She even took his hand in her own, interlocking her fingers with his.</p>
<p class="TX">It had all happened so quickly that only two short seconds had passed.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wait<span class="ellipse">…</span> Hold on<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">The sweet aroma of her fragrant lotion and the soft, undeniable touch of those delicate fingers forced him to acknowledge with every fiber of his being that he was in the presence of a girl. He could feel his cheeks turning red.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Is that<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Whoa, seriously? It’s really them!”</p>
<p class="TX">Passersby began to buzz as they recognized Clara, whispering among themselves as they snapped photos with their phones without the slightest hesitation. But far from making an annoyed face, Clara happily struck an exuberant pose. Of course, Mushiki, whose arm she was still gripping tightly, was included in those pictures. He could do little else but stand there in silent despair.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">It was the sight of Kuroe staring at them coldly that made him snap back to his senses.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes. He was clearly taken aback by the suddenness of the situation.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, however, already had someone in his heart.</p>
<p class="TX">Making up his mind, he gently shook off Clara’s arm and untangled their fingers.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Um, Clara?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hm? What’s up? Oh, are photos off-limits or something?” she asked with genuine confusion.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 53. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_53" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>He shook his head. “That’s not it,” he said softly. “We’re not even dating, are we?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Really?” Her eyes bulged with genuine shock. “But didn’t you say you’d<span class="ellipse">…</span>you know<span class="ellipse">…</span>give me a <span class="ITAL">reward</span>? If I stopped your cute little sister?”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s<span class="ellipse">…</span> I suppose I <span class="ITAL">did</span> say that.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Right? So I figured we could go on a date. I want that to be my reward.”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s a pretty heavy request, isn’t it?!” Mushiki gawked.</p>
<p class="TX">Clara giggled. “Well, you know what they say—people have different tastes in music! Well, if we’re <span class="ITAL">too</span> different, I guess we’ll just have to call it quits<span class="ellipse">…</span> But anyway, let’s go out again sometime, Mushipi!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Mushipi?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“That’s my nickname for you. You are my boyfriend, after all, Mushipi.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">He felt that he should have made some remark about the odd pet name—but at the moment he had other things on his mind.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m sorry,” he said with a strong shake of his head. “I can’t do that.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Why not? Am I not your type? I know I’m a little weird, but I’m serious about giving this my all, y’know?”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, I mean, all that aside<span class="ellipse">…</span> I already have someone that I like.”</p>
<p class="TX">At this, Clara let out a long, drawn-out whistle. “Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> So that’s it. I guess it <span class="ITAL">is</span> the springtime of youth, huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? But you two aren’t actually dating yet, right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s<span class="ellipse">…</span> Well, maybe it’s an unrequited love,” he answered as he scratched his cheek.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, you’re so cute when you blush!” Clara exclaimed, staring into his eyes once more. “By the way, who is she? I promise you, I’m not about to lose to any other girl here! I’ll definitely win your heart, Mushipi!”</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s Saika.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Gahaw?!”</p>
<p class="TX">No sooner had he uttered that name than Clara stumbled backward, her reaction resembling those seen in manga.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 54. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_54" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“S-Saika<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? You mean Madam Witch? In charge of the Garden?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yep.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Ha<span class="ellipse">…</span> Whew<span class="ellipse">…</span> You’re wearing a pretty straight face there as you casually announce that you’re gunning for the big game<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Clara staggered, raising a hand to her lips as though to wipe away a trickle of blood (which, of course, there wasn’t any). She probably hadn’t expected him to name Saika, of all people.</p>
<p class="TX">But she quickly shook her head to regain her composure, then pointed at him with her forefinger outstretched as though to punch a hole through his heart.</p>
<p class="TX">“But no one can stop a maiden in love! Even if I’m fighting against Madam Witch herself, Clara here will never give up!” she cried fervently.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, a light chime sounded from inside her pocket.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm? Oops, is it really that time already? I got completely carried away!” She pulled her phone out from her pocket, tapped the screen a few times, then turned her gaze swiftly back to him. “Well, I’ve said everything I came to say, so I’ll be off! See you later, Mushipi!” she said, making a heart sign with her fingers before dashing away down the sidewalk.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>From her entrance right up to her departure, she had been like a raging hurricane.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>She’s gone,” he muttered under his breath once she was out of sight.</p>
<p class="TX">“Indeed. Though, those parting words of hers were rather ominous,” Kuroe added.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki frowned. Kuroe, usually so expressionless, seemed to have a vaguely satisfied look about her.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kuroe? Is something wrong?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Hmm?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> Well, if it’s nothing, that’s okay.”</p>
<p class="TX">With that, she tilted her head and turned her gaze straight ahead.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 55. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_55" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“More importantly, we should hurry,” she said. “That took up more time than I anticipated.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Right. We’ll be late for homeroom.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Not that,” she murmured with a shake of her head. “We aren’t going to the classroom today.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?” Mushiki responded, his mouth agape.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe kept her voice low so she wouldn’t be overheard. “Today we have to welcome our guests from the Tower.”</p>
<p class="TX">“The Tower<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Ah, you mean<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">Only then did he manage to put the pieces together. Ahead, the road leading to the central school building was lined with unfamiliar decorations.</p>
<p class="TX">On both sides of the street, simple food stalls had been set up—almost as if a campus festival were about to get underway.</p>
<p class="TX">“But won’t the exhibition match be held tomorrow?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes, but there will be a welcome ceremony today—and celebrations tonight.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, I see. In that case<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">He looked around, when Kuroe finished his sentence for him. “That being the case, we have to attend the ceremony. And need to finish our preparations, and—”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, she furrowed her brow and dragged him by the arm to lead him into a space between two nearby buildings.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wha—? What’s this all of a sudden, Kuroe<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Shhh. Be quiet.” She raised a finger to her mouth as she glanced back at the street.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki followed suit—and quickly realized why she had acted that way.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri was walking with a friend down the sidewalk where the two of them had been standing until just a moment ago.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Her face was awash with anger, her forward-leaning posture close to <span aria-label=" Page 56. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_56" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>that of a ferocious predator. Mushiki could feel the deadly atmosphere radiating from her.</p>
<p class="TX">She clearly wasn’t in her usual good mood.</p>
<p class="TX">If he had to make a comparison, she looked like someone whose brother had just given them the slip—right after witnessing that same brother get claimed as some suspicious woman’s boyfriend in a weird internet video. She gave that kind of impression.</p>
<p class="TX">“R-Ruri<span class="ellipse">…</span> Let’s calm down a little, okay? You’re scaring everyone,” urged a gentle-looking girl by her side with knit brows—Hizumi Nagekawa, Ruri’s friend and roommate.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Calm down? You say the strangest things, Hizumi. Can’t you see I’m already calm?”</p>
<p class="TX">“R-really<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yep. My blood is practically freezing over.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Th-that doesn’t sound good<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">As the two bantered, the students around them couldn’t help but take note of Ruri’s extraordinary aura, quickly fleeing or averting their gazes.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki had broken out into a nervous sweat just watching from a distance.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Thank you, Kuroe. That was a close one.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Not at all. For the time being, it’s best she doesn’t see you like that,” Kuroe whispered.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">But the next moment, as Ruri made her way down the sidewalk, she came to a sudden stop and started looking around in suspicion.</p>
<p class="TX">“What’s wrong, Ruri?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Can’t you feel something? My brother’s presence?”</p>
<p class="TX">“H-his presence<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yeah. It’s faint. Like he was here around a hundred and ten seconds ago.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I can’t feel anything<span class="ellipse">…</span> Maybe you’re just imagining it?”</p>
<p class="TX">“You think I would mistake my own brother’s presence?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 57. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_57" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“I suppose not<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Hizumi said with a frown.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri wrinkled her nose a few times, then began to slowly approach the building where Mushiki and Kuroe were hiding.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! She’s coming this way<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s voice stuck in his throat as he glanced behind him—the passageway, however, looked too narrow for them to make a quick escape.</p>
<p class="TX">“We’re left with no choice,” Kuroe murmured, grabbing him by the shoulders and pressing him up against the wall.</p>
<p class="TX">“Um<span class="ellipse">…</span> Kuroe? What are you<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“We’re going to need to initiate a state conversion. In any event, I was planning on doing it prior to the ceremony.”</p>
<p class="TX">“A state conversion<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Mushiki gasped.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes, an interchange between the two bodies that lay dormant inside him, his own and that of Saika.</p>
<p class="TX">When changing from Saika to himself, he needed to be sufficiently excited to increase the amount of magical energy that he naturally released.</p>
<p class="TX">But when transforming from his own body to Saika’s, it was necessary for him to take in magical energy from an external source.</p>
<p class="TX">And the most efficient way of doing that was—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Still perfectly expressionless, Kuroe lifted her chin to face him.</p>
<p class="TX">“U-um, hold on a second there, Kuroe<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“We don’t have time. How often have we done this now? Why are you hesitating?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I guess that’s true, but still<span class="ellipse">…</span>” He looked away, his cheeks burning.</p>
<p class="TX">She was right, of course, but he also knew that she was the real Saika. So it was only natural that he would feel a little nervous when she was about to—</p>
<p class="TX">“Let’s just get this over with.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 58. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_58" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>His whole body shuddered as those words escaped her lips.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe wasn’t about to let that chance get away, homing in on his face, when—</p>
<p class="TX">“Mmm<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Like that, she pressed her mouth against his lips.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Her soft, pliant touch—and her sweet aroma he faintly smelled—those sensations flooded his mind, his consciousness. Unable to move, he felt a shock as his vision flickered.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, a few seconds later—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Phew.”</p>
<p class="TX">By the time Kuroe pulled away, he had already fully transformed into Saika Kuozaki.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes. This act—a mouth-to-mouth kiss—was the most efficient means of absorbing magical energy from an external source.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">With glazed eyes, Mushiki raised a finger to his lips where the memory of that kiss still lingered.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Was that a little longer than usual?” he asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“You must be imagining things,” Kuroe said matter-of-factly as she turned away.</p>
<p class="TX">She was already back to her usual self.</p>
<p class="TX">At that very moment, Ruri peeked in from the end of the alleyway.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Huh? Madam Witch? And Kuroe<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? What are you both doing there?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Lady Saika spotted a rare insect,” came Kuroe’s threadbare excuse.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki forced a smile as he nodded along. “Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> Yes. I was sure of it.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh? You’ve got an impressive intellectual curiosity, Madam Witch,” Ruri said in admiration as she continued to look around for any sign of her brother.</p>
<p class="TX">Realizing that he wasn’t there, she craned her neck, her brow furrowing.</p>
