<p class="COTX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Kuroe. This could be the greatest crisis the Garden has ever seen.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What are you talking about now?”</p>
<p class="TX">“My reflection in the window is just too beautiful. I can’t look away.”</p>
<p class="TX">“That does sound like a problem. Which shall I break to solve it for you, the window or your face?”</p>
<p class="TX">Such was the response from the girl with dark hair and dark eyes, her tone ice-cold as she looked on with narrowed eyes and a slight head tilt.</p>
<p class="TX">She was Kuroe Karasuma, Mushiki’s attendant—though strictly speaking, she served the original owner of his current body.</p>
<p class="TX">Her words were clearly spoken in jest, but her expression, gaze, and intonation were all so harsh that they carried an eerie intensity. Mushiki felt a cold sweat break out on his forehead.</p>
<p class="TX">His remark wasn’t an attempt at humor or casual chitchat. For him, the sight staring back at him was simply irresistible.</p>
<p class="TX">The two of them were in the headmistress’s office on the top floor of the central school building at the mage-training institute Void’s Garden.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki was sitting behind a large desk at the far end of the room, organizing and responding to paperwork as per Kuroe’s instructions<span class="ellipse">…</span> <span aria-label=" Page 4. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_4" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>And while carrying out those tasks, he had simply happened to glance at the window, where he had spotted his own reflection.</p>
<p class="TX">The glossy, lustrous, ash-blond hair that draped over his shoulders. A beautiful face with perfectly balanced features that transcended worldly terms like <span class="ITAL">the golden ratio</span>. In the center of that beguiling countenance, a pair of colorful eyes transfixed him with their alluring charm.</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed. The image in the reflection wasn’t that of Mushiki Kuga, a mere high school boy, but rather a beautiful young woman—a veritable goddess made flesh.</p>
<p class="TX">From the moment he laid eyes on her, it was like an arrow had struck his heart. He found himself unable to divert his gaze. Yes, to use a metaphor, she was—</p>
<p class="TX">“Whatever it is, please snap out of it.”</p>
<p class="TX">Alas, interrupting his thoughts, Kuroe grabbed Mushiki by the head and, with a violent jerk, forced him to turn his attention back to the matter at hand. The silken hair swayed gently before him.</p>
<p class="TX">With that image having vanished from his vision, he found that he could finally move his body once more.</p>
<p class="TX">“Sorry,” he said with a sigh. “Thanks. The second I met those eyes in the window, it was like I froze<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Have you become Medusa, then?” Kuroe said in exasperation as she piled a fresh stack of documents atop the desk. “Now, let’s move on to the next batch. I’ve already read and signed everything, but we can’t send them back without first affixing a magic-based form of certification. Everyone’s inherent magic has a different latent pattern, so this last step has to be performed using Saika’s body.” She pointed to the space at the bottom of the page after explaining.</p>
<p class="TX">There, the name <span class="ITAL">Saika Kuozaki</span> was written in neat handwriting.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes. Saika Kuozaki.</p>
<p class="TX">The headmistress of Void’s Garden and the strongest mage in the world.</p>
<p class="TX">The identity of the individual whom Mushiki had now become.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 5. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_5" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Around a month earlier, Mushiki had stumbled upon the dying Saika, and the two had undergone a fusion.</p>
<p class="TX">If it became known that the strongest mage had perished, the world would be thrown into turmoil. As such, Mushiki was now living in and attending the school as Saika herself. This paperwork was just one of his duties as the headmistress.</p>
<p class="TX">“Right<span class="ellipse">…</span> Um, what do you mean by <span class="ITAL">certifying</span> the documents?” he asked in Saika’s voice.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe continued to point to the letters at the bottom of the page. “We use a special ink with a high sensitivity to magic, so all you have to do is lightly trace the name here with your finger.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm. Like this?”</p>
<p class="TX">He did as instructed and placed his thumb on the paper and slid it sideways.</p>
<p class="TX">With that movement, the letters let out a fleeting brilliant flash, prompting him to stare wide-eyed in shock.</p>
<p class="TX">“Whoa, I wasn’t expecting that. It’s beautiful.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. Everyone tends to react with surprise the first time they see it.”</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s also pretty stimulating tracing the name <span class="ITAL">Saika Kuozaki</span> with my finger.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Please don’t bring your sexual proclivities into all this,” Kuroe said with a glare before retrieving the first document and then pointing to the next one underneath. “I’m afraid there are a lot of these, so please. I’ve been somewhat busy lately, so they’ve built up a little.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, leave it to me<span class="ellipse">…</span> I’m a little surprised, though. I mean, given how organized everything is here at the Garden, I would have thought this would be done electronically or something.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Personally, I would like to move to digital authentication as soon as possible, as our current method is extremely inefficient<span class="ellipse">…</span> Unfortunately, there are still many traditionalist mages who place too much emphasis on old methods.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 6. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_6" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Sounds pretty similar to the world outside the Garden,” Mushiki said with a shrug.</p>
<p class="TX">“Everyone else is younger than Lady Saika, yet they’re so stuck in their ways,” she all but spat under her breath.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ha-ha<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Mushiki flashed her a forced smile as he certified one document after the next.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm?”</p>
<p class="TX">As he traced the signatures of several more documents, he felt his eyebrows begin to climb up his forehead.</p>
<p class="TX">Every now and then, an interesting turn of phrase kept popping up on the sheets of paper as he skimmed their contents.</p>
<p class="TX">“An interschool demonstration battle<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? What’s that supposed to be?” he asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes,” Kuroe answered with a nod. “A friendly match between another mage-training institute, Shadow Tower, and us.”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki was a little taken aback by that response. “You mean there are other mage schools besides the Garden?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Indeed. Annihilation factors appear all over the world. In Japan alone, there are five training institutes. We regularly provide opportunities like this for students to improve their skills and share ideas.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">It made sense, come to think of it. Convinced, Mushiki stroked his cheek in thought.</p>
<p class="TX">Only then did he notice another detail from the document in front of him.</p>
<p class="TX">“I thought it looked like it was coming up soon<span class="ellipse">…</span>but the day after tomorrow?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes, well. I should have submitted these documents last month, but with so many things happening lately, there were some delays<span class="ellipse">…</span> That said, these forms are just a formality. Rest assured that everything has been well prepared,” Kuroe said.</p>
<p class="TX">“I hope so<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he murmured, crossing his arms.</p>
<p class="TX">Since she didn’t know what to make of his reaction, Kuroe’s <span aria-label=" Page 7. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_7" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>expression remained emotionless. “There’s no need to worry. Only the five students selected as representatives will be required to fight. Seeing how you’ve just transferred to the school, Mushiki, it’s highly unlikely that you will be chosen.”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, I mean, I’m not really worried about that. It’s just<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">He fell silent. One face in particular flashed through his mind at the word <span class="ITAL">representatives</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">“Will Ruri be one of them, perhaps?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Without a doubt. It wouldn’t make sense if Knight Fuyajoh wasn’t selected as one of the five students.” Kuroe nodded.</p>
<p class="TX">“Right<span class="ellipse">…</span>” He exhaled, struck with admiration for his younger sister.</p>
<p class="TX">Though still a student herself, Ruri Fuyajoh was counted among the strongest Knights of the Garden. As her brother, Mushiki was filled with pride—and overjoyed to hear how highly regarded she was here.</p>
<p class="TX">But after pondering this for a moment, he shook his head slightly. “Huh? From the way you’re talking, it sounds like the five students haven’t been chosen yet, though.”</p>
<p class="TX">“That is correct. The Garden’s administrative AI will select five students to represent us just before the start of the match.”</p>
<p class="TX">“That sounds pretty sudden. I guess they wouldn’t have much time to prepare or practice, then, would they?”</p>
<p class="TX">“One doesn’t always have an ideal team ready to engage an annihilation factor. A mage must be capable of adapting to the environment and the situation at hand.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I see.”</p>
<p class="TX">It was certainly true that there could be no anticipating when an annihilation factor might appear, nor what the situation would be at the time. In short, theirs was a constant battlefield. It was important to be constantly ready without requiring any special preparation.</p>
<p class="TX">“In any event, all you have to do is attend the welcome ceremony and watch the match. Afterward, well, please just offer a few words of thanks to the participants.” Kuroe paused, removing the next document. <span aria-label=" Page 8. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_8" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Please continue with your work. If you keep stopping, we won’t be able to get through them all.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, right.” Mushiki nodded, tracing the signature on the remaining documents with his finger.</p>
<p class="TX">How long did it all take? By the time he’d finished going through the whole pile, his thumb was starting to feel a little numb.</p>
<p class="TX">“Well done. Now then, I will return these to the relevant parties,” Kuroe declared.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah. Thank you,” he responded, raising a hand in gratitude.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe gathered up the papers, then turned back to him. “Now, we should move on to substantiation training<span class="ellipse">…</span> Shall we start the preparations now?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse">…</span> Yeah, okay,” he replied, tensing up slightly at the sudden change of topic.</p>
<p class="TX">By <span class="ITAL">substantiation training</span>, she meant practicing how to use his magic techniques.</p>
<p class="TX">And by <span class="ITAL">preparation</span>, she meant <span class="ITAL">stimulating</span> him to ready his body for training, to disturb his mental state and increase the flow of his magical energy.</p>
<p class="TX">In other words, she was as good as saying she would make full use of her sensual wiles to seduce him.</p>
<p class="TX">And so Kuroe approached him with slow steps.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Her softly swaying hair, her obsidian eyes, her cherry-red lips all drew closer. He hadn’t paid them much attention before, but each and every aspect of her body now sent a powerful thrill through his brain.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kuroe, what are you—?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t move, please.”</p>
<p class="TX">As she spoke, she placed her hands on his shoulders and leaned in.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">What in the world was she about to do to him? Dizzying fantasies swirled inside his head, and he suddenly found himself short of breath.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 9. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_9" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She positioned her lips close to his ear and whispered in the most bewitching manner imaginable:</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">“Now, <span class="ITAL">Mushiki</span>. We’re going to have some exciting training time. Why don’t I give you a rousing squeeze?”</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">Her countenance, until a moment ago cool and collected, now betrayed an amused smile. Outwardly, her appearance hadn’t changed in the slightest, but it was as if she had somehow become a completely different person.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">No sooner did he hear that than he felt an electric current course through his brain, his chest tightening and his whole body heating up.</p>
<p class="TX">Then a vague glow enveloped his body—as it transformed into an entirely different figure.</p>
<p class="TX">A few moments later, a young man was sitting atop the oversize chair in the headmistress’s office.</p>
<p class="TX">His hair was pale in hue, his face androgynous. Even his navy-blue uniform had adjusted to suit his more masculine body.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes. Saika Kuozaki had just transformed into Mushiki Kuga.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>One month earlier, Mushiki had stumbled upon the dying Saika and inherited her body and powers.</p>
<p class="TX">This, however, didn’t mean he had lost his own original body.</p>
<p class="TX">Though he spent most of his time in Saika’s form, his own still dwelled within it, and when he was strongly stimulated or aroused, those sensations would trigger an immediate change into his original form.</p>
<p class="TX">“Maybe that was a little much?” Kuroe said, squinting as she looked him over.</p>
<p class="TX">Her expression and tone had returned to its cool, detached manner from before.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki could feel the blood rushing to his cheeks as he pursed his <span aria-label=" Page 10. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_10" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>lips. “That’s bound to happen, what with Saika herself whispering in my ear.”</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed. In truth, there was no human by the name of Kuroe Karasuma in this world.</p>
<p class="TX">The young woman before him was an artificial vessel that Saika Kuozaki had prepared as a refuge for her soul should she find herself caught in an emergency.</p>
<p class="TX">In other words, Mushiki was presently occupying Saika’s body, while Saika was presently in Kuroe’s. Simply put, this was indeed a messy situation.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Could you warn me the next time you do that? I’ve got to prepare, too.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Prepare your heart, you mean?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Recording equipment.”</p>
<p class="TX">“You never change,” she retorted, fixing him with a hard glare. “But let’s move on. Time is short. We’ll begin your training at once<span class="ellipse">…</span> The two bodies—yours, Mushiki, and Lady Saika’s—are two sides of the same coin. If you die, so, too, does Lady Saika’s body. To prevent that from happening, we need to ensure that you are at least strong enough to fight.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yeah, I get all that<span class="ellipse">…</span> By the way<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“What now?”</p>
<p class="TX">“You aren’t going to talk like Saika anymore<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he asked sadly.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe let out a small sigh. “Just like the truth about your body, we cannot risk <span class="ITAL">my</span> secret leaking out. We should refrain from such actions as much as possible.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>I<span class="ellipse">…</span>see<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“You’re always quick to sink into depression,” she exclaimed with an exasperated look as she approached the back of the headmistress’s office and reached for the doorknob. “I <span class="ITAL">would</span> like to use the training grounds, but we would be a little too conspicuous there. The courtyard in front of Lady Saika’s mansion will make a better choice.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 11. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_11" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>With that, she opened the door—revealing a beautiful forecourt surrounded by magnificent flowerbeds and carefully cultivated trees.</p>
<p class="TX">Of course, this wasn’t the top floor of the central school building. There was no way that a place like this could have existed on the other side of that wall. Rather, the door operated through a magical distortion, leading to a different place within the grounds of the Garden.</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki. This way, please.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes,” he answered in a simple though clear voice as he followed her through the doorway.</p>
<p class="TX">He found himself in front of Saika Kuozaki’s private residence in the Garden’s northern precinct.</p>
<p class="TX">There was an elaborate gate up ahead, followed by a paved path extending beyond. It was hardly designed for ease of combat, but it was more than enough for a novice mage to practice his skills.</p>
<p class="TX">“Now then, let’s begin<span class="ellipse">…</span> Please try activating your second substantiation,” Kuroe urged as she positioned herself on the paved path.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Right.” Mushiki nodded, collecting his thoughts.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">It felt like he was trying to force all the elements that composed his body together, from his feet to his gut, from his head to his chest, from his shoulders to the tips of his hands. He took stock of his whole body, focusing his strength into a single point.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>U-ugh<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">But nothing appeared in the palm of his right hand.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Hmm.” Kuroe exhaled at long last. “That’s odd. You <span class="ITAL">have</span> successfully pulled off your second substantiation once before.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Sorry. I didn’t really know what I was doing that time<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm.” She stroked her chin. “Perhaps you exerted more power than usual after falling into an extreme situation<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Well, that kind of thing does happen on occasion. Magical energy does change greatly depending on one’s mental state.”</p>
<p class="TX">She paused there, narrowing her eyes. “So long as you are in <span aria-label=" Page 12. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_12" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>possession of Lady Saika’s body, this will pose a problem. You must learn to use your powers in a stable manner.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Right,” he said meekly.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe sighed. “But if all we’re going to say is <span class="ITAL">do it</span>, the Garden can hardly be considered a training institute. Let’s build you up to it. Are you ready?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes! Even if it costs me my life<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” Mushiki responded fervently.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe gave a slight shrug. “I appreciate your spirit, but that won’t do, either. If you perished, Lady Saika would also die.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> S-sorry. You know what I mean.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Very well. I don’t doubt your enthusiasm,” she said with a nod, before raising a finger. “As I said earlier, you have already succeeded once in activating your second substantiation. Which means that you already have everything you need to do it again.</p>
<p class="TX">“Do you follow, Mushiki?” she asked. “The substantiation created by your technique is, so to speak, a component of your inner self. Your first substantiation, <span class="ITAL">phenomena</span>, brings forth magical effects that exist within you. Your second substantiation, <span class="ITAL">matter</span>, establishes those effects as a tangible substance. By moving from one substantiation stage to the next, you expand the scope of your <span class="ITAL">inner self</span> outward. So let’s keep that image in mind as we try it again.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Right.” He nodded, fixing his attention on his right hand yet again.</p>
<p class="TX">“N-ngh<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>But try as he might, nothing appeared in his hand.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe let out a long breath. “Well, if you could do it with just some simple words of advice, you would hardly need training. It will take steady, repetitive practice.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Right<span class="ellipse">…</span> Sorry.”</p>
<p class="TX">As though suddenly remembering something, Kuroe raised an eyebrow. “Now<span class="ellipse">…</span> Yes. This may seem somewhat childish, but let’s prepare some treats.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Treats<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. To serve as a reward. They might help motivate you a little <span aria-label=" Page 13. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_13" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>more. How about this? If you can activate your second substantiation, I will answer one question. About anything you want.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, I did it!”</p>
<p class="TX">No sooner had Kuroe finished speaking than a clear, glass-like sword materialized in Mushiki’s right hand as a two-layered crown-like world crest appeared over his head.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Huh?” Kuroe stared wide-eyed.</p>
<p class="TX">He had never seen her so taken aback before. This was a rare sight—and one that he wished he could have caught on camera, if only he’d had one on hand.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>” She stared at him for a long moment, before folding her arms in consternation. “I have to ask. You didn’t do that on purpose, did you?”</p>
<p class="TX">“No way. I wouldn’t lie to you, Kuroe.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Hmm. Yes, I’m sure you wouldn’t,” she said with a nod, but her expression suggested she wasn’t entirely convinced.</p>
<p class="TX">“By the way, Kuroe?”</p>
<p class="TX">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Did you mean it, when you said I could ask you anything?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I see. So you were only thinking of your reward?” From her tone, her despair seemed to border on admiration. Then, pulling herself together, she said, “Very well. Putting aside how you achieved it, you <span class="ITAL">did</span> successfully activate your second substantiation<span class="ellipse">…</span> So how does it feel to hold that sense of mystery in your hands? Are you <span class="ITAL">aware</span> of the sword, of what it <span class="ITAL">is</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“What type of person does Saika like<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? No, what kind of presents<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Chances like this are hard to come by; I’ve got to think carefully here<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Mushiki pondered in all earnestness.</p>
<p class="TX">“Listen to me, please,” Kuroe said with a deep frown.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, at that moment—</p>
<p class="TX">A soft chime came from her pocket.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">She must have received a message of some sort. She retrieved her phone and began to tap the screen.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 14. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_14" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Hmm<span class="ellipse">…</span> My apologies, but something important has come up. Let’s call it a day for now.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Eh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">In spite of himself, Mushiki found himself short of breath after hearing these words—and just like that, both his second substantiation and his world crest vanished.</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t make such a face. Your reward is still valid.”</p>
<p class="TX">His desperation must have been clear as day, as Kuroe stared back at him, aghast.</p>
<p class="TX">“That being said, there’s no time to waste. Please don’t neglect your self-studies.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Right<span class="ellipse">…</span> But what should I do<span class="ellipse">…</span>like, specifically?”</p>
<p class="TX">“The tablet you use in class contains a textbook on basic magic usage. Please use that as a basis for practicing some drills. As for the rest, well<span class="ellipse">…</span>” She placed her index finger on her chin as though mulling over something. “Given my position, I can’t actively recommend it, but apparently many students have been using MagiTube as a point of reference lately.”</p>
<p class="TX">“MagiTube?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki tilted his head at the sound of that unfamiliar word.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe nodded. “Speaking of which, we’ve been so busy that I haven’t properly explained how to use the various applications<span class="ellipse">…</span> You do have a smartphone, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Ah, yeah.”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki gave her a small nod as he pulled his phone from his bag nearby. He had received it upon enrolling as a student at the Garden, so it was a little different from his old one.</p>
<p class="TX">He usually carried it in his pocket, but seeing as it could get in the way during training, he had left it in his bag.</p>
<p class="TX">“You should see an app called MagiTube, yes? It’s one of the applications we preinstall here at the Garden.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Ah, here it is. I had no idea about any of this<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Come to think of it, he hadn’t made use of his new phone that much <span aria-label=" Page 15. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_15" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>over the past few weeks. The only feature that he had gotten familiar with up till now was the camera.</p>
<p class="TX">He tapped on the icon with a stylized letter M, and the application opened.</p>
<p class="TX">Beneath the MagiTube logo was a search bar and thumbnails for various videos.</p>
<p class="TX">“It kind of looks like a video site.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Precisely. MagiTube is a video-hosting site exclusively for mages.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>For mages?” he repeated.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe glanced down at the screen—her face coming so close that his heart raced, though he decided to keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. As you know, the existence of mages must be kept a secret from wider society. We can’t openly talk about things like magic or annihilation factors<span class="ellipse">…</span> Nevertheless, in this information-oriented world, it would be foolish of us to share only through oral means or written texts.”</p>
<p class="TX">She paused there, pointing down at the screen. “So we decided to create a web service that only mages can use. It isn’t particularly different from similar services you can find on the <span class="ITAL">outside</span>. You can upload videos containing confidential information and leave comments. Don’t worry about security. The main staff members at the company managing it are all mages, too.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Wow<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Mushiki said as he scrolled down the screen with clear admiration.</p>
<p class="TX">The thumbnails for the videos did indeed show people using magic in flashy ways, along with monsters that could only be annihilation factors. Several seemed to deal with topics such as the history of magic—and provided explanations and commentaries as well as guides on effective practice.</p>
<p class="TX">Slowly, Kuroe’s words began to fall into place. These might not be official lesson materials, but it was often easier to intuitively understand something with the help of a video.</p>
<p class="TX">Incidentally, one video titled <span class="ITAL">I Tried to Defeat an Annihilation Factor</span> <span aria-label=" Page 16. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_16" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="ITAL">Using Only Spell-Type Magic</span> caught his eye<span class="ellipse">…</span> How on earth could they have pulled that off?</p>
<p class="TX">“Finding what works for you through trial and error is an important step in the learning process. You should try anything that comes to mind.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Right. I think I get it,” he answered.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe gave him a firm nod. “Well, then,” she said, glancing up at him. “Let’s go. I’ll walk with you to the central precinct.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, right.”</p>
<p class="TX">He followed Kuroe down the path leading away from the courtyard, when she suddenly stopped as though only now remembering something.</p>
<p class="TX">“By the way, Mushiki,” she said. “There should be an application called Connect. Did you see it?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Ah, yeah. What does it do?”</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s a social networking service that lets users exchange messages and stickers—and make phone calls. You can also talk about anything magic-related through it, too.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, I see<span class="ellipse">…</span> I’m a bit surprised, though. I thought mages would use magic to communicate or something.”</p>
<p class="TX">“This is much more efficient than relying on a crystal ball or telepathy. Of course, those are still used for special situations, but when it comes to everyday communication, technology is the answer. You don’t need to waste your magical energy to use it, after all.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, that makes sense.”</p>
<p class="TX">Why did he feel like they’d had a similar conversation once before?</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, he raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="TX">“So why did you bring up this app?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Let’s exchange user IDs. I don’t think we’ll be able to be with each other as much from here on out.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Huh?!” Mushiki’s voice cried out at this unexpected announcement.</p>
<p class="TX">“What’s wrong? Is there a problem?”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, it’s just<span class="ellipse">…</span> I mean<span class="ellipse">…</span> A-are you sure?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 17. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_17" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“We’ll need to split up pretty often from now on, so it’s best that we have several ways to contact each other.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Y-yeah, right. C-can I get your details, then<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Mushiki asked, his hand trembling as he opened the app on his phone to read the QR code on Kuroe’s screen.</p>
<p class="TX">The device let out a high-pitched sound as the name <span class="ITAL">Kuroe Karasuma</span> appeared on the display, along with an <small>ADD AS FRIEND</small> button.</p>
<p class="TX">“Eeep<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">“There’s no need for any weird noises. What on earth is the matter with you?”</p>
<p class="TX">“No<span class="ellipse">…</span> I was just a little surprised is all. Yes, let’s start off as friends and see where we go!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Watch what you say,” Kuroe replied, her tone flat as she narrowed her eyes at Mushiki.</p>
<p class="TX">Overcome with emotion, he tapped the <small>ADD AS FRIEND</small> button.</p>
<p class="TX">“I—I can’t believe it<span class="ellipse">…</span> Saika’s details<span class="ellipse">…</span>on <span class="ITAL">my</span> phone<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Before he knew it, he felt a wave of heat spread from the area around his eyes all the way down his cheeks.</p>
<p class="TX">“I don’t have any more regrets<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he whispered, holding his phone close to his chest.</p>
<p class="TX">“Haven’t you set the bar a little low there?” Kuroe said with a sigh as she returned her own phone back inside her pocket.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Around ten minutes after leaving Mushiki, Kuroe was holding herself ramrod straight as she took the elevator in the Garden’s central library.</p>
<p class="TX">There was no one else with her, but even so, she didn’t once step out of character as Kuroe Karasuma. She understood full well that there were always blind spots in one’s awareness; carelessness and overconfidence only made one more vulnerable, allowing them to be easily taken advantage of.</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed, the only time she dropped the mask of <span class="ITAL">Kuroe</span> to become <span aria-label=" Page 18. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_18" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="ITAL">Saika</span> was while in the presence of Mushiki, the one and only person who knew her true identity. At all other times, in all other places, it was necessary, she believed, to truly <span class="ITAL">be</span> Kuroe.</p>
<p class="TX">Well, she would never say this to Mushiki’s face, though—if she did, he would just end up having another one of his emotional overreactions.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, the elevator came to a stop. An electronic chime sounded out as the doors slid open.</p>
<p class="TX">She was on the twentieth basement floor, the lowest level of the Garden’s central library. Only those with special permission were allowed to enter—or even to know of its very existence.</p>
<p class="TX">This restricted space was known as the sealed area—a place where the most dangerous materials and creatures were stored for safekeeping.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe approached calmly so as not to let the hem of her skirt flutter too much and made her way down the dimly lit corridor before reaching an opening.</p>
<p class="TX">There, the wall, covered in magic glyphs, gave way to a heavy metal gateway. In appearance, the area was more akin to an altar for some kind of arcane ceremony, or perhaps a huge bank vault, than a room in a library.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Thank you for waiting, Knight Erulka,” she called out with a polite bow to the individual who had arrived ahead of her.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm?” The mage in question turned around with a puzzled look.</p>
<p class="TX">She was a petite girl garbed in a long white robe worn over thin leggings, and her fluffy, feline hair was tied up in a distinctive arrangement.</p>
<p class="TX">No matter how you looked at her, she could only have been in her early teens—certainly not old enough to be permitted inside such an important area.</p>
<p class="TX">But when it came to mages, one’s outer appearance told you nothing about their true age. In fact, after Saika, this girl was the second oldest individual at the Garden.</p>
<p class="TX">Erulka Flaera—the head of the Garden’s medical department and one of its most important knights.</p>
<p class="TX">“You<span class="ellipse">…</span> Kuroe, was it? I asked Saika to join me, though<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 19. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_19" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Yes. Lady Saika is currently occupied with something, so she instructed me to take care of this affair on her behalf,” Kuroe answered.</p>
<p class="TX">She could have easily brought Mushiki with her after restoring him to his Saika form, but there were things in this sealed area that, should he learn of their existence, would cause him unnecessary psychological harm. As she didn’t know why Erulka had asked her to come down here, it was simply too risky to get Mushiki involved.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse">…</span>” Erulka stared at her as though to size her up, before finally letting out a labored breath. “Very well. If Saika is happy to let you down here, I suppose that speaks to how she trusts you. As far as I’m concerned, I have no complaints so long as you convey my message to her.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I would be happy to,” Kuroe replied with a polite bow.</p>
<p class="TX">Erulka may have been one of the oldest and most senior mages at the Garden, but she was also adaptable enough to know how to deal with unexpected circumstances such as this. In fact, if not for that trait of hers, it would have been difficult for Saika to have maintained such a strong friendship with her over the centuries.</p>
<p class="TX">“In that case, Knight Erulka, what is this about?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> If Saika asked you to come here on her behalf, I suppose it’s safe to assume you know what this place is?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes,” Kuroe answered.</p>
<p class="TX">Erulka gave her a slight nod and reached out to the console set in the wall.</p>
<p class="TX">Several strings of letters appeared on the screen, and a feminine voice came from the speaker: “<span class="ITAL">Ye-e-es? Who is it?</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Erulka here. Sis, display stored item O-08.”</p>
<p class="TX">Despite that strange form of address, the individual on the other end of the interphone wasn’t Erulka’s actual sister. The administrator of this library was simply a little eccentric.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Oh, Erulkie? You know Item O-08 is sealed under the highest security level, yes? It could be dangerous to view it. Are you sure?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">“I’m sure.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Okaaay!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 20. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_20" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The voice replied cheerfully, and the letters engraved on the wall let out a dim glow. The metal door at the far end of the room slowly swung open.</p>
<p class="TX">“O-08<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe, watching on, raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="TX">Of course, she knew exactly what that serial number was assigned to. Of all the items stored in this underground sealed area, it ranked among the absolute worst. Why in the world would Erulka want to take a look at it<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>What?”</p>
<p class="TX">From behind the door, a huge transparent crystal came into view—an artificially made gemstone, refined through magic, used for sealing away magical substances.</p>
<p class="TX">The problem lay within that crystal—a huge heart, around as tall as Erulka herself.</p>
<p class="TX">And it was pulsating ever so slightly.</p>
<p class="TX">“The heart of the Ouroboros is beating<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Kuroe whispered, her voice quavering.</p>
<p class="TX">Erulka folded her arms as she nodded. “Precisely. Annihilation Factor No. O-08: Ouroboros. One of the twelve mythic-grade annihilation factors, Mythologia, that Saika defeated a long time ago.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">Annihilation factor</span>—a general term for an existence capable of destroying the world, phenomena that tended to occur somewhere on the Earth roughly every three hundred hours.</p>
<p class="TX">According to the level of threat they posed, they were categorized into calamity, war, obliteration, and illusionary grades, and mages of corresponding caliber were routinely sent to destroy them.</p>
<p class="TX">But over the past five hundred years, there had also been twelve confirmed annihilation factors that ranked higher even than the highest illusionary grade.</p>
<p class="TX">Those were known as mythic-class annihilation factors—or Mythologia.</p>
<p class="TX">Legendary threats that only Saika Kuozaki could hope to stop.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 21. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_21" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Sealed within that crystal was a piece of one such creature, the Ouroboros.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>As for why the body of the Ouroboros, which Saika herself defeated, remains—the Ouroboros was an annihilation factor with the power of <span class="ITAL">immortality</span>,” Erulka explained, staring unwavering at the slowly beating heart.</p>
<p class="TX">Maybe she was being overly cautious as she wasn’t sure just how much Kuroe already knew about all this.</p>
<p class="TX">As such, playing along, Kuroe nodded in a display of understanding. “Yes, I’ve heard about it. The only monster that Saika’s techniques couldn’t defeat. In order to prevent its body from regenerating, it was divided into twenty-four pieces, each stored in separate locations around the world.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Precisely. The heart has been in a state of suspended animation for centuries. But as you can see, it’s beating again. I don’t know what triggered this, but it’s certainly not in its usual state.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe bit her lip at Erulka’s explanation.</p>
<p class="TX">She could guess why this had happened.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes—because Saika had died.</p>
<p class="TX">Close to a month ago, Saika Kuozaki had been fatally wounded, her body merging with that of Mushiki Kuga, who had happened to stumble on the scene of the crime.</p>
<p class="TX">As such, Mushiki presently inhabited the body that possessed all of Saika’s techniques, while Saika’s soul had been transferred to a homunculus—an artificial body—in the form of Kuroe.</p>
<p class="TX">In other words, Saika Kuozaki, her mind and body, no longer existed as one entity.</p>
<p class="TX">It wasn’t surprising that the seal that Saika had placed on this creature long ago had therefore begun to weaken.</p>
<p class="TX">“I understand the situation. I will immediately seek Lady Saika’s instructions on how to restore the seal. At the same time, I would appreciate it if you could check the other sealed parts.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 22. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_22" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Hmm. Understood.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Yes. If it awakens now, there’s no way we’ll be able to stop it<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Kuroe murmured under her breath, talking to herself.</p>
<p class="TX">Erulka, overhearing, tilted her head. “Hmm? What a strange thing to say. It may be a unique class of annihilation factor, but Saika has already beaten it once before, no?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Yes, you’re right. But Lady Saika hasn’t been at her best lately.”</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe could hardly reveal the truth here, nor could she give the false impression that Saika would be able to deal with this should worse come to worst. Still worried, though, she tried to brush the comment aside.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh? I see. That sounds rather serious, no<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Well, either way, we’ll have to take caution while dealing with this thing.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Yes. That’s exactly right.” Kuroe nodded, trying to hide the sweat building up on her forehead.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">Shortly after parting ways with Kuroe, Mushiki found himself sitting on a bench behind the central school building, carefully perusing the videos available on the streaming application MagiTube.</p>
<p class="TX">As Kuroe had suggested, to make effective use of the service, he first had to understand how the application worked and what was trending on it.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">At first glance, the application didn’t seem much different from any other video-sharing website. The thumbnails were lined up in neat rows, complete with their titles, durations, and number of views.</p>
<p class="TX">For the time being, he decided to try ranking them by popularity. As he tapped through the menu, the available options appeared in a list from top to bottom.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm?”</p>
<p class="TX">As he glanced over the videos, he suddenly noticed something.</p>
<p class="TX">Apparently the first-, second-, and third-most popular videos were all by the same user.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 23. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_23" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Clara Channel<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">It looked to be fairly popular. Glancing at the channel rankings, it was clearly number one by an overwhelming margin. Some of the videos had even surpassed a million views. Mushiki didn’t know how many mages there were in the world, but given how limited the user base had to be, that number was positively astounding.</p>
<p class="TX">According to Kuroe, lots of students used these kinds of videos to learn how to wield magic. The fact that they were so popular had to mean that this Clara provided easy-to-understand explanations or maybe innovative teaching methods. As such, with his hopes raised, Mushiki tapped on the top trending video.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Hi there! And we’re back—it’s Clara Channel Time! Are you having a</span> ca-razy <span class="ITAL">day, my Claramates?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">The video started playing—showing a young woman waving playfully to the camera.</p>
<p class="TX">She had a colorful appearance, wore a mask to hide her face, and had ears adorned with various earrings and ear cuffs. Her name was Clara, from which her channel took its title. She was clearly acting more than a little over-the-top throughout, speaking as though actually addressing her audience.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“I want you all to hear me out for a minute. The other day, your friend Clara saw a video on a website from the</span> outside. <span class="ITAL">You know, the kind anyone can watch. It was called</span> I Tried Taking a Bath with Slimes. <span class="ITAL">Wow, I thought—but all they did was fill a bathtub with some slime toys and then climb in and make a whole lot of noise</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">So I was thinking: Hold on a minute. Is this a joke? Where are the slimes?”</span></p>
<p class="TX">With that, the image on the screen cut to a different angle.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“So I went to a friend from a different year who’s studying alchemy and insisted they make some for me!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">With that, she gestured to the bathtub behind her—filled with an unmistakable <span class="ITAL">something</span> that was swelling and wriggling all over.</p>
<p class="TX">That was clearly no ordinary substance. The rippling on the water’s surface couldn’t possibly be a natural phenomenon—it was far more <span aria-label=" Page 24. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_24" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>likely the movements of an invertebrate in search of food. Listening carefully, Mushiki could even make out what sounded like a high-pitched cry.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Whoa</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">The real thing sure does have a different kind of aura, huh? If it was too strong, it would end up being a certified annihilation factor, so I asked my buddy to drop its power level a bit</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">”</span></p>
<p class="TX">The corners of Clara’s lips were twisted in a forced grin, sweat all but dripping down her cheeks from thrilled anxiety.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">But! Your good friend Clara isn’t scared of something like this! Whhhoooaaa! Here it comes, a real-life</span> I Tried Taking a Bath with Slimes<span class="ITAL">!</span>” she cried out in anticipation as she dived straight into the bathtub.</p>
<p class="TX">With a loud thud, the gel-like substance rippled violently and spilled over the edge of the bathtub. Nonetheless, without so much as a drop of that goo spilling onto the floor, it soon retreated back inside the tub.</p>
<p class="TX">Then the foreign body who had just invaded its space—Clara—was soon engulfed, the substance wrapping itself around her.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Oh</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_exclamatory">…</span><span class="ITAL">! Wha—?! Ooohhh</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_questionmark">…</span><span class="ITAL">?!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">Clara squirmed as she let out a pained cry. Her arms and legs kept reappearing then sinking once more below the surface.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Eventually, the cries died down and silence fell.</p>
<p class="TX">But then—</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Gah</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_exclamatory">…</span><span class="ITAL">!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">Just as Mushiki was beginning to feel genuinely worried for her safety, she stepped out of the bathtub.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Ha</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_exclamatory">…</span><span class="ITAL">! Ha</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_exclamatory">…</span><span class="ITAL">! Th-that was insane</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_exclamatory">…</span><span class="ITAL">! It was agony at first, but then there was a sense of profound calm</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">I don’t remember the Sanzu River being so slimy, though</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_questionmark">…</span><span class="ITAL">? Anyway, there you have it! Your good friend Clara just conquered a real-life slime bath! There’s nothing to it! Just a mage’s strength of will!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">With that proud declaration, her clothes suddenly collapsed into a heap, melted to bits.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ITAL">Gyaaarrrggghhh?! So I was almost</span> digested <span class="ITAL">in there?!</span>” she exclaimed, <span aria-label=" Page 25. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_25" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>her arms and legs flailing about in panic while her pale skin became increasingly exposed.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, a quick disclaimer appeared on the screen: <span class="ITAL">I used a slime that only melts clothes.</span> Mushiki couldn’t be entirely sure, but maybe there were certain rules that video streamers had to follow when using this mage-exclusive video-sharing site?</p>
<p class="TX">After that, the screen went black for a moment, before Clara, having apparently escaped from the bathtub, reappeared, breathing heavily. Most of her clothes had melted away, and she looked to have changed into a swimsuit that she had probably readied in advance.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Ha-ha</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">That was a close one. If not for this anti-digestive swimsuit, I would have been mosaicked all over again! Anyway, you had better watch out if you’re planning on taking a real-life slime bath, my Claramates! Make sure your clothes are made from the right materials! Especially down below! Seriously, if you’re not careful, those things can creep in from front and back. Men, too! There’s a hole in your penis, you know?! All right, that’s it for today. Clara out!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">With that, the video reached its end.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki rested a hand on his forehead, his expression tinged with bewilderment.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Yep, that certainly was a <span class="ITAL">unique</span> kind of video, the sort that only a mage could produce. He had never seen anything even remotely like that creature on the <span class="ITAL">outside</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">But despite having patiently sat through that video, he still hadn’t learned any useful information about magic or how to use it for himself.</p>
<p class="TX">“Um<span class="ellipse">…</span> Er<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Whhhoooaaa?!”</p>
<p class="TX">And then—</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>
<p class="TX">A moment later, Clara’s voice rang out yet again, prompting Mushiki to widen his eyes even further.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 26. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_26" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Maybe the video hadn’t actually finished? And he hurriedly glanced back down at his phone, but the display was already showing the page for the next recommended clip. It <span class="ITAL">had</span> ended.</p>
<p class="TX">But he had also definitely heard her voice just then<span class="ellipse">…</span></p>
<p class="TX">“Eh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”!</p>
<p class="TX">At that point, he had clammed up.</p>
<p class="TX">But that was only to be expected.</p>
<p class="TX">After all, a person had suddenly come falling down from the sky.</p>
<p class="TX">“Uggghhh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">He reached out and caught the tumbling figure in his arms.</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, a heavy weight bore down on him, shooting through his shoulders all the way down to his waist.</p>
<p class="TX">The figure might not have been particularly large, but it was the momentum of the fall more than anything else that added to the impact.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>Well, if not for his training in the Garden’s practical classes, he would have been crushed, so this wasn’t really too bad.</p>
<p class="TX">“Owww<span class="ellipse">…</span> Another failure<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">The girl who had fallen from above blinked a few times, her eyes snapping open as she finally grasped her current situation.</p>
<p class="TX">“Whaaat?! Someone’s carrying me in their arms?! Like a princess?! Seriously?! This kind of thing can really happen?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Her eyes gleaming with excitement, she swung her legs up and down.</p>
<p class="TX">With each of her movements, the tendons in Mushiki’s arms and waist, already at their limit, screamed out.</p>
<p class="TX">“Stop<span class="ellipse">…</span> Um<span class="ellipse">…</span> Let me<span class="ellipse">…</span>put you down<span class="ellipse">…</span>” He groaned.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, sorry ’bout that,” the girl said lightly as she dropped to the ground.</p>
<p class="TX">“Phew<span class="ellipse">…</span> Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">The pressure on his body was gone, and his muscles, having turned unnaturally stiff, finally began to move as he fell flat on his backside.</p>
<p class="TX">The girl from the sky peered down at him with a worried look. “Um<span class="ellipse">…</span> Are you okay, mister?”</p>
<p class="TX">“A-ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> Yeah. Are you<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Are you hurt?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 27. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_27" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Nope! Thanks to you, I’m fine!” she answered with an exaggerated salute.</p>
<p class="TX">For now, at least, Mushiki could breathe a sigh of relief, simply forcing a faint smile.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Hmm?”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, his eyebrows shot up.</p>
<p class="TX">It had all happened so fast that he didn’t have time to process it, but looking the girl over once more, a mysterious feeling took hold of him.</p>
<p class="TX">She appeared to be around the same age as him, with her flashy dyed hair tied up in two pigtails. Two slender eyes, distinctive makeup, ears full of piercings and ear cuffs. She was wearing a mask drawn over her ears, but she had pulled it down over her chin as though it would be rude to hide her face while thanking someone. Her sharp canines peeked out from between her exposed, shapely lips.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ellipse">…</span>To be honest, it was too much information to process—and that was just from the neck up. Her eyes seemed to flicker as she stared at him.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, it wasn’t her unique appearance that had caused Mushiki’s sense of discomfort.</p>
<p class="TX">No, it was more like d<span class="accent">é</span>j<span class="accent">à</span> vu. This was without a doubt their first meeting, but he couldn’t help feeling like he had met her somewhere before.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm? What’s up, mister? Why’re you staring like that? Have I bewitched you with my gorgeous charms?” she said with a mischievous smile.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki continued to stare back—when his eyes widened.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Clara?” Her name spilled from his lips unknowingly.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes, there could be no mistaking her. This was undoubtedly the same Clara from the MagiTube channel he had just been watching.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yep, I’m Clara. Looks like you’ve heard of me,” she said in a daze.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, a fresh voice came from his smartphone, which he had left on the bench.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 28. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_28" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="ITAL">“Wooowww?! Th-that light is amazing! Awesome!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">As he had left the screen on for a while, his device must have automatically started playing the next recommended video—and was now showing Clara having another flashy reaction. Incidentally, the title of this next video was <span class="ITAL">I Bought a Legendary Holy Sword on a Mage Auction Site</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">The girl’s eyes sparkled as she glanced at the device. “Whoa, for real?! You were watching <span class="ITAL">my</span> videos?! Huh?! So I fell from the sky while you were watching <span class="ITAL">me</span>?! Is that even possible?! This has to be fate! Maybe I’ve been watching too much anime?!” Her voice ecstatic, she continued to ramble on and on.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki had to agree that, statistically speaking, this was indeed a miraculous occurrence, but it wasn’t quite so clear whether watching anime had anything to do with it.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yeah<span class="ellipse">…</span> But to fall while filming and then to have this super-rare encounter<span class="ellipse">…</span> <span class="ITAL">Inscrutable are the ways of heaven</span>, right?” The girl, overcome by deep emotion, gave him a forceful nod.</p>
<p class="TX">He didn’t really understand that last part, but there was something else more important bothering him.</p>
<p class="TX">“ ‘While filming’<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? What <span class="ITAL">were</span> you filming?”</p>
<p class="TX">“A little thing I’m calling <span class="ITAL">I (a Beginner) Try Parkour on the Roof of the School Building</span>!” She laughed.</p>
<p class="TX">“Talk about reckless<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Mushiki murmured sullenly.</p>
<p class="TX">The girl let out an amused chuckle. “Ha-ha-ha. Well, I figured a healing mage would help me out if I got hurt. Besides, <span class="ITAL">thrilling</span> videos are all the rage, you know? You’ve gotta grab life by the balls! Though I guess I don’t exactly have balls, huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">She broke out into another bout of chortled laughter. “Anyway, thanks. You saved my life! I’m Clara—Clara Tokishima. Nice to meetcha!” she said, extending her hand.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki was more than a little confused, but he likewise reached out in turn.</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki Kuga,” he said, shaking her hand. “Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 29. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_29" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Hmm?”</p>
<p class="TX">Clara broke into a sudden frown, as if she’d found something unusual about his self-introduction. “Mushiki Kuga? You mean <span class="ITAL">that</span> Mushiki Kuga?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Which Mushiki Kuga?”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, I mean, er<span class="ellipse">…</span> Huh? You’re being serious? You’re not pulling my leg here?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Um<span class="ellipse">…</span> I mean, I’ve always been Mushiki Kuga<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he replied uncertainly.</p>
<p class="TX">All at once, Clara tugged forcefully at his hand. “Mushiki Kuga! You’re like a celebrity! Wow, what a coincidence! Can I take a selfie with you?! Whoa! Awesome! Everyone’s gonna think I staged this!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Eh? Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>
<p class="TX">With no idea what she was talking about, he found himself squinting as Clara rattled on and on.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, when his confusion had risen considerably—</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse">…</span><span class="ITAL">Aiiieee</span><span class="ITAL_ellipse_exclamatory">…</span><span class="ITAL">!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">From somewhere in the distance, the rumble of footsteps approaching along with high-pitched screams rang out.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh?”</p>
<p class="TX">Clara must have noticed them as well, as she flashed him a strange look.</p>
<p class="TX">It wasn’t long before the sound of hurried footsteps grew even louder, and a voice became clearly audible.</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushikiii!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Me?”</p>
<p class="TX">By the time he’d recognized who was calling out his name, she was sprinting toward him at high speed, kicking up a huge cloud of dust.</p>
<p class="TX">Just before she reached him, like slamming on brakes, she skidded to a halt, her long hair, tied in twin ponytails, fluttering violently behind her.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 30. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_30" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Ruri?” Mushiki squeaked, gazing back at her.</p>
<p class="TX">Right. Appearing before him was none other than his own sister and classmate, Ruri Fuyajoh.</p>
<p class="TX">She had been seriously injured during the incident not too long ago, but with the treatment and care provided by the Garden’s medical department, she was once again able to move around freely—and was now perhaps a little <span class="ITAL">too</span> energetic.</p>
<p class="TX">“Here you are! What’s the meaning of this, Mushiki?! Explain yourself!” she exclaimed, leaning forward in excitement, grabbing him by the chest and shaking him back and forth.</p>
<p class="TX">“C-calm down. What’s going on<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he stammered.</p>
<p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse">…</span>Hmm?” Ruri turned her eyes in suspicion to the girl standing beside him—with whom he was still shaking hands.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wha—?”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, indignation and anger dyed her cheeks even redder than they had been a moment ago.</p>
<p class="TX">“Who’s this?! She looks like a ticking time bomb! What do you think you’re doing?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh. Even if you’re thinking it, it isn’t cool to say something like that to someone’s face,” Clara said, whistling in astonishment.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, having another thought, her tone turned regretful. “Ah<span class="ellipse">…</span> Wait, are you his girlfriend? Tch. I should have known he’d be taken.”</p>
<p class="TX">“G-g-g-g-g-girlfriend?!” Ruri cried out, her face a bright scarlet now. “Mushiki! Is <span class="ITAL">that</span> how you’re introducing me to people?!”</p>
<p class="TX">She shook him again, even stronger than before—though she did seem somehow happier this time.</p>
<p class="TX">“I—I didn’t say anything<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Then what’s all this talk about girlfriends?! I’m not kidding here! You and me, we’re brother and sister! We can’t go around breaking social morals!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? You’re siblings? She’s your sister?!” Clara exclaimed, her expression brightening. “Ah, now I get it. I thought you looked pretty similar. So that’s it. Heh, I guess I made a mistake there.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 31. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_31" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! Wh-wh-what are you saying<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! Don’t be stupid! His girlfriend?! I’m sorry I called you a ticking time bomb; do you want to get a juice or something?” Ruri screamed, her face crimson as she grabbed Mushiki by the collar and flung him back and forth even stronger and faster than before. To any outside observer, his head must have been little more than a blur.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh my <span class="ITAL">god</span>, Mushiki. You should have told me you had a cute little sister! Huh? Mushiki? Hello? Can you hear me in there?” Clara asked in a carefree manner.</p>
<p class="TX">“I-I’ll do anything<span class="ellipse">…</span> Just<span class="ellipse">…</span>stop her<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he stammered, unable to focus his vision as Ruri was still shaking him from side to side.</p>
<p class="TX">Clara, seeming to have struck on an idea, gestured wildly. “All right, got it. But if you want me to stop her, you’d better be fine with me taking one of her arms. If I do it, will you give me a reward?”</p>
<p class="TX">“F-fine<span class="ellipse">…</span> Just hurry<span class="ellipse">…</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Okay! Got it!” Clara said with a wink as she made a peace sign, before quietly approaching Ruri from behind.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">“Chomp!”</span></p>
<p class="TX">Without warning, she bit down on Ruri’s earlobe.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kyargh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri shuddered as she let go of Mushiki’s collar. “Wh-wh-what are you doing?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“I just thought you had such pretty ears is all.”</p>
<p class="TX">“A-are you crazy?!” Ruri cried, backing away as she held a hand against her bitten ear.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, who was still spinning around and feeling dizzy, fell on the ground on his back.</p>
<p class="TX">“Um<span class="ellipse">…</span> Ruri. So<span class="ellipse">…</span>what did you want<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he asked.</p>
<p class="TX">With that, her eyebrows twitched as though only now remembering why she was looking for her brother. “Ngh. Right<span class="ellipse">…</span> I guess that has to come first!”</p>
<p class="TX">With those words, she pulled her phone from her pocket and held the screen in front of him.</p>
