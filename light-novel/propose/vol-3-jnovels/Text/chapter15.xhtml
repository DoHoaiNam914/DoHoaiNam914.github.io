<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_105" aria-label=" Page 105. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">“About what?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">“Ao. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">I remember her being more accommodating in the past.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“Hmm…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Mushiki tilted his head, sinking deep into thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">Ao certainly hadn’t seemed the accommodating sort from what he had seen—but he hadn’t known her anywhere as long as Kuroe had. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">Perhaps something was amiss.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">“So you’re saying this talk of marriage has some deeper significance?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">he asked.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">“…Perhaps.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">Kuroe narrowed her eyes, having yet to figure out the answer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">“In any event, let’s continue this tomorrow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">If we push too hard, Ao may well toughen her stance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.5">There are still a few days left before the wedding ceremony. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.6">Let’s take our time and come up with a better plan.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">“Right… If I stay out too long, the Azures might catch on to us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">I’ll go back to my room for the rest of the day. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">They’ll probably have figured out I’m working with you now that they’ve seen us together in front of the headmistress, Madam Witch, but there’s no point giving them an excuse to crack down on me.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.4">Ruri turned to Mushiki and politely bowed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.5">“Excuse me, Madam Witch. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.6">I’ll drop by again tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">“Ah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">There’s still much to do. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">Get some rest.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“Yep!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">Ruri answered cheerfully as she left the room.</span></p>
<p class="SBORN"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1"><img class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg" alt=""/></span></p>
<p class="TX1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">“…Hmm.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">In the office of the Ark’s headmistress, Ao let out a small sigh in the hope of lifting her gloomy spirits.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">She had had a great deal on her mind lately: from the revival of the Ouroboros to the weakening of the Tower.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">There was also the appearance of two record-setting krakens at the same time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">The Azures and Saika may have managed to save the day…but Ao, who had been defending the seas for longer, couldn’t help having a bad presentiment.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">Yet despite all that, her biggest concern was something else entirely.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_106" aria-label=" Page 106. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“…I wouldn’t have expected Saika to come here in person.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Saika Kuozaki—the world’s most powerful mage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">Never in her wildest dreams would Ao have expected her to try so blatantly to interfere in her plans for Ruri’s future.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Even Ao, who wielded absolute power in the Ark, was at a disadvantage when it came to her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">After all this time, she still regretted going along with Ruri’s wishes and letting her attend the Garden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">Then again, it was no doubt the Garden that had made her into her present self, but it pained her to have to admit that.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“…And Mushiki, too? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">What is </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">he</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1"> doing here?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">she muttered bitterly, resting a hand against her head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">“It’s all falling apart…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">But at that moment, she stopped herself.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">No. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">To be more precise, she was forced to stop because of a sudden cough.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“…Gah… Geh…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">She pressed a hand against her mouth to restrain the violent attack.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">A few moments later—she pulled her hand away, her breathing ragged.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Reddish-black blood clung to her fingers.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“…I suppose we had better pick up the pace,” she muttered in a chilling voice as she clutched her bloodstained hand.</span></p>
