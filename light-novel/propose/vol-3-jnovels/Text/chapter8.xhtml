<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">And the video came to an end.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">“…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">“…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">After a moment of stunned silence, Mushiki exchanged looks with Kuroe and Hizumi.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">“…Clearly, something is up.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Kuroe was the first to speak; her brows were furrowed, her misgivings evident in her hushed tone.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">Mushiki and Hizumi nodded in agreement.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“…Yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">No matter how you look at it, something isn’t right.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">“Mm-hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">The video raises a lot of questions…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">Come to think of it, there were many odd things with that recording.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">First things first, it was unthinkable that Ruri would accept an arranged marriage so easily after making it clear that she was so strongly opposed to it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">On top of that, why would she use Ao’s familiar to send a message, and a video recording no less? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">It would have been much more natural if she had simply called them.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">But above all else, there was one thing that could not be overlooked.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">“…Impossible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">She wouldn’t send a message like that without saying anything to Saika.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“…She didn’t mention Madam Witch at all.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“That’s just it.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Mushiki and Hizumi both said simultaneously, while Kuroe likewise wore a look of amazement.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“I mean, you know Ruri.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“This </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">is</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1"> Ruri we’re talking about.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">“…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">Once more, the two of them spoke over each other with the same remarks.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">There were several peculiarities with that video, but that was by far the one that stood out the most.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Assuming—just for argument’s sake—that Ruri went to see the main </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_42" aria-label=" Page 42. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">family with the full intention of refusing the marriage but ended up falling head over heels in love with her prospective partner… In that case, she </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">might</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1"> hypothetically become open to the suggestion.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">But getting married would have a profound impact on her life, especially as the Fuyajohs seemed to be a prominent and well-respected family. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">They could have all sorts of peculiar customs. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">The option of dropping out of the Garden might have also potentially come up.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">If the main family was located somewhere with poor cellular service, it wasn’t unthinkable that she would contact them through a recorded video.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">However.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">However…</span></i></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Even if they were to turn a blind eye to all those possibilities…</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">There was absolutely no way that Ruri Fuyajoh, the honorary president of the (unofficial) Saika Kuozaki Fan Club, wouldn’t have uttered so much as a word about her dear Madam Witch</span><span class="ellipse_exclamatory"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">!</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">If she really did have to leave the Garden because of some unavoidable dilemma, she would have tearfully told them about her situation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">She would have expressed her gratitude to Saika without end, reminisced about her memories of Saika, and would have sung a song that she had written herself with a video of Saika playing in the background, telling them how reluctant she was to let everything go. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">Then, at the end, sobbing uncontrollably, she would probably have had to be dragged off-screen.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“There’s no way you could fit all that on a single memory card,” Mushiki murmured.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“Mm-hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">No doubt about it,” Hizumi added.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“You’re very confident.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Kuroe sighed.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">But even if she had followed a different line of reasoning, Kuroe had also deemed the recording to be incredibly suspicious. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">And so, clearing her throat to regain her composure, she began: “At first glance, this does look like Ruri. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">However, I don’t think it would be impossible, either with magic or with technology, to forge a video of this kind… In addition, we cannot deny the possibility that Ruri </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_43" aria-label=" Page 43. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">herself is being manipulated in some way, or that she might have been brainwashed.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“What</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">?!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“No</span><span class="ellipse_exclamatory"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Both Mushiki and Hizumi broke into stern frowns.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“Brainwashing… Would they really go that far?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">Hizumi asked.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">“It’s only a possibility. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">However, Ruri is likely the greatest talent among the current members of the Fuyajoh clan. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">As the headmistress of her own school, I doubt it was the family head’s intention to have her enrolled at a rival institute. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.4">It’s possible that she is using this as an opportunity to take drastic action.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">“…We need to go help her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Where’s this head of the family located anyway?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">Mushiki demanded with a scowl.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">Kuroe shook her head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">“Calm down, Mushiki. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">It isn’t going to be that easy.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">“Why not?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">“The mansion of the main Fuyajoh family is situated within the mage-training institute Hollow Ark. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">So to get there, you would first need to board the Ark itself.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">“Board the Ark</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">So what’s the problem? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.3">I know I’m still inexperienced as a mage, but it’s not like students from other schools can’t enter?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">A large number of students from the Tower had entered the Garden during the exhibition match. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">Even if security had been tightened somewhat following the incident with Clara, it was difficult to imagine that other students would be denied entry at all costs.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">But Kuroe continued in a soft voice, “Please listen calmly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">Hollow Ark…is the only all-girls school for mages.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">“Huh</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">Mushiki said with a grimace.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">“From the teachers to the students to the administrative staff, the school is made up entirely of women. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">I can’t speak for the grounds of the Fuyajoh residence, but at least when it comes to the academy itself, men are not permitted to enter.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">“Th-that’s…” Mushiki clenched his fists.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">“In that case, I’ll—” Hizumi said.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_44" aria-label=" Page 44. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">“Yes, that may indeed be possible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">However, and I don’t mean to sound harsh in saying this, even if you go to the Ark, I don’t think you will be able to accomplish much, Hizumi. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.3">Your opponents will be the Fuyajoh family, experts in the field of magic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.4">In all likelihood, they will refuse to meet with you.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">“Th-then what should we</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">Hizumi’s voice trailed off.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">But Kuroe was no doubt right in that regard.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Mushiki caught his breath, then slammed his fists on his desk in frustration.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">“What </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">are</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1"> we supposed to do, then? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">Are you saying we should just sit back and watch while she gets married off against her will?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">“…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Kuroe, deep in thought, fell silent for a long time.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">At last, she seemed to make up her mind.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">“No… A delicate matter such as this needs to be entrusted to the right person.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">“The right person</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">Mushiki said, then his eyes widened in comprehension.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">“Indeed,” Kuroe continued. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">“Someone they won’t be able to refuse entry to, someone who can negotiate directly with Headmistress Fuyajoh, and—should worst come to worst—fight her way through the entirety of the Fuyajoh family.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">“But someone who can do all that…” Hizumi frowned.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Mushiki, however, nodded along with newfound confidence.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">“There’s only one person who fits the bill.”</span></p>
<p class="SBORN"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1"><img class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg" alt=""/></span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">The moment that Mushiki set foot in the Engineering Room on the third floor of the Garden’s central administration building, the technicians gathered there all turned his way, their breath catching in their throats.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">But that wasn’t an unreasonable response. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">After all, right now, Mushiki was—</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Yes, he was currently Saika Kuozaki, the Garden’s headmistress.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">After that last discussion, Mushiki left the classroom, received a magical power-up kiss from Kuroe in a separate empty room, and returned as Saika.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">“Ah, please continue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">Don’t mind me,” he urged the technicians, who had stopped working, to rise to their feet and bow.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">Inside, his heart was pounding, but he managed to reply with a relaxed smile.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">“By the way,” Mushiki murmured to change the subject as he glanced out the window. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.2">“I’ve been wondering this for a while now, but where exactly </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">is</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1"> the Ark?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">It had already been close to an hour since they had left the Garden, the scenery outside having changed from residential areas and buildings to abundant nature.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">Kuroe likewise turned to look at the passing scenery. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.2">“We will be arriving shortly.”</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">It was hard to believe that another one of Japan’s five mage-training schools could be located just an hour’s drive from the Garden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.2">At the very least, he would have expected it to be in another region, like the other three were.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">Perhaps sensing his unvoiced question, Kuroe spoke in a quiet voice: “We are extremely fortunate, Lady Saika. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.2">The Ark only comes this close to the Garden two or three times a year.”</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">Mushiki blinked in confusion when the car came to a stop. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.2">The driver, stepping out from the front seat, moved to open the back door.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">“We have arrived, Madam Witch. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.2">Please,” he said with a reverent bow.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">“Ah, thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">To be honest, his head was still filled with questions, but he couldn’t afford to let them show. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.2">And so, with exceedingly elegant movements, he alighted from the vehicle.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">“Hmm,” he murmured.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">Spreading out before him was a field of blue.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">The strong scent of the sea hit his nose. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.2">Sunlight gleamed on the surface of the water. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.3">Waves sounded intermittently, and the cries of the seagulls tickled his eardrums.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">Yes… He was standing before the sea.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">Strictly speaking, it wasn’t a beautiful sandy beach like you might see in a promotional photo of a tourist spot, but rather a corner of a deserted wharf. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.2">It looked more like the kind of place where workers might unload cargo from a ship, or where mafia groups might engage in backroom deals. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.3">Certainly not the kind of beach where you might find families in bathing suits.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">“This way, Lady Saika,” Kuroe urged, having stepped out of the car first, a pair of tote bags in her hands.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">He didn’t like forcing her to carry his luggage, but it couldn’t be helped if they were to show a typical relationship between a lady and her attendant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.2">And so, deciding that he would thank her later, he followed a couple of steps behind.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">A strange sensation passed through his body as he approached the end of the wharf.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">It was similar to what he had felt when entering the Garden—he was passing through a barrier, magic designed to conceal something from the outside.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">By the time he recognized it for what it was—</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">A small boat had appeared before his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">To be precise, he wasn’t quite sure whether </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">boat</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1"> was the right word. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.2">It was a strange vessel, with a vague capsule-like design. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.3">But the way it floated in the water had him reaching for the closest word in his vocabulary.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">Then—</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">“Saika Kuozaki, headmistress of Void’s Garden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.2">We’ve been expecting you.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">Mushiki turned to face the voice that had suddenly called out to him.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">Standing at the end of the wharf was a strange-looking figure—a young woman in a white sailor suit and a cloak resembling a haori. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.2">Her epaulettes and realizing device indicated that she was a mage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.3">When had she appeared there? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.4">She must have been dispatched from the Ark.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">As for her facial expression—Mushiki couldn’t read it.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">That wasn’t to say that the figure was impersonal, lacking in individuality. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.2">But her face was hidden behind a fox mask with a curious pattern engraved on it.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">He was startled for a moment, but it was common enough for mages to dress oddly—and above all, Saika Kuozaki wouldn’t have allowed herself to be taken aback by this.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">“I will serve as your guide during your stay with us,” she said with a tranquil voice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.2">“Please call me Asagi.”</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">Mushiki assumed this meant that they would be entering the vessel, and so nodding his head, he climbed aboard, Kuroe following a step behind him.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">Even from inside, the </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">boat</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1"> was strangely built. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.2">A smooth and rounded transparent outer wall surrounded the seats, reminding Mushiki of an imaginary spaceship that he had once seen in a picture book.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">“Let’s proceed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.2">Please be careful. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.3">It may get a little bumpy,” Asagi said as she sat down at the pilot’s seat and reached for the touch-panel console.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">Then, with a low-pitched whirr, various parts of the </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">boat</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1"> were infused with a faint glow of magical energy.</span></p>

<p class="TX1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">“Ah…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">After disembarking in the Ark, Mushiki let out a sigh both of admiration and of amazement at the sight spreading out before him.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">He was staring at a circular city with a magnificent chalky keep at its center. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.2">The streets were laid out as if by design—as indeed they were—running in orderly rows with buildings of various sizes lining the long avenues.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">A thick dome of air covered the mass of buildings, as though they were inside a giant goldfish bowl placed upside down on the seabed.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">Looking up, Mushiki could spot countless schools of fish swimming under the shimmering sun, appearing as if they were flying in the sky.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">It was a fantastic, unreal sight.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">If the dragon’s palace from the tale of Urashima Taro had been a real place, it must certainly have looked something like this.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1">“…Lady Saika.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.2">Kuroe called out his name.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">“Hmm</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.2">Ah,” Mushiki answered, turning his gaze back ahead.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">Right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.2">He couldn’t go around acting like a fresh-faced tourist while in Saika’s body.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">Then, as though waiting for him to come back to his senses, Asagi offered him a polite bow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.2">“Allow me to take you to see the headmistress. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.3">Your luggage will be delivered to your accommodations, so please leave your bags here.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1">“I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.2">Lead the way,” Mushiki said, following along with Kuroe.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">They made their way down a sequence of beautifully paved roads toward the keep-like school building in the center of the city.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1">Along the way, he spotted countless students in the Ark’s white sailor uniform. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.2">Come to think of it, Ruri had been wearing the same kind of outfit in the video that they had received.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1">Consistent with what he had heard about the Ark being an all-girls school, he spotted only women… The thought that he was making use </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_54" aria-label=" Page 54. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.1">of Saika’s body to intrude upon this sanctuary of the opposite sex left him feeling like he was up to no good.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1">At that moment—</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">“Huh</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">Mushiki’s eyes twitched as one girl, wearing a mask and cloak atop her school uniform, stood out from all the rest.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">“That mask and cloak…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1">While the pattern on the mask was ever so slightly different, it remained remarkably similar to the one worn by the girl leading Mushiki and Kuroe.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">“Yes,” Asagi said in response to his unfinished question. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.2">“We are the Azures, the Ark’s disciplinary committee. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.3">Our primary duties are to maintain security and public morals here at the Ark, but we’re also, well, jacks-of-all-trades, you might say. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.4">If you need anything during your stay, please don’t hesitate to tell one of us.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1">“Hmm…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">It seemed that their guide’s mask and cloak weren’t her own unique clothing style but were, rather, part of a uniform. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.2">No doubt each school had its own special characteristics in that regard. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.3">Mushiki nodded in understanding as they continued on their way.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1">A few minutes into their tour of this underwater aquarium, they arrived at the top floor of the school building enshrined in the center of the city—at the headmistress’s office.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">“Ma’am. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.2">I’ve brought Saika Kuozaki,” the masked girl said.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">With that, the double doors slowly swung open.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">The girl remained by the door in a state of awe.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.1">Likewise, Kuroe took a step back as though to say that she would wait here.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.1">“…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.1">From this point on, the discussion would be between the heads of the two schools.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">But Saika Kuozaki wouldn’t lose her head in this situation, so Mushiki stepped inside, doing his best not to let his apprehension show.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1">Inside, the space was set out like an audience room, the design </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_55" aria-label=" Page 55. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1">similar to the fortresslike building’s exterior. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.2">At the back of the room was a raised platform, with a bamboo blind sectioning it off from the lower area. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.3">It was completely different from Saika’s office, which was filled with countless shelves of books.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1">“Heh-heh, welcome. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.2">It’s been a long time, Saika. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.3">I almost died of loneliness, not seeing you for a full week,” said Ao Fuyajoh, the headmistress of the Ark, from behind the blind.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1">“Apologies,” Mushiki responded with a gentle smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.2">“It took me a good amount of time to find the right tea leaves that’ll match your standards.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.1">“Oh dear.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.2">Ao smiled in amusement.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.1">On the surface, they had exchanged friendly greetings with a touch of humor.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1">But Mushiki could feel the tension in the room—it was so strong that it made his chest hurt.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">This wasn’t his first conversation with Ao; they had met before at a conference consisting of the principals from each mage-training institute—as like-minded allies, so to speak.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">Now, however, he had been forced to set foot in the Ark—her territory—to retrieve Ruri, whom they were unable to contact.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">He would be more than happy if they could come to an amicable solution. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.2">But seeing as it was Ao who had decided on Ruri’s marriage, the possibility of a hostile reception was far from zero.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">Ao, too, was no doubt aware of all this.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">Kuroe had described her as far from stupid. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.2">She was the kind of woman who wouldn’t feel the slightest discomfort at a sudden visit from Saika.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">But Mushiki still lacked sufficient information. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.2">He had been warned not to say anything until they knew what was really going on here.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1">Then again, another way of phrasing all this was that they wouldn’t hesitate to take appropriate measures once everything was revealed.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">“So what’s with the sudden offer about giving a special lecture? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.2">The girl who received your request got quite the surprise.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_56" aria-label=" Page 56. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.1">“Not at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.2">I think opportunities for our schools to exchange ideas are invaluable.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.1">“Even though you rejected my previous request?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.1">“…Ha-ha-ha… Did I?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.1">This was the first he had heard of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.2">He gave an empty smile to conceal his surprise.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.1">“In this state of emergency, it’s vital for all mage-training institutes to join hands. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.2">Wouldn’t you say?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.1">“Well, let’s leave it at that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.2">Irrespective of your reasons, I welcome the offer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.3">It isn’t every day we have an opportunity like this.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.4">With that, Ao snapped her folding fan shut. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.5">“Say, Saika?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.1">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.1">“The resurrection of the Mythologia, the Ouroboros…is a serious situation, no? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.2">Moreover, its whereabouts remain unknown. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.3">It might be mass-producing Immortals even as we speak.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">“…Yes, that’s right.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.1">“During such a critical time as this, no mage would be foolish enough to poke her nose into the affairs of another’s family and home out of mere curiosity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.2">No?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.3">Ao asked, lowering her voice.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1">“—.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">Mushiki’s chest tightened at these words, which were so at odds with the lighthearted greeting they had exchanged a moment ago.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">But Saika Kuozaki wouldn’t let this fluster her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.2">So Mushiki spread open his hands, taking on a generous tone to conceal his distress. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.3">“Of course not… Clara Tokishima has turned on our people. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.4">I’m vindictive at heart, as you know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.5">I will repay her in full; you can be sure of that.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1">“Oh my… How stalwart of you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.2">But I guess that’s how you’ve always been. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.3">It’s frightening at times… I wouldn’t want you as my enemy.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">“Ha-ha. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.2">Rest easy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.3">There’s no way we could end up as enemies, is there? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.4">Not unless you hurt any of my beloved students,” he said, his tone carrying a hint of menace.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1">“Oh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.2">Indeed,” Ao said with a faint smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.3">“On that point, you can rest assured. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.4">I would never seek to do such a thing… But know this, Saika. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.5">It seems that the Azures are a little on edge, given the previous incident. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.6">I know you have no intention of doing so, but you would be doing me a great favor if you refrained from any actions that could invite misunderstanding.”</span></p>
