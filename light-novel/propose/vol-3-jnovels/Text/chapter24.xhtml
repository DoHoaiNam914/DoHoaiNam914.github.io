<p class="COTX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Ruri had always loved her brother.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Perhaps that was because he was always kind to her, or maybe because he considered her adorable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">Whenever they went shopping together, he would offer to carry the heavy bags, and he would always give her the biggest piece of candy.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">To Ruri, he was a gentle older brother, someone who had been by her side for as long as she could remember, always looking out for her.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">And she loved him for it.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">That was when she realized—she couldn’t imagine a world without him.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">But if there had ever been a single defining moment—</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">Yes, it could only be that time seven years ago.</span></p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">She remembered his back.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Small, but to her, it was large as he stepped forward to protect her.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">For a moment, the figure before her hadn’t been that of her familiar brother.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">The reason was simple—a crown-like mass of light now hovered above the young Mushiki’s head.</span></p>
<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_178" aria-label=" Page 178. "></span>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Ruri and Mushiki were born into a family of magicians called the Fuyajoh, but to be perfectly honest, neither had trained particularly diligently during their childhood.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">This was because their mother was opposed to the rest of the family’s stance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">As such, they had resided in the so-called </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">outside world</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1"> away from the Ark, where their relatives lived. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">Their lives were almost the same as those of regular people.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">They went to a normal elementary school, played with normal friends, and ate normal meals—and while they did on the rare occasion have one or two strange guests, and they did occasionally make their way to some strange locale for one event or another, as far as Ruri and Mushiki were concerned, such trips were like nothing more than the normal practice of returning to one’s hometown for the Bon festival and New Year’s.</span></p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">That day, however, Ruri’s world changed completely.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">An annihilation factor had appeared near where the family lived.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Annihilation factor</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">—a catch-all term for entities capable of destroying the world.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">If such events could be overcome during the window for reversible annihilation, their effects wouldn’t be recorded in the world’s history.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">As such, the destruction, the loss of their family home, the ruined landscape—all should have been returned to normal once a mage defeated the rampaging enemy.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">But although Ruri was lacking in skills, she was still a mage.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">Her wounds wouldn’t have returned to normal, and any lost limbs wouldn’t have grown back.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">If she had died, her life would have been irrevocably lost.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Yet—</span></p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“…Are you hurt, Ruri?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">The figure looking over his shoulder as he asked this was none other than her brother, Mushiki.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">His gentle smile was the same as ever. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">It was hard to imagine </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_179" aria-label=" Page 179.

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Mushiki flashed her a quiet smile, gently stroking the back of her head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">“Don’t worry. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">I’ll protect you, Ruri.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">His pleasant touch helped ease the chill that had locked her in place, a sense of relief flowing through her heart.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">But all she could do was repeat her brother’s name, her tears never stopping.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">There was so much that she wanted to say.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">So many feelings that she wanted to share with him.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">But the young Ruri didn’t know how to put them into words.</span></p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Now, she finally understood.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">Ah—this was what she had felt back then.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Ruri had fallen in love with him, her heart—</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">She woke with a start—jolting upright and glancing around.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">She was in a large Japanese-style room, in a comfortable futon laid out on high-quality tatami floor.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">There could be no mistaking it—this was the room she had been assigned to after moving to the Ark.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">Her body felt heavy—exhausted as if she had just finished a long sprint up a mountain road before nodding off to sleep.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">As she became more awake, her memories began to return to her.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">The last missing memory fell into place with a click.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">Recalling everything that had happened, she jumped up onto her feet.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Even inside the Ark, surrounded by its huge wall of air, the wind was blowing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">Apparently, there were artificial air currents within the dome of the underwater city to keep the air from getting stagnant.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Mushiki glanced around. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">There was a cemetery behind the main Fuyajoh residence, with tombstones in orderly lines. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">Each of them was decorated with fresh flowers, the paths running between them clean and well maintained.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">“It isn’t an entirely accurate description, but these are essentially the graves of former family heads… For two hundred years, the Leviathan’s curse has invaded my life. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">This is where I mourn the corpses of previous Ao Fuyajohs after choosing my successor,” Ao explained, making her way down the gravel path with Asagi by her side.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">“Apologies for keeping you waiting… I had to report the news to my children first.”</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Ao responded with a weak smile, looked quietly down at the nearest grave, and remained that way in silent prayer.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">After a long moment, she slowly raised her face, glancing around with a smile.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">“…Perhaps you think me a fool? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">Or do you scorn me as a hypocrite?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.3">she asked.</span></p>
