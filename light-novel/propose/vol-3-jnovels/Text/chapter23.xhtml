<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_172" aria-label=" Page 172. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">Until just a few seconds ago, that is.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Mushiki had so brilliantly fulfilled his role in battle and had been successfully rescued by Ao’s second substantiation.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">He must have exhausted his magic to break the curse. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">His transparent sword had already vanished from his hands, as had the world crest glimmering above his head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">On top of that, he seemed to be covered all over in wounds.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Despite that special technique of his, he was, after all, still a novice mage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">Unable to even wield flight magic without Ao’s help, he would no doubt have plummeted straight into the ocean below.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Yet in spite of all that, he had single-handedly attacked the mighty Mythologia.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">And it had all been for her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">To break the curse that had been placed over the Fuyajoh family.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Ah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">The situation might have been different, but here it was—the very scene that Ruri had longed for as a child.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">“Ah</span><span class="ellipse_comma"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">,” she breathed, releasing an outpouring of emotion.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">To be honest, she was still disoriented by the inexplicable phenomenon of Mushiki transforming into Saika, and Saika transforming into Mushiki. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">She couldn’t begin to comprehend the nature of what she had seen.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">But deep in her heart, she was relieved that it was them.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">Saika had paved the way forward—and Mushiki had guided her down it.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">The two individuals she respected most had gone to such extreme lengths for her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">She couldn’t dawdle here worrying forever.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">I’m glad I studied under Saika.</span></i></p>
<p class="TX"><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">I’m glad Mushiki’s my brother.</span></i></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">From here on out, the task was hers.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">While its curse had been lifted, the Leviathan itself was still very much alive. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">Its impossibly long body, resembling nothing if not a skeletal fossil, writhed in agony.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">If she failed here, Saika’s trust in her, Ao’s confidence, and Mushiki’s love all would have been for naught. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">She couldn’t stand that thought.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_173" aria-label=" Page 173. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">But it was mysterious.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“Ha-ha…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">Her heart now knew no pressure or fear.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">There was only the greatest of emotions, the passion that drove her.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">Lifting a hand into the air, she drew an insignia with burning, intense emotions.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">“…Day for day, night for night.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">A three-layered world crest shaped like a demon’s head appeared above her—joined next by another fang-like stroke.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">“Until eternity and the life to come, there will be no time for darkness to spread.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">The naginata in her hands and the armor protecting her body were both bathed in gleaming fire.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">As if responding to this change, the ocean floor began to emit a bluish-white glow.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">“Now behold! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">The citadel of eternal night!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">She cried the name of the strongest technique she had:</span></p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">“Fourth Substantiation: World of Infinite Nightless Days!”</span></p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">A moment later—a huge fortress appeared, tearing through the raging sea.</span></p>
<div class="LI_SB1"></div>
<p class="TX1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“Ah…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Lying on the back of a bird of flame, Mushiki looked on, dumbfounded, at the scene transpiring before him.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">It was a fantastic sight.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">A magnificent castle tower, a blue bonfire scattering sparks like petals, emerged out of the darkness. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">All at once, the dark night was painted over, the thick clouds and the leaden sea replaced by brilliant moonlight.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">The Leviathan, thrashing around underwater and letting out wails of agony, was exposed to the void, being pushed upward by the rising fortress.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_174" aria-label=" Page 174. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“Ruri</span><span class="ellipse_exclamatory"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Mushiki called out.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">The reason was simple. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">Around her in every direction, countless </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">spheres</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1"> of water had appeared.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">If they fired at her all at once, it would be well-nigh impossible for her to shoot them all down.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">Yet—</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“…It’s okay.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">Ruri, bathed in divine light, gave a carefree smile.</span></p>
<div class="LI_SB1"></div>
<p class="TNI"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“—.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">Amid the light, Ruri was filled with a sense of omnipotence.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Her fourth substantiation—the strongest level and the ultimate goal of any modern-day mage.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">Certainly, there was a great deal of risk involved when pushing oneself this far. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">It wasn’t something that could just be used whenever the fancy struck.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">But once manifested—</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">“No one can defeat me! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Not except for Madam Witch!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">she shouted to the heavens, wielding the new power that flowed through her body.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">At that moment, the Leviathan’s </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">spheres</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1"> erupted into balls of light.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">They must have numbered at least a couple of hundred, and she couldn’t possibly hope to eradicate them all just with her Luminous Blade.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">But she didn’t need weapons now.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">With a blinding flash, the jets of water struck her from all sides.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">But—</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">“Hmm…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">Her lips twisted into a sneer as she accepted the bombardment head on.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Though her entire body was pierced by barrages of cutting water, and even though a single </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">sphere</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1"> ought to have been fatal, she was completely unharmed.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">And that was as it should be—all thanks to her fourth substantiation.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Having activated it, she could freely fix the state of anything and everything within range at will.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_175" aria-label=" Page 175. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">In other words, while using her fourth substantiation, she could maintain her unharmed state no matter what kind of attack was dealt to her.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">And </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">fixing a state</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1"> didn’t end there.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">“Aaarrrggghhh!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Launching herself into the sky, she slashed at the Leviathan with her Luminous Blade.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">In an instant, the tapering sword of blue light sliced off the titan’s arms, the Leviathan’s wails echoing all around.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">The Leviathan had been resurrected with Clara’s powers—and if Ruri’s experiences in their previous encounter under the Garden’s library were anything to go by, its body would continue to regenerate so long as Clara didn’t lift the spell.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">But now that she had </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">assured</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1"> the severed state of the Leviathan’s limbs, they plunged silently into the sea without regenerating.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">And that wasn’t all.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">Blue flames spread along the creature’s shoulder where her blade had hit it, and sparks of fire shot down its long body.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Under regular circumstances, those flames would abate within moments.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">But Ruri had made it so that they would never go out, and so now they enveloped the creature’s body.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Of course, this state would continue only for as long as her magical energy lasted and her fourth substantiation was in effect.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">But the Leviathan itself seemed to have been only partially resurrected within Clara’s fourth substantiation.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">“Let’s see which of us can last the longest, you evil cow.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Ruri stared down at the burning Leviathan with a ferocious grin, bathed in the light of the flames ripping through it.</span></p>
