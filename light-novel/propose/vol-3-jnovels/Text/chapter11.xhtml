<p class="COTX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Even among mage-training institutions, each school had its own unique characteristics that were influenced by their location.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Hollow Ark, which journeyed through the world’s oceans, often dealt with annihilation factors that arose in the sea. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">For this reason, the layout of the school’s training grounds was quite different to those at the Garden.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">The fields consisted of sand, and they even went so far as to replicate the ebb and flow of the waves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">Seawater had eroded a portion of the dome of air surrounding the Ark, giving the training area the appearance of a beach or bathing area.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">And now, at that very training ground—</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“Um, this </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">is</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1"> the right place, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">This is where it said to go on WeSPER.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">“I knew it! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">It </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">was</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1"> Madam Witch I saw yesterday!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Several excited students had gathered.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Looking closely, Mushiki also spotted the occasional older mage—teachers, no doubt. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">In fact, the area was laid out almost like an event venue.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">But that was understandable.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">After all, today was the day of Saika Kuozaki’s special guest lecture.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_68" aria-label=" Page 68. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“It seems like a big hit,” he observed, peeking out the window of the small building set aside as a waiting room at the corner of the beach.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“Indeed,” Kuroe answered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">“It’s rare that one has the opportunity to see a mage on the level of a school principal give a live demonstration. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">Even more so when they visit from outside one’s own campus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.4">And especially when it’s you, Lady Saika. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.5">It’s only natural that you’re the center of attention.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Well, Saika Kuozaki was renowned as the headmistress of Void’s Garden and the world’s strongest mage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">With her past achievements, she was literally a living legend. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">It would be hard to find a mage who hadn’t heard her name.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">That being said, the crowd was smaller than Mushiki had expected…</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Only a limited number of students had been selected to attend.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Given that a mage of her caliber had gone to the trouble of visiting the Ark to give a special lecture, it would only have been natural for any and all aspiring mages to want to participate.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">That said, here they were.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">To top things off, there was something else bothering him.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“By the way, Kuroe,” he began.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“What’s with this outfit?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">he asked, staring down at himself.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">He was presently wearing a sporty halter bikini.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">The tight swimsuit hugged Saika’s proportions perfectly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">Her body was truly a work of art. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">In fact, Saika’s figure was so beautiful that Mushiki had hardly been able to bring himself to move away from the mirror since changing into the bikini.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">It wasn’t just Mushiki who wore a swimsuit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Kuroe and the other girls gathered in the training grounds were all dressed similarly, though their swimsuits were of different designs. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">Combined with the location, it had the air of a seaside school rather than a special lecture.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Kuroe, however, remained composed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">“Even at the Garden, we change into sportswear when we use the training arenas, do we not?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">she asked pointedly.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_69" aria-label=" Page 69. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“Ah, right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">Yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“Precisely.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“Talk about huge regional differences, though,” Mushiki said, overcome with a strange feeling.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">Kuroe tilted her head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">“You don’t like it?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“No, I think it’s wonderful. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">In fact, I’d like to introduce this kind of thing at the Garden.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“People will make a fuss if you were to lose your mind, Lady Saika. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Please refrain from doing anything rash,” Kuroe said flatly.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Mushiki nodded. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">That </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">would</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1"> cause a commotion.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“Anyway, I get it… I was just a little surprised. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">The design isn’t bad. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.3">Yours looks good, too, Kuroe.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“Thank you,” she replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">She sounded nonchalant, but something about her response suggested that she wasn’t entirely indifferent.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">At that moment, there was a knock on the door to the waiting room.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“Come in,” Mushiki said—and with that, a young woman stepped inside.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">She was wearing a mask and cloak over her uniform, clearly marking her as an Azure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">From the pattern on the mask, Mushiki recognized her as Asagi from yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“Excuse me…Headmistress Kuozaki. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Explain all this,” she demanded in a disapproving tone.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">Mushiki couldn’t read her expression because of the mask, but he could sense that she had on a deep frown.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">“Explain what? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">There was no specified format for my lecture, so I decided to give a practical class. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">Here, we can gather more students than in a classroom or auditorium, wouldn’t you agree</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">Is there a problem?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">“…” Asagi fell silent.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Yes, this was the plan that Kuroe had suggested yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">The Ark was working to prevent contact between him and Ruri, but so long as Saika was visiting the school as a special lecturer, they couldn’t stop him from teaching the students. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">If he was ever going to have a chance to reach Ruri, this was going to be it.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_70" aria-label=" Page 70. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">If it was held in a classroom or auditorium, there was a high possibility that Ruri would be kept away, ostensibly for lack of seating.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">For that reason, they decided to do a practical lesson open to all, with no limit to the number of students permitted to attend.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">They had made sure to broadcast the event beforehand, and Mushiki had asked Hildegarde to announce the class on WeSPER, a social networking website used exclusively by mages.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">There was little in the way of entertainment at the Ark, and as more than ninety percent of all mages were said to have an account on WeSPER, it would only be a matter of time before everyone at the school learned of the lecture.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">Even if Ruri’s cell phone had been taken away from her, it would be practically impossible to keep her out of the loop once word spread to every corner of the school.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">“…This is only a class. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">Please refrain from conversing any more than necessary,” Asagi said bitterly.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">“Oh, I understand,” Mushiki responded with an exaggerated nod. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">“Let’s get started, Kuroe.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">“Understood.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">With that, Mushiki exited the waiting room and went straight to the white sandy beach.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">“…Ah! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">Look, everyone! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.3">There she is!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.4">bellowed the first student to notice Saika, pointing excitedly his way.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">Then, like a crashing wave, the other girls let out a roar of cheers.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">“Is that Madam Witch?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">From the Garden?!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">“She’s even more beautiful than I imagined!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">“Ah, she just looked this way!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">And so on, each voice more animated than the last.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Though overwhelmed for a moment by the attention, Mushiki didn’t feel at all bad that Saika was proving to be so popular. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">He fixed the audience with a relaxed smile and waved in their direction.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">“</span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">Kyaaarrrggghhh!</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">” the girls cried out at the top of their lungs—as if he was a celebrity.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">The next moment—</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_71" aria-label=" Page 71. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">“—.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Mushiki’s eyebrows twitched slightly.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">Behind the girls, he had spotted Ruri.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">He and Kuroe exchanged glances for a moment, along with the slightest of nods.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">“…Looks like we’ve cleared the first hurdle,” he whispered.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">“Yes,” Kuroe murmured. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">“But I don’t think we can afford to be too optimistic.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">She was right, of course. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">It was clear as day that Ruri wasn’t in a sound state of mind.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">“Indeed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">If she was her usual self, she’d be up there in the front row, camera at the ready, crying out, </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Ah, Madam Witch! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">You’re so gorgeous! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">You’re like a brilliant, glittering star! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.4">So radiant, I can’t even sleep at night!</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1"> And she’d be taking photos nonstop.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">“That’s a very specific example.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">“I can’t even begin to guess how she’s managing to stand there so calmly.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">“Perhaps you’re imagining things. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">One might say she’s being more decorous now than she usually is.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">The two of them proceeded across the beach while talking, soon reaching the front of the crowd.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">Then, after waiting for everyone’s enthusiasm to subside, he introduced himself in a clear and calm voice, “Greetings, everyone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">I’m Saika Kuozaki, headmistress of Void’s Garden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.3">As fortune would have it, I’m joining you today here at the Ark as a special lecturer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.4">We’ll only be together for a short while, but I look forward to showing you some new tricks.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Like that, the students burst into excitement all over again, the swimsuit-clad girls throwing out their chests as they jumped for joy.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">It was an incredibly stimulating sight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">If Mushiki had been his usual self, he might have averted his gaze so as not to risk getting too excited and increasing the amount of magical energy leaking from his body.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">However—</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_72" aria-label=" Page 72. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">“…Hmm.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">His lips twisted into a dauntless grin.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">The reason was simple. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">He had already witnessed a stronger weapon of mass destruction—Saika in a swimsuit—in the waiting room mirror a few minutes ago, so he had become somewhat immune to the sight of other girls (incidentally, it had been necessary for him to take two power-up kisses from Kuroe as well).</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">“Now then,” he continued with a relaxed expression, “let’s begin with warm-up exercises. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">Could you form pairs of two?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">“Yes!”</span></i></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">The students were quick and eager to respond to his instructions, forming pairs with their friends.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">The area around Ruri erupted with an explosion of noise.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">“Lady Ruri, if you don’t mind, won’t you partner with me?!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">“No, no, with me!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">“No, no, no, no, choose </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">me</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">It seemed that the students were bickering over who would be paired with her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">Yet even in the midst of all this, Ruri maintained an expressionless doll-like look, responding only with a noncommittal “Hmm…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">But Mushiki had already anticipated this development after witnessing how those hangers-on had acted around her the day before.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">“Oh dear, it looks like you can’t decide on a partner. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">Then there’s no helping it,” he said with a soft smile as he approached the group. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.3">Then, pointing toward Ruri, he said, “You—I suppose you’ll have to pair up with me.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">Perhaps it was just his imagination, but he sensed that Ruri’s facial muscles twitched slightly in response.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">“Headmistress Kuozaki!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">sounded a voice from behind him—Asagi.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">He had also expected this.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">“What is it?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">he asked, glancing back with an exaggerated look over his shoulder. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.3">“Surely a member of the disciplinary committee wouldn’t interfere with a </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">class</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">he said, emphasizing the final word.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">“…Ngh,” Asagi grunted in frustration. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">Though clearly unhappy with this development, she said nothing more.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_73" aria-label=" Page 73. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">Mushiki turned back to Ruri and extended his hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">“How about it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.3">You don’t want to?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">“…No…that’s not it… I would be honored</span><span class="ellipse_comma"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">,” she answered with a blank expression and a faltering voice.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">The next moment, the other students burst out in excitement.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">“Lady Ruri and Madam Witch together</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">?!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">“I-is this demonstration really free to watch</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">?!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">“It’s like how sea urchin and wagyu beef are even more delicious when eaten together</span><span class="ellipse_exclamatory"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">There didn’t seem to be any further objections, and so with a soft smile, Mushiki took Ruri’s hand and returned to his original spot.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">“Now then, let’s get started. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">Be thorough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.3">Lack of proper preparation can risk serious injury.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">“</span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">Yes, Madam Witch!</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">” The students cried back in cheerful voices.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">If anything, the cohort here at the Ark seemed to be even more motivated than that at the Garden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.2">The students were all on the tips of their toes to see Saika’s first live demonstration. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.3">Mushiki understood how they felt. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.4">Even he wanted to take this class.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">But right now, he had other priorities.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">After a simple stretch to warm up, he had Ruri sit down on the beach, then positioned himself behind her and pushed slightly on her back so that she would lean over.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">Then, so that Asagi wouldn’t be able to see, he positioned his lips close to her ear and whispered, “I was worried about you, Ruri. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">I’m glad you’re safe.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">“</span><span class="ellipse_exclamatory"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">She remained expressionless, but her body noticeably twitched.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">Something was indeed wrong with her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.2">But it was certain that she was also reacting to his words. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.3">And so, without letting Asagi catch on, he continued in a whisper, “Are you being watched? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.4">Blink once for yes, twice for no.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">“…” Gritting her teeth, Ruri’s eyes snapped shut once.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">“Do you truly want to remain here at the Ark?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">“…” Two blinks.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_74" aria-label=" Page 74. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">“Are there surveillance cameras monitoring you where you’re staying?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">“…” One blink.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">“Is there a way to contact you in secret?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">“…” Two blinks.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">Like that, he continued to ask her a few more questions.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">Though her answers were somewhat strange, she was able to respond to his every query. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.2">It was like she was unable to freely control her body, as though every effort required a surge of willpower.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">“…Hmm…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">Was it possible that Ao had hypnotized her, but she was now slowly regaining her sense of self through contact with her idol, Saika</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">?</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">It wasn’t unthinkable… And in that case, he might be able to completely undo the hypnosis with stronger stimuli.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">It took Mushiki only a moment to come to this decision—and with that, he immediately began to take action.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">“Try to lean in a little further, Ruri,” he said, pressing close against her back and pushing down with his weight.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">Then, his lips almost grazing her earlobes, he whispered, “It isn’t good to hold back… Give it your all… Unburden yourself…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">“…Gah… Grrrhyuuu…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">A mysterious noise sounded from somewhere deep inside Ruri’s body as she leaned forward as far she could go. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">She was incredibly flexible, her legs almost parallel with her torso.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">Her face, Mushiki realized, had turned bright red. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.2">He realized he had pushed down on her back harder than he should have.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">“Oops.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">As he eased up, Ruri’s bones creaked, and steam was coming out of her ears.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">“Sorry,” he murmured. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">“Was I a little too strong?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">“…N-no</span><span class="ellipse_comma"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">,” Ruri answered like a rusty robot.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">Her expression remained vacant, but that was unmistakably an audible response.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">He would have to press further.</span></p>
