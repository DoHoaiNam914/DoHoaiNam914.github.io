"></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">“Heh-heh, you’re a naughty boy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.2">Perhaps you’re in need of a little disciplining?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">“A-ah… Ugh…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">So went Mushiki and Kuroe’s exchange, both of them blushing as they talked.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">“…Um, sorry. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">I forgot to ask you something. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">It’s about the student Mushiki Kuga mentioned in the report…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Suddenly, there was a rumbling at the end of the room, and the representative from the Tower, Rindoh Shionji, timidly reappeared.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">“Er.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">“…Huh?!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">As she took in the sight of Mushiki and Kuroe, her face instantly turned scarlet.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“Eeep! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">U-um, s-sorry! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">S-sorry for disturbing yoouuu!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.4">Rindoh cried out, covering her mouth with her hands and disappearing again without a trace.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">“…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">“…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">The two of them were left in stunned silence for a few moments, when—</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">“Ah…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">Mushiki’s body faintly glowed, his appearance changing into that of an androgynous male high school student. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">He was back in his original form.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">She had left just in the nick of time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">If the transformation had taken place a few seconds earlier, Rindoh might have seen everything.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“…Do you perhaps like it when someone’s watching?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">Kuroe asked, squinting at him.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">“You’ve got the wrong idea!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">he couldn’t help crying out.</span></p>
<p class="SBORN"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1"><img class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg" alt=""/></span></p>
<p class="TX1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Void’s Garden, the mage-training institute located in Ohjoh City in Tokyo, was divided into five major areas.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">The eastern precinct, where many of the research buildings were located.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_20" aria-label=" Page 20. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">The western precinct, where there was a high concentration of training facilities.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">The southern precinct, full of dormitories and commercial facilities.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">The northern precinct, occupied by Saika’s mansion and other private amenities.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">And the central precinct, where most of the school buildings were situated.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">After leaving the special conference building located in the northern precinct, Mushiki and Kuroe made their way along the paved path down to the campus’s central area.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">As they approached, the road gradually grew in width, various buildings peeking out from behind the dense trees. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Since they usually made their way to school from their dormitory in the southern precinct, it provided a refreshing change of scenery.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">That, however, wasn’t the only reason for the unfamiliar sights.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“…Right, the repairs aren’t done yet, huh?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">Mushiki, back in his original body, murmured as he walked along the pavement.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">Several of the roads and buildings had collapsed, with work crews busy restoring them.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">All probably lingering effects from the previous incident.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">“It looks like it,” Kuroe responded from next to him.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">In tone and atmosphere, she had reverted to the perfect coolheaded attendant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">Mushiki would have liked it if she spoke more casually with him, but they couldn’t afford to let anyone learn her true identity, so she typically played the role of Kuroe Karasuma with great aplomb.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“It’s fairly common for the facilities to sustain some degree of damage during exhibition matches, but the scale was so large that it will take some time to repair. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Though if we still had Silvelle, the work might proceed a little more efficiently.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“Ah…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">Mushiki sighed at the sound of that name.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Silvelle—the artificial intelligence in charge of security and management at the Garden.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">Just like the students of the Tower, she had fallen into Clara’s hands. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">In short, she had been turned against them, and so the Garden could </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_21" aria-label=" Page 21. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">be said to have bared its fangs on its own staff and students. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">Mushiki felt a chill run down his spine when he stopped to wonder how he had managed to survive it all.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">It ought to be possible to restore Silvelle as she was an AI…but even now, several days after the incident, there had been no indication that anyone planned to.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“Silvelle hasn’t been fixed up yet, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">It feels a little lonely without her.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">At that moment, Mushiki’s eyes widened in surprise.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">A familiar figure was walking down the path, straight for them.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">What is it, Mushiki?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“Er, is that</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">He pointed ahead with a blank stare.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">She was a beautiful young woman, perhaps around eighteen years old. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">She walked slowly, her long silver hair almost touching the ground and her ample breasts on the verge of bursting out from her clothing as they swayed with each step.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">There could be no doubt about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">It was a three-dimensional projection of the Garden’s management AI Silvelle, the kind she used when communicating with people.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">“…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">She pushed on ahead, oblivious to Mushiki and Kuroe, seemingly muttering something under her breath.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">Well, Mushiki reasoned, she was only a projection, so there was little chance of their colliding.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Yet—</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">The next moment, Mushiki gasped.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">The reason was simple. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">His fingers, stretched out in front of him, had pressed up against Silvelle’s chest.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">“</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">?!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">A second later, Silvelle jerked back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">A faint tremor passed through her, from her chest all the way to Mushiki’s fingers.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">“…Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-what</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">A faint voice like the buzz of a mosquito emanated from her throat.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_22" aria-label=" Page 22. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">Mushiki furrowed his brow in confusion.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">“She’s got a physical form</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">Hold on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">What’s going on—”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">“Mushiki. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">Please lower your hand.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">Only after Kuroe had spoken did he realize what he was still doing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">Flustered, he hurried to put his hand away.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">“S-sorry,” he stammered.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">“…N-no… It’s okay… Eeep</span><span class="ellipse_comma"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">,” Silvelle responded in a voice so small that he might not have heard it if he hadn’t been paying attention. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">“I—I was just startled, that’s all… I’m sorry you had to touch something so plain… I was lost in thought</span><span class="ellipse_comma"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">,” she said in a strained, anxiety-ridden voice.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">For a moment, Mushiki thought she was angry at him for his disrespectful behavior…but apparently not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">Rather, she seemed quite unaccustomed to brushing things off with a casual laugh.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">Watching her, Mushiki finally realized this woman wasn’t the Silvelle he knew.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Her features and stature were exactly like the AI, but her clothes, facial expressions, and overall atmosphere were simply too different.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">Silvelle had worn a white robe and always had a gracious, saintly smile—perfectly befitting the self-proclaimed big sister figure she endeavored to be.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">The girl in front of him now, however, was dressed in a frilly gothic Lolita-style dress that covered her body almost completely. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">She had a severe stoop, and her long bangs partly obscured her face. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.3">Her eyesight didn’t seem particularly great, either, as she was wearing a pair of narrow framed glasses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.4">In one hand, she grasped a parasol, her shoulders slumped forward as though to keep them from being exposed to the sun.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">If Silvelle was yang, this woman was yin—her aura was practically the polar opposite of the AI’s.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">Kuroe spoke up to address his confusion: “Mushiki. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">While they may look very similar, this is not the administrative AI Silvelle.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">“Ah…right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">I guessed as much,” Mushiki said, still staring at the woman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.3">“But in that case—”</span></p>
