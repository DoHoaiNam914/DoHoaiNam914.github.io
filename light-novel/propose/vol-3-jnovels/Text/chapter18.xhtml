<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">Then, reaching out to the masks that they were wearing, one by one, she peeled them off to expose their faces.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">The sight made Mushiki catch his breath.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">The Azures had been unmasked, and they each had Ruri’s face.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">Hoping to gather more information, Ruri’s eyes darted everywhere.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">It was a large room, with a mysterious pattern drawn over the wooden floor. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">A strange atmosphere filled the air. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">There were no lights, and even though she was clearly indoors, a large bonfire was burning.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Next, she turned her gaze downward—and found herself wrinkling her brow.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">She couldn’t help it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">After all, she was wearing a splendid pure white kimono.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Yes, Ruri had been abducted by members of the Azures while enroute to Saika’s guest quarters and forced to take a bath before being changed into this wedding dress.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">There could only be one possible reason for all this—the wedding ceremony that was supposed to take place in several days’ time must have been moved up in response to Saika’s visit to the Ark.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Then—</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Her eyebrow twitched.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Ring, ring…</span></i></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">From somewhere in the distance, she could hear the faint sound of a small bell.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">She pulled a quizzical face, the sound growing louder and louder until it entered the room in front of her.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Slowly, the door began to slide open.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">A woman in a beautiful white robe stepped inside, holding a folded fan in one hand with her face hidden behind a veil. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">On either side of her, two masked girls dressed in shrine maiden outfits and holding sets of kagura bells followed reverently.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Ruri’s eyes burned with resentment at this sight.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“…Lady Ao.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">“Yes… That dress suits you, Ruri. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">You’re beautiful,” said the woman in the kimono—Ao Fuyajoh—as though deeply moved.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">Ruri couldn’t make out her expressions due to the veil and the darkness of the room, but she could sense the woman was smiling.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">“Let me answer you… We’re about to hold the nuptial ceremony,” Ao responded, throwing her words back at her.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Ruri glared at her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">“You’re stubborn… I will never, </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">ever</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1"> give you what you want. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">This </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">nuptial ceremony</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1"> or whatever you want to call it—go ahead, but I’m not going to just accept some lifelong partner because of some moldy old ritual. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">I’ll beat the crap out of any husband you pick out for me and leave.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">Ao sighed, as if trying to cover up her anxiety. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">“That won’t do. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">Having spirit is all well and good, but you need to know when to show grace… Because you’re going to be the head of the Fuyajoh clan from now on.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">“…Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Ruri frowned, with absolutely no idea what on earth she was saying.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">At that, Ao smiled, and began to slowly remove her veil.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">“What</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">Ruri couldn’t help gasping when she saw Ao’s face.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">“Now…let the nuptial ceremony begin.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">Ao’s mouth twisted into a smile—and the sound of the kagura bells in the hands of the masked girls filled the room.</span></p>
<p class="SBORN"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1"><img class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg" alt=""/></span></p>
<p class="TX1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">“Hilde—how much farther to the ceremony hall?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">“Y-you’re nearly there… It’s the room at the end of that corridor…!”</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1"> Hildegarde’s voice sounded from their earpieces as they ran down the long corridor in the main Fuyajoh residence.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">Following her directions, Mushiki poured yet more strength into his legs as he charged forward.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">“Let’s hurry.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">“Right,” Kuroe answered behind him.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">After defeating Asagi and the other Azures in the bamboo grove, Mushiki and Kuroe had run into security guards twice in the main </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_123" aria-label=" Page 123.

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">Having seen the faces of the Azures, Asagi included, Mushiki couldn’t shake an indescribable sense of unease. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">He pushed forward, hoping to reach Ruri as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Then—</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Having reached their destination, Mushiki kicked the door in without hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">From the moment they had entered the Fuyajoh residence, he hadn’t expected things to go smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">If Ao, the head of the Fuyajoh clan, and the other members of the family, too, were all on the other side of the door, then he was determined to face them to rescue Ruri.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">…But what he found on the other side was beyond his wildest expectations.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">In the center of the large room, decorated all over with arcane patterns, sat Ruri alone with her back to them, dressed in a white kimono.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">Mushiki glanced around, but there were no other figures in sight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">Ruri’s shadow flickered strangely from the light of a bonfire by the far wall.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">“Ruri!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">he called out, rushing to her side. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">“Ruri, are you okay?”</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">Though he shook her shoulders, Ruri stared back at him in a daze.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">He was concerned about her condition, but their first priority was to get out of here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">He took her hand, pulling her to her feet.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">“Ah…” Mushiki nodded in recollection.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">So many different girls all with Ruri’s face lying unconscious on the ground had certainly been a nightmarish sight.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">“Earlier, I said soul and body need to be compatible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">In other words, if you prepare countless bodies that you </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">know</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1"> to be compatible with your soul, you can swap for a younger one whenever you want… And the body most compatible with your soul will always be your own.”</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">Then, Ao spread her hands as she met his gaze head on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.2">“Indeed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.3">The Azures are all clones of Ao Fuyajoh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.4">They are all members of the Fuyajoh clan, the spears who protect the sea and govern the Ark.”</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">The reason was simple—it wasn’t Saika who’d emerged from the fires of the explosion.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.1">Ao’s soul hadn’t yet fully settled in Ruri’s body, so, she had reasoned, there was a chance that the connection between the two could be broken simply by draining her magical energy.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.1">And Mushiki had developed the ability to absorb energy from another individual, if only to a certain extent.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.467.1">While he normally used the technique only with Kuroe, with the right preparation ahead of time, it could be used to absorb magical energy from any human target.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.1">Mushiki averted his gaze, as did Kuroe.</span></p>
