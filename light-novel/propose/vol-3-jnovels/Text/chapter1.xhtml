<p class="COTX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">The world was dyed in five colors.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Mushiki Kuga gazed at the fantastic scene spread out before him from his vantage point on the edge of a towering skyscraper in the void.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">It was such a strange view. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">The space, so vast that you couldn’t tell where it ended, was divided into five sections like a cake into slices, each characterized by wholly unique scenery. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">It was as if he had cut up several postcards and glued them back together as his mood fancied.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">It was hard to believe that it was all real. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">In fact, if the old Mushiki had seen this, he would have thought it was a dream or an illusion.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">But perhaps that was only to be expected.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">After all, gathered here now—</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">—were the mages lauded as the best in the whole world.</span></p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">“Allow me to provide an overview of the incident once again,” a clear voice echoed throughout that five-colored world.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Curiously, the voice seemed to fill every corner of that vast, endless space.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">“Clara Tokishima, a mage belonging to Shadow Tower, led a cohort of her followers to stage an uprising during the exhibition match held the other day at Void’s Garden… Her objective was to obtain the heart </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_4" aria-label=" Page 4. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">of the Ouroboros, a mythic-grade annihilation factor sealed in the basement of the Garden’s library, along with information on the facilities where the other pieces of the Ouroboros were kept. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">We are presently still attempting to locate her, but her current whereabouts remain unknown.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">This explanation was given by a girl with dark hair and dark eyes, her gaze cool, and her expression betraying not a hint of emotion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">The girl was dressed from head to toe in the monotonous uniform of a personal attendant.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Her name was Kuroe Karasuma—and she served the head of Void’s Garden.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">Right now, she stood ramrod straight behind Mushiki’s back, above the sideways-looming skyscraper.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“I see</span><span class="ellipse_comma"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">,” uttered the low voice of a man.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">The next moment, the world to Mushiki’s right pulsated slightly, spreading out and zooming in.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">Emerging in its place was a frightening scene bathed in red moonlight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">A row of dead trees. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">Barren earth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.4">A single Western-style building, with an endless bundle of spires, emanating a bewitching glow.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">And a tall man sitting back in a chair.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Though appearance was no guarantee of a mage’s true age, he looked to be around forty years old. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">His eyes were shielded by rainbow-colored glasses, and he wore a long cloak.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Despite the immense distance between them, Mushiki had no difficulty making out his voice and appearance.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Eishuu Gurendoh—the headmaster of the mage-training institute Ember’s Peak.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“The Ouroboros. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">To think that sealed Mythologia could have been resurrected—and fused with a human no less… Do you have a photograph of this Clara Tokishima?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">“Yes,” Kuroe responded, moving the fingers of her right hand as though swiping on a giant tablet screen.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">Then, in the center of that huge space, an image filled the air.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">A young woman in a flashy outfit, with pink hair and multiple </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_5" aria-label=" Page 5. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">earrings and ear cuffs, posing and winking to the camera as if taking a selfie.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Frankly speaking, that image was a far cry from the overall mood of this gathering.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“…Couldn’t you have found a different picture?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">Gurendoh grumbled.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“There </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">are</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1"> others,” Kuroe said with a wave of her hand.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">The next moment, the huge image projected in the center of the world was replaced with another, then another.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Clara in a peculiar outfit.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Clara cosplaying as a maid.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Clara’s clothes being melted by a slime, the image a stone’s throw away from having to be blurred out for decency’s sake.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">“Enough!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">Gurendoh growled in resignation.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">In the end, the first image had indeed been the most mature.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“Anything else of note?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">Her Influenster ability converts fame and attention into magical energy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">In other words, the more people who know about her and who are aware of her exploits, the greater her power increases.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“What a headache. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">So even if we exercise caution, that will only boost her powers?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“That’s right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">However…” Kuroe paused for a moment, moving her hand once more and replacing the projected photograph with a short video clip.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“Hiya there! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">And we’re back—it’s Clara Channel Time! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">Are you having a</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1"> ca-razy </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">day, my Claramates? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">Right then, so I’m thinking of running a little experiment today. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.3">Something called</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1"> Are Immortals Really Incapable of Dying?!</span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">”</span></i></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">The video continued, and the mage Clara Tokishima spoke to the audience amid the turmoil on display in a lighthearted manner, complete with exaggerated reactions and gestures.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">Watching her, Gurendoh raised a quizzical eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">“…What’s </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">this</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">“A video, uploaded to the mage-exclusive video website MagiTube just a few hours ago,” Kuroe said, her eyes downcast.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_6" aria-label=" Page 6. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">Right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">Even with everything that had happened, despite her attack on the Garden and her true identity coming to light, Clara continued to post new videos.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">“Of course, we’ve asked the company responsible for managing the website to suspend her account, but it seems she keeps finding new ways to bypass our restrictions, either by creating new accounts or using those of her followers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">It’s a game of cat and mouse, I’m afraid,” Kuroe explained.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">Gurendoh rested a hand on his forehead as though battling a migraine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">“…You’re telling me that gamboling upstart prankster is a mythic-grade annihilation factor?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">“How rude, judging others by their appearance,”</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1"> sounded a flat electronic voice.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">The speaker’s identity was soon revealed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">Just as it had when Gurendoh first spoke, the scenery warped, the space to Mushiki’s left pulsating and expanding.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">Spreading out before him was a pixelated video game screen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">In the center of that blinking, low-resolution landscape sat a man with somewhat gloomy eyes, hunched over on both knees.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Baito Shikimori, headmaster of the mage-training institute Twilight City. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">Though he looked young, like Gurendoh, he was another powerful mage fully qualified to attend this conference.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">“That girl is fused with the Ouroboros and has turned more than a hundred mages into Immortals to attack the Garden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">That’s all that matters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.3">Unnecessary preconceptions can cloud one’s judgment.”</span></i></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">“I don’t need </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">you</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1"> to tell me that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">I’m not about to let my guard down, no matter the foe,” Gurendoh grumbled back in mild irritation.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">“If I was to judge</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1"> you </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">by</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1"> your </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">appearance, I’d say you’re a dubious-looking middle-aged man.”</span></i></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">“And you’re as garrulous as ever, I see.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">“I don’t know what kind of look you’re going for, but round sunglasses are taking it a bit too far, if you ask me.”</span></i></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">“Are you ever going to learn when to drop it?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">Gurendoh exclaimed in exasperation.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_7" aria-label=" Page 7. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">On closer inspection, he seemed more than a little embarrassed, his cheeks having turned bright red.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Then, perhaps in response to this exchange, the space to the far right of Mushiki’s vision stirred slightly.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">The scenery reminded him of the interior of a grand Japanese-style building. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">The sliding fusama doors, installed in several layers, opened quickly one after the other, revealing a bamboo blind at the very end of the building.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Behind it, the silhouette of a figure leaning forward was faintly visible.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">“…Whatever the case</span><span class="ellipse_comma"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">,” the woman’s voice began from behind the screen.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">She was Ao Fuyajoh, headmistress of the mage-training institute Hollow Arc.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">“First of all, we should clarify where the responsibility for this debacle lies… Isn’t that right, Rindoh?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">“…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">At this, the last person joining them flinched.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">In appearance, she looked to be around thirteen or fourteen years old, with a fearless countenance and her hair tied in a bun behind her head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">Her eyebrows, clearly defined as though to emphasize her strong willpower, were now twisted in a grim expression.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">Her presence, here in this space, was highly unusual.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">The reason for that was simple—she was the only figure here who was not the head of a mage-training institute.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">As if to hammer home that point, she was seated in what was possibly a plain conference room bathed exclusively in white. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">Only a single chair filled that wide expanse.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">The girl’s name was Rindoh Shionji, and she was a student at Shadow Tower.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">The first was that she was the great-great-granddaughter and a direct descendent of the Tower’s former headmaster Gyousei Shionji.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">With those final words, the space around Ao disappeared, as though consumed by blue flames.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">…Finally, only Mushiki and Kuroe remained.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">“…Phew.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">A few seconds after realizing they were now alone, Mushiki let out a tired sigh, the tension built up inside him unraveling.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">At the same time, the horizontal skyscraper on which he was sitting vanished, the space around him returning to its original form.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">The two were in a bleak conference room—awfully empty in appearance, no doubt on account of the sparse furniture and decoration.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">“Well done,” Kuroe said appreciatively from behind him.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">Mushiki turned around and gave a forced smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.2">“…I hope it went all right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.3">She seemed a little suspicious there at the end.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_16" aria-label=" Page 16. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">“Headmistress Fuyajoh is always like that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.2">Even while Lady Saika was still in her prime, she would often say suggestive insinuations and throw barbs for no apparent reason.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">“…I see.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">Once more, Mushiki let out an awkward sigh.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">“But still—that’s really bad for the heart.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">As he spoke, he recalled the scene that until a moment ago had stretched out before him, and he glanced down to scrutinize his right hand.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">A space divided into five colors. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.2">The dispute between Rindoh and Ao. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.3">And Saika’s towering skyscraper that had brought an end to it.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">From Mushiki’s standpoint, that scene of carnage could very well have ended with someone dying. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.2">Even now, his heart was still racing.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">Kuroe, however, was calm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">“Don’t worry. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.3">As I explained earlier, no one was actually there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.4">We asked them to stop because, yes, those two fighting would have certainly caused a problem, but even if it had come to bloodshed, they wouldn’t have died.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">Right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.2">Everything that Mushiki had just seen had been simply a projection wrought by magic.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">In other words, it was a magic-based remote conference. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.2">The rooms seemed to be designed through the application of a technique that changed the surrounding scenery in accordance with the individual accessing it.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">“But part of our consciousness is still connected, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.2">Is that what you mean? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.3">Strong stimuli that would end up having a physical response?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">“It wouldn’t </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">kill</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1"> them,” Kuroe answered flatly.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1">“…Right,” Mushiki responded, still uneasy.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">Then again, this probably wasn’t a big deal as far as she was concerned.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.1">“Now then,” she continued, changing the subject. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.2">“While our options are limited, our plan of action has been decided. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.3">For now, we must all do what we can.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">“What we can</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.2">That means magic training in the meantime… For you to master Lady Saika’s techniques, and to also handle your own techniques, it is imperative that you increase your magic level. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.3">Even if Clara </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_17" aria-label=" Page 17. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">Tokishima is found, that knowledge won’t do us much good if you cannot fight her properly.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.2">Kuroe paused for a moment, glancing at her watch. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.3">“Fortunately, the meeting ended ahead of schedule, so we have time to spare. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.4">If we leave now, we may be able to make it to your first class. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.5">Let’s hurry along and get ready.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">“Get ready?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">“Don’t play dumb. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.2">We’ve done this countless time before.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">Then, watching him through narrowed eyes, Kuroe wrapped her arms around Mushiki’s neck and positioned her lips close to his ear.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1">“…Or would you rather I take the lead?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.2">she whispered, her bewitching voice tickling his ear.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">“</span><span class="ellipse_exclamatory"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">!”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">Mushiki’s breath caught in his throat.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">She looked so different from her usual appearance as an attendant, her teasing tone calling to mind Saika’s sensuality.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1">But that, too, wasn’t at all surprising.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">After all, Kuroe was, in fact, the real Saika Kuozaki herself.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1">Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.2">There had never been a real Kuroe Karasuma anywhere in this world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.3">She was a homunculus, an artificial body created to house Saika’s soul.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1">About a month ago, the real Saika had been mortally wounded, and before slipping away for good, she had transferred her soul to this artificial body that went by the name Kuroe.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.1">Simply put, two beings now existed side by side—Saika’s body as merged with Mushiki, and Saika’s soul dwelling within Kuroe’s body.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1">When Kuroe had talked about </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">getting ready</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">, she meant for Mushiki to return to his original state.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">In his current form, Mushiki was constantly radiating magical energy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.2">When that amount underwent a rapid increase, his body would attempt to suppress the loss by entering a safe mode that consumed less energy—in other word’s, Mushiki’s original body.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">And </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">this</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1"> was how to instigate it.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">After all, magic was closely linked to the mind.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1">Essentially, when he entered a state of extreme arousal, the amount of magical energy being released would spike.</span></p>
