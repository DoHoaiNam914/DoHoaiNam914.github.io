<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">“Even kittens have claws. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">Do be careful. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.3">I wouldn’t want to see a dear friend get hurt.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“Hmm.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">“Oh-ho-ho.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">After this exchange of words, the two traded small smiles.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Though they both maintained a friendly tone, the tension in the room was palpable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">A weak-minded observer would have found it hard to watch.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Nonetheless, Ao had no intention of continuing their conversation indefinitely, waving her hand as though to change the topic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">“Well, it might be a difficult time, but this is still a rare opportunity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">Do enjoy yourself a little. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.4">It’s been a quite a while since your last visit, yes?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">“…Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">I think I will,” Mushiki responded as he left the headmistress’s office.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">As soon as he stepped outside, the doors swung shut behind him.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Then, with perfect timing, Asagi, who had been waiting outside, bowed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">“Allow me to show you to your rooms. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">This way, please.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">“Thank you,” Mushiki said with a slight nod, following her down the corridor with Kuroe by his side.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">“Kuroe?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">he whispered so that Asagi wouldn’t hear.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">She nodded along to his summary of the discussion, as though she already knew everything that had happened inside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">Given that they were dealing with </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">her</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">, she had probably guessed the meeting’s contents—though it wasn’t out of the realm of possibility that she had actually listened in somehow.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“…As expected, Ao is aware of the true purpose of our visit.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">“Yes…she must be,” Mushiki said.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_59" aria-label=" Page 59. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">Kuroe nodded. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">“But it doesn’t seem like she intends on going out of her way to stir things up so long as we don’t make it explicit… In any event, we need to locate Ruri first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">Is she being restrained or held in confinement? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.4">Is she being permitted a degree of freedom under supervision? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.5">Is she presently able to act on her own volition? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.6">Without knowing any of this, we won’t be able to plan our next moves.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“…Ah.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">Mushiki nodded as he clenched his fists.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“…Yes?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">At that moment, Asagi, who had been walking along ahead of them, turned around with suspicion.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Apparently, his voice had grown louder without his meaning to.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“It’s nothing,” he said with a shake of his head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">It’s just been so long since I last visited. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">You have a wonderful school here.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">“I’m honored. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">I’m sure the headmistress will be pleased to hear that,” the girl said calmly as she led Mushiki and Kuroe out from the school building and into the dormitory area.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">The day’s classes, it seemed, were already over, with girls in white uniforms gathering to chat in small groups at the various commercial establishments that lined the streets.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Some of them noticed their visitors, watching with piqued curiosity as they passed through.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“Hey, hey, who’s that being led around by the Azure?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“She’s so beautiful… A visitor from the outside, I suppose?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">“I feel like I’ve seen her somewhere…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“Huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">Doesn’t she look like Madam Witch from Void’s Garden</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“Seriously? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Wow…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">And so rumors began to spread like wildfire.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">Come to think of it, Kuroe had said something about the Ark having few visitors, seeing how it was a mobile city constantly roaming the sea. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">The people here probably didn’t have many opportunities to interact with those from other mage schools. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">Perhaps it was a rare thing for a guest to visit.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“Hmm…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">Saika could hardly ignore their gazes as she walked past them, and </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_60" aria-label=" Page 60. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">so Mushiki gave a smile and a small wave at the groups of girls staring at him, prompting a flurry of squeals and blushes.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Then—</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“…Lady Saika.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Kuroe caught her breath, before giving his sleeve a slight tug.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Given how well she normally kept her emotions under control, this was rare, and Mushiki couldn’t help stopping in wonder.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">“Hmm? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">Ah, sorry. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">I guess I’m going a little overboard smiling to all the students here…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“What are you talking about? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">Take a look at </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">that</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“Huh</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">He cast his gaze in the direction she was pointing—and fell suddenly silent.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">The reason was simple. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">There could be no failing to recognize the girl across the street.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Her long hair was tied up in twintails, and her eyes showed unshakable willpower.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">She was wearing the Ark’s white sailor uniform, but there could be no mistaking her…</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">It was his sister, Ruri Fuyajoh, whom they had been unable to reach for more than a week now.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">“…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">There she was, making her way down the street surrounded by several girls.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">Perhaps because of her status as a scion of the Fuyajoh family, she seemed to be incredibly popular. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">The girls around her were all smiling happily as they tended to her needs.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">But even in the midst of all these girls, Ruri’s eyes were lifeless, and her expression was dark and morose—as though she couldn’t even hear the voices of those around her.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">Mushiki had never seen her like that at the Garden, and his chest tightened.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">“…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">They were fortunate to have located her so quickly, but something was clearly amiss. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">He took a deep breath as he called out to her, “Ruri—”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_61" aria-label=" Page 61. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">Yet—</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">“Headmistress Kuozaki. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">Please don’t shout in the school district.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">At that moment, Asagi, as though sensing what he was about to do, positioned herself in front of him.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">No, that wasn’t all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">Appearing practically out of thin air, others dressed just like her—the Azures—rushed to separate him and Ruri.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">“What</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">Mushiki furrowed his brow, but quickly regained his composure as he gracefully brushed his fingers through his hair.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">“Oh, dear me, I apologize,” he said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">“Yes, it certainly won’t do to make a ruckus on school grounds.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">“Thank you for your understanding.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">Asagi gave a bow, and the other Azures followed suit—they were so in sync, they could have all been following the exact same programming.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">“But,” Mushiki continued, “isn’t that a slight exaggeration? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">I just happened to see an old acquaintance and thought I should call out to her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.3">It would be beneath the dignity of the Ark to stand in the way of something so trivial.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">“…” Asagi listened in silence, but it wasn’t long before a muffled voice sounded from behind her mask: “Headmistress Kuozaki. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">Please consider your influence and standing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">You are the most powerful mage in the world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.4">Even the smallest of gestures when coming from someone as highly respected as you could have a profound effect on those watching… Furthermore, you have been invited to the Ark to give a special lecture. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.5">I would like to ask that you refrain from showing favoritism to any one student in particular.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">“…I see, I see…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">Mushiki let out an impatient sigh at this roundabout excuse.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">“What a quaint thing to say. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">Don’t I have every right to speak to a beloved student of mine?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">“Beloved student? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">Who in the world are you talking about</span><span class="ellipse_questionmark"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">…</span></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">If you mean Ruri Fuyajoh, who was formerly enrolled at the Garden, I believe she has already informed you of her intent to withdraw from your school.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_62" aria-label=" Page 62. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">“…Oh?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">Mushiki narrowed his eyes in irritation—when Kuroe tapped him on the shoulder, urging him to calm down.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">Glancing back down the street, he saw that Ruri’s group had already left.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">…Right, it wouldn’t be a good idea to stir things up here and now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">With that in mind, he gave Kuroe a slight nod as he let out a sigh.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">“…I’m a little tired. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">Can you show me to my accommodations?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">“As you will,” the masked girl answered with a polite bow.</span></p>
<div class="LI_SB1"></div>
<p class="TX1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">“Well now…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">After arriving at his assigned room, Mushiki let out a long sigh as he took in his surroundings.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">He had been given a room in the guest quarters at the back of the dormitory building—the Ark’s best, no doubt. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">It was decorated with luxurious furnishings and was a little too spacious for one person.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">“What do we do now?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">Mushiki muttered, in no mood to feel excited by all this.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">After leading him and Kuroe here, Asagi had handed them her contact information and told them to reach out to her if they needed anything before promptly disappearing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">Right now, it was just the two of them.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">Of course, another room had been prepared for Kuroe, but they had met in Saika’s room to discuss their next moves.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">“Please wait a moment,” Kuroe said with one hand raised as she narrowed her eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">Then, concentrating, she intoned, “First Substantiation: Eye of Inquiry.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">A ringlike pattern unfurled around her neck, her eyes lighting up.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">Mushiki had seen this technique before. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">As he recalled, it was a form of analytical magic that allowed her to see though the structure and composition of other objects.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">With her eyes aglow, Kuroe cast her gaze around the room. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">Finally, giving him a quick nod, she deactivated her world crest.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">“That was?”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_63" aria-label=" Page 63. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">“I was concerned about privacy, so I checked just in case.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">“…I see.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">Mushiki felt his eyes twitching at Kuroe’s words.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">It was clear by now that Ao doubted their intentions for coming here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">He should have anticipated this.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">“However, Ao isn’t a fool. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">She will have expected us to check for anyone listening in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.3">She won’t go out of her way to look for our weaknesses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.4">This was merely a precaution.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.5">Then, after a short pause, she added, “Let’s consider our plans moving forward.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">With those words, she pulled a small cell phone and a pair of wireless earphones from her pocket, handing one to Mushiki.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">After fitting it into his ear, he could make out a small voice: </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">“…A-ah… Testing, testing… What was it again…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">Whew…”</span></i></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">It was Hildegarde. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">Her voice was a little hard to make out, but that seemed to be a volume issue on her end, not a connection one.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">“Um…can you hear me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">Li’l Saika? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.3">Li’l Kuroe…?”</span></i></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">“Yes, no problems here.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">“Ha-ha… This is like playing spy, huh…?”</span></i></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">“It kind of is, isn’t it?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">Mushiki responded with a soft smile.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">Hildegarde must have been pleased to hear that he shared her opinion, as she gave a soft </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">“Tee-hee-hee…”</span></i></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">“More importantly, Knight Hildegarde, what is the current situation?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">Kuroe asked brusquely, holding the other earphone to her ear.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">“Ah…y-yes…,”</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1"> Hildegarde responded, flustered. </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">“You have the device I gave you before you left, yes? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">I was able to use it to access the Ark’s internal network. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.3">If you give me enough time, I think I can break through their security. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.4">Just be careful that the battery doesn’t run out…,”</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1"> she added in a hurry.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">Indeed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">This was what Mushiki and Kuroe had asked of her before leaving the Garden.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">To confirm Ruri’s current location, gather information on the Fuyajoh family, and counter any security measures at the Ark that might stand in their way in the event of an emergency.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">For those reasons, they had asked her to hack into the Ark’s network.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">…It was hardly a noble approach, and Mushiki was a little worried </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_64" aria-label=" Page 64. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">that it skewed too close to how Clara had attacked the Garden, but they had to be prepared for any eventuality.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">“The Ark, by its very nature, has its own campus-wide network, which limits how much can be accessed from the outside… With a physical connection to the main server, you might have a shot, but it’d still be pretty difficult… However, with this neat little gadget, once you’re in, you can do just about anything… Tee-hee-hee. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">Did they honestly think they could keep me out with such weak security…?”</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1"> Hildegarde seemed to be talking to herself, gasping in realization after saying all that. </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">“A-anyway…leave it to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">I’ll let you know when there’s progress.”</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1"> With that, she hung up.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">Mushiki and Kuroe, each wearing a single earphone in one ear, exchanged glances and brief nods.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">“Let’s see what Hilde can come up with…and think about what </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">we</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1"> can do, too,” he suggested.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">“Yes,” Kuroe answered.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">Of course, it wasn’t going to be that easy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">And so, crossing his arms as he got to thinking, he added, “We were lucky to find Ruri on the first day…but the situation doesn’t look good.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">“No. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">She isn’t being confined…but she wasn’t acting like her usual self, either.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">“Ah…” Mushiki frowned, recalling how she had looked when they’d spotted her.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">While he had seen her only from a distance, she certainly hadn’t seemed like her usual self. </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">Brainwashing</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">, </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">manipulation</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">—words that he would have otherwise considered poor jokes flashed through his mind.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">All the same, pessimism would get them nowhere. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.2">With a shake of his head to clear his negative thoughts, he continued, “There’s no point worrying about that now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.3">First things first, let’s think of a way to reach out to her.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">“My thoughts exactly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.2">The main issue will be the disciplinary committee—the Azures,” Kuroe said, resting a hand on her chin.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">“Yeah,” Mushiki said with an exaggerated shrug. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">“I wasn’t expecting them to interfere so blatantly like that.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">“But the fact that they did is proof that they don’t want Lady Saika </span><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_65" aria-label=" Page 65. "></span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">interacting with her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.2">If they believed there was no harm in letting you see her, they wouldn’t have taken this approach.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">“I see…” Mushiki nodded in understanding.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">Certainly, if they had completely brainwashed her, it was hard to believe they would be so overly sensitive. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.2">Their overzealous approach in guarding her was a weakness that could potentially be leveraged.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">“But how </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">can</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1"> we contact her? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.2">Given the situation, she must be under surveillance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.3">If posssible, I’d like to avoid getting into a big fight…”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">“There </span><i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">is</span></i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1"> another way,” Kuroe said with a confident nod. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.2">“One where it wouldn’t be unusual for you and Ruri to meet at close range. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.3">It would also be difficult for the Azures to interfere.”</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">“Oh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">What is it?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.3">Mushiki asked.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">“Lady Saika,” Kuroe answered softly, “Please fulfill your original purpose in coming here.”</span></p>
