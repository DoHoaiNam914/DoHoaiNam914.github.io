    <p class="COTX">“There you are, Sara,” Anviet called out.</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara was standing on the balcony outside his quarters in the Garden, watching the night sky. More stars than the eye could count shone overhead, while the lights of the city below were no less numerous.</p>

    <p class="TX">“An…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara turned to face him, her eyes swollen with tears.</p>

    <p class="TX">The annihilation factor—the Fortuna—had been successfully destroyed, and Sara, with whom it had merged, had somehow managed to survive. It was an extraordinary outcome, unthinkable under normal circumstances.</p>

    <p class="TX">But as a result, Sara had lost her beloved daughter, with whom she had shared life’s joys and sorrows for so very long. Her tears had flowed nonstop from the moment she came back to her senses.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I’m sorry. I’m so distraught.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I know…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet shook his head. He had known his daughter for only a few days, but her loss had torn a gaping hole in his heart. It wasn’t hard to imagine how Sara must have been taking it.</p>

    <p class="TX">After a long silence, she spoke up. “Madam Witch said something, before… That maybe Surya was an identity, a personality state, <span aria-label=" Page 194. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_194" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>created by my wish a hundred years ago…” She turned her face back to the night sky. “So long as her memories are engraved into my soul, she isn’t truly gone… Someday, I have to give birth to her for real. So I can’t despair forever.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Yeah.” Anviet nodded.</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara approached on light footsteps, wrapping her arms around him in a hug.</p>

    <p class="TX">“So please…let me hold you until dawn. Once morning comes, I’ll be okay.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Ah.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet bowed his head in response, holding her small body in turn.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">In room 2-A of the Garden’s central school building, Mushiki was using a ruler to draw lines on a piece of paper.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Forty-eight millimeters by two millimeters…”</p>

    <p class="TX">After carefully cutting a long, narrow strip, he rolled it up and glued the tips together.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then, like a craftsman admiring his handiwork, he peered down at the ring-shaped object.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I see…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What are you doing?” a voice called out from behind him.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Whoa<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki jumped upright, the paper ring falling onto his desk.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Kuroe…don’t startle me like that.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Unfazed, she glanced at the ring quizzically.</p>

    <p class="TX">“And what is <i>that</i>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah, I tried making a ring for a size eight finger.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…And why would you do that?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I wanted something I could feel in my hands to help stimulate the imagination,” he declared.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe looked on in a half squint. “I’m glad to see you’re enjoying yourself.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah, right. Sorry.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 195. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_195" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Are you familiar with the word <i>sarcasm</i>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh? Sure.” He nodded.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe breathed a tired sigh.</p>

    <p class="TX">Several days had passed since the destruction of the Fortuna, and the Garden had returned to normal.</p>

    <p class="TX">The damage wreaked by the annihilation factor had been rendered as if it had never occurred, which meant that the wishes it had granted were undone, too. Mushiki’s body was once again fused with Saika’s, while Saika’s soul had returned to the homunculus Kuroe Karasuma. And of course, the girls had all gone back to wearing their regular uniforms instead of those frilly maid outfits.</p>

    <p class="TX">…Incidentally, Hildegarde, the one who had wished for the Garden to adopt maid outfits as its official uniform in the first place, had been holed up in her workshop since that fateful meeting, so she hadn’t been able to see those outfits with her own eyes. Mushiki kind of felt sorry for her.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm?” He raised a brow.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri was hiding at the back of the classroom, watching their every move.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Ruri? What are you doing there?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Jerking backward, she hastily pointed a finger at him. “D-don’t get the wrong idea, Mushiki! I was only acting weird the other day because of the Fortuna<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Th-that’s all!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? R-right.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Overwhelmed, Mushiki nodded in agreement.</p>

    <p class="TX">To be perfectly honest, he wasn’t entirely sure what she was talking about, but in any event, she seemed to accept his response at face value. Ruri came up to him, still looking somewhat uneasy.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Your body went back to the way it was, didn’t it?” she asked softly so the other students wouldn’t overhear.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yeah. Unfortunately.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I wonder if this was really for the best…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 196. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_196" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“What do you mean<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“It’s not like you cheated or anything to make it happen, you know? I mean, sure, it’s dangerous, but used properly, I can see how it could have positive results…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ruri…”</p>

    <p class="TX">He could sympathize with her on that account. She hadn’t honestly been contemplating using the annihilation factor, but with it all behind them and the option no longer on the table, it was understandable that she might wonder whether they had really done the right thing.</p>

    <p class="TX">As if to dismiss their concerns, Kuroe shook her head firmly. “Of course, we did everything we could at the time.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Kuroe…” Ruri sighed, before finally nodding in response. “Yes, you’re right.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What happened to Sara, by the way?” Mushiki asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“We aren’t about to throw her out, so Knight Anviet has been appointed as her guardian,” Kuroe explained. “If I recall correctly, she’ll be starting at the Garden’s middle school today.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah, right… Is that okay, though? Being merged with an annihilation factor is one thing, but does she actually have an aptitude for magic?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“If you’re curious, why don’t we look in on her?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“Huh?”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki and Ruri exchanged uncertain glances.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">“…Hmm?”</p>

    <p class="TX">When the three of them arrived at the Garden’s middle school building, they found that they weren’t the only visitors.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mr. Anviet<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet was peering into the room through a gap in the door, and he jumped slightly when Mushiki called out his name. For some reason, his actions called to mind Ruri’s behavior a few minutes ago.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Y-you lot… Whaddaya doin’ here?!”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 197. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_197" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“We should be the ones saying that.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Did you come to check on Sara, Knight Anviet?” Kuroe asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“E-eh?!” he stammered. “Who said anythin’ like that?! I was just out for a little stroll, that’s all<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">The middle school building and its adjoining facilities were located in the Garden’s eastern area—making it a somewhat unexpected place for Anviet, a teacher in the high school precinct, to wander into by chance.</p>

    <p class="TX">“You aren’t being entirely truthful, are you?” Kuroe insisted.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Were you worried Sara might be a hit with the boys in her class?” Ruri teased.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah…” Mushiki nodded.</p>

    <p class="TX">“You<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” A throbbing blue vein had emerged by Anviet’s temple.</p>

    <p class="TX">At that moment, the teacher’s voice sounded from within the classroom: “All right, now, quiet down, everyone. I’d like to introduce you to a new friend who will be joining us today.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet shot his gaze back to the gap in the door, and Mushiki and the others followed suit. It was a bit cramped with all four of them there, but that was unavoidable.</p>

    <p class="TX">Inside, at the front of the classroom and dressed in the Garden’s middle school uniform, stood Sara, a shy smile on her face.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’m Sara Svarner. It’s nice to meet you all,” she said with a bow of her head.</p>

    <p class="TX">Her appearance, her name—everything about her had her fellow students in a buzz.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Svarner<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Does that mean you’re<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“The girl everyone’s been talking about<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Hushed whispers spread throughout the room. Apparently, word of the teacher newly responsible for looking after his illegitimate daughter had spread to the lower grades.</p>

    <p class="TX">Eventually, a female student raised her hand into the air with a question.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 198. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_198" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Yes! Sara! Are you Mr. Anviet’s daughter?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“No, I’m not,” she answered decisively.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“So it was just a rumor…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Her fellow students responded with a mix of acceptance and disappointment.</p>

    <p class="TX">And yet—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Not his daughter. His wife,” she said with a slight blush.</p>

    <p class="TX">The classroom was thrown into an uproar, while Anviet was overcome by a violent fit of coughing.</p>

    <p class="TX">It seemed that life was about to become even more hectic for him.<span aria-label=" Page 199. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_199" role="doc-pagebreak"></span></p>
