    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 80. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_80" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“What the hell, Fuyajoh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Have you finally cracked?” Anviet demanded uneasily.</p>

    <p class="TX">“How rude. Is that mouth of yours only good for insults and slander?” Ruri shot back. The discrepancy between her words and her body language was just too much.</p>

    <p class="TX">Incidentally, only four of them—Saika, Kuroe, Mushiki, and Ruri—had responded to the PA announcement. Not wanting to interfere in official knight business, Hizumi had gone on to class as usual.</p>

    <p class="TX">Technically, Mushiki should have been in much the same position, but since the cause of his separation from Saika remained unclear, Kuroe had advised them to stay close together, considering the risk of recombination… But perhaps more to the point, Ruri simply refused to let go of him, so in a way, he was being treated as little more than an accessory.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…You ain’t s’pposed to bring outsiders to an emergency meetin’,” Anviet continued, looking Mushiki over.</p>

    <p class="TX">At this, Erulka, standing just a short distance away, gave an exaggerated shrug. “That goes for you, too, no?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ugh…”</p>

    <p class="TX">His response was understandable. After all, Surya was clinging to his back in much the same way Ruri was to Mushiki’s.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I didn’t have much choice! I told her to wait, but she wouldn’t listen!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Papa? You said you wanted to be with Sue…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I did <i>not</i>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Looks like we’ve got ourselves a pair of midwife toads,” Erulka muttered in exasperation.</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment, a woman hiding in a corner of the room let out a raspy chuckle. “…Samba toads… Tee-hee-hee… I’d love to see that…” She laughed, her shoulders quivering slightly with each breath. Her voice was so soft that you might have missed it if you weren’t paying attention.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 81. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_81" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Then again, in terms of appearance, she didn’t exactly blend in with her surroundings.</p>

    <p class="TX">She was tall of stature, with long silver hair that almost reached the ground, and she was dressed in a tight black dress covering every square inch of her body. But while she might have been trying to hide her skin, she couldn’t possibly conceal the sheer magnitude of her bust.</p>

    <p class="TX">And that wasn’t all. Though shrouded behind her long bangs and her thick-framed glasses, her dignified countenance was a mirror image of Silvelle’s.</p>

    <p class="TX">Knight Hildegarde Silvelle—the creator of the Garden’s management AI (the other Silvelle), and also the model for its visual interface. She must have responded to the emergency announcement as well.</p>

    <p class="TX">Crossing her arms, Erulka turned her attention to Hildegarde. “…The midwife toad is known for carrying its eggs on its back. Not for dancing.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh? Oh… U-ugh<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Hildegarde stammered, her cheeks turning slightly pink as she slouched down even more than she already was.</p>

    <p class="TX">She didn’t seem embarrassed at being called out for making a mistake so much as being overheard talking to herself.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Anyway, let’s get started, Hilde. Come over here.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Um, I-I’m fine here…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Enough. Get over here.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eeep…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Realizing that she couldn’t refuse, Hildegarde did as instructed but promptly hid herself behind Saika because she was feeling self-conscious about everyone looking at her. And so the third samba toad made its grand entrance.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hey. Morning, Hilde.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Good morning, Li’l Saika… You smell nice today<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Hildegarde returned with an awkward smile.</p>

    <p class="TX">Though she probably wasn’t trying to come across this way, her words, gestures, and even facial expressions couldn’t have been more furtive.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 82. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_82" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She tended to be shy around strangers, but once she got to know someone, she didn’t hesitate to fully open up. She even greeted Mushiki and the others, though she didn’t make direct eye contact with them.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Li’l Ruri, and Mushiki, too… Ah… You aren’t wearing your maid outfit today, Kuroe?” She sighed, looking somewhat disappointed.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe was currently in her Garden uniform. Though there were some minor differences, such as her stockings and the realizing device at the end of one of her shoulder epaulets, her outfit was much the same as Saika’s and Ruri’s.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’m a student at the Garden, so naturally, I wear the uniform when attending classes.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I—I see…” Hildegarde slumped.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Do you like maid outfits, Hilde?” Mushiki asked vaguely.</p>

    <p class="TX">Hildegarde averted her gaze. “…I-it’s not that, not exactly… I know they’re supposed to be a work uniform, but they’re so frilly and cute. You can’t deny they’re the perfect intersection of functionality and style… Just looking at them makes my heart flutter… I like the cosplay aspect of them, too… But ultimately, nothing beats the classic monochrome style… Ah, I wish the girls’ uniforms here were modeled after maid outfits…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sounds like you <i>do</i> like them.” Mushiki chuckled in response to this impassioned speech.</p>

    <p class="TX">Only then did he notice that Kuroe was narrowing her eyes in a squint, her brow furrowed.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Kuroe? You don’t need to make that face…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“No, that isn’t it.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh?” Mushiki blinked.</p>

    <p class="TX">After a long moment, Kuroe shook her head. “…No. Don’t mind me.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh? Are you sure<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">He tilted his head to one side in uncertainty, but Erulka took this as her cue to set the conversation back on track.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ahem. Shall we move on?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 83. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_83" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Apologies. Continue,” Saika said.</p>

    <p class="TX">Erulka heaved a weary sigh. “Sorry for calling you here day after day, Saika.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I don’t mind. More importantly, what’s happened? You didn’t summon our knights for no reason.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Have you determined the cause of yesterday’s phenomenon?” Kuroe asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki caught his breath. At the same time, Ruri buried her face in his neck, breathed in with a thin, hiss-like inhale, and let out a long sigh. Mushiki could feel his neck growing warm.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’m afraid not… Sis?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“Here I am!”</i> answered a voice as the AI Silvelle appeared over the table.</p>

    <p class="TX">Hildegarde, meanwhile, wore a look of marked displeasure. While she had designed the AI herself, she simply couldn’t stomach that it had chosen, entirely of its own accord, to model its appearance after her.</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“Silvelle’s back, my cute brothers and sisters! Oh, and look! Anvi and Sue are here, too! And Hildegarde… Hi there.”</i> Her tone turned more formal toward the end, and she bowed.</p>

    <p class="TX">Hildegarde drew her eyebrows together in a frown and ran a hand through her hair. “I knew it! Why am I the only one who gets the cold shoulder<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“I’m just kidding. You’re my creator, but I’m still your older sister. You’re an only child, so you learned how to develop AIs because you wanted an older sister of your own, right?”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">“Why do I feel like you’re rewriting my past<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Hildegarde murmured, but Silvelle didn’t seem to be listening.</p>

    <p class="TX">The AI twisted her body through the air, extending her arms toward those gathered around. <i>“Now, let’s wrap up this sisterly chat and move on to the main affair. Take a look at this.”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment, a three-dimensional image was projected above the table.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 84. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_84" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Is that<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki raised an eyebrow in consternation.</p>

    <p class="TX">Before them was a scene of what must have been a foreign city—but just like the day before, it looked like entire sections of it had been wiped out.</p>

    <p class="TX">“That doesn’t look like the same place as yesterday…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm. Early this morning, we witnessed the same phenomenon we did yesterday in southern Australia,” Erulka explained. “The scale is considerably smaller than last time, but there’s no mistake that we’re dealing with the same kind of thing. Other institutions are making inquiries, too…but as of this moment, we haven’t been able to confirm the nature of the annihilation factor.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I see<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Saika said with a worried groan.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I don’t mean to take this lightly, but without any leads, there is no course of action for us to pursue,” Erulka continued, her expression grave. “The fact that this has occurred twice in as many days suggests that it may happen again tomorrow, and beyond that, too. We’re going to have to raise our alert level.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…How ironic. We have to wait for an annihilation factor to strike again in order to identify the root cause,” Kuroe observed.</p>

    <p class="TX">Her expression remained as stoic as ever, but Mushiki detected a faint hint of regret in her tone of voice.</p>

    <p class="TX">“There’s nothing else we can do,” Erulka muttered. “I’m not taking it easy thinking we can undo all this down the line, but our options are limited right now.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes, I know. Apologies for speaking out of turn.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Never mind. We’re on the same page.” Erulka shook her head before looking up to address them all.</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s all we have to report. There’s no telling what will happen next. Stay on your guard.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Yes.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki could do little more than nod.</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika and the other knights were similarly frustrated at being unable to respond to the crisis, their expressions reflecting a quiet <span aria-label=" Page 85. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_85" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>determination to sharpen their fangs in preparation for the coming battle.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I guess we’re done here. I’m headin’ back,” Anviet declared. With a wave of his hand and a deliberate yawn, he turned to leave.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Papa? Don’t you want to take a nap with Sue today?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I didn’t say nothin’. Besides, I’ve got a class to teach.”</p>

    <p class="TX">…Well, with Surya clinging to his back, he didn’t exactly make an impressive exit.</p>

    <p class="TX">“We should go. Daily training is a necessity for any mage,” Kuroe urged.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki gave a slight nod in response and left the command center with Saika and Kuroe, dragging Ruri behind him.</p>

    <p class="TX">Likewise, Hildegard stuck close to Saika, trailing along in her wake.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hilde<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Mushiki asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“There’s no need for you to come with us, Knight Hildegarde,” Kuroe pointed out.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh… U-um… It’s kind of calming, being with Li’l Saika<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” she answered with an awkward smile.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe heaved a sigh of resignation. “I don’t mind per se, but Lady Saika has a lesson to attend, so please be on your way before we reach the classroom.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“O-okay… But it’s nice…holding on to someone’s back… Maybe I should hire someone to hide behind<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Be my guest. But, Knight Hildegarde, won’t you have difficulty hiding behind someone you don’t know?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Ugh<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” she mumbled, unable to refute her. “Li’l Saika…won’t <i>you</i> be my wall? I’ll pay you ten thousand yen a day…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Please don’t solicit the headmistress for your odd jobs,” Kuroe shot back, unamused.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">Then, the following morning—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 86. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_86" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>A light electronic sound beeped repeatedly from Mushiki’s bedside, rousing him from his dream.</p>

    <p class="TX">There could be no mistake—it was his cell phone. But that wasn’t his alarm.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Slowly, as his mind cleared, he realized that his phone was ringing.</p>

    <p class="TX">Sitting up in a hurry, he reached for the device to answer the call.</p>

    <p class="TX">“H-hello<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“Good morning, Mushiki,”</i> came Kuroe’s voice on the other end of the line.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Morning. What’s up, Kuroe<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? I didn’t oversleep, did I?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“No. I’ve received an urgent message from Knight Erulka, and I thought it best to keep you informed.”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">“A message?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“Yes… It seems that our disappearing phenomenon has struck again.”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki’s breath caught in his throat.</p>

    <p class="TX">The scenes that he had witnessed over the past two days flashed again before his eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I see… Where was it this time<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he asked warily.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe’s response was calm yet firm: <i>“Ohjoh City in Tokyo. In other words, right here.”</i></p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">“…Kuroe!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki rushed out of the boys’ dormitory when he spotted Kuroe at their arranged meeting place, calling out her name.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sorry I’m late!” he apologized, darting over while still buttoning up his uniform. He’d rushed to get dressed after their phone call, so his clothes were heavily disheveled, while his hair was similarly unkempt.</p>

    <p class="TX">“No. I apologize for waking you so early. Saika and Ruri haven’t arrived yet, so please, take a moment to fix your appearance. Panicking won’t change anything.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“S-sorry<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he apologized again, straightening out his uniform.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 87. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_87" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Hmm<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">He blinked a few times as a vague sense of unease came over him.</p>

    <p class="TX">In contrast to his own attire, Kuroe’s outfit was flawless—yet she was dressed not in her Garden uniform but rather the maid uniform she wore when attending Saika.</p>

    <p class="TX">“So you’re wearing that today, Kuroe?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? <i>Today?</i>” She cocked her head to one side as if failing to understand his point.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah, no. It’s fine, really. If we’re facing an emergency, I suppose we wouldn’t be going to class anyway…”</p>

    <p class="TX">He stopped himself there—or more precisely, he was interrupted.</p>

    <p class="TX">All at once, a mysterious figure fell down from overhead, clinging tightly to his back while snuggling up to him in a passionate embrace.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mushiki! Mushiki! Mushiki! Mushiki! Mushiki! Mushiki—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Wha—?! R-Ruri?!” he cried out in alarm.</p>

    <p class="TX">He might not have been able to see who had snuck up behind him, but that voice and unshakable grip were unmistakably his sister’s.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Good morning, dearest brother. I’ve missed you so much these past twelve hours! You missed me, too, right? Admit it, you were lonely. If time apart nurtures love, then the moment we finally meet is like a charged burst of energy, wouldn’t you say? It’s so absurd how they keep the boys’ and girls’ dorms separate, don’t you think? They should have a separate dorm for siblings in the middle.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Despite going on and on, the fact that her tone of voice was much the same as usual only added further fuel to Mushiki’s sense of dismay.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he murmured, raising a quizzical eyebrow.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri’s clothes fluttered into the corner of his vision; they were an altogether different color than her regular Garden uniform.</p>

    <p class="TX">Or to be more precise—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ruri? Why are you dressed like Kuroe<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he wondered aloud.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. Ruri was presently wearing clothes in the exact same style as Kuroe’s attendant uniform—in other words, a maid outfit.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 88. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_88" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Ruri, however, responded to him with a vacant stare. “Of course they’re the same. This is our uniform,” she said, as if the answer was obvious.</p>

    <p class="TX">After a short pause, she jumped up in mild surprise. “What’s that? You don’t want me to wear ready-made clothes? Are you saying you want to dye me in <i>your</i> colors? So you’re secretly super possessive? You want to skip classes today to go shopping? Oh my gosh! You want to introduce me to the latest fashions<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? A god-tier update? My bank account is ready!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“C-calm down, Ruri. Y-you’re strangling me…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oops. All this power is just welling up in me!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki tapped Ruri softly on the arm, and she loosened her grip with a wry laugh.</p>

    <p class="TX">With his airways cleared, fresh oxygen poured into his lungs. He breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p class="TX">But his last question still weighed on his mind. After taking a moment to catch his breath, he continued, “…Ruri. Did you just call that a <i>uniform</i>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes. So what?” she shot back.</p>

    <p class="TX">She didn’t seem to have the faintest shred of doubt about what she was wearing.</p>

    <p class="TX">That was when everything came together. Kuroe’s reaction just before had been out of the ordinary, too. He had assumed that she had a specific reason for donning her attendant attire, but she didn’t seem to consider her outfit in any way unusual.</p>

    <p class="TX">At that moment, something inside him clicked. Yes, just yesterday a certain someone had mentioned maid clothes…</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hey there. Morning, everyone. Sorry I’m late.”</p>

    <p class="TX">All at once, a fourth voice sounded from the direction of the girls’ dormitory, interrupting his train of thought.</p>

    <p class="TX">But he could be forgiven for his confused response. After all…</p>

    <p class="TX">“S-Saika<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm? Ah, morning, Mushiki. What’s the matter? Is there something on my face?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 89. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_89" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Saika Kuozaki was dressed in the exact same style of maid outfit as Kuroe and Ruri.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Eh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">No sooner had his retinas locked on to her than he choked, nearly collapsing on the spot. The only reason he didn’t fall flat on his face was that Ruri was still supporting him from behind.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Whoa. Are you all right, Mushiki?” Ruri asked excitedly. “Does this mean you want to entrust me with your body and soul?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Her words, however, flew in one ear and out the other.</p>

    <p class="TX">A maid outfit—in other words, a servant’s work clothes. That was hardly the kind of attire to grace the body of an individual of Saika’s high status.</p>

    <p class="TX">But for some inexplicable reason, these two circles—that by all rights, should never have overlapped—were perfectly united.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Thank…you<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he wheezed, tears of joy streaming from his eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Whatever for?” Saika asked, tilting her head in curiosity.</p>

    <p class="TX">Overcome with gratitude, he was unable to respond.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Who knows?” Kuroe answered.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">“Tch… What the hell is all this?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Having made his way to the western edge of the Garden after receiving Erulka’s report, Anviet contorted his face in horror at the sight laid out before him.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that was only natural. After all, part of the wall encompassing the Garden had been sheared away, exposing a view of the outside world.</p>

    <p class="TX">No. Technically, it was incorrect to describe all this as the <i>outside</i>. The cityscape that should have extended beyond the campus grounds was nowhere to be found, as if it had been erased from the face of its earth. For quite some time now, the sounds of ambulances and fire trucks and the propeller blasts of news helicopters flying overhead had been continuing nonstop.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 90. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_90" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>His expression stern, Anviet walked right up to the gaping hole in the wall.</p>

    <p class="TX">He traced his fingers over the cut—so smooth that the edge could have formed a razor-sharp blade.</p>

    <p class="TX">The Garden’s outer walls were built to withstand extreme physical and magical assaults. Not even an annihilation factor launching a direct attack would have an easy time breaking through. And of course, even if the walls did get destroyed, it was hard to imagine how anything could do that so <i>cleanly</i>.</p>

    <p class="TX">He had read the reports on the incidents in America and Australia, but seeing the damage up close really drove home the exceptional nature of whatever they were facing.</p>

    <p class="TX">While it was most certainly an annihilation factor, it evidently wasn’t some rampaging monstrosity. Whatever it was, no one had caught direct sight of it. No, this was unmistakably a special type of annihilation factor.</p>

    <p class="TX">“It’s so smooth…”</p>

    <p class="TX">This comment, of course, came from Surya, gently stroking the cross-section of the wall. She hadn’t left Anviet’s side for days.</p>

    <p class="TX">He’d gotten up early this morning to investigate the site, but the next thing he knew, she was already standing by the door, waiting for him.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Geez.”</p>

    <p class="TX">By now, he was used to the girl following him around, and he knew full well that there was no use complaining. That being said, her presence did help to ease the tension of the moment. Anviet let out a weak sigh, scratching the back of his head.</p>

    <p class="TX">Come to think of it, so many uncanny occurrences had taken place over the past few days—all since he had helped rescue Surya.</p>

    <p class="TX">There was Surya herself, who claimed to be his daughter, and the mysterious disappearance of cities the whole world over. Something was off with Saika, too; and on top of that, Ruri had been acting weird since the day before… Well, maybe he was overthinking that last one. She had always been more than a little out there.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 91. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_91" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>This</i>, however, was undeniably out of place.</p>

    <p class="TX">Turning around, he scrutinized his surroundings with a dark glower.</p>

    <p class="TX">A mass of teachers and students had gathered to see what was going on, just as he had.</p>

    <p class="TX">The female students, however, were dressed not in the Garden’s regular uniform, but fluttering apron-like dresses—the spitting image of what Saika’s attendant liked to wear.</p>

    <p class="TX">Perhaps noticing his gaze, a group of female students cautiously approached.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Good morning, Mr. Svarner.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hey. Whaddaya doin’?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“We’re here to help the teachers set up temporary wards to keep outsiders from accidentally wandering in.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah…” He nodded in understanding.</p>

    <p class="TX">The wards shielding the Garden were still active, so the campus was still hidden from outside observers. If, however, someone was to wander blindly through the freshly carved gap in the wall, those protections would have little effect. Given the number of rescue teams, construction workers, and media reporters scouring the area outside, it made sense to take extra precautions.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes, <i>that</i> part he could understand.</p>

    <p class="TX">He narrowed his eyes. “…So what’s with those ridiculous getups? The cultural festival’s still a ways off, you know?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">The girls tilted their heads, looking down at their clothes.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet sincerely doubted they needed to put on a fancy outfit just to set up and maintain a few wards. Yet judging by their reactions, they didn’t have the faintest clue what he was talking about.</p>

    <p class="TX">The boys, in contrast, were dressed in their normal uniforms and looked just as curious as Anviet. Seeing his reaction, they all seemed to breathe sighs of relief.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I knew I wasn’t crazy<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” one of them murmured.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet, however, pursued the matter no further—not because he <span aria-label=" Page 92. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_92" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>decided it wasn’t worth investigating, but because he had bigger fish to fry.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh? And you are<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Where did you come from? Not the <i>outside</i><span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">The group of girls had spotted Surya, still running her hand across the gap in the wall.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah. She’s—”</p>

    <p class="TX">But Anviet was soon interrupted by another girl: “Oh, so you’re Surya? She’s fine.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Haven’t you heard? She’s Mr. Svarner’s illegitimate daughter.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah… Huh… So that’s her.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sorry, Mr. Svarner. I didn’t know.”</p>

    <p class="TX">The girls each gave him polite nods.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet, however, shot them all a piercing glare.</p>

    <p class="TX">“How many times do I gotta say it?! I ain’t got no illegitimate kid! I don’t have <i>any</i> kids!” he cried out in frustration.</p>

    <p class="TX">He was sick of denying it, but if he said nothing, his silence would only sound like an admission.</p>

    <p class="TX">A wave of sorrow washed over the girls’ faces.</p>

    <p class="TX">“How awful… Even if you don’t want to acknowledge her, how can you say that right in front of her?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s right! Maybe you just don’t remember?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I mean, Mr. Svarner <i>is</i> quite the ladies’ man, right?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Can you tell us your mother’s name, Surya?”</p>

    <p class="TX">There was no end to it. Anviet could feel a vein throbbing on his forehead.</p>

    <p class="TX">“You lot<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he growled.</p>

    <p class="TX">But he didn’t have a chance to say any more.</p>

    <p class="TX">Why? Because Surya turned to the student who’d asked that last question.</p>

    <p class="TX">“My mama’s name…is Sara,” she declared in a loud voice.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Eh?” Anviet moaned, feeling as if his heart had been crushed underfoot.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1"><span aria-label=" Page 93. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_93" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Whoa… This is incredible.”</p>

    <p class="TX">After Mushiki somehow managed to regain his composure, he, Saika, and Kuro made their way to the western edge of the garden, which looked over the missing city.</p>

    <p class="TX">Walking with Ruri clinging tightly to his back was quite difficult, so Mushiki had asked her to let go. She had resisted at first, but when he told her that he couldn’t see her cute face, she shyly released him from her grasp. Now she gave him a wink each time their eyes met.</p>

    <p class="TX">Several teachers, administrative staff, and students had already gathered at the western edge of the Garden where the outer wall had been neatly gouged out. They were busily inspecting the damage and setting up fresh wards.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…It looks like what we saw in the previous reports,” Kuroe observed.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Indeed. This is clearly the same phenomenon we’ve seen the past few days.” Saika nodded.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes. But how could it strike this close<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Just what’s going on here<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Ruri added. “Mushiki! Mushiki! Look over here! Don’t you think I’m adorable?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">All three of them, dressed in matching outfits, wore stony-faced looks, though Ruri struck a cute pose at the end.</p>

    <p class="TX">“You’re adorable,” Mushiki answered in a strained voice.</p>

    <p class="TX">“We’re dealing with an annihilation factor… One that clearly affects the laws of nature,” Kuroe said, narrowing her eyes. “Though the range of destruction is considerably more restricted than that of a havoc-wreaking dragon or kraken, annihilation factors like this one often exhibit <i>unique</i> effects when certain preconditions are satisfied. Without deciphering the rules that govern them, it’s impossible to grasp their true nature… This is a most vexing class of annihilation factor.”</p>

    <p class="TX">She paused for a moment, her maid uniform fluttering as she turned to Mushiki. “Given its magnitude, the annihilation factor may well be exerting effects throughout the world as we speak. Even the smallest of details could prove vital, Mushiki. Does anything seem to you in any way out of the ordinary?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 94. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_94" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Ah… Well…I can think of one thing.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe raised an eyebrow in surprise. “What is it? You’ve noticed something unusual?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I mean, it’s your clothes. Why are you all wearing those maid outfits?” he asked, pointing to each of them in turn.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki may have been absolutely floored by the destructive power of Saika in a maid costume (he still couldn’t look at her for long without losing his senses), but he was sure that it was out of place on her.</p>

    <p class="TX">And it wasn’t just Saika and Ruri—all the female students were dressed similarly. More importantly, <i>none</i> of them seemed to have the faintest doubt about what they were wearing.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…You’re saying our clothes are <i>strange</i>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Maybe not <i>strange</i> exactly… But up until yesterday, everyone was wearing normal uniforms, right? And now this? It’s like what Hilde said yesterday has come true.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Knight Hildegarde…” Kuroe broke into a slight frown.</p>

    <p class="TX">But before she could utter another word—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Kuozakiii!”</p>

    <p class="TX">A furious howl sounded from close to the gap in the outer wall.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mr. Anviet<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Mushiki’s eyes widened in surprise.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. Directly in front of them was Anviet, screaming at the top of his lungs.</p>

    <p class="TX">The four of them gaped as he confidently marched over and then, without a moment’s hesitation, grabbed the collar of Saika’s blouse.</p>

    <p class="TX">“You… How much do you know about all this?!” he snarled with a vicious glare.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mr. Anviet<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri and Mushiki gawked at this aggressive display, but Anviet paid them no heed.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What the hell is goin’ on here<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! How does she know about Sara?! Just what are you keepin’ from me?!” he screamed in anguish.</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“…”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">For a second, both Saika’s and Kuroe’s breaths caught.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 95. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_95" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>But that lasted only for an instant.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’m sorry,” Saika responded, regaining her composure. “I don’t quite follow. Could you let me go?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Cut the crap… You think this is all some big coincidence?! If this is connected to what happened back then, who am I s’pposed to turn to other than you?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Far from letting go, Anviet tightened his grip around her collar, pulling her even closer. Given their differences in height, he was <i>this</i> close to lifting her off the ground.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that was as far as he could go. Behind him, another figure tugged at the hem of his shirt.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Papa<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? You don’t <i>really</i> want to do this, do you<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">It was Surya. Anviet glanced at her out of the corner of his eye, gritting his teeth and letting Saika drop back down to her feet.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Saika!” Mushiki hurried over to support her.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Ah. Thank you. I’m okay,” she answered, coughing faintly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Damn it all to hell…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet continued to glare at her for a long moment, then spun around and stormed off. Surya offered them all a quick bow before chasing after him.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What was that about<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Who does he think he is?! Showing such disrespect to Madam Witch<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">In the aftermath of the altercation, Mushiki and Ruri fumed with shock and indignation.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe and Saika, however, wore troubled frowns, as if a fresh possibility had just come to mind.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Rewriting past events, manipulating people’s memories and perceptions…granting their desires… Sara… It can’t be…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Kuroe<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? What is it?” Mushiki hazarded to ask.</p>

    <p class="TX">After a long moment, she raised her face. “…There are a few things I need to look into. I can explain later.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Yes. Let’s check it out.” Saika nodded with the same degree of solemnity.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 96. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_96" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Mushiki and Ruri, not used to seeing them act so serious, exchanged concerned glances.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Um… Who is this Sara person<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Mushiki tried asking.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sara Svarner,” Kuroe answered with a slow nod. “Knight Anviet’s late wife. She passed away close to a century ago.”</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">“Papa<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Surya hesitated as they headed back into the Garden.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Shuddup,” Anviet responded brusquely.</p>

    <p class="TX">He didn’t mean to be dismissive or cold, but his head was in such a mess that he couldn’t put his thoughts in order.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Damn it all… What the hell is goin’ on<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he spat, running a hand through his hair.</p>

    <p class="TX">After a brief pause, he spun around, facing Surya.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Who the hell <i>are</i> you? I know we’re not related by blood… So how do you know Sara’s name?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sara…is Sue’s mama. We were always together. She always talked about you, Papa…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Enough… I saw it with my own eyes… Sara’s gone. Dead… Or are you tellin’ me you came here from some other world?” he demanded with a piercing glare.</p>

    <p class="TX">Surya, however, wasn’t in the slightest bit intimidated. “It’s okay. It will all make sense soon. That’s what you wished for, Papa…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“Wished…?”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">He scowled at her, unable to make heads or tails of anything she said.</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment, he was struck by a severe migraine.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Gah<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">He keeled over, clutching his head in pain.</p>

    <p class="TX">That was when he realized that something was off… This was no ordinary headache. No, it was more like an enormous amount of information was being injected into his mind.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…—…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Several minutes later, he slowly pulled himself up, his whole body coated in a thick layer of sweat.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 97. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_97" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…What…the<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Then in utter confusion, his voice a wretched mess of rage and despair, he cried, “What the hell are all these memories<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">After the commotion at the western edge of the Garden, Kuroe made her way alone to the library’s underground archives.</p>

    <p class="TX">This was where the Garden stored most of its prohibited books and important documents, and it was off-limits to students. It also comprised the uppermost level of the underground containment facility that Clara Tokishima had attacked two months ago, but it had since been restored to its original condition.</p>

    <p class="TX">Fortunately, no materials were lost or damaged during that incident. However, the attack couldn’t have been brushed off, considering that Clara had stolen something of even greater importance—the heart of the Ouroboros.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe took a seat in the farthest corner of the archive and placed her hand on a computer terminal to log in.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Authentication: Kuroe Karasuma.”</p>

    <p class="TX">A small electronic tone resonated in response as a beam of light passed first through the palm of her hand, then scanned her eyes. Finally, after she’d finished entering a complicated password, a three-dimensional projection in the shape of a book appeared before her.</p>

    <p class="TX">This terminal for viewing electronic materials was completely independent of any external network. Only Saika Kuozaki herself had access to it, along with her attendant, who, for official purposes, had been granted special permission.</p>

    <p class="TX">Why? Because these records contained crucial information on the twelve mythic-class annihilation factors that Saika had subdued in ages past—information known only to her.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Access data on Annihilation Factor No. 010,” she murmured.</p>

    <p class="TX">With that command, the three-dimensional book projection flipped to the relevant page.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 98. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_98" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">She spent a full ten minutes skimming through its contents. As she did, the vague possibility that had occurred to her just a short while ago was replaced with gut certainty.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Could she have—”</p>

    <p class="TX">But at that moment, her cell phone began to vibrate in her pocket.</p>

    <p class="TX">Someone was calling her. She glanced down at the screen and saw that Erulka’s name had popped up.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hi, Karasuma here. How can I help?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“Mm-hmm. We’ve just confirmed another disappearance, this time in Eastern Europe. It’s considerably smaller in scale compared to the previous three cases, but the phenomenon seems to be increasing in pace. It might only be coincidence that it struck once per day up till now.”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe gritted her teeth and furrowed her brow… As an attendant, she was supposed to maintain a calm demeanor at all times, but with everything going on, no one could blame her for letting her emotions show now.</p>

    <p class="TX">There was still no hard evidence. But if her suspicions were correct, there was no time to waste. And so, in that split second, she made up her mind.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I have a request, Knight Erulka.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“Hmm? Go on.”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">“…Please secure Surya, with all haste. Treat her with the utmost courtesy, and do not convey so much as a hint of hostility to her.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“Surya… Ah, the girl. Why?”</i> Erulka asked, her skepticism readily apparent.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that was only natural.</p>

    <p class="TX">Forcing herself to keep from letting the panic in her heart show, Kuroe continued, “She may be an annihilation factor… Or rather, there’s a possibility she may have fused with one, much like Clara Tokishima.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“…What?”</i> Erulka muttered in disbelief. <i>“Are you saying she pretended to be Anviet’s daughter to infiltrate the Garden?”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">“No. Her intentions may not be hostile. However, if my suspicions <span aria-label=" Page 99. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_99" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>are correct, her actions could have a profound effect on the world, whether she wants to or not.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“What do you mean?</i> Which <i>annihilation factor are we talking about?”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">“The object-type annihilation factor Fortuna, the Wheel of Fate—a device for fulfilling wishes.”</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1"><i>“This is an urgent message for Knight Anviet Svarner and Sue Svarner. Please report to the central command center immediately. I repeat—”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">For the umpteenth time, an emergency announcement blared over the Garden’s PA system.</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika was busy scouring the Garden’s western area—and it wasn’t just her. Glancing around, she could see countless students searching to and fro, all of them searching for Anviet at Erulka’s instruction.</p>

    <p class="TX">To be more precise, it was Surya whom they really needed to find, but only a select few individuals—such as Saika and Ruri—were aware of that.</p>

    <p class="TX">At any rate, the Garden was essentially in the middle of a manhunt, and as a student herself, Saika was involved in the search. Mushiki and Ruri had wanted to accompany her, but after she told them it would be more efficient to split up, they reluctantly complied, albeit with a great many tears.</p>

    <p class="TX">The fact that there was no end to the announcements over the PA system meant that neither Anviet nor Surya had yet been located.</p>

    <p class="TX">Knowing Anviet, it was difficult to imagine him purposefully ignoring an urgent summons.</p>

    <p class="TX">That being the case, it was likely that he was beyond the PA system’s reach…unless he really was intentionally ignoring the summons for some reason.</p>

    <p class="TX">If it was the former, they still had time. But if they were dealing with the latter scenario…</p>

    <p class="TX">“Anviet<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Saika murmured sorrowfully when she spotted a figure on the path farther ahead.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 100. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_100" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She was struck by a sense of unease, which prompted her to look up.</p>

    <p class="TX">The reason was simple—that figure was utterly out of place in its surrounding environment.</p>

    <p class="TX">She was a tall-statured woman—probably over two meters, by Saika’s estimate—and though it wasn’t the season for it, she was dressed in a long coat and wide-brimmed hat pulled low over her eyes. From beneath her hat, tufts of long hair swayed in the wind.</p>

    <p class="TX">At the very least, she wasn’t a student. But Saika had a hard time imagining anyone like her among the teaching or administrative staff, either.</p>

    <p class="TX">Most peculiar of all, however, was that no one else seemed to be paying any attention to her.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Miss?” the woman called out as she strolled Saika’s way. “Do you have a moment? You wouldn’t happen to have seen a young girl, around ten years old, would you? She has beautiful blond hair, and her name… Yes, her name is Surya.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…How do you know about Surya?” Saika repeated, instantly entering a state of heightened vigilance.</p>

    <p class="TX">Perhaps sensing her reaction, the woman let out a low growl. “Oh dear… Has the Garden already discovered her secret, then? Well, I suppose there’s no helping it. Plan B, it is.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Lifting the brim of her hat with a gloved hand, the woman revealed her face.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika lost herself in the sight of those poisonous crimson lips, of the eye staring back at her from between the bandages wrapped around her head.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">The search had been going on for nearly two hours.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Did you find Mr. Anviet?!” Mushiki called out the moment he entered the central command center.</p>

    <p class="TX">Erulka, Kuroe, and Hildegarde turned to face him, the last woman visibly flinching, startled by his volume.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 101. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_101" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Not yet… Though in terms of location, perhaps we <i>do</i> know where he is,” Erulka said with a bitter frown.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki tilted his head to one side, not having expected such an evasive response.</p>

    <p class="TX">While out looking for Anviet and Surya, he had received an urgent call from Kuroe, telling him to hurry to the command center. Naturally, he had expected them to have made some progress, but it seemed that Anviet’s whereabouts remained unknown.</p>

    <p class="TX">Incidentally, Ruri was trailing along behind him. She wasn’t physically attached to his back this time, but she was so close that it made little difference.</p>

    <p class="TX">At Saika’s insistence, the siblings had split up to look for Anviet—but that hadn’t stopped Ruri from bumping into him at the earliest opportunity.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What a coincidence, dearest brother. Or is this fate? Destiny perhaps?” she had said when he pointed it out. He knew there was no use in pursuing the matter any further.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Um… What do you mean, <i>in terms of location</i>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Take a look,” Kuroe urged. “We just received a communication. Silvelle—Sis—if you would?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“On it!”</i> Silvelle’s voice rang out through the empty air as she appeared hovering over the table.</p>

    <p class="TX">Next to her was an image of Anviet with Surya by his side.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Is that—”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki startled as the Anviet in the video sharpened his gaze, as if to lock on to his target.</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“I challenge you to a duel, Saika Kuozaki of the Garden… Let’s have us a fair and reasonable contest.”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">“What—”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“The place will be the Mishiroyama Trainin’ Ground. No rules, anythin’ goes. The outcome’ll be decided by death or surrender. If you ignore this request…”</i> He paused for a moment, glancing down at Surya. <i>“I’ll destroy the world with the annihilation factor Fortuna… You catch my drift?”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 102. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_102" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Mushiki’s breath caught in his throat.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Destroy the world<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? He can’t mean that, can he<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? That’s the exact opposite of the Garden’s role. Besides, it can’t be that easy to just—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“It is,” Kuroe interrupted with a shake of her head. “If indeed the Fortuna has been revived, it is certainly within the realm of possibility.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“S-seriously<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki had no idea what exactly the Fortuna was or its potential for destruction, but Kuroe would never say something like that unless she absolutely meant it. He could feel his forehead breaking out into a cold sweat.</p>

    <p class="TX">Erulka wore a troubled look as she stroked her chin. “…I can’t begin to imagine his motives, but if he has the Fortuna, we can’t <i>not</i> comply… Saika. You all heard him. We need her to strike him down without mercy.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Th-that’s right!” Ruri chimed in. “For someone with his losing streak, he really ought to know his place! We’ll just have to show him what’s what!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Erulka, however, tilted her head to one side. “…And where <i>is</i> Saika? Wasn’t she with you?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh? We split up. I thought she had come back here<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Mushiki answered. Just then, an alarm began to sound throughout the command center.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What on earth is that?” Erulka demanded.</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“We’ve received an external communication—from Saachie,”</i> Silvelle said. As the self-proclaimed older sister of all humanity, she treated even Saika herself like a younger sibling.</p>

    <p class="TX">“From Saika<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Pass it through, Sis,” Erulka instructed.</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“Got it!”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment, a grainy video started playing in the center of the room.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">One look was enough for Mushiki to furrow his brows in worry.</p>

    <p class="TX">And he wasn’t alone. Ruri, Erulka, Hildegard—even Kuroe—were visibly shocked.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 103. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_103" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>But that was to be expected. After all, the image showed Saika tied to a chair with a rope.</p>
