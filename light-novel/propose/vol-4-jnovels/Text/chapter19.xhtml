    <p class="COTX">“Clara? Clara? Wake up, Clara!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hmm… What’s up, Kiritan?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Having been roused from sleep by a rough shake, Clara Tokishima—her garish pink hair tied back in two ponytails, her ears positively swarming with piercings and ear cuffs, her fingernails painted in a myriad of colors—rubbed her eyes and sat up.</p>

    <p class="TX">She was currently residing in an apartment located somewhere in Tokyo, and she’d been snoring loudly as she lay on the sofa with her legs spread. A small blanket covered her abdomen, but other than that, her underwear was completely exposed.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<i>Yaaawn…</i> Not getting enough sleep totally wrecks your skin, you know? What am I s’pposed to do if I end up with a major skin issue or something?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“In that case, maybe you should consider removing your makeup before you take a nap? And forget skin problems—you’ve recovered from fatal wounds before. So I don’t think it will be too much of an issue.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ugh. Those two things are, like, totally different topics. Did you forget your inner girly vibe somewhere?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I don’t want to hear that from someone who sleeps with their underwear exposed…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 154. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_154" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Seriously, what’s up with you?” Clara asked with a pout.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes, Clara wasn’t just a flashy young woman—she was a mage and a streamer, too. But most important, she was also an immortal human being with part of the mythic-class annihilation factor the Ouroboros embedded inside her.</p>

    <p class="TX">After her recent grand tour of the Garden, she was now a wanted fugitive, pursued by mages all over the world. Consequently, she had decided to lie low in this modest apartment for the time being.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…So, like, did something happen?” she asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh, I almost forgot. Take a look at this.” Kiriko Araibe, the owner of the apartment building, repositioned her thick glasses before passing Clara her smartphone. Incidentally, said smartphone was one of many Clara gave her followers in order to gather information, allowing them to access websites available only to mages.</p>

    <p class="TX">While Kiriko might have come across as an ordinary human being at first glance, she was actually undead, an Immortal who couldn’t be killed. Clara had stolen her death from her, turning her into one of countless servants. She was an illustrator by trade, and the reason Clara had chosen her as her personal attendant was because Kiriko tended to hole herself up at home on weekdays.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Look, see? The video. Isn’t that the guy you were talking about?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Is that Mushipi? Whoa. This is a <i>super</i> rare find!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Indeed. Kiriko had just shown her a clip on MagiTube, a mage-exclusive video-sharing app, featuring her boyfriend, Mushiki Kuga.</p>

    <p class="TX">He was in his usual Garden uniform, and there was a somewhat nervous cast to his face. Clara’s heart almost skipped a bit as she looked at his beautiful innocence up close.</p>

    <p class="TX">But there was something else about the video that caught her attention.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. It was titled <i>To Clara</i>.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? For <i>moi</i><span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? I wonder what it could be. Oh my God, could it be a confession of love or something? This is <i>sooo</i> awkward!”</p>

    <p class="TX">She squirmed on her chair before tapping the <small>PLAY</small> button.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then, with a slight tremble to his voice, Mushiki began to speak: <i>“Second substantiation, first letter. Fourth substantiation, fourth letter. The level of the underground battle beneath the library…”</i></p>
