    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 122. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_122" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“But you are <i>not</i> presently Lady Saika.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I know that.” Mushiki shook his head. “But something tells me he’ll still face me if he thinks I really mean it.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…And what basis do you have for saying that?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I mean, I don’t have any real evidence or anything. But…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“But?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Maybe because we would both be fighting for those we love.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That hurts, Kuroe. Kuroe?” He squirmed as she tugged on his earlobe.</p>

    <p class="TX">“This is no time for jokes.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I wasn’t joking,” he insisted. “…Besides, I don’t honestly think Mr. Anviet <i>wants</i> to harm the world.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm…” Kuroe hesitated. She must have suspected as much, too.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mr. Anviet isn’t the kind of person to destroy the world if we don’t give in to his demands… Saika, though, she would see through his front and fight him anyway. Out of respect for his determination… Right?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Indeed. That was precisely why this didn’t sit well with Mushiki. Despite everything, Anviet still believed in Saika Kuozaki.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe mulled this over before she finally heaved a sigh.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Assuming you’re correct, would that not make it even more prudent to negotiate? If he has no intention of using the Fortuna, there would be no need to go through the trouble of fighting.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That won’t work,” Mushiki insisted.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Why not?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Because that isn’t how Saika would respond.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe fell silent at this show of confidence.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. Whatever the reason, Anviet wanted a one-on-one fight with Saika.</p>

    <p class="TX">And Saika Kuozaki would never ignore a student’s desperate wish.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 123. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_123" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>At long last, Kuroe sighed weakly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Good grief. I suppose I wouldn’t, no,” she answered as her true self. “Yes, you’re right. What a bind… In the time I’ve been without my body, it seems you’ve become a better me than me.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Saika<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Mushiki called out sadly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Very well,” Kuroe responded, wearing a soft smile. “Let’s give it a shot.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Right!” He nodded forcefully.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Well, our bodies have been separated,” she continued with a playful shrug. “Even if you lose, it wouldn’t physically affect <i>me</i>. If you kick the bucket, I’ll arrange a proper funeral for you.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I-I’ll do my best to make sure that doesn’t happen<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm. Maybe this <i>will</i> stand a chance<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“No… If you’re going to do it, you have to put in a proper showing, all right?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Y-yes…”</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">“Lady Saika’s techniques… Magnificent,” Kuroe murmured as Mushiki emerged from the cloud of dust.</p>

    <p class="TX">Her voice was as composed as ever, but a thin layer of sweat glistened on her cheeks, and her heart was racing with excitement.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that was unsurprising. After all, Mushiki had just manifested Saika’s second and third substantiations while he was still in his own body.</p>

    <p class="TX">Unlike conventional magic, substantiation techniques used the human body itself as part of their formulas. For that reason, it wasn’t enough to possess immense magical power; if your body, your cells, your genetic sequences differed, it was impossible to replicate someone else’s substantiation techniques without meeting a very specific set of conditions.</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>However</i>—and this was only a small, nagging feeling—a faint <i>something</i> tugged at Saika’s thoughts.</p>

    <p class="TX">Indeed, her body and Mushiki’s body were now separated.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 124. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_124" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>And yet if Saika had actually been taken captive by some rogue criminal, where had her powers disappeared to?</p>

    <p class="TX">The answer now stood before Kuroe in the most indisputable form.</p>

    <p class="TX">If not for Mushiki and Saika’s unnatural separation at the hands of the Fortuna, this contradictory state would have been well and truly impossible.</p>

    <p class="TX">No. It wasn’t quite so simple, Kuroe corrected herself.</p>

    <p class="TX">For the past three months, Mushiki had been living <i>as</i> Saika, adopting her personality, using her abilities, and fighting her enemies—all of which made him uniquely capable of working this miracle.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mushiki…” Kuroe found herself clenching her fists as her beloved disciple emerged in spectacular fashion.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">“…What kinda sick joke is this?” Anviet demanded uncertainly in the middle of the training ground.</p>

    <p class="TX">His gaze contained a potent mix of hostility and wariness, along with a slight hint of curiosity.</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s…Saika’s…”</p>

    <p class="TX">But no one was more surprised than Mushiki. Instinctively, he had raced to shield himself from Anviet’s attack—and just like that, his body was shrouded with Saika’s substantiations.</p>

    <p class="TX">It was almost like Saika herself had swooped in to save him. He couldn’t help trembling with emotion.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">But he had to pull himself together… After all, Kuroe had drilled it into him that a good mage had to know how to accept phenomena as they occurred, know how to understand them, to use them.</p>

    <p class="TX">And so Mushiki responded with a fearless smile.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Good work. You did an excellent job of dodging my attack. I was hoping to deal a decisive blow with that last one.”</p>

    <p class="TX">This, of course, was merely a bluff. He didn’t really understand how this had happened.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 125. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_125" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Before that, it had been a struggle just to maintain Saika’s substantiations. He was simply standing firmly on the ground, and yet it felt like his magic, his physical strength, every last ounce of his energy were being sucked out of him. It was a far cry from when he used these powers in Saika’s body.</p>

    <p class="TX">But he feigned composure all the same, flashing his foe a graceful smile.</p>

    <p class="TX">Why? Because Saika herself would have done just that.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hmph.” Anviet stooped over, shooting Mushiki a piercing stare. “It’s a copy…an illusion… I ain’t clued in on your tricks, but you got any idea what that sight means to me?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“A symbol of your defeat?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmph. Take this.”</p>

    <p class="TX">No sooner had Anviet finished speaking than a lightning bolt crackled across the grounds as he vanished in the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p class="TX">That same moment, several streaks of lightning struck down from above, aimed straight for Mushiki.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ngh…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Catching his breath, Mushiki gently struck the butt of his staff against the ground.</p>

    <p class="TX">It let out a faint glow, causing the earth to ripple. Then the ground itself reached up to shield him, blocking the thunderbolts bearing down from above.</p>

    <p class="TX">This was Saika’s second substantiation, Stellarium, capable of transforming the world howsoever she pleased.</p>

    <p class="TX">It seemed, however, that Mushiki wasn’t quite able to unleash its full potential, as several lightning strikes tore through gaps in his makeshift shield.</p>

    <p class="TX">Thankfully, the third substantiation in which his body was garbed, Animaclad, safely repelled them.</p>

    <p class="TX">…No. That wasn’t quite right.</p>

    <p class="TX">Just before the bursts of electricity could reach him, they veered off in the opposite direction.</p>

    <p class="TX">This was the result of the divine protection offered by Saika’s <span aria-label=" Page 126. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_126" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>techniques—the manipulation of chance itself. In short, her Animaclad robe bestowed its wearer with extraordinary luck.</p>

    <p class="TX">Without these two substantiations, Mushiki would no doubt have been beaten by Anviet’s first strike.</p>

    <p class="TX">“They’re the real deal<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!” Anviet cried, floating in the air with an explosive radiance like a thunder god incarnate.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I ain’t got no clue what the hell’s goin’ on here, but that’s gotta be Kuozaki’s doin’<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Fine, then! I ain’t gonna show you no mercy! I’ll smash you to bits, goddamn it!” he howled.</p>

    <p class="TX">His voice and face were awash with intense fury, with boundless animosity. But in the distance beyond his hatred loomed something even greater—an overwhelming sense of grief.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Ugh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Dodging and shielding himself from a hail of lightning strikes, Mushiki continued to wield Saika’s Stellarium to transform the world around him as he launched a series of counterattacks.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mr. Anviet!” he screamed amid the dazzling barrage of light.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!” Anviet shot back.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’m sorry about Sara, I really am<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! And if Saika was involved, I understand why you can’t forgive her! But Saika—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Shuddup!” Anviet interrupted. “Actin’ like you know how it went down… What the hell could <i>you</i> possibly understand?! About how helpless you feel not bein’ able to protect your girl… Watchin’ her breathe her last in your arms<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I…” Mushiki swallowed his next words, unable to respond.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet was right. No matter what he said, he couldn’t possibly understand how that must have felt to someone who had experienced it all firsthand.</p>

    <p class="TX">And yet… He gritted his teeth.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I can’t say I know how you feel,” he began. “But I know what it’s like to be unable to save someone you care about.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hah?” Anviet broke into a dark scowl.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. Mushiki couldn’t possibly share in Anviet’s sorrow and despair.</p>

    <p class="TX">But he, too, had lost the love of his life on no less than two separate occasions.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 127. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_127" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The first time was in that urban labyrinth, when he’d brought a blood-soaked Saika into his arms.</p>

    <p class="TX">The second was the other Saika, who had come back from the future.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I…I was powerless. I can’t help but wonder if it might have been different if I had just been a little stronger… But I have to live on! I have to <i>become</i> stronger<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Because I have to carry on Saika’s mission<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What are you blabberin’ about<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! She’s still kickin’ just fine!” Anviet fired back in bewilderment.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that wasn’t unreasonable. After all, he didn’t know everything that had happened between Mushiki and Saika, let alone about the Saika from the future.</p>

    <p class="TX">“And why the hell are you bringin’ Kuozaki’s name up here?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Because…because I’m going to marry her one day!” Mushiki shouted in his loudest voice yet.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">“…How can he<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? And so loudly<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe broke into a nervous sweat as she watched the intense battle unfold before her.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that was only natural. After all, Mushiki had shouted something absolutely preposterous in the heat of combat, and at the top of his lungs, no less.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…You idiot.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Yet in her heart, Kuroe breathed easy.</p>

    <p class="TX">No one else had overheard him.</p>

    <p class="TX">And more importantly, no one else could see her reaction.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">“You’ve been off your rocker since you came out here! Just how insane are you?! Did you dope yourself to be able to use Kuozaki’s moves or somethin’?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“How rude! I’ll do anything for Saika! I’ll take any blow!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That ain’t my point!” Anviet cried as the two of them exchanged fresh strikes.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki stood his ground. “I’ll do anything for the woman I love! <span aria-label=" Page 128. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_128" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Even if it means fighting you, Mr. Anviet! You’d do the same, wouldn’t you?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet’s voice caught in his throat. Readying his next attack in midair, he let his body fill with raw power.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I warned you. If you’re dead set on this, I’ll treat you like Kuozaki herself and knock you outta the park with everythin’ I’ve got<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">There was a change in the air.</p>

    <p class="TX">It was enough to make Mushiki’s skin crawl. Furrowing his brow, he poured his strength into his staff.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Stellarium<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">The ground beneath Anviet’s feet undulated, writhing in response to an invisible will as it lashed out.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet, however, spread his palms wide to brush the attack away.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I command you,” he began, his four vajras circling above him like satellites. <i>“Construct my fortress in the golden garden where heaven and earth hold no sway, beyond even the reach of the gods.”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">With those words, the electric storm raging around him grew stronger and more intense.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Fourth Substantiation: Aksara Nirsvarna!”</p>

    <p class="TX">A fourth layer to Anviet’s world crest unfurled behind his back, a radiant burst of light emanating from its outer edge.</p>

    <p class="TX">At the same time, bolts of electricity coursed down his body, radically transforming the world around him.</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">A sea of clouds spread out around him as far as the eye could see, their surfaces aglow with a dreamlike radiance.</p>

    <p class="TX">A golden palace peaked out between gaps in their movements, along with trident vajra after trident vajra in seemingly endless abundance.</p>

    <p class="TX">It was like a cosmic paradise. Any nonmage might have concluded that they had suffered a fatal blow and been whisked up to heaven.</p>

    <p class="TX">This was a fourth substantiation—a mage’s most potent and deeply kept technique, the pinnacle of substantiations, capable of repainting the space around themselves with a world of their own creation.</p>
