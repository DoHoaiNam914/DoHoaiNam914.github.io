    <p class="COTX">“…Excellent.”</p>

    <p class="TX">After receiving the latest report on the operation, Willows looked up at the ceiling and put his hands together with a slow clap.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes, there’s no virtue quite like being quick at your job. Life’s short. Wrapping things up pronto is basically an investment in life itself.”</p>

    <p class="TX">His subordinates, waiting at the side of the room, offered up picture-perfect smiles.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Exactly right.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Couldn’t have said it better myself.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">…They understood nothing. Willows breathed a thin sigh as he turned to his dim-witted lackeys.</p>

    <p class="TX">He wasn’t really angry. Loyal subordinates had their uses, no matter how dull. They had dedicated their lives to serving him, irreplaceable though they ought to have been. Any competent underling realized this sooner or later. They either left him, started asking for a higher wage, or sought to usurp his throne. Of course, any who tried that last option ended up biting the dust.</p>

    <p class="TX">In any event, he had just received good news. There was no need to be so negative.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 106. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_106" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Yes. Just a few moments ago, Zhu Yin had sent word that she had taken a young woman at the Garden hostage.</p>

    <p class="TX">“So where is Surya now?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I have the girl locked away underground.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I see. Smart thinking.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Willows had set up base in a property owned by one of the many dummy companies affiliated with Salix. The ground floor was the same as any old building, but the basement served as a warehouse for storing illicit goods. Needless to say, security was extremely tight. If some powerless girl had been taken captive, there was no way she could hope to escape.</p>

    <p class="TX">“But <i>locked away</i>…that’s a bit harsh. I love Surya like my own daughter. She’s my <i>lucky charm</i>. She brings enormous benefit to the organization.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Willows twisted his lips into a smile.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes, Surya truly was a <i>lucky charm</i>. Since the moment she came into the world, she had possessed a unique magical property. She was extraordinary, bringing blessings and good fortune to those around her by her mere presence.</p>

    <p class="TX">It was largely thanks to her that Salix, originally just a ragtag assemblage of low-level stray mages, had grown to its present size and scale.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Now then, shall we? My beloved princess awaits.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Of course… This way,” one of his subordinates said, motioning down the corridor.</p>

    <p class="TX">With a grandiose nod, Willows headed toward the elevator, taking it to the basement level.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Oh dear.”</p>

    <p class="TX">No sooner had the doors slid open than a woman called out to him.</p>

    <p class="TX">She was more than two meters tall, and the upper half of her face was covered in blood-soaked bandages. She left a haunting impression; that was for sure. In fact, several of Willows’s subordinates were so overwhelmed by her presence that they had been trembling since the moment they’d first laid eyes on her.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Greetings, Mr. Willows. How can I help?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 107. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_107" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“I’m not about to rest on my laurels if you’ve retrieved my overly spirited little girl.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh my. Aren’t we impatient?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Zhu Yin’s crimson lips contorted in a smile as she pointed to the door at the end of the corridor.</p>

    <p class="TX">Willows waved a hand in front of the authentication device installed in front of the door, waiting for it to unlock with an electronic beep.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then he reached for the handle and opened the door.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Long time no see, my sweet little Surya. Where have you been? I was so worried about you. I couldn’t sleep at night, always—”</p>

    <p class="TX">He stopped midsentence.</p>

    <p class="TX">The reason was simple—Surya wasn’t in the room.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">For some reason, a young woman in a maid outfit was staring back at him.</p>

    <p class="TX">He saw his reflection in the depths of her vivid iridescent eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">At that moment—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Kyaaarrrggghhh!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Consumed by fear, Willows let out a bloodcurdling scream without hesitation or restraint.</p>

    <p class="TX">“B-Boss<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” called one of his subordinates.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh my. What’s this, all of a sudden?” Zhu Yin approached with an inquisitive glance.</p>

    <p class="TX">All this, however, was to be expected. Up until now, Willows had always presented himself as his organization’s arrogant kingpin, but now here he was, wailing at the top of his voice as his legs quivered like a newborn fawn’s.</p>

    <p class="TX">But Willows didn’t have the luxury of keeping his cool.</p>

    <p class="TX">After all, standing right in front of him was—</p>

    <p class="TX">“…S-Saika…Kuozaki<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">It was she, the Garden’s very own Madam Witch, who was hailed as the strongest mage in the whole world.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What…is <i>she</i> doing here<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 108. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_108" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Now that you mention it, I <i>have</i> seen her before<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” one of his subordinates murmured behind him.</p>

    <p class="TX">Zhu Yin, however, seemed somehow puzzled. “Who? I feel like I’ve heard that name somewhere.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Are you an idiot?! Have you been living under a rock?! It’s Saika Kuozaki!” Willows wailed.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah. Well. Aren’t you a stray mage?” Zhu Yin shrugged, as if to ask what the big deal was.</p>

    <p class="TX">This, however, was no time to get into an argument.</p>

    <p class="TX">Willows stormed right up to Zhu Yin, sweat dripping all over his face. “She’s the Garden’s headmistress! The strongest mage in the whole damn world<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! What is <i>she</i> doing <i>here</i><span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! I thought you brought Surya back?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I never said that. I couldn’t find the little girl, so I took a student hostage instead. Did your lackey not explain that to you?” Zhu Yin answered, motioning to one of his subordinates.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! Y-you did<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">The underling in question averted his gaze, like a rat cornered in a dark alley. Willows fixed him with a piercing glare.</p>

    <p class="TX">But now wasn’t the time to dole out punishment, no matter what the level of incompetence. Fighting to keep his racing heart under control, he turned back to Zhu Yin.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Y-you haven’t done anything else, have you<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“No.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“G-good…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Besides sending a threatening video message to the Garden a short while ago.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Whaaat?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Willows fell to the floor, slamming his fists on the ground in despair.</p>

    <p class="TX">“If this lady is as important as you say, perhaps this is a good thing? You <i>do</i> want your Surya back, I assume?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Of course I do! She’s like a magnet for good fortune! The whole group needs her! But do you know the lengths we went to trying to stay under the Garden’s radar?!” Willows howled in abject despair.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 109. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_109" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Zhu Yin, however, brushed off his concerns. “Calm down. I’m a professional. You’re paying me to do a job, and I’ll do it.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“How many times do I have to say it?! We’re past that point now! Nggghhh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! That damn girl is eyeballing me<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! We’re finished!”</p>

    <p class="TX">The next instant, Willows fell silent—because Zhu Yin had reached out abruptly and grabbed him by the neck, tilting his face upward.</p>

    <p class="TX">“And <i>I</i> told <i>you</i>. Leave it to me.” A single, bewitching eye peaked out from behind the bandages wrapped around Zhu Yin’s face.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">The moment Willows locked eyes with it, he froze, utterly petrified.</p>

    <p class="TX">Only then did he realize his mistake. Yes, he had unraveled in front of Saika Kuozaki, but this other woman here also possessed supernatural abilities beyond the imagination.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Be a good boy, now.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Zhu Yin curled her crimson lips into a soft smile as she released Willows from her grip and closed her eye.</p>

    <p class="TX">With that, he crumbled to the floor like a marionette whose strings had been cut.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hah…hah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“B-Boss! Are you okay?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Supported by his men, Willows somehow managed to pull himself to his feet.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Y-you’ve sown the seeds of all this! You’d better make sure you’re the one who reaps it<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I know.” Zhu Yin nodded.</p>

    <p class="TX">Trying his best to look anywhere other than at her or Saika Kuozaki, Willows beat a hasty retreat.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">The Garden’s central command center had descended into pandemonium.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that was only natural. After all, Anviet Svarner, one of the Garden’s highest-ranking mages, had just demanded a duel with Saika.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 110. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_110" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>To make matters worse, Saika herself had been kidnapped, and the culprit was demanding that they hand over Surya in exchange for her safe release.</p>

    <p class="TX">They were facing not one crisis here but two, each with conflicting demands. Both sides wanted what the other had; the Garden, caught in the middle, could satisfy neither.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Let’s calm down, everyone,” Kuroe declared, catching their attention with a clap of her hands. “There is nothing to be gained by panicking. Let’s address our problems one by one.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Kuroe is right.” Erulka stepped in. “Never forget the most important qualities of any good mage. No matter what happens, one can’t allow oneself to give in to hysteria.”</p>

    <p class="TX">At this warning, the others all took a moment to calm themselves. For his part, Mushiki placed a hand on his chest to calm his racing heart.</p>

    <p class="TX">Frankly, he had been unable to think straight ever since learning that Saika had been kidnapped. If, however, they were to react without thinking, they might end up exposing her to even greater danger.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What do we do now? We can’t respond to Mr. Anviet’s demands without Saika, and we can’t negotiate with Saika’s kidnapper without Surya, who’s with Mr. Anviet,” he pointed out.</p>

    <p class="TX">Erulka lapsed into thought for a long moment. “…Our first priority should be dealing with Anviet.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“May I ask why?” Kuroe asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Simple process of elimination… Do you really believe Saika could be taken captive? She must be up to something. Of course, it’s imperative that we determine her whereabouts, but if we have to prioritize one of them, then Anviet must come first. He’s in possession of an annihilation factor, after all.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I see. That is a good point.” Kuroe nodded.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki sensed, however, a faint trace of agitation behind her calm exterior. Perhaps he was the only one who had picked up on it.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Then our first course of action should be to send a messenger to Knight Anviet,” Kuroe continued. “We must tell him that Lady <span aria-label=" Page 111. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_111" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Saika is willing to accept his challenge, while also buying us some more time.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes. But who will go?” Erulka asked. “There’s no guarantee he’ll be in a frame of mind to negotiate. It would be a dangerous task.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes. Leave that to Mushiki and me,” Kuroe declared.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! Wh-why you two?!” Ruri exclaimed.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I am Lady Saika’s attendant, while Mushiki is on good terms with Knight Anviet. We are the best choice,” Kuroe explained matter-of-factly.</p>

    <p class="TX">In truth, Mushiki wasn’t particularly close to Anviet…but, well, they could hardly tell everyone that he had been filling in for Saika these past few months.</p>

    <p class="TX">As far as Ruri was concerned, however, that was neither here nor there.</p>

    <p class="TX">“You can’t send Mushiki off without me!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Having a knight take part in any negotiations would risk complicating the situation even further,” Kuroe pointed out.</p>

    <p class="TX">“But still<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Erulka raised a hand to silence her. “While the others are buying more time, we’ll need you to locate Saika…I take it?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Precisely,” Kuroe answered. “How about it?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Erulka paused to size her up for a long moment, before nodding in agreement. “Very well. We’ll leave Anviet to you.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Very good. Then we’ll leave at once… Let’s go, Mushiki.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Right!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ngh! Ugh!”</p>

    <p class="TX">With Ruri’s muffled cries behind their back, Mushiki and Kuroe left the command center.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Is there any special significance to the Mishiroyama Training Ground?” Mushiki asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“It’s one of the Garden’s external training facilities,” Kuroe answered, taking the lead. “It has no shortage of different environments to fight in, and it’s equipped with various accommodation facilities, too. I can think of no better place to lie in wait for an approaching enemy.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I see… Then let’s get on our way.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 112. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_112" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Yes… Though I do have one concern.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe checked to make sure no one was in earshot before he responded, “I worry that Lady Saika may truly have been taken captive.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki was left at a loss for words.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe glanced over her shoulder at him. “Of course, under regular circumstances, it would be quite impossible for her to fall into an enemy’s hands. As Knight Erulka said, it would be natural to assume that she is merely feigning capture. However, in light of the current situation, I can think of no reason why she would allow herself to be taken willingly.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Th-then what are you suggesting? What kind of mage could snatch her and get away with it<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“A good question. There should be no one in this world so capable… Unless, of course, she cannot employ her magic to its fullest.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…She can’t use her magic?” Mushiki repeated dubiously, when all of a sudden, it dawned on him.</p>

    <p class="TX">It had been several days since the two of them had been separated, but come to think of it, he had never actually seen her use any magic during that time.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes, she hadn’t needed to use any spells in the course of her everyday life, but she had also sat out the practice classes claiming that she was feeling under the weather. Mushiki had put that down to the shock of their unexpected separation, but could it be that she was actually hiding her magical ineptitude<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I should have considered this possibility. Your bodies have indeed been separated, probably as an unintended consequence of the Fortuna. However, there is no guarantee that Lady Saika has been returned to her prefusion state.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“But…but she never said anything!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s what concerns me. Lady Saika was acting extremely normal…as if she herself didn’t realize her situation to begin with.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“How could she not notice<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Mushiki asked in doubt.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 113. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_113" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>But Kuroe left it at that. Perhaps she wasn’t entirely sure herself or had decided they simply didn’t have the time to address that question.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…In any event, there’s nothing more we can do right now. We must find Knight Anviet and inform him that Lady Saika is currently unable to fight him. Our only option is to seek his help rescuing her…or at the very least, to convince him to wait until the other situation is resolved.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Do you think he’ll believe us<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe pulled a taut face.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet was unaware that Mushiki and Saika had fused <i>and</i> that Saika wasn’t in peak condition. There was a very real possibility he would think they were lying.</p>

    <p class="TX">On top of that, there was something else bothering Mushiki—a problem lying at the very heart of their situation.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Why,” he asked with a troubled frown, “would Mr. Anviet even do something like this?”</p>

    <p class="TX">It was less of a question and more an expression of doubt. Even after everything he had seen, he couldn’t bring himself to believe that Anviet was responsible for the present crisis.</p>

    <p class="TX">But perhaps the only way they might learn his motives would be to ask him directly. Mushiki didn’t expect Kuroe to actually respond to his question.</p>

    <p class="TX">But to his surprise, she did precisely that after a long, heavy silence.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I can think of one reason Knight Anviet might go this far…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Mushiki asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe hesitated for a moment. “I mentioned earlier that his wife passed away a hundred years ago.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes… So<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe took a deep breath. “…I’m the one who took her life,” she said as Saika Kuozaki.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki fell silent, dumbfounded.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 114. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_114" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Why would you<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe averted her gaze.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki had to take a deep breath to calm his racing heart.</p>

    <p class="TX">Her confession was completely shocking. But it was precisely at times like these that one had to keep their cool.</p>

    <p class="TX">He had to trust her, as much as it was possible.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Can you tell me<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? About what happened back then?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe let out a thin sigh to brace herself before unleashing the floodgates—and out came the root cause of the century-long grudge between Saika Kuozaki and Anviet Svarner.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">“…And that’s what happened.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">After hearing Kuroe through to the end, Mushiki was left momentarily speechless. He had never imagined that Saika and Anviet could have such a complicated past.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Initially, Anviet bore a strong grudge against me. I wouldn’t be surprised if he contemplated seeking revenge.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…So is he planning on using the Fortuna to kill you?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“No… If that were the case, he would simply have to wish for my death with it. The fact that he’s gone to this extent must mean that he wants to defeat me with his own two hands… He’s challenged me to duels before, and I’ve brushed him off each time. He no doubt realized that by taking the world hostage with the Fortuna, he could force me to face him seriously.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki remained silent, unsure how to respond.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Anyway,” Kuroe continued, reorienting herself. “We need to find him as quickly as possible. Once he knows the person he wants to exact revenge on has been taken captive, he will no doubt shift his approach. Yes, he may have his doubts, but—”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 115. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_115" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>At that moment, however—</p>

    <p class="TX">“No,” Mushiki interrupted before he truly knew what he was doing.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mushiki<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Kuroe called back uncertainly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“S-sorry,” he said, pulling himself back together. “That came out of nowhere…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“No. Let’s hear it,” Kuroe said, staring deep into his eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">There was an urgency to her voice, quite unlike her usual calm and composed demeanor. Perhaps she herself wasn’t entirely sure of Anviet’s intentions.</p>

    <p class="TX">Nor could Mushiki be entirely certain.</p>

    <p class="TX">But after learning of their past, he’d been struck by a vague suspicion.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I have an inkling,” he began, his eyes burning with determination. “Can you let me handle it?”</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet stood with his arms crossed in a remote corner of the Garden’s Mishiroyama Training Ground, waiting impatiently for his opponent to show herself.</p>

    <p class="TX">The training grounds occupied a vast area. They were much wider than the practice facilities in the Garden’s western precinct, and they bore a multitude of visible scars. Given that they were utterly deserted, they might even be mistaken for a ruin at first glance.</p>

    <p class="TX">Despite the early summer season, the air here was cold, likely due to the high altitude. The wind racing through the mountains roared in the background.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes, this was the most fitting location for his showdown with Saika.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet had politely instructed the local administrative staff and the students visiting the site on an intensive training camp to leave. Now, only he and Surya remained.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Papa<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” She spoke up nervously.</p>

    <p class="TX">A faint crack tore through his composure as he turned his gaze to face her.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 116. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_116" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…What? If you’re hungry, go back to your room.”</p>

    <p class="TX">But Surya shook her head. “Maybe you want Sue to stop<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">He fell silent, unable to respond immediately to her quiet appeal.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Sorry,” he said at last. “I didn’t wanna drag you into this…”</p>

    <p class="TX">He gritted his teeth, his forehead creasing in a deep line. He realized he was clenching his fists so tightly that his nails were digging into the palms of his hands.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…That’s one thing I can’t ask. I won’t be satisfied till I beat the crap outta her…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Papa<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Surya called out mournfully.</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment, two familiar faces appeared in the far entrance—Saika’s attendant, Kuroe Karasuma, and the new transfer student, Mushiki Kuga.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet looked them over one at a time, letting out a dismissive snort.</p>

    <p class="TX">“So you came. And? Where’s Kuozaki? She’s low, but she ain’t the kind to sneak up on an enemy, is she?”</p>

    <p class="TX">The two new arrivals exchanged silent glances. After a short pause, Mushiki alone stepped forward.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Whaddaya playin’ at? Just so we’re clear, I ain’t gonna answer your questions. And I’m not here to negotiate. If you wanna stop me, you’d better send Kuozaki to finish me off.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki took a long, deep breath, then opened his eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’ll face you.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hah?” Anviet couldn’t believe his ears.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki took another deep breath, then—</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’ll defeat you in Saika’s place!” he declared at the top of his voice.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">“…Do you realize what you’re sayin’?” Anviet growled, staring daggers at Mushiki.</p>

    <p class="TX">Any weak-willed individual would have fallen to their knees at the <span aria-label=" Page 117. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_117" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>intensity of his stare. And indeed, Mushiki’s heart was racing, and sweat was trickling down his forehead and back.</p>

    <p class="TX">But then he clenched his fists so hard, they were practically shaking, and he returned Anviet’s fierce gaze.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes. If you want to fight Saika, you’ll have to beat me first.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“You’ve gotta be kiddin’ me,” Anviet barked in indignation.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki, however, poured all his strength into his voice, declaring, “Because I’m in love with her!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hah?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet’s jaw dropped.</p>

    <p class="TX">Maybe Mushiki was imagining things, but for a second, Kuroe seemed to fidget in mild discomfort a step behind him.</p>

    <p class="TX">A few seconds later, Anviet grimaced in confusion.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What the hell are you blabberin’ about, Kuga? Did you hit your head or somethin’?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Only during my training.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“You did, then?”</p>

    <p class="TX">His spirits dampened, Anviet scratched the back of his head and heaved a tired sigh.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Just get the hell outta here. I mean it. I ain’t got time for your jokes.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What would you do<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What would you do if I challenged someone <i>you</i> cared about to a duel<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Say, Sara?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What did you just say?” Anviet growled, his brow creasing in suspicion.</p>

    <p class="TX">Judging by his expression, he was struggling to gauge Mushiki’s true intentions—and was no doubt taken aback to hear Mushiki uttering the name of his late wife.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What do you think you’re playin’ at?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I know that was rude of me. But there’s no other way to say it.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What’s your point?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“If <i>you</i> were in that situation, would you be able to stand by and watch?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 118. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_118" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet’s breath caught.</p>

    <p class="TX">“You couldn’t, right? Neither can I… There are things I can’t give up, just like you can’t!” Mushiki declared.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet’s expression twisted in rage. “You’re out of your mind! Kuozaki’s infinitely stronger than you!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“You’re saying if I’m not strong enough, I shouldn’t try to protect the person I love?” Mushiki shouted back.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Tch!” Anviet’s face contorted in indignation.</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“…Haah.”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">After a long moment, he breathed a resigned sigh. “…I ain’t gonna hold back,” he muttered with a sharp look.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki had expected no less.</p>

    <p class="TX">Among the teachers at the Garden, Knight Anviet Svarner might have come across as the most intimidating and foulmouthed—but in truth, he was the kindest of them all.</p>

    <p class="TX">There was no way he could make light of someone’s determination and resolve to stand firm in defense of the people they loved.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Of course. You wouldn’t be able to beat me if you did.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“…Haah…”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet responded to this provocation not with mockery or scorn but with a long, tired exhale.</p>

    <p class="TX">And so marked the beginning of their duel.</p>

    <p class="TX">All at once, an enormous amount of magical energy began to swirl around Anviet, flashes of blinding lightning crackling through the air.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Fine. I’ll make this quick. Stay on your toes, unless you wanna end up a charred piece of nothin’.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet dropped low, twisting his body as if drawing an invisible bow.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Third Substantiation: Vasaras!”</p>

    <p class="TX">With those words, a beautiful golden world crest, a radiant three-layered halo, unfolded behind his back.</p>

    <p class="TX">At the same time, boundless magical energy enveloped his body, coalescing into a suit of golden armor… This was his third substantiation, with the rank of assimilation, in which a mage armored themselves <span aria-label=" Page 119. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_119" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>in their own substantiation magic. Only truly experienced mages were capable of pulling off such techniques.</p>

    <p class="TX">In the face of Anviet’s godlike presence, Mushiki instantly realized that he was facing an all-powerful behemoth.</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment—</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Here goes.”</p>

    <p class="TX">It took only a split second. Probably not even that.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet was more than ten meters away—and then he was right in front of Mushiki in the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p class="TX">Clad in this third substantiation, the man looked as though he had transformed into a bolt of lightning.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Vajdola: Deva Sarya!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Before Mushiki could possibly hope to respond, four trident vajras appeared before him, unleashing simultaneous lightning attacks.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">A tremendous burst of electricity exploded in the center of the training arena.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe furrowed her brow as she watched from the sidelines.</p>

    <p class="TX">With perfect timing, Anviet emerged from the blast, clad in his suit of golden armor.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…He ain’t dead. Still, get him to the infirmary. I tossed the doctors out, but you should be able to patch him up yourself, at least,” Anviet said, his voice tinged with guilt.</p>

    <p class="TX">Despite both parties having agreed to the duel, he wasn’t the kind to take pleasure in beating down a weaker opponent.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe, however, narrowed her eyes. “…What is the meaning of this, Knight Anviet?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hah? Kuga strutted out here himself. He ain’t got no right to complain.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That isn’t what I meant,” she continued with a shake of her head. “It’s unbecoming of a mage to turn their back on an opponent when the battle is still ongoing.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 120. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_120" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet raised a brow in suspicion, when—</p>

    <p class="TX">A beam of light shot through the cloud of dust in the center of the arena, aimed straight for his head.</p>

    <p class="TX">“—?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet quickly dived out of the way, his armored body shimmering.</p>

    <p class="TX">The attack, however, was more than enough to send a shiver down his spine. Anviet spun around in shock.</p>

    <p class="TX">A moment later, someone emerged from the settling dust.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Kuga…what have you done<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he murmured, unable to believe his eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">He couldn’t fathom how Mushiki had managed to survive what should have been a fatal blow. But he was even more taken aback by the boy’s appearance.</p>

    <p class="TX">That response made perfect sense.</p>

    <p class="TX">After all, Mushiki was now clothed in what looked like a sorcerer’s robe and was holding a huge staff topped with an orb in the shape of the earth.</p>

    <p class="TX">Above his head, three world crests combined in the shape of a witch’s hat shimmered in all the colors of the rainbow.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. There were small differences here and there, but there could be no mistake—these second and third substantiations belonged to none other than Saika Kuozaki, the Witch of Resplendent Color.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">“…Is your head on straight?”</p>

    <p class="TX">A short time earlier, just before Mushiki and Kuroe reached the training grounds…</p>

    <p class="TX">After hearing Mushiki’s <i>idea</i>, Kuroe stared back at him in disbelief.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<i>You’re</i> going fight Knight Anviet in Lady Saika’s stead<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? You do realize you would be going up against an S-class mage, don’t you? It wouldn’t be a fair match,” she pointed out bluntly.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki, however, flashed her a wry smile. “I know. But if I were Mr. Anviet…I wouldn’t accept any attempt at negotiation or appeasement. I wouldn’t be satisfied unless Saika confronted me head-on.”</p>
