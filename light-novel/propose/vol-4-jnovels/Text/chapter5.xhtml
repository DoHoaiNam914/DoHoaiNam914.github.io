    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 42. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_42" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Incidentally, there was a child’s chair next to Anviet’s, along with a small table, where Surya was sound asleep. She must have been in the middle of her next artistic endeavor, for she was holding a pencil in one hand, and a half-finished drawing rested under her cheek.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah… Um<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Mushiki stammered, turning in Kuroe’s direction. That was all it took to communicate his question.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe responded with a curt nod, “We’re here to report what we’ve gleaned about Surya’s background so far.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Have you figured anythin’ out?!” Anviet shouted, before quickly covering his mouth in panic.</p>

    <p class="TX">After a timid look in Surya’s direction to confirm she was still sound asleep, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…That was close,” he continued in a noticeably softer voice. “I finally managed to get her to doze off. Don’t startle me like that, you hear?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I see you’ve settled into life as a full-fledged parent,” Kuroe quipped.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Shuddup. So what’d you find?” Anviet urged.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe pulled out a small tablet PC before continuing. “First of all, we’ve identified the stray mages who were chasing after her. They belong to the Salix group.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Um, sorry. What’s the Salix group<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Mushiki asked softly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“A medium-size organization made up of stray mages,” Kuroe answered, staring down at the tablet screen. “Their leader is Doug Willows, a former A-class mage. Salix’s primary activities involve dispatching personnel to various organized crime groups. In essence, they operate as hired muscle in the underworld. Even the most rudimentary magic is considered miracle working by those on the outside… Of course, we should hardly tolerate such activities, but the simple fact of the matter is that we don’t have the resources to put a stop to them.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I see<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Mushiki murmured.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet wore a thoughtful look, his chin cupped in one hand.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 43. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_43" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Kuroe continued reading, “We interrogated the five men captured at the scene, but it seems they were unable to explain why they were chasing Surya. Or to be more precise, they apparently had no idea who our people were referring to.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hah? How do you figure?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“In all likelihood, they were conditioned to automatically erase all memory of their mission in the event of being captured.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Conditioned<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? You mean brainwashed? Why would a bunch of strays go that far? Who the hell are we even dealin’ with here?” Anviet demanded, stealing another peek at the sleeping Surya.</p>

    <p class="TX">“We’re still looking into that. We’re also still investigating her background. However…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“However?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Genetic testing suggests that the probability of any blood relation between you two is extremely low.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Well, yeah. Of course,” Anviet answered as he folded his arms.</p>

    <p class="TX">With his having denied their relationship at every possible opportunity, he must have been expecting this result. There was no sign of surprise on his part.</p>

    <p class="TX">But—and it was hard to fully describe—there was <i>something</i> about his expression that one would never glimpse in the usual Anviet.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mr. Anviet, are you—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<i>Disappointed?</i> Say the words, and I’ll electrify you from your brain to your toes.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hungry? Can I get you something to eat?” Mushiki asked, deftly redirecting the question.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet clearly picked up on the clunkiness of that rejoinder, but he made no further mention of it. “…All right, I get it. Anythin’ else?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Not yet,” Kuroe answered. “We’ll leave you to it.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah…h-hold on a sec.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Just before Mushiki and Kuroe could turn to leave, Anviet called out to them once more.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sorry ’bout this, but I’m up to my ears in work. Can you take Surya to nap in the duty room or somethin’?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 44. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_44" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Eh? Ah, okay. I guess so… Why not let her stay here, though?” Mushiki answered.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hah? Sleepin’ on your desk is a surefire way to ruin your posture. Not to mention the risk of blood clots. You never heard of traveler’s thrombosis? You’d better wisen up if you know what’s good for you.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…R-right…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Faced with such a sound argument, Mushiki could do little else but nod nervously in response.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Um… Kuroe?” he asked, crouching down.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Understood.”</p>

    <p class="TX">As if sensing his implied request, Kuroe wrapped an arm under Surya’s body, slowly lifted her up, and rested her on Mushiki’s back.</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s it<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he whispered, praying that she wouldn’t wake up.</p>

    <p class="TX">Now that she was safe and secure, he rose back to his feet.</p>

    <p class="TX">“We’ll be off, then.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yeah,” Anviet answered with a light wave of his hand.</p>

    <p class="TX">Bowing their heads slightly, Mushiki and Kuroe left the staff room.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki made his way down the halls at a slow pace so as not to wake Surya. The duty room, if he remembered correctly, was at the far edge of the central school building.</p>

    <p class="TX">It was six o’clock in the evening—several hours since classes had ended, so the building was mostly quiet. The setting sun flooded the corridor in orange, lending it an otherworldly atmosphere.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Are you all right, Mushiki?” Kuroe asked all of a sudden.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Surya may be a child, but it always feels heavier carrying someone when they’re unconscious or sleeping.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki shook slightly, adjusting Surya’s position on his back.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I can handle this much. Maybe all that training has been good for my physique?” he joked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Maybe,” Kuroe answered, eyes downcast. “It’s been nearly three months since you joined us here. How time flies… It hardly feels that long.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 45. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_45" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“No, I guess it doesn’t.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki let out a deep sigh.</p>

    <p class="TX">Indeed, so much had happened since he had fused with Saika and enrolled at the Garden that he’d barely had any time to catch his breath. It all started when a mysterious assailant attacked him and Saika; then there was the rivalry between the Garden and the Tower along with Clara Tokishima’s scheming, followed by the commotion surrounding Ruri’s supposed engagement and the incident at the Ark. It was no exaggeration to say that he had been constantly involved in one potentially world-ending dilemma after another.</p>

    <p class="TX">“But mages have been living like this behind the scenes for ages, right?” he asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s certainly true, but the incidents we’ve seen these past few months are unprecedented in the history of the Garden. After all, several mythic-class annihilation factors have emerged in rapid succession.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Come to think of it, that was probably true as well. It seemed he had joined the Garden at an incredible time.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’m not exaggerating when I say that if not for Lady Saika, we would have been incapable of surmounting those crises. Once again, thank you.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I-it’s nothing…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Besides,” Kuroe continued, “I’ve had plenty of new experiences these past few months as well. I was never able to enjoy the Garden as a student before. It’s refreshing…fun, even. I would like to keep enjoying life like this for a little while longer yet.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Kuroe<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Mushiki began.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Please, rest assured,” she answered with a slight shake of her head. “I haven’t forgotten our promise. Nor, I expect, have you, Mushiki. No?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…No,” he confirmed. “My goal hasn’t changed, either. I want to separate myself from Saika and meet her again. Not through a mirror. Not through another body. As two separate individuals.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 46. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_46" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The moment he uttered those words, Kuroe’s eyes seemed to flutter for a brief second. She furrowed her brow and averted her gaze.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki’s breath caught in his throat as he watched on.</p>

    <p class="TX">Even though it was after hours and the building was largely deserted, there was no guarantee that no one was listening in. Of course, he doubted that anyone would understand the exchange even if they did manage to overhear it, but that still didn’t mean they could discuss the matter so casually.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sorry. That was thoughtless of me.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…No, not that. Did you hear anything just now?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki blinked a few times.</p>

    <p class="TX">“No, nothing…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I see.” Kuroe looked around once more, then breathed a shallow sigh. “My apologies. Perhaps I’m a little on edge.”</p>

    <p class="TX">With that, she cleared her throat as if to set her thoughts in order.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Now then, a lot has happened today, but we must stick to our routine. Once we’ve left Surya in the duty room, we should pick up where we left off yesterday.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Right. Ruri and I have made some new cards, actually.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I wasn’t talking about your Lady Saika game.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah… Sorry,” Mushiki apologized.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe breathed a deep sigh. “…One round. After that, training.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh? Ah… Right!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Making his way down the corridor dyed red by the setting sun, Mushiki could have jumped for joy, if not for the little girl resting on his back.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">The following morning, Mushiki awoke a little earlier than usual to a feeling of mild discomfort.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">In the haze of his still half-asleep consciousness, a shred of doubt popped into his mind.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 47. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_47" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>It wasn’t something simple, like how one might feel after waking up from a bad dream, or when the sun coming in through the window was shining stronger than usual, or when the large-scale construction work was underway in the neighboring dormitory room. <i>Something</i> felt off, but he couldn’t put his finger on what exactly.</p>

    <p class="TX">With time, that sensation began to solidify.</p>

    <p class="TX">The first thing he noticed was the scent.</p>

    <p class="TX">A sweet fragrance, like floral soap, tickled his nostrils… It certainly wasn’t the kind of aroma one would expect to find in a boys’ dormitory.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Like a bee lulled by the promise of honey, he slowly opened his eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">And then—</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment, he went as stiff as a rock.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that was entirely reasonable.</p>

    <p class="TX">After all, laid out before him was a most unbelievable sight—for two very different reasons.</p>

    <p class="TX">Lying beside him on the cramped bed was a young woman, still sound asleep.</p>

    <p class="TX">That alone would have been shocking enough to prompt his heart to leap right out of his chest; indeed, it was already beating wildly.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that wasn’t all. Yes, the sight had startled him, but if that was everything, it wouldn’t have left him as overwhelmingly distressed as he presently found himself.</p>

    <p class="TX">The issue was in confirming who, precisely, she was.</p>

    <p class="TX">Trembling faintly with each heartbeat, Mushiki tried to examine her features in full.</p>

    <p class="TX">Her hair was positively sparkling, no less radiant than the sun streaming in through the window.</p>

    <p class="TX">Her face was immaculate and perfectly proportioned—the kind that could only be attributed to divine favor.</p>

    <p class="TX">Her eyes were closed, so he had no way of deducing their color, but he could already readily imagine their hue.</p>

    <p class="TX">There was a very simple reason for that. He had grown accustomed to seeing this face on an almost daily basis.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 48. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_48" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Yes. In other words—</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hmm…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Just before his brain could reach a conclusion, the woman stirred slightly, then opened her eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">A pair of fantastical, iridescent irises—exactly as he had imagined—stared back at him at such close distance that his breath caught in his throat.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB"></div>

    <p class="TX">“Ah… Morning, Mushiki. Nice weather today, don’t you think?”</p>

    <div class="LI_SB"></div>

    <p class="TX">The woman—Saika Kuozaki—flashed him a faint smile.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Rendered mute with shock, Mushiki fell backward, sliding off the side of the bed.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Argh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">There was a dull thud, followed by a building pain in his back.</p>

    <p class="TX">By all indications, this was no dream. He looked up at the ceiling in alarm, watching the dust thrown up into the air glisten in the morning sunlight.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Are you okay, Mushiki?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika peered down at him from atop the bed, looking for all the world like an angel emerging from the heavens.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Saika<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? H-how<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki stammered in the face of this unreal sight, his voice ebbing from his throat seemingly of its own accord.</p>

    <p class="TX">But the question on the tip of his tongue was only natural.</p>

    <p class="TX">“How are you <i>here</i>?!” he cried out as he stared into those brilliant, resplendent eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">He was well aware just how silly the question was, but he could think of no other way to phrase it.</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika blinked several times, as if only just now realizing that she and Mushiki were both in the same room.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah… I see. How strange.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 49. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_49" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“S-so you don’t know what’s going on here, either<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’m quite at a loss… There seems to be a fog in my memories. My mind isn’t as clear as it should be,” she said, pressing a hand against her forehead.</p>

    <p class="TX">She didn’t seem to have a headache. Rather, the gesture was no doubt more to convey her sense of confusion.</p>

    <p class="TX">“A-are you all right?!” Mushiki asked, jumping up in alarm.</p>

    <p class="TX">He felt ashamed of himself. He had been so taken aback to find that he and Saika had somehow been separated that he hadn’t paused to consider how it might have affected her.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes, he and Saika were now disconnected; they both existed in the same place at the same time. This was the very outcome he had long dreamed of. Regardless of how this had come about, it was cause for celebration, not sorrow.</p>

    <p class="TX">But he would be able to rejoice only if the separation had been performed cleanly, without causing any other issues.</p>

    <p class="TX">“A-anyway, let’s make sure there’s nothing wrong with your body. How bad is your confusion?! Can you move your arms and legs?! You’re not in any pain, are you?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Having worked himself into a panic, Mushiki suddenly slammed his mouth shut.</p>

    <p class="TX">Not because he had noticed anything unusual about Saika or himself.</p>

    <p class="TX">No, there was a much simpler, more profound, more fundamental reason.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. Up until this point, he hadn’t fully noticed it.</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika was completely naked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“A-a-ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">His eyes went as wide as they could possibly go, and his trembling voice leaked weakly from his throat.</p>

    <p class="TX">Even he could tell that his cheeks had turned bright red. If anything, he felt like smoke must have been billowing out from the top of his head.</p>

    <p class="TX">A slim neck. Alluring collarbones. Delicate shoulders…</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 50. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_50" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>For good or ill, a bed sheet was draped over the rest of Saika’s body, so that was all Mushiki could make out clearly. But that sight by itself was stimulating enough. Saika’s contours, emerging gracefully beneath the single layer of fabric, sent his imagination into overdrive.</p>

    <p class="TX">And it didn’t end there.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm? Did I miss something funny?” Saika asked, puzzled by his reaction.</p>

    <p class="TX">She began to scrutinize herself, lifting her arms into the air to take a closer look, when—</p>

    <p class="TX">At that moment, the bed sheet barely obscuring her naked body dropped down, fully exposing her gorgeous pale skin.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">The second his brain processed this latest development, Mushiki spun around half on reflex, hitting his head with considerable force and passing out.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">“Ruriii!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Close to an hour after that early-morning commotion, Mushiki, having somehow managed to come back to his senses, found himself all but wailing at the top of his lungs while sprinting across the Garden grounds.</p>

    <p class="TX">He was on the main street, which stretched from the southern precinct where the dorms were located all the way to the central school building. It may have been somewhat early in the day, but there were still students scattered around campus, many of them watching on either in amusement or with misgivings as Mushiki raced in front of them.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki, however, paid no attention to the odd looks that everyone was giving him—or to be more accurate, he didn’t have the luxury of caring. All he could do was run desperately about, calling out at the top of his lungs.</p>
