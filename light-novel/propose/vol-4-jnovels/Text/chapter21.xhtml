    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 156. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_156" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>He went on and on for a full thirty seconds, as if repeating a secret code. Then, it was over.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I wonder what it means,” Kiriko murmured.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh-ho<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Clara scrolled down the screen to view the closed captions.</p>

    <p class="TX">There, she spotted an unlabeled URL. She clicked on it and was taken to a white screen featuring nothing more than a text box.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Got it. A password, huh? Looks like they wanna send a message only yours truly would get.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“You got all that? The code?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Well, like, it’s not super complicated or anything. It’s just set up so only the people who were there at the time would get it. Um, let me think<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Clara mumbled, before proceeding to enter the password.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh?! Is that okay, doing it here?” Kiriko exclaimed in panic. “Won’t they be able to track your location?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“All my phone stuff is routed through a bunch of overseas servers, so no one can see where any messages are coming from. Should be all good!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Wow. That’s amazing.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“To be totally honest, I don’t have the faintest clue how any of it works. I got one of those techie Immortals to do it for me. The communication speed is a bit slow, but with Silvie in the Garden and all, this is apparently the best we can do.”</p>

    <p class="TX">After she’d typed the message in full and hit the <small>SEND</small> button, a brief message appeared on the screen.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Clara’s eyebrows shot up. In short, the message stated that in exchange for certain information, the Garden was willing to restore Clara’s frozen MagiTube account.</p>

    <p class="TX">“They wanna make a deal with yours truly? They’ve got guts, huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? So they want me to spill the beans on where the Salix headquarters is. Is Mushipi in trouble with some stray mage? Maybe he’s only been <span aria-label=" Page 157. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_157" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>playing innocent, but he’s got a secret wild side? Hee-hee-hee! Seriously, this is gonna be too much fun!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…You don’t think it seems rather fishy?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm?” Clara answered nonchalantly as she dialed a number.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<i>Hellooo?</i> Dougie? It’s me, your good friend Clara… Wait, what? Who’s accusing me of being an impostor? I’m, like, the hottest chick in the whole mage world right now. It’s <i>me</i>, Clara Tokishima. Yeah. Remember when you asked me to join your crew? I wanna talk about that. So, like, what’s the deal? I mean, I might have gone a little overboard here. I don’t wanna join your squad, exactly, but if you could set up a chill hideout for me, I might, you know, be able to help out with some work. It’s all about give-and-take, right<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Uh-huh. Yup. Sure, let’s meet up. I’ll swing by. Where are you now?”</p>

    <p class="TX">After extracting the necessary information, Clara ended the call.</p>

    <p class="TX">“All righty. It’s in the bag. Get ready for another shoot, Kiritan,” she instructed.</p>

    <p class="TX">“C-Clara?” Kiriko stammered, stopping her. “Wh-who were you just talking to?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Dougie… You know, Salix’s boss? We’ve been in touch before, so I didn’t need to waste time sending anyone to track him down.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Y-you’re going to sell a friend out to the Garden?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Clara tilted her head to one side in confusion, prompting Kiriko to break out into a cold sweat.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Just because we’re both lost souls doesn’t automatically make us friends or anything. Anyway, being loose-lipped about where you’re at—that’s, like, super careless. It’s a sweet deal, getting my MagiTube account back up. And besides…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…B-besides<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mushipi’s more my type,” she exclaimed with excitement.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kiriko watched on in horror, her expression all but saying, <i>She’s out of her mind…</i></p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1"><span aria-label=" Page 158. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_158" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i>“Yippee! It’s Clara Channel Time! Are you having a</i> ca-razy <i>day, my Claramates?”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">In a car en route to the Garden, a bright and cheerful voice sounded from Kuroe’s smartphone.</p>

    <p class="TX">In the center of the screen was the video-streaming mage Clara Tokishima.</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“Totally unexpected emergency livestream, you guys. Seriously, my schedule suddenly opened up, so today, I’m gonna reply to some of the comments that’ve come in… Let’s see, what’s this one?</i> What are you playing at, annihilation factor? <i>Ha-ha, oh my God, shut up! I’m gonna make you regret saying that!”</i> Clara said with a laugh, giving the screen the middle finger. An instant later, her vulgar gesture was blurred out. Any editor would have a hard time keeping up with one of her live broadcasts.</p>

    <p class="TX">Incidentally, the stream wasn’t being hosted on Clara’s account. No doubt it belonged to one of her reincarnated servants. Of course, with this being a spur-of-the-moment livestream from an unknown account, the number of viewers started off quite low. But as word spread across social media, her view count quickly picked up.</p>

    <p class="TX">The actual contents, however, were of little importance. Disinterested in the video itself, Kuroe tapped on a URL listed in the description.</p>

    <p class="TX">A page with a text input window appeared on the screen.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm… There are no instructions. Perhaps she reused the same password<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Kuroe murmured, typing it into the box and hitting the <small>SUBMIT</small> button.</p>

    <p class="TX">A moment later, the website revealed an address.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Is that<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Mushiki asked from the seat beside her.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…The location of Salix’s hideout,” Kuroe answered calmly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! So this means…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…You’re tellin’ me that damn Ouroboros is lendin’ us a hand?” Anviet growled from the back seat, his expression one of true surprise. Like Mushiki, he was covered in injuries, his body bandaged up in several places.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 159. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_159" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“We’re hardly <i>cooperating</i>, as such,” Kuroe explained matter-of-factly. “This is an extraordinary transaction… Of course, we haven’t told Clara that Lady Saika is being held captive.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Right. Clara regarded Saika with extreme hostility. If she had known that their true goal was to rescue Saika, Mushiki doubted whether even the promise of reactivating her MagiTube account would have been enough to enlist her help.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Still, it’s kinda surprisin’ how easily she’s givin’ that info up. The Garden couldn’t get ahold of it.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“We know that she must have established her own intelligence network, as evidenced by her previous attacks and the incident involving the Leviathan. By enlisting her victims as her own servants, she can place eyes and ears practically anywhere. That is, of course, highly concerning. But she may well have connections that we don’t. As they say, it takes a thief to catch a thief.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah. So this is something only the Ouroboros could do?” Mushiki asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ow. That hurts, Kuroe,” Mushiki shrieked as she pinched his cheek.</p>

    <p class="TX">“However,” Kuroe continued with a disappointed sigh, “we cannot rule out the possibility that Clara Tokishima is in league with Salix. They are fellow stray mages, after all. Should that be the case, we may be walking into a trap.”</p>

    <p class="TX">She was right, of course. It would be pretty low to leak information on a like-minded acquaintance to a common enemy…though it would align with Clara’s past actions.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What do we do, then?” Mushiki asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“We will crush them with everything we have,” Kuroe answered without batting an eye.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">“No word from the Garden?”</p>

    <p class="TX">In the depths of the basement, Zhu Yin addressed a member of Salix in a suit.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 160. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_160" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“No… Nothing yet,” the man said, visibly distressed.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm…” Zhu Yin showed little interest in this response and rose gracefully to her feet.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then, with slow, deliberate steps, she approached the restrained Saika.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Are your comrades so heartless as to abandon you? Or do they believe you don’t <i>need</i> saving?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ms. Zhu Yin…I wouldn’t get too close to her if I were you<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” the Salix member cautioned in a trembling voice.</p>

    <p class="TX">Unfazed, Zhu Yin brought her face up to Saika’s.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Are you <i>really</i> the world’s strongest mage?” she demanded, staring intently into the girl’s eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika broke into a cold shiver but remained stoic and silent.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm… Something’s off. Willows was terrified of you, but I don’t sense much in the way of magical potential. Is it all just a bluff, a front? Or maybe there’s some hidden explanation<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? You’ve caught my interest. And I do love a good mystery.”</p>

    <p class="TX">A cold, lifeless eye peered out from beneath Zhu Yin’s long, dangling bangs and the bandages wrapped around her head.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Now, look into my eye. Tell me—what are you hiding?”</p>

    <p class="TX">The moment Zhu Yin twisted her lips into a sickly smile, her eye flashed with a mesmerizing shimmer.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">That ominous light seemed to penetrate everything—even Saika’s thoughts.</p>

    <p class="TX">She contorted in agony, overwhelmed by the sheer force of the glow.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Oh? I see…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Zhu Yin’s brow creased in a dubious frown.</p>

    <p class="TX">At that moment, a heavy thud came from upstairs as a deafening alarm began to ring.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Standing up straight, Zhu Yin turned back to the entrance.</p>

    <p class="TX">The man waiting by the door hurriedly picked up a communication <span aria-label=" Page 161. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_161" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>device. After exchanging a few brief words, his face took on a look of abject panic. “W-we’re under attack! It’s mages from the Garden<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">Within moments, a mixed-use building located at the southern tip of Tokyo had been turned into the site of a pitched battle.</p>

    <p class="TX">Flashes of light caused by the mages’ first and second substantiations, along with bullets fired from an assortment of handguns and heavier armaments, littered walls, shattered windows, and tore through floors and ceilings. A barrage of angry shouts and screams sounded amid the destruction.</p>

    <p class="TX">There were approximately thirty Salix personnel within the building, facing off against a four-member infiltration team from the Garden (of which only three were actually combatants).</p>

    <p class="TX">While the strike team had set up wards around the building to keep under the radar of any innocent bystanders, they still weren’t able to engage in large-scale combat right in the middle of a bustling city, which meant that they had to keep their numbers to a minimum.</p>

    <p class="TX">In terms of manpower, it was ten against one.</p>

    <p class="TX">The battle was completely one-sided—an effortless victory for the Garden.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that, of course, should have gone without saying.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Luminous Blade!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Vajdola!”</p>

    <p class="TX">After all, the team included two of the Garden’s strongest knights.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri twirled her <i>naginata</i> of roiling flame through the air, reducing the volley of bullets fired down the other end of the corridor to ash. At the same time, Anviet unleashed a hail of lightning, instantly incapacitating the enemy group.</p>

    <p class="TX">They were totally in sync, a perfect combo. Though the two individuals often found themselves at odds, they were nothing short of spectacular when they joined forces.</p>

    <p class="TX">“W-wait! If you’re here for Saika Kuozaki—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Shuddup.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 162. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_162" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Anviet cut off the last man standing midsentence before unleashing a final lightning strike.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Gyargh!”</p>

    <p class="TX">The man fell to the floor with a loud thud as he gave a final scream.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki, ostensibly a combatant himself, could only watch open-mouthed from the rear as the other two did all the work.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Wow…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ruri and Anviet are two of the Garden’s most capable mages. This outcome is to be expected,” explained Kuroe, the remaining member of their group. Her tone and disposition were the same as ever, but Mushiki sensed a hint of pride in her voice.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm. At least that’s one thing to breathe easy about. For a second, I thought you might have lost your edge, Anviet,” Ruri called from the front of the corridor.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hey. Don’t you start mouthin’ off at me,” he responded with a scowl.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<i>You’re</i> the one who insisted on playing the bad guy in a drill in the middle of a major crisis.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Gah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet let out a strained cough.</p>

    <p class="TX">Having reluctantly gone along with Kuroe’s story, he was now being treated as the imbecile who had gone off alone on a training exercise against the backdrop of an actual crisis.</p>

    <p class="TX">Unsurprisingly, Ruri didn’t fully buy this story, but she understood well enough that Anviet wasn’t about to admit to anything else. As such, she had been poking fun at him ever since she had rendezvoused with the group.</p>

    <p class="TX">“By the way, Anviet<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” she began.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What now?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Why were you so injured when you came back from the training grounds?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“And not just you. Mushiki was covered in bandages, too. What <span aria-label=" Page 163. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_163" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>happened? Did you two fight? Did you hurt each other? Hey. Are you listening to me?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri got closer and closer to Anviet, bombarding him with one question after another. From Mushiki’s perspective, her behavior was more than a little scary. Anviet must have been desperate for an answer, as sweat was beading on his forehead.</p>

    <p class="TX">“R-Ruri! Let’s focus on rescuing Saika for now!” Mushiki interceded in a fluster.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Right!” she answered, her ears giving a visible twitch. “What Mushiki said. Yes, you’re always so calm and levelheaded… Cute and invincible, too. Don’t you think, Anviet?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Heh.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What was that? You’d better not be thinking of making a move on him. You think I’d let that slide? Huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What do you want from me?” Anviet sighed in exasperation before giving his head a firm shake. “Anyway, where’s Kuozaki? Are we gonna have to search the place?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That would take too long. Let’s find whoever’s in charge and make them talk,” Ruri countered.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe stared down at her feet. “That would most likely be him,” she said, pointing to the skeleton-thin man Anviet had just knocked out.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s the head of Salix, Doug Willows.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet scratched his cheek awkwardly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Seriously, what are you even doing?” Ruri demanded with a withering glare.</p>

    <p class="TX">“They cross my path, I take ’em down.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Right.” Ruri nodded in approval, her attitude doing a complete one-eighty.</p>

    <p class="TX">Looking over a nearby floor plan, Kuroe spoke up. “Kidnappers tend to keep hostages in places where they won’t be overheard. Let’s try looking underground.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah, right. Underground, huh?” Ruri nodded.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 164. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_164" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The four of them hurried to the emergency staircase.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Whoa<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Fire! Shoot!”</p>

    <p class="TX">There were more Salix personnel in the basement, and they attacked Mushiki and the others on sight.</p>

    <p class="TX">But they were no match for Ruri and Anviet. The pair subdued the Salix underlings in a matter of seconds.</p>

    <p class="TX">No sooner had the team begun checking the basement floor than Ruri called out, “This room is the only one that’s locked. And it’s an electronic lock, too.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Lemme see,” Anviet said, placing a hand on the input panel.</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment, there was a burst of sparks and a loud bang as the door slid open.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Talk about crude. Why not try a smarter approach? Like cutting through the door maybe?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That sounds even cruder to me.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Arguing back and forth, the two of them entered the room. Mushiki and Kuroe followed just a few steps behind.</p>

    <p class="TX">Glancing around inside, Mushiki spotted Saika near the far wall, gagged and bound to a chair.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Saika!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Madam Witch!”</p>

    <p class="TX">They rushed forward as soon as they laid eyes on her.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika’s muffled voice rang out, as if she was trying to tell them something.</p>

    <p class="TX">Taken aback by the unprecedented situation, Mushiki and the others removed her gag, when—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Watch out! There’s a mage! She can manipulate your vision!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki’s eyes widened in shock.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Heh-heh… Hee-hee-hee…”</p>

    <p class="TX">A fey chuckle reached them from somewhere in the darkness—Zhu Yin.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 165. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_165" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“You must be the Garden’s knights. I see, yes… You’re terribly strong.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">The four of them braced themselves.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yet no matter where they looked, Zhu Yin was nowhere to be found. They could hear her voice, but it was impossible to tell where it was coming from since it was reverberating off the walls and ceiling.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh…I’m so scared. I’m so terrified, I might just burst into tears here,” she continued mockingly. “I suppose I’m going to have to get serious.”</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Fourth Substantiation: Baimugui Yexing.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Just as that unfamiliar phrase reverberated through the darkness—</p>

    <p class="TX">The basement around them warped and was replaced by an altogether different world.</p>

    <p class="TX">The walls, floor, and ceiling, all composed entirely of straight lines, gave way to a reddish-black fleshy mass, as if the room had been swapped out for the belly of a gargantuan beast.</p>

    <p class="TX">No. That wasn’t all. The fleshy walls were pulsating as eyeballs of every size imaginable came into being. It was a truly hellish sight, more than enough to make the faint of heart pass out on the spot.</p>

    <p class="TX">“A fourth substantiation<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“There’s no way some runaway mage could do all this<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">With a grim look, Ruri summoned a seal with her finger—the world crest above her head burning intensely as it unfolded further.</p>

    <p class="TX">Unless there was a significant power differential, only a fourth substantiation could counter another fourth substantiation. And since Anviet had exhausted himself in the previous battle and was in far from perfect shape, Ruri was the only one of them who could hope to resist this foe.</p>

    <p class="TX">But Zhu Yin must have anticipated as much, as the moment Ruri tried to manifest her fourth substantiation, the eyeballs in the wall spun to face her.</p>

    <p class="TX">A bolt of frigid ice ran down Mushiki’s spine.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 166. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_166" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Ruri!”</p>

    <p class="TX">There was no telling what kind of power Zhu Yin’s fourth substantiation possessed, but he knew in his bones that it wasn’t going to be anything good.</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Anviet! Touch me!” As if sensing the dread chill, Saika, still bound to the chair, let out a piercing cry. “And make a wish! To overcome this crisis! To defeat that mage!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hah?! What are you goin’ on about?!” he shot back.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that wasn’t unreasonable. Anyone would have been caught off guard by her last statement.</p>

    <p class="TX">And yet—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Just do it! Quickly, An!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Out of nowhere, Saika addressed him by a different name in an unrecognizable tone of voice.</p>

    <p class="TX">As instructed, Anviet placed a hand on her shoulder.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I have a wish! To see our enemy fall<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” he shouted in obvious bewilderment.</p>

    <p class="TX">A short moment later—</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Ah! Arrrggghhh?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Zhu Yin let out an ear-piercing shriek as cracks began to tear across the grotesque wall of flesh and eyeballs. The space collapsed with a dazzling burst of light.</p>

    <p class="TX">Chunks of muscle rained down all around, dissolving and disappearing into the air.</p>

    <p class="TX">Within seconds, they found themselves back in the dimly lit basement—only now a woman in a long trench coat lay helplessly on the ground before them.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">She was barely breathing and seemed to have been knocked out cold. On closer inspection, her eyelids had slumped unnaturally, and blood was dripping from her empty eye sockets.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What…just happened<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Mushiki gasped, turning to Saika.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 167. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_167" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>No doubt the others were all wondering the same thing. Ruri and Kuroe likewise stood there, watching her.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet’s astonishment, however, seemed to be the greatest of all—he was staring at Saika in abject shock, unable to believe his eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that was only natural.</p>

    <p class="TX">It wasn’t just a matter of voice or word choice; Saika’s most recent words had clearly been spoken by someone else.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Sara<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he murmured, incredulous.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Yes. It’s been a long time, An,” Saika answered with a touch of melancholy.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">A long silence reigned in the dimly lit basement.</p>

    <p class="TX">The four members of the infiltration team had been left speechless by Saika’s explanation of what had just taken place.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I suspected as much.”</p>

    <p class="TX">It was Kuroe who broke the eerie stillness.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Kuroe<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Mushiki began. “What do you mean?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I didn’t have any concrete proof, and I only recently became aware that this was even a possibility,” she began, narrowing her eyes. “When it appeared a hundred years ago, the Wheel of Fate, Fortuna, was destroyed long after the window for reversible annihilation had already expired. Consequently, its effects on the world were recorded in the annals of history. In other words, the wishes granted by it at the time were never undone… With more phenomena, unmistakably the work of the Fortuna, taking place throughout the world, I began to wonder—could it be that one or more of Sara’s wishes had yet to be fulfilled?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Oh-ho. I would expect no less from Madam Witch’s personal attendant.” Saika—or rather, Sara—smiled.</p>

    <p class="TX">She must have known, of course, that Kuroe was, in fact, the real Saika. Nevertheless, she was willing to keep that a secret, likely out of consideration for Kuroe’s situation.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What exactly did you wish for before you died<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Ruri asked with a puzzled look.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 168. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_168" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“I had two unfulfilled wishes at the time of my death,” Sara answered with a slow nod. “The first was to be blessed with a child. The second was that An and I could meet again in our next lives.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet’s breath caught in his throat.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Did those wishes…come true <i>after</i> Sara died<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">It was Kuroe who answered him. “In all likelihood, yes. It seems to have taken a good deal of time, but rather than vanishing after death, Sara’s soul appears to have been reincarnated here in this world… There is one problem, however.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“A problem<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes. Sara merged with the Fortuna before being reborn. Inevitably, that means that its powers returned along with her.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Anviet almost jumped back in alarm. “Hold on. I thought Surya was the one wieldin’ the Fortuna’s powers?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s right. In other words, <i>she</i> must be Sara’s reincarnation.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Wait a sec.” Anviet ran a hand through his hair in confusion. “This ain’t makin’ any sense. So why does Sara look like Kuozaki?”</p>

    <p class="TX">After a few moments of thoughtful silence, Sara continued, “…It happened a few days ago. Madam Witch noticed me and offered me her body… It would be inconvenient for both involved, she said, for two consciousnesses to inhabit the one body.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Anviet murmured.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…So that was it?” Mushiki asked in a small voice, turning to Kuroe.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…No. I believe Sara is being mindful of our circumstances and trying to cover for us. Perhaps after you and Lady Saika separated, her body was in want of a soul—and so it attracted Sara’s to inhabit it,” Kuroe answered in a whisper.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Ah…” Mushiki nodded. “…No wonder she doesn’t walk like Saika…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes. Which is why—”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe stopped herself in midsentence.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Don’t tell me you knew she wasn’t the real Lady Saika?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 169. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_169" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Huh? No way. I had no idea at all she was Mr. Anviet’s wife. I was just so surprised, you know? I kind of panicked…” He paused to catch his breath. “But being around her as long we were, I couldn’t help but notice that her mannerisms were all subtly off.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh? Why are you hitting me, Kuroe? Ow. That hurts.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“If you knew, you should have said something sooner.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“S-sorry… I thought it might be rude to point it out…”</p>

    <p class="TX">As Mushiki and Kuroe fidgeted and whispered between themselves, Anviet flashed them a fierce glare.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What are you two yappin’ about?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Nothing.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“It isn’t important…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Giving his head a vigorous scratch, Anviet turned away from them both, back to Sara.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Two minds in one body? No, hold on a sec. What’s the story with Surya, then?”</p>

    <p class="TX">But at that moment—</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Papa!”</p>

    <p class="TX">As if she’d been waiting for someone to mention her name, a small figure leaped from the entrance of the room to cling to Anviet’s leg.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…S-Surya?! I told you to hang tight till I gave you the all clear!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…But you wanted Sue to come, didn’t you, Papa<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” she said, staring at him with upturned eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet heaved a sigh of resignation.</p>

    <p class="TX">After watching this exchange, Sara called out to her, “Surya.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Surya’s shoulders shook in response to her voice.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Is it okay now<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” she asked. “Mama?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Yes. I’m sorry. I was discovered,” Sara said, sticking out her tongue.</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment, Surya trembled with an outpouring of emotion as she caught Sara in a hug.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mama<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Mama<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 170. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_170" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…I’m so sorry, Surya. I haven’t even been able to hold you in my arms all this time,” Sara whispered, embracing her.</p>

    <p class="TX">A long moment later, Sara turned her gaze back to Anviet.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Allow me to introduce her to you again. This is Surya—our daughter.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet’s eyes rounded in astonishment. But that was no surprise. After all, this girl claiming to be his daughter, whom he had zero recollection of, had turned out to be the real deal.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Our daughter<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? H-how?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“It seems that when I died, a new life had already been conceived inside me.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet froze in shock.</p>

    <p class="TX">“The Fortuna faithfully granted my final wishes,” Sara continued quietly. “When I was reborn in this world, the child inside me was given new life, too… You see, there were two souls within the reincarnated body—hers and mine.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Ah. That must have resulted in a state akin to dissociative identity disorder, no?” Kuroe asked. “Then, your consciousness was transferred to the empty vessel of Lady Saika’s body, while Surya’s continued to inhabit the original one?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara responded with a solemn nod. “…To tell you the truth, after being reincarnated, the first thing I wanted to do was find An. But the power of the Fortuna prevented me from doing so… When I finally grew strong enough to venture out a few years later, a stray mage noticed my powers and took me from my foster home.” Her face clouded over.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki was almost taken aback by her strange expression, but after giving it further thought, it made perfect sense. Even if Sara was reincarnated, her body must still have biological parents… And from what he gathered, her home environment must have been far from ideal.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Well, the silver lining is that they never caught on to the Fortuna’s <span aria-label=" Page 171. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_171" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>true potential,” Sara continued. “Simply having the Wheel of Fate nearby is enough to bring incredible fortune. Willows was so afraid of losing his <i>lucky charm</i> that he wouldn’t let anyone near me.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe’s face twitched slightly. “Voicing a wish while in direct contact with you… That’s the necessary condition for it to come true, isn’t it?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Yes. Originally, the Fortuna was a small trinket, an accessory.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki’s eyes widened in realization.</p>

    <p class="TX">An event came to mind that matched those conditions perfectly.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes, the evening a few days ago. While carrying Surya on his back, Mushiki had wished aloud to separate his body from Saika’s and meet her again in the flesh.</p>

    <p class="TX">If the Fortuna had registered that as a wish, then that meant <i>he</i> was ultimately responsible for their separation.</p>

    <p class="TX">And that wasn’t all. Looking back, Mushiki realized that Hildegarde had been touching Saika’s shoulder when she remarked how nice it would be if the girls’ uniform at the Garden was modeled on a maid outfit.</p>

    <p class="TX">By then, Sara’s soul was already residing in Saika’s body. Assuming that the Fortuna had been transferred at the same time, it came as no surprise that Hilde’s wish had come true.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki paused, noticing that Ruri had broken into a nervous sweat.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ruri?” he asked. “Are you okay?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I-it’s nothing. Were you thinking about me? You’re so sweet, dearest brother. I love—”</p>

    <p class="TX">With a sudden jolt, she slammed her mouth shut.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki tilted his head to one side in bewilderment when Anviet cried out in a voice that could have been angry or sad: “…But still! Why—why didn’t you say nothin’?! That you were Sara!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I’m sorry, An.” Sara lowered her eyes. “I’m a sinner, and a grave one at that. I might not have fully known what I was doing, but I still used the annihilation factor’s power to satisfy my own selfish desires, <span aria-label=" Page 172. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_172" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>immensely damaging the world in the process… I felt like I didn’t have the right to face you.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“No…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“And also<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” she continued, stroking Surya’s head, “I wanted you to meet our precious daughter first.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet glanced down at Surya, then fell to his knees and bowed his head.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Sorry. All that stuff I said about you not bein’ my daughter…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Surya, however, gave her head a firm shake. “It’s okay, Papa. Sue understands.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mama told me so much about you… She said you can be a bit rough, but you’re also the kindest person in the whole wide world.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Surya<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Anviet murmured.</p>

    <p class="TX">She opened her eyes slightly as if noticing something. “Huh? Do you<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Do you<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Wh-what<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Do you wanna give Sue a huge hug, Papa?” she asked, staring up into his eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet looked back in shock for a brief moment, then—</p>

    <p class="TX">“…You know me too well, huh?” he said with a soft chuckle, wrapping his arms around her in a tight embrace.</p>

    <p class="TX">Watching on from the sidelines, Mushiki and Ruri exchanged measured glances.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Mushiki?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Yeah.” He nodded, already knowing what she wanted to say.</p>

    <p class="TX">They had rescued Saika—or rather, Sara—and reunited Anviet with his daughter and late wife. By all means, this was a joyous occasion.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yet despite all that, the damage inflicted by the Fortuna remained unresolved.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Ah<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Mushiki said, coming to a realization.</p>

    <p class="TX">There was a third reason Sara hadn’t revealed herself to Anviet.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Kuroe. About Sara…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 173. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_173" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe stared down at her feet, not answering Mushiki.</p>

    <p class="TX">She must have realized it, too.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…An,” Sara began. “Thank you… I’m glad we were able to meet again, one last time.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” He stopped himself there, no doubt grasping what she meant.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sara, you can’t…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…The window for reversible annihilation from the first wish hasn’t run out yet. If we destroy the Wheel of Fate now, it will be like those disappearances all over the world never happened.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Destroying annihilation factors to save the world—such was the inevitable mission of any mage.</p>

    <p class="TX">But at the same time, that meant that Sara, who’d merged with the Fortuna, would have to disappear as well.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. That was the third reason why Sara hadn’t revealed herself until the last minute, despite longing to be reunited with her husband.</p>

    <p class="TX">Simply put, she didn’t want to force Anviet to endure the pain of losing her all over again. That was how Mushiki saw it, at least.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…No… You’re kiddin’, right<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Anviet murmured, before he froze.</p>

    <p class="TX">The reason was simple. Someone had grabbed Sara by the leg.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What—”</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara’s eyes widened in shock, while Anviet’s voice caught in his throat.</p>

    <p class="TX">A second later, Mushiki and the others caught on to what had happened, too.</p>

    <p class="TX">Zhu Yin, who should have been lying unconscious on the floor, had latched on to Sara’s leg.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then, staring up at them with empty eye sockets, she let out a hoarse cry: “I have a wish, Fortuna! This world should be mine<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Gah… Ugh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 174. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_174" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>All at once, an unfathomable physical force assailed Mushiki, sending him to his knees.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mushiki?! Are you okay?!” Ruri cried, gaping in panic.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki, however, couldn’t so much as utter a word of thanks.</p>

    <p class="TX">The reason was simple. Just as Zhu Yin’s body started emitting a faint glow—</p>

    <p class="TX">The basement was gripped by a massive earthquake, like the world itself was falling apart.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">“Ahhh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Arrrggghhh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Amid those powerful tremors, Zhu Yin slowly rose to her feet.</p>

    <p class="TX">No. To be more precise, her body seemed to be defying gravity, floating up into the air.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Whaaat?! This, this power<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! It’s incredible<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Limitless might<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">In an ecstatic trance, Zhu Yin turned her head to the heavens. At the same time, magical energy gathered in her sunken eye sockets to form radiant eyes of pure light—magic-based substantiations, no doubt.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! What just happened?!” Anviet cried in alarm.</p>

    <p class="TX">“That much magic<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!” Ruri shouted in dismay.</p>

    <p class="TX">Their responses were only natural. Zhu Yin, whom they had all thought to be incapacitated, was now floating in midair, enveloped in an impossibly dense shroud of raw energy.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Th-that’s…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Struck with impossible weariness, Mushiki somehow managed to find his voice.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe immediately knelt down beside him, lowering her head so he could whisper in her ear. “What is it, Mushiki?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I—I don’t know… It’s like a huge part of me was just torn out of my body…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe’s expression turned sullen. “…Given this phenomenon, and Zhu Yin’s present state…she may have been speaking figuratively when she made that wish of hers…but I suspect she has usurped the throne of the World King.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 175. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_175" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!” Mushiki’s eyes all but popped from their sockets.</p>

    <p class="TX">World King—the title mentioned by the other Saika, the one from the future.</p>

    <p class="TX">According to her, this world was merely a manifestation that Saika had modeled on the <i>real</i> world—a fifth substantiation.</p>

    <p class="TX">The mage responsible for maintaining that substantiation took on the mantle of the World King. Indeed, the other Saika had come back from the future to wrest it from her past self.</p>

    <p class="TX">Even now, the ensuing battle was etched in Mushiki’s memory.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Gah<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Ugh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki let out a pained moan as a searing agony welled up from deep within his chest.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that was only natural.</p>

    <p class="TX">The seat of the World King, which Saika had risked her life to protect, and which the future Saika had sought so desperately to acquire, had been wrested from his grasp with a single command from an unknown mage.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Calm yourself, Mushiki.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“How can I…stay calm here<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">He struggled to suppress the debilitating vertigo that had taken hold of him, pulling himself upright.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then, fixing Sara in his sights, he muttered, “Right… If the Fortuna can take the world away, it should also be able to put it back…”</p>

    <p class="TX">And yet—</p>

    <p class="TX">“I don’t think so!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Zhu Yin held up a hand to stop him.</p>

    <p class="TX">With that—</p>

    <p class="TX">He was launched backward like a feather in the wind, his vision turning stark white.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Gah<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">After a few brief moments of weightlessness, he slammed hard into the ground.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yet in spite of the excruciating pain racking his entire being, a peculiar sense of unease crossed his mind.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. They were all supposed to be in an underground basement, and <span aria-label=" Page 176. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_176" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>while the room was relatively large, it still had its limits. Could he really have been thrown back so far?</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">He opened his eyes wide, his breath catching in his throat.</p>

    <p class="TX">The space around him was now unrecognizable.</p>

    <p class="TX">In the span of a few seconds, the sky had spread out overhead, the room had been replaced with a vast expanse, and all potential obstacles had been cleared away.</p>

    <p class="TX">A fourth substantiation? No. He could see what looked like a townscape in the distance.</p>

    <p class="TX">The view was a chaotic mess, as if someone had crushed a garden of clay sculptures and reshaped them according to their every whim.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh dear, did I go a little overboard<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Do forgive me. I don’t yet know my own strength.” Zhu Yin laughed, waltzing through the air with her lips contorted in a sinister smile.</p>

    <p class="TX">A split second later—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Rays of the Rising Sun!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Vasaras!”</p>

    <p class="TX">A pair of shadows lunged for Zhu Yin’s blind spot, lashing out with weapons and unleashing electric blasts. It was Ruri and Anviet, both clad in their third substantiations.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Yet Zhu Yin effortlessly parried their attacks, without so much as moving a muscle.</p>

    <p class="TX">No. <i>Parried</i> wasn’t entirely accurate.</p>

    <p class="TX">Their attacks didn’t even reach her; the radiant glow enveloping her body had blocked them.</p>

    <p class="TX">“You startled me. To think that you still have such energy! I should have expected no less from Knights of the Garden!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Zhu Yin’s voice echoed around them, her dazzling glow intensifying and flinging both of them back.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Gah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh… What the<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Thrown to the ground, Ruri and Anviet fixed Zhu Yin in a pair of <span aria-label=" Page 177. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_177" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>baleful glares before resuming their assault. Yet none of those strikes succeeded in reaching her, either.</p>

    <p class="TX">There seemed to be no point whatsoever to attacking—the power differential was simply too overwhelming.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that was precisely so. After all, they were effectively fighting against the world itself.</p>

    <p class="TX">There was no other option—they had to find some way to retrieve the mantle of the World King.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yet Zhu Yin’s earlier attack had scattered Mushiki, Kuroe, Sara, and Surya all over the battlefield, leaving each of them lying injured on the ground where they had fallen.</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara couldn’t use the Fortuna to make her own wishes come true, so someone else had to reach her to undo what Zhu Yin had done. But at this distance…</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Sara!” Kuroe shouted from behind.</p>

    <p class="TX">She, too, was badly wounded, barely able to stand up. But that didn’t stop her from calling out at the top of her lungs.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Can you return your consciousness to Surya’s body?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara spun around, her surprise at this request writ large.</p>

    <p class="TX">“If you can, do it now!” Kuroe cried.</p>

    <p class="TX">“A-all right<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara closed her eyes and focused, before she collapsed to the ground like she had passed out. Saika’s body, now devoid of a soul, lay utterly defenseless.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">At the exact same moment, Kuroe toppled forward.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Kuroe?! Are you all right?! Kuroe<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!” Mushiki called out to her.</p>

    <p class="TX">But as much as he wanted to run over to her, his body refused to listen. It wasn’t just a matter of damage or injury—from the moment Zhu Yin usurped the authority of the World King, a strange sensation had taken hold of him, rendering all movement impossible.</p>

    <p class="TX">Dread filled his lungs. Abject fear. If Mushiki didn’t act now, Kuroe and Saika would be in jeopardy.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 178. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_178" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>That was when he heard it—</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX">“Don’t worry, Mushiki.”</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX">A voice echoed in his panic-stricken mind.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I-is that<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he murmured in a daze.</p>

    <p class="TX">But his surprise was entirely reasonable.</p>

    <p class="TX">After all, that voice belonged to the woman he longed for most, who he continued to desire.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Don’t worry about Kuroe. She probably just overexerted herself. Let her rest for a while.”</p>

    <p class="TX">A figure slowly rose from the cloud of dust, swaying gently.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki felt tears welling up from deep inside.</p>

    <p class="TX">It made no sense, yet it made perfect sense in his heart.</p>

    <p class="TX">She. It was she—the <i>true</i> Saika Kuozaki, body and soul as one.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Saika<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he called out, overwhelmed by emotion.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri and Anviet, still fighting, had also clearly noticed her, as had Zhu Yin, who stretched out her hand once more.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I said I won’t let <i>yooouuu</i>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">In an effort to stop Saika from using the Fortuna, Zhu Yin warped the space between her and Surya, as if she were crushing it in her fist.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Saika!” Mushiki shrieked in despair.</p>

    <p class="TX">But at that moment—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm? Did you call me?” came the most matter-of-fact voice.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Both Mushiki and Zhu Yin watched on, agape. Meanwhile, Saika broke into an amused laugh.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Why are you acting so surprised? There may not be a lot of magic left in my body, but that won’t stop me from drawing on external energy. And as powerful as substantiation techniques are, it’s never a good idea to limit your available strategies.”</p>

    <p class="TX">She paused for a moment, glaring at Zhu Yin.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 179. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_179" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“As for you… Your actions don’t even qualify as a substantiation technique. You have immense power, but you wield it blindly. Such a waste of potential… My world wasn’t made to be abused by the likes of you.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…So you say. But how are you going to measure up to me now?” Zhu Yin’s gaze sharpened as she readied herself to launch another attack.</p>

    <p class="TX">But just before she could do so, Ruri and Anviet lunged toward her from either side.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hah!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Augh!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Tch… Get out of my way!” she spat, unleashing beams of raw magic at them both.</p>

    <p class="TX">But Ruri and Anviet were Knights of the Garden. They weren’t about to fall for the same trick twice; they both spun around and dodged the strikes.</p>

    <p class="TX">In that moment, Zhu Yin left herself open.</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika dropped to her knees by Mushiki’s side.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hey, Mushiki… It’s been a while since we were last like this, huh?” she joked.</p>

    <p class="TX">It should have gone without saying, but she was Saika Kuozaki in every possible way—her expression, her voice, her every movement.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Saika…I—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Stop. Don’t try apologizing. You did great. Above and beyond my wildest expectations… And you were pretty cool in that fight against Anviet. Just don’t shout <i>that</i> kind of thing too loudly, okay?” she said with a small chuckle. “I’ll take it from here. Every now and then, it falls on the headmistress to step up.”</p>

    <p class="TX">With those words, she leaned in and brought her lips against his own.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Close your eyes… It’s time for me to give it all back—the magical energy that resided in you.”</p>
