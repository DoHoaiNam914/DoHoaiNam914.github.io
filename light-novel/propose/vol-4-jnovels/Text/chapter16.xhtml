    <p class="TX">For a moment, Mushiki almost allowed the magnificence of this scene to distract him.</p>

    <p class="TX">But being a fourth substantiation, it was much more than just a beautiful view. There was nothing more precarious than getting trapped in an opponent’s fourth substantiation—it was like being caught in the belly of a whale.</p>

    <p class="TX">If he was to break out, his only choice was to employ his own fourth substantiation. And so Mushiki reached out, grasping for Saika’s powers now dormant in his body.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Argh… Gah<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">But then he was struck by a sudden bout of agony and came to a standstill.</p>

    <p class="TX">No. More precisely, his body refused to move, no matter how he tried to command it.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…It’s pointless,” called Anviet, appearing before Mushiki. “Livin’ things ain’t goin’ nowhere without electricity. Your muscles only work ’cause of weak electric signals… Your body dances to the tune of ’em.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet pointed at him. “My Aksara Nirsvarna is a paradise of thunder and lightnin’. So anyone who gets sucked into this space falls right under my spell… You catch my drift? The moment this fourth substantiation kicks in, the game’s already won.”</p>

    <p class="TX">With a slightly pained looked, he turned his back on Mushiki.</p>

    <p class="TX">An instant later, an intense barrage of lightning was released from the countless vajras orbiting through the sky, exploding right into their immobilized target.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">“Tch…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet clicked his tongue as a tremendous explosion sounded behind him, accompanied by a blinding flash and a pungent burning stench.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 131. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_131" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>His fourth substantiation, Aksara Nirsvarna, was a cage of lightning from which no living being could hope to escape.</p>

    <p class="TX">He had never intended to go this far. After all, his opponent was a pupil at the Garden—a new transfer student and a rookie mage, at that. Sure, he’d somehow found a way to replicate Saika’s substantiation techniques, but there was no way he could withstand an electric barrage of such magnitude.</p>

    <p class="TX">But Mushiki must have known all that. His eyes had burned with unmistakable determination and resolve. And that was precisely why Anviet had known he couldn’t break this foe with half-hearted attacks. He owed it to Mushiki to meet him on the field of battle as an equal.</p>

    <p class="TX">When two individuals opposed each other so directly, neither of them willing to yield, conflict was guaranteed. And since Anviet had no intention of retreating, this outcome was inevitable.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that still didn’t mean it sat well with him…</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment, he narrowed his eyes in a faint twitch.</p>

    <p class="TX">The surrounding area was, so to speak, an extension of Anviet himself. Weak electric currents pervaded the space, and like a sixth sensory organ, they relayed in detail everything that took place within the bounds of his substantiation.</p>

    <p class="TX">Which was how he knew that Mushiki Kuga was still standing.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Auuuggghhh!” came an ear-rending scream from behind his back.</p>

    <p class="TX">Spinning around, Anviet laid eyes on Mushiki, who <i>should</i> have been utterly crushed by his last attack.</p>

    <p class="TX">He was no longer clad in Saika’s third substantiation, and her staff was likewise gone.</p>

    <p class="TX">Instead, he was clutching a sword whose blade was translucent, like a sheet of crystal glass.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes, he was taken aback by this unexpected development. But even more unbelievable was the fact that Mushiki was moving by his own volition inside Anviet’s fourth substantiation.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 132. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_132" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Did this mean Mushiki had made better use of Saika’s third substantiation than Anviet had expected? Or, Anviet asked himself, could it be that he had inadvertently gone easy on his young foe?</p>

    <p class="TX">In any case, Mushiki remained undefeated. Resolve still burned brightly in his eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">Their duel was far from over. Refocusing his attention, Anviet adopted a fresh battle stance.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Vajdola!”</p>

    <p class="TX">His vajras unleashed a fresh lightning strike.</p>

    <p class="TX">“—!”</p>

    <p class="TX">However, Mushiki banished them with only a single swing of his blade.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet gasped in shock.</p>

    <p class="TX">Taking full advantage of that lapse in concentration, Mushiki closed in.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hollow Edge<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ngh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet’s instincts sounded the alarm—he needed to avoid coming into direct contact with that blade at all costs.</p>

    <p class="TX">He tried to gauge the weapon’s abilities, tracing it with his eyes for a long moment as it danced through the air.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">By the time he realized what it was, Mushiki was already within range.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Now<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki started to slam his blade against Anviet’s chest.</p>

    <p class="TX">But it never connected.</p>

    <p class="TX">To distract Anviet, Mushiki tossed the sword to the side, where it fluttered through the air until it disappeared in a sea of clouds.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What was that about?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…That’s how I’m—how Saika—is going to win,” Mushiki said with the faintest of smiles as he launched into his follow-up attack.</p>

    <p class="TX">Not that Anviet was going to give him a chance. Transforming <span aria-label=" Page 133. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_133" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>himself into a supercharged thunderbolt to fall back in the blink of an eye, he caught the now-defenseless Mushiki in his sights.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Deva Sarya…”</p>

    <p class="TX">With those words, he unleashed an unbounded barrage of golden electricity, more than enough to lay his target low.</p>

    <p class="TX">And yet—</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">For a moment, Anviet failed to understand what had happened.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. By all rights, it ought to have been impossible.</p>

    <p class="TX">…His lightning bombardment fell not on Mushiki, but on himself.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">“…Hah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">The world around Mushiki was wiped away in an explosive burst of electricity, delivering him back to the Mishiroyama Training Ground.</p>

    <p class="TX">Landing on solid earth, he faltered for a moment before falling to his knees.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mushiki<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Kuroe called out, rushing toward him.</p>

    <p class="TX">He tried raising a hand to show that he was still conscious, but his body refused to obey. In the end, he needed Kuroe’s help to climb back to his feet.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I’m…I’m okay… More importantly<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he rasped, looking up ahead.</p>

    <p class="TX">In front of them was Anviet, who’d taken a direct hit from his own attack.</p>

    <p class="TX">His body was scorched black, and his face was downturned—but unlike Mushiki, he was still on his feet. Mushiki gasped at the imposing sight.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mushiki<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Kuroe murmured.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Yes,” he confirmed with a brief nod.</p>

    <p class="TX">Back when Anviet’s fourth substantiation had immobilized him, Mushiki had managed to activate his Hollow Edge by the slimmest margin.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 134. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_134" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>He had hoped that the sword, with its power to dispel other substantiations, would be enough to neutralize the electric currents holding him in place.</p>

    <p class="TX">It was no more than coincidence that the Hollow Edge had brushed his arm the moment it materialized. Perhaps the possibility-multiplying qualities of Saika’s Animaclad were responsible for that.</p>

    <p class="TX">And so, having regained his freedom of movement, Mushiki narrowly escaped the impending threat.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that was all. His odds had simply gone from minus back to zero. His substantiation-nullifying Hollow Edge had canceled out not only Anviet’s electric current but Saika’s Stellarium and Animaclad, too. In a very real sense, he was worse off than before.</p>

    <p class="TX">The only way he could possibly reverse the situation was to resort to a fourth substantiation.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…You used Saika’s fourth substantiation?” Kuroe asked in a muted voice.</p>

    <p class="TX">No doubt she had already guessed as much.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes… But I wasn’t able to manifest it fully in my body,” he answered, holding up his palm. “All I managed to pull off was the tiniest point, like the end of a needle.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. It was a miniscule substantiation, a far cry from a fourth substantiation capable of transforming the world around oneself.</p>

    <p class="TX">But it <i>was</i> Saika Kuozaki’s fourth substantiation, her ultimate pride and joy.</p>

    <p class="TX">Deploying the Hollow Edge as a decoy, Mushiki took advantage of the almost imperceptible change in the area to counter Anviet.</p>

    <p class="TX">The power of Saika’s fourth substantiation—Void’s Garden—lay in its ability to observe and choose from myriad possibilities.</p>

    <p class="TX">No mage with Anviet’s level of skill would ever miscalculate while wielding his own magic.</p>

    <p class="TX">But if there was any chance, even one in a billion, a trillion—a quintillion, if necessary…</p>

    <p class="TX">So long as there was even the slightest possibility, Saika’s fourth substantiation would bring it forth.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 135. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_135" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…It’s just like you told me,” Mushiki said.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Rock-paper-scissors. You need a wide range of moves if you want to win.”</p>

    <p class="TX">He flashed her a weak grin.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe’s eyes widened slightly, the corners of her lips curling in a rare smile.</p>

    <p class="TX">At that moment—</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Sa…ra<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” came a low, raspy voice.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet, hunched forward with his head bowed like a guardian Nio statue, was shaking all over.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">“…An…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hey. An.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hmm? Yeah, I hear you,” Anviet Svarner answered, rubbing his sleepy eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">He was in a familiar palatial room, decorated with fine furnishings and a lush carpet.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Really? Seemed to me you were sound asleep,” answered the young woman as she gave his shoulder a playful shake.</p>

    <p class="TX">She had well-defined features and the most beautiful black hair. Her skin was the same shade of brown as Anviet’s, and she was wearing an exquisite traditional outfit, plus accessories.</p>

    <p class="TX">She was Sara Svarner—Anviet’s wife of less than a year.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’m up, seriously… And quit callin’ me <i>An</i>.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh? But it’s so cute.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s why.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara stared at him with an amused look, prompting Anviet’s lips to twitch in annoyance.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I ain’t a kid no more. You can’t keep callin’ me that forever.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet had reached the age of maturity according to his nation’s customs the previous year, wedding his wife and becoming an adult in <span aria-label=" Page 136. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_136" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>both name and reality. But Sara, who was two years his senior, continued to call him by her pet name for him…</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh…I see. I’m sorry. I didn’t realize it bothered you so much.” Sara slumped.</p>

    <p class="TX">Guilt stabbed Anviet’s heart as he watched her despondent reaction.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I…er…I don’t <i>dislike</i> it, you know? But if anyone overheard you sayin’ it…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Then I can keep using it when it’s just the two of us?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Er… Ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“So you <i>do</i> dislike it… I’m sorry I didn’t realize sooner… What a sad excuse for a wife I am…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…A-all right. Only when it’s just us, though,” he gave in.</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara immediately perked up. “Yay! I love you, An.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah… Y-you tricked me<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“No I didn’t. I was saved by your kindness, that’s all,” she answered with a beaming smile.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet heaved a deep sigh.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hey<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Sara began, a twinkle in her eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">Across the room, a large pile of books and notepads were scattered across the desk.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Were you studying?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Ugh…”</p>

    <p class="TX">He averted his gaze so she wouldn’t see the color rising to his cheeks. He had been hoping to keep it all under wraps.</p>

    <p class="TX">Though Anviet was a prince, he was merely the third son in a collateral branch of the royal family, so his chances of succeeding to the throne were slim to none. As such, while he had received a proper education and been trained in etiquette from a young age, he had grown up in a relatively lenient environment compared to most other young royals.</p>

    <p class="TX">Since he’d married Sara last year, however, every other prince higher than him in the royal pecking order had left the country, fleeing in disgrace on account of one ugly scandal or another. Before he knew it, he had been named heir to the throne.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 137. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_137" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Though Anviet himself had mixed feelings about his new status, his subjects seemed all but convinced that his wife, the future Queen Sara, was a physical embodiment of the goddess of fortune.</p>

    <p class="TX">Even if that <i>were</i> true, he couldn’t afford to rest on his laurels. There was a great deal indeed that he had to learn if he was to rule in his own right one day.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…It ain’t no big deal. But if I were one of the common folk, I wouldn’t want some clueless dolt who doesn’t know jack about politics callin’ the shots.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“An…” Moved by his words, Sara held her hands to her chest. “Ah, how devoted you are. My dear An… Do you mind if I pet you?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Cut it out,” Anviet responded bashfully before breaking into a frown. “Hmm?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Several rings adorned Sara’s fingers, but one of them with a unique design stood out.</p>

    <p class="TX">“That ring…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“No. I just thought it looked a little strange.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah, this one<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? It’s like a good luck charm,” Sara murmured after a moment’s hesitation, folding her hands to hide the item in question.</p>

    <p class="TX">Concerned by her reaction, Anviet looked up with a troubled frown.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Did someone give it to you?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara’s eyes widened in surprise, but she soon flashed him a smug grin.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Do you want to know? Maybe you’re wondering if another man offered it to me?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sh-shuddup! I wasn’t thinkin’ that!” he shouted, his facing turning bright red as he turned his back to her with a pout.</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara let out a soft giggle, embracing him from behind.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Don’t worry. You’re the only one for me, An. Now and forever.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Yeah.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Unsure how best to answer her and feeling his cheeks reddening even further, he simply nodded in response.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 138. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_138" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“But yes, you’re right,” Sara continued, tightening her embrace. “I suppose I ought to push myself to be the best I can as future queen.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Push yourself<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes. For the time being, you need an heir.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Bah<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” he spurted at this unexpected development. “Wh-where did <i>that</i> come from?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh? But isn’t that a queen’s most important role?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Maybe, but still<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara paid his protests no heed and ran her fingers over his skin. “I know it’s not our first time, but it <i>always</i> feels new. Are you teasing me? You know my weaknesses, don’t you? You sneaky little thing…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What are you— H-hey!”</p>

    <p class="TX">At that moment, there came a knock at the door as an attendant let himself in.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Excuse me, Your Highness,” he began, coming to an abrupt stop. “I-I’m so sorry! P-please, don’t let me disturb you<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Arrrggghhh! Hold it! Don’t go scramblin’ outta here with that sorta misunderstandin’!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet hurriedly shook Sara off while calling after the attendant.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What is it?! What’s so urgent?!” he pressed.</p>

    <p class="TX">The attendant offered Sara a polite bow before continuing. “A request for an audience. I know it’s on short notice, but the minister is eager for you to meet this guest.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“An audience? Now? <i>Who?</i>”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’m afraid I don’t know exactly. It seems they’re a practitioner of sorcery, from somewhere in the Far East.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sorcery<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Suspicion colored Anviet’s face. This individual had to be an important envoy indeed to have been granted an abrupt audience, but that description set off alarm bells.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Okay, fine. Let’s go, Sara.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Understood.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Though on edge, Anviet left the room. Sara followed a half step behind him.</p>
