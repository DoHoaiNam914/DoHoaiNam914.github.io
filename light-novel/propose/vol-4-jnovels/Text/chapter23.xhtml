    <p class="TX">An indescribably soft sensation pressed up against Mushiki’s <span aria-label=" Page 182. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_182" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>lips—just as it had when he’d first met Saika on the verge of death three months ago.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">“Auuuggghhh<i>…</i>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Kyaa—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Gwah<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">With a loud shriek, Zhu Yin waved her hands desperately in front of her.</p>

    <p class="TX">The two Knights of the Garden, darting around at high speed, finally fell silent.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ha-ha… Ha-ha-ha<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Have you come to your senses? With this…I have power over all…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Her face was awash with bliss, yet her voice suddenly trailed off.</p>

    <p class="TX">Zhu Yin felt amazing. She didn’t know how or why, but her body was filled with a rush of power, near unlimited might. If there was such a thing as a god, this must have been what it felt like to be one. Omnipotence emanated from every fiber of her being. She felt like her very soul would melt into the fabric of reality if she lost concentration for even a moment.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh? You seem to be enjoying yourself,” came a voice to dampen her spirits. “Shall we have this dance, Zhu Yin?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Zhu Yin shifted her body slightly. Floating in the air like her mirror image was Saika Kuozaki.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah, yes… I’m supposed to take you down… Aha-ha-ha… But why? Oh well. There you are, so I might as well…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Your memories have begun to grow muddy. That isn’t surprising. You usurped the world’s stock of magic, using it as a weapon in battle rather than keeping it under control.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What now<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Are you <i>mocking</i> me<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“As if. I appreciate this feat of yours more than you can possibly imagine. You’re a genius… I expected you to keel over within ten minutes.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 183. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_183" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“What was that<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Zhu Yin demanded.</p>

    <p class="TX">At that moment, a warm sensation ran down her cheek.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">For a second, she thought she was crying—but that wasn’t it.</p>

    <p class="TX">She wiped the trickling feeling away, only to discover it was dyed bright red.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">It wasn’t just her eyes—blood was oozing from her nose, her mouth, and her ears.</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika averted her gaze. “It’s a shame, really… With your ambition, you might even have become a knight if you had decided to join the Garden.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Bwa-ha-ha! What are talking about? There is <i>no one</i> stronger than me now! Why would I serve under—”</p>

    <p class="TX">Just then, Zhu Yin fell silent.</p>

    <p class="TX">After all, she had just realized that Saika Kuozaki, floating before her, was emitting an aura no less powerful than she herself was.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Wh-what?! Where did you <i>get</i> that<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!” she cried, pouring every ounce of her magic into her next attack.</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika, however, calmly deflected it.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I strip you of the mantle of World King… Whether you live or die now depends entirely on your own potential.”</p>

    <p class="TX">A four-layer world crest burst into being over her head as she raised her hand gracefully in front of her.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Young mages truly do come up with the most fascinating ideas. I hadn’t considered such a creative application before,” Saika said, gathering an immense quantity of magic in the palm of her hand.</p>

    <p class="TX">“The creation of all things. Heaven and earth alike reside in the palm of my hand.”</p>

    <p class="TX">A dazzling resplendence of color flowed from her world crest.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Pledge obedience…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Faced with this fantastical sight, Zhu Yin let out a half-strangled cry: “…Beautiful…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…For I will make of you my bride.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 184. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_184" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>At the receiving end of that devastating blow, Zhu Yin sank into deepest darkness.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">A burst of brilliant color filled the sky.</p>

    <p class="TX">That told Mushiki everything he needed to know—Saika had won.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ugh…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Groaning in pain, he pulled himself to his feet. His body still ached, but now that Saika had recovered her power, he at least seemed to be able to move a little. Perhaps after accommodating the magic of the world for so long, his body had come to depend on it. Then again, maybe Saika’s kiss had served to reinvigorate him.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mushiki…are you okay?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri limped up to him, clutching her shoulder. Her third substantiation was no longer in effect, leaving her in a tattered maid uniform.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yeah… I’ll manage.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“You’re injured. Does it hurt? Are you really okay? Shall I lick your wounds better for you?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Er… R-really, I’m fine. Are you?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I guess so… Hold on, is that Kuroe? She isn’t moving…” Ruri cast her gaze to where Kuroe had fallen, her face contorted with worry.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki froze for a moment as he debated how best to answer her. Kuroe’s consciousness—in other words, <i>Saika’s</i> consciousness—had been transferred back to her original body, but there was no way he could tell Ruri that.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Don’t worry about Kuroe. I’ll take care of her.”</p>

    <p class="TX">To Mushiki’s relief, a third voice entered the conversation from above.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Saika!” Mushiki called out.</p>

    <p class="TX">“A-are you okay?! You’re not hurt?!” Ruri shouted at the exact same moment.</p>

    <p class="TX">Before they knew it, Saika had joined them, responding to their cries with a wry grin.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’m perfectly fine.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 185. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_185" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Thank goodness…” Ruri breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p class="TX">Her concern for Kuroe seemed to have instantly abated, but that was no surprise. After all, Saika had just told her not to worry, and what better reassurance could there be than that?</p>

    <p class="TX">“But what a surprise! It’s really you, Madam Witch! Does this mean your soul left Mushiki’s body for your own again<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah, yes. Something like that.” Saika nodded.</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>Magnificent</i>, Mushiki thought. From an outsider’s perspective, there was nothing at all to suggest that she wasn’t telling the whole truth.</p>

    <p class="TX">“It seems that Zhu Yin has survived as well. She has an impressive life force, that one.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I see… But what was that at the end? Shouldn’t she have been able to conquer the world with that much power<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That may be so. There’s still a great deal we don’t understand about annihilation factors,” Saika deflected, before breathing a tired sigh. “Now then…we have one final task before us.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Final task<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Ruri repeated uncertainly.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. There was still one more thing Saika had to do.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">“Sara<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Anviet called out as he approached her.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…An,” Surya—or rather, Sara—answered.</p>

    <p class="TX">Her mature tone of voice and the slightly melancholy cast to her face were at stark odds with her young, child-size body. Anviet had to remind himself that he was addressing his beloved wife, Sara.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…It’s all over,” he murmured softly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Yes, it is,” she answered with a sad smile.</p>

    <p class="TX">They spoke as if both had already accepted the future that fate had given them.</p>

    <p class="TX">The Wheel of Fate, Fortuna—a mythic-class annihilation factor that had already caused immense destruction. Considering the extent of Anviet’s and Zhu Yin’s wishes, there was no doubt that calamities unknown to them had already taken place somewhere in the world.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…The Fortuna is too dangerous. It has to be destroyed.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 186. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_186" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“But—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Precisely,” sounded a third voice, interrupting him.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet glanced over his shoulder and spotted Saika, accompanied by Mushiki and Ruri.</p>

    <p class="TX">He didn’t want to admit it, but Saika came across to Anviet as nothing less than a god of death incarnate.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Annihilation factors must be eradicated. Especially Mythologia.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Yes.” Sara nodded, slowly rising to her feet. Then, after a short pause, she whispered, “I’m sorry, An…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Why are you apologizin’?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“You’ve figured it out, haven’t you? What I asked Madam Witch back then.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Yeah.” He let out a deep sigh. “Don’t worry… I know you don’t want me to throw my life away.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh-ho… You’ve grown up, An.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’ve been grown up since forever.” He blushed slightly, remembering his actions during the incident at the training grounds. “…But I guess I did kinda make a fuss, huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I love that part of you.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Sure you do,” Anviet pouted.</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara flashed him a serene smile. Then, after a long pause, she continued, “…I’ve…always been afraid.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Of what<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Anviet asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Ever since I received the Fortuna, I was blessed,” she explained with a slight nod. “My father’s business thrived, our family grew ever more prosperous and happier, and my frail health made a remarkable turnaround… Then I got to marry the man of my dreams, the dashing Prince Svarner.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hee-hee…” Sara flashed him a mischievous smile. “You never knew, did you? I was in love with you long before we ever met. So when we finally got married, I felt like I was on top of the world.”</p>

    <p class="TX">She paused for a moment.</p>

    <p class="TX">“But even surrounded by so much happiness, there was one fear I could never shake: maybe you only loved me because of the power <span aria-label=" Page 187. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_187" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>of the ring… That’s why I ran when Madam Witch turned up all those years ago. I was afraid you wouldn’t love me anymore if I lost the Fortuna.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…That’s absurd<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” Anviet growled, his brow creased in a pained frown. “Ain’t no way in hell that would happen. Even if our meetin’ was a stroke of luck, nobody’s gonna deny my feelings for you!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“An…” Still visibly anxious, Sara stared deep into his eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet took her in his arms, holding her in the tightest of hugs.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…That Fortuna’s been gone a hundred years, and I haven’t forgotten you for a single goddamn day. You’re the woman I love, Sara. You’re the only one for me in this life<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Overcome with emotion, Sara returned his embrace.</p>

    <p class="TX">How long did they stay like that?</p>

    <p class="TX">At long last, Sara pulled away, leaving Anviet’s shirt wet with tears.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Thank you, An. I have no more regrets.”</p>

    <p class="TX">She turned to Saika. “Sorry I kept you waiting, Madam Witch… Please…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Ah.” Saika nodded, uncrossing her arms. “Sara. Can you manifest the Fortuna’s powers like you did a hundred years ago?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I’ll try.”</p>

    <p class="TX">With those words, she lowered her gaze and focused.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then a world crest–like pattern arose behind her and emitted a faint glow, like a white robe draping itself over her form. There could be no doubt about it—this was the same form she had adopted after assimilating the Wheel of Fate all those years ago.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Is that…a third substantiation<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Ruri whispered.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Not exactly, though it’s very similar in nature,” Saika answered softly.</p>

    <p class="TX">She held out a hand, her own world crest hovering above her head.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Then let us begin.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika reached out, her palm bathed in scintillating light.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! Madam Witch?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara’s eyes widened in shock, A split second later, so did Anviet’s.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Kuozaki<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 188. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_188" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Saika meant not to kill Sara but to save her.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">Sweat trickled down Saika’s cheek.</p>

    <p class="TX">She hadn’t conducted this kind of procedure in a very, very long time.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that was only natural. After all, she was attempting to forcibly separate a human being who’d merged with an annihilation factor.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…This was beyond me a hundred years ago<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” she wheezed, her voice overflowing with regret. “But now…just maybe<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">She wasn’t referring only to her added strength or another hundred years of life, or to the new experiences gained.</p>

    <p class="TX">No. Right now, the key was none other than the fallen Zhu Yin, whom Saika had stripped of the mantle of World King.</p>

    <p class="TX">That didn’t mean, however, that Saika had resumed that responsibility for herself.</p>

    <p class="TX">Right now, the throne was vacant—the world was without anyone to administer it.</p>

    <p class="TX">Of course, there was no telling what might befall it in such a state. Saika would have to take it back as soon as possible.</p>

    <p class="TX">But this crisis presented a certain opportunity.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. Free from the need to dedicate her resources to maintaining the world’s balance, she was, so to speak, in her absolute prime.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Saika<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” Mushiki shouted behind her, clearly worried for her safety. “Let me use the Hollow Edge!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…No. That would cancel out everything I’m doing.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…B-but<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">From the corner of her eye, Saika watched as Mushiki’s face twisted in frustration.</p>

    <p class="TX">She felt her expression soften.</p>

    <p class="TX">Was that it? Was he bothered by the fact that there was nothing he could do to help?</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Don’t look at me like that. You’re the one who revealed this option to me.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 189. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_189" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Mushiki stared back, wide-eyed.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. It wasn’t just her overall strength and experience that differentiated her now from who she’d been one hundred years ago.</p>

    <p class="TX">The old Saika believed that certain sacrifices had to be made for the world to be saved. Well, strictly speaking, she <i>still</i> believed that.</p>

    <p class="TX">But it was Mushiki Kuga who had said it while facing off against a future version of herself whose powers were above and beyond those that she possessed even now.</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>Saika would never do that.</i></p>

    <p class="TX">“You think too highly of me… I’m not the saint you think I am,” she murmured, clenching her teeth as she poured all her strength into her hands.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Augh… Auuuggghhh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara screamed in agony, but that was little wonder. Saika was trying to remove another existence that had become intertwined with her own, a process that entailed no ordinary level of pain.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Be strong! External forces alone won’t be enough to separate you! You have to reject the Fortuna with all your being!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sara<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” Anviet howled, gripping her hands in his own.</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara tightened her grip as best she could. “…An…”</p>

    <p class="TX">With that, her eyes turned vacant.</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika grimaced. At this rate, Sara’s spirit wouldn’t be able to endure. There would be no point separating her from the Fortuna if it meant leaving her permanently comatose.</p>

    <p class="TX">She needed something, <i>anything</i>, to overcome the annihilation factor’s hold on her.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…It’s all right.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“…?!”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">At that very moment, another voice sounded from Sara’s mouth.</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika and the others collectively gasped.</p>

    <p class="TX">That tone, those words—they knew at once who it was.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Su…rya<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Anviet gaped.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then, with the gentlest of smiles, she said, “Sue will save you, Mama.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 190. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_190" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika startled as her magic instantly met a more pliant response.</p>

    <p class="TX">Something had clearly changed from a moment ago. And now, she had firmly identified the true form of the Fortuna, enmeshed with Sara’s soul. At last, she might finally be able to separate them.</p>

    <p class="TX">But at that same moment—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Stop, Surya! If you do that, you’ll—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Surya!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet must have realized it, too. Holding Surya’s small hand in his own, he screamed at the top of his lungs.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yet she just shook her head weakly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sue…was born a little too early… That’s all<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” she said with a serene smile. “Papa… Mama… You’ll have me again…”</p>

    <p class="TX">With that, her voice faded into nothing.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ngh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">That last nudge was all Saika needed to materialize the annihilation factor and strip it from Sara’s soul.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then, summoning up a miniature fourth substantiation, she crushed it into oblivion.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">Light filled the surrounding area.</p>

    <p class="TX">After those spectacular developments, Mushiki helped Saika, overcome with exhaustion, back to the entrance.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Saika…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I’m sick of being labeled the world’s strongest mage,” she muttered, staring down at her tattered palms. “In the end, I couldn’t do anything on my own.”</p>

    <p class="TX">As she spoke, tremendous earthquakes struck all about, as if the world itself were seeking out its new master.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Looks like we’re running out of time.”</p>

    <p class="TX">She breathed a thin sigh, turning to stare at Mushiki.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Do you resent me?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 191. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_191" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“The Wheel of Fate is destroyed. It won’t be long before all the damage it caused will be returned to its original state—along with the wishes it granted,” she said with a faraway look.</p>

    <p class="TX">It didn’t take much guesswork to figure out what she meant.</p>

    <p class="TX">In other words, they would soon be merged into one again.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…The way I was a moment ago, I could probably have done it. I could have separated us for real. But now—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Saika.” Mushiki stopped her there. “You were busy saving Sara. And I wanted to help you do it.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hmm.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Staring down at the ground, she breathed a weak sigh. It would be extremely gauche, she knew, to make any further show of self-doubt.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Then it’s time for us to part ways for a while… Give my best to Kuroe.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I will.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh, and one more thing.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes?”</p>

    <p class="TX">A cloud of light engulfed them as she spoke her final words: “My ring size. It’s an eight.”</p>
