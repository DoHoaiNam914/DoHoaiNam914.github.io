    <p class="COTX">“I like to think of myself as a tolerant and forgiving man… But there are three things in this world that I simply cannot abide.”</p>

    <p class="TX">The mage Doug Willows leaned forward in his chair and flicked the metal lighter in his hand open and closed.</p>

    <p class="TX">He appeared to be in his midthirties and was dressed in an expensive-looking dark-colored suit. His sharp eyes and sunken cheeks gave off a somewhat jittery impression.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">In front of him was another man, his mouth gagged and his hands and feet bound to a chair. Tears dripped endlessly down his cheeks, while from time to time, he squirmed about in his chair as if trying to communicate something with grunting, inarticulate cries.</p>

    <p class="TX">Willows, however, was in no mood to listen to his pleas.</p>

    <p class="TX">The interrogation was already over. The man was still here simply because he had failed to provide satisfactory answers. Willows saw no need to ask any him more questions at this point.</p>

    <p class="TX">“The first is margarine on toast. The second, women reeking of overly pungent perfume. And the third…” Willows’s eyes sharpened like a razor’s edge as he snapped the lighter closed. “Incompetent subordinates who can’t even babysit a single child.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 64. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_64" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The next moment, a single-layer world crest appeared at the tip of his hand, and thin threads of light extended from his fingertips, prompting the man bound to the chair to recoil in horror.</p>

    <p class="TX">“—!”</p>

    <p class="TX">The man’s muffled screams echoed throughout the room, the legs of the chair beating violently against the floor in sync with his wild thrashing.</p>

    <p class="TX">Willows’s first substantiation could inflict indescribable pain on a subject by damaging their nerve fibers, much like jamming a thorny stick directly into their body.</p>

    <p class="TX">The mage, however, had no intention of killing this man.</p>

    <p class="TX">He certainly had committed the gravest blunder, and yes, Willows was furious with him.</p>

    <p class="TX">But Willows was a businessman first and a mage second. No matter how hot his blood was flowing through his veins, he never failed to consider the potential for profit and loss. While his subordinate needed to be punished to serve as an example, there was nothing to be gained by killing him in a fit of emotion. No, if Willows was going to take a life for his own temporary satisfaction, it would be more beneficial simply to work someone to death.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">At last, the man’s head slumped forward as he blacked out.</p>

    <p class="TX">Willows was extremely fond of his ability—he could inflict pain worse than death, but so long as he didn’t push too hard, the subject wouldn’t expire.</p>

    <p class="TX">Pain begot fear, and fear served as a potent leash. To maintain control over an organization like his, Willows firmly believed it was crucial to instill a sense of overpowering fear into his subordinates.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that alone was insufficient. Slowly raising his head, Willows turned his gaze to his other lackeys waiting by the far wall.</p>

    <p class="TX">“You still don’t know where my <i>lucky charm</i> has run off to?” he demanded.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…W-we’re doing everything we can to find her…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Willows detected a hint of terror in the voice of the man who’d stepped forward to answer him.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 65. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_65" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>But that was to be expected. After all, they were the ones who had lost his lucky charm during the transfer—and she was of the utmost importance to Willows and his group.</p>

    <p class="TX">To make matters worse, even the men he had sent to pursue her had vanished without a trace.</p>

    <p class="TX">Had they been attacked? Spirited away? Or had they conspired to steal her for themselves? Whatever the case, the situation could hardly be any worse.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Find her,” he growled, lowering his voice as he issued fresh instructions. “No one just <i>disappears</i>. Use any means necessary to locate her. The same goes for the traitor who tried to steal her away from me.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“Y-yes…!”</i> his subordinates replied in tense unison.</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment—</p>

    <p class="TX">The door burst open, and a young underling leaped inside, visibly distressed.</p>

    <p class="TX">“B-Boss! Emergency!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What happened?” Willows inquired in the coldest possible voice.</p>

    <p class="TX">It would be a lie to say that he hadn’t been caught off guard, but he knew full well that if he let it show, it would serve only to chip away at his authority.</p>

    <p class="TX">“We’ve found the lucky charm! And we know who attacked Jeff and the others<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh. Good work… So where is she?”</p>

    <p class="TX">The subordinate choked on his words for a moment before summoning up the courage to answer: “…The Garden…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Void’s Garden<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Apparently, the knight Anviet Svarner whisked your lucky charm away<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">The room fell silent, as though it had been doused in icy water.</p>

    <p class="TX">After a moment, a raspy chuckle emerged from deep in Willows’s throat. “…The Garden, you say<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">The mage-training institute Void’s Garden. If Willows and his stray mages were outlaws, then the Garden was essentially a police <span aria-label=" Page 66. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_66" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>force—and the term <i>knight</i> referred to the highest-level mages in its ranks.</p>

    <p class="TX">Most crucially, if the Garden had gotten involved, that meant <i>she</i> must have, too.</p>

    <p class="TX">The headmistress of Void’s Garden, the world’s most powerful mage—the Witch of Resplendent Color, Saika Kuozaki.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">His breath caught in the back of his throat just as that blighted name rose to the tip of his tongue.</p>

    <p class="TX">At the same time, a dull murmur began to spread among his subordinates.</p>

    <p class="TX">This wasn’t good. He took a deep breath to calm himself, then let out a feigned cough to get his underlings to focus. The men startled for a moment, straightening their backs as they snapped to attention.</p>

    <p class="TX">So they were up against the Garden. To be honest, Willows would have very much preferred to steer clear of the likes of them.</p>

    <p class="TX">But he couldn’t afford to back down in front of his men, no matter the adversary. Above all else, he couldn’t afford to lose his lucky charm now.</p>

    <p class="TX">Staring down at his feet, Willows considered his next words carefully.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Get me Zhu Yin.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Zhu Yin<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!” His underling’s eyes shot open in alarm.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that, too, was unsurprising. Zhu Yin was the name of the infamous Taskmaster, a mage notorious among strays like these.</p>

    <p class="TX">“You heard me. Tell her I don’t care how it’s done, so long she retrieves the lucky charm in one piece. I’ll give her whatever she wants in reward.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“B-but she—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Are you going to make me repeat myself?” Willows warned with a piercing look.</p>

    <p class="TX">“N-no<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” his subordinate groaned so softly as to be almost inaudible before rushing from the room.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1"><span aria-label=" Page 67. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_67" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Let’s lay out all the facts,” Kuroe began quietly in the headmistress’s office on the top floor of the central school building.</p>

    <p class="TX">There were only three individuals in the room: Mushiki, Saika, and Kuroe. Mushiki and Saika were facing each other on the sofas in the reception area, while Kuroe stood between them to the side.</p>

    <p class="TX">A short time had passed since Erulka had filled them in on the events in America. By now, the students would be in the middle of class.</p>

    <p class="TX">In light of the situation, it had been decided that Mushiki would take the rest of the day off.</p>

    <p class="TX">Of course, he was well aware of the importance of daily lessons. There were simply too many things, however, that required his immediate attention.</p>

    <p class="TX">Incidentally, seeing how there were topics that they simply couldn’t discuss in Ruri’s presence, they had urged her to return to class as usual… The mere thought of her brooding in the knowledge that the three of them were still together sent a chill down Mushiki’s spine.</p>

    <p class="TX">“When you woke up in the morning, Lady Saika was lying next to you… Isn’t that right, Mushiki?” Kuroe asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Y-yes<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he answered.</p>

    <p class="TX">“You too, Lady Saika,” Kuroe asked, glancing in her direction. “Does anything seem out of the ordinary?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm. When I woke up, I was in Mushiki’s bed. I’m afraid I don’t remember what I was doing before I fell asleep.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I see…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe placed a hand under her chin and sank deep into thought. She looked to be having difficulty pinpointing any possible explanation.</p>

    <p class="TX">Silence filled the office for a long, drawn-out moment. Mushiki, feeling somehow ill at ease, let his gaze wander.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">At that moment, his eyes met Saika’s, and she gave him a mischievous smile, winking across at him.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">His heart seemed to skip a beat.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 68. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_68" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>As if in a trance, he rose wordlessly from his seat and knelt before her.</p>

    <p class="TX">“A-aaahhh, Saika…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What is it? Speak up.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“W-will you—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s enough,” Kuroe interrupted, grabbing him firmly by the neck.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Gah!” He wheezed at the unexpected shock. Furrowing his brow, he turned to face her. “What gives, Kuroe<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s my line. What on earth were you about to do?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Fulfill my promise…of course,” he answered.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe kept her hand clamped on his neck, as if she had just found a pet cat up to no good.</p>

    <p class="TX">Right. After learning that he and Saika had become one, Mushiki had made a request: <i>If we find a way to separate, give me the right to propose to you.</i></p>

    <p class="TX">Saika, he remembered, had answered him with a wry grin.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ever since, that had been Mushiki’s ultimate goal.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe, perfectly aware of all this, heaved a deep sigh. “Of course I remember your promise, and I can’t say that the present situation doesn’t appear to meet our preconditions. However, we still haven’t gotten to the bottom of <i>how</i> you were separated, and we also have an ongoing crisis that must be addressed. Should we not take care of those matters first?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">At this, Mushiki’s breath caught.</p>

    <p class="TX">She was right, of course. Their agreement had simply been that he would have the right to propose to her—whether or not she accepted was a completely separate matter. Rushing ahead would be meaningless if it meant ignoring her feelings.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Right. I guess I didn’t stop to think…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“So you understand?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes. Besides, it would be rude to propose without getting a ring first, right<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 69. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_69" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“You <i>don’t</i> understand.” Kuroe let out a thin sigh. “Mushiki.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes. What is—”</p>

    <p class="TX">Before he could finish speaking, Kuroe lifted his chin and planted a kiss on his lips.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Her movements were so natural that he froze in place, and his eyes widened the second he felt her skin against his own.</p>

    <p class="TX">Out of the corner of his eye, he caught sight of Saika, looking back and forth between the two of them with piqued interest. “Hmm<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” she murmured.</p>

    <p class="TX">She must have found the sight curious, like watching on from the outside while she leaned in to kiss him herself.</p>

    <p class="TX">But when it came to strange impressions, Mushiki was equally stupefied. Here he was, kissing the woman of his dreams while she looked on as an observer at the same time. Confusion, panic, and pleasure came together in his head, leaving him at a total loss as to what to do next.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hmm.”</p>

    <p class="TX">But soon Kuroe brought this to an end, pulling away with a low growl.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Wh-what are you<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he began, unable to get his words out clearly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Supplying you with additional magical energy, of course.” Kuroe nodded calmly. “The fact that you haven’t undergone a state change does indeed suggest that the two bodies have been separated… Although there is one more thing for us to confirm,” she said, narrowing her eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Assuming that the terms of our agreement have been met, to which of us do you intend to propose?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Those last words came not from Kuroe Karasuma, but rather Saika Kuozaki.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki fell silent, at a loss for words.</p>

    <p class="TX">That certainly was a conundrum. He mustn’t have been thinking straight in the face of Saika’s presence. But in actual fact, there were <i>two</i> Saikas here.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 70. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_70" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…This <i>is</i> a very strange situation.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika uttered those words, folding her arms as a grave expression came to her face.</p>

    <p class="TX">“One possible explanation,” she continued, “is that when Mushiki and I were separated, my consciousness, stored inside the homunculus, was split in two. Although my gut feeling is that we’re dealing with something else here.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Indeed,” Kuroe answered. “It’s also possible that a new self came into being within the separated Saika Kuozaki, or within the artificial body Kuroe Karasuma.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes, it is. I consider myself the true Saika Kuozaki, of course—but assuming your theory is true, that I only came into the world this very day, it would be extremely difficult to prove that I’m not a fake.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“The opposite applies for me. My only claim to authenticity is my own memories.”</p>

    <p class="TX">With that, Saika and Kuroe turned their gazes to Mushiki.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mushiki, I want to hear your thoughts.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What do you think of this situation?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What do <i>I</i> think<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he asked, looking back and forth between the two of them.</p>

    <p class="TX">There were <i>two</i> Saika Kuozakis, no doubt about it. And what a wonderful thing that was. The fact that they were both here with him struck Mushiki as nothing short of miraculous.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I—I…I love you both equally<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“…”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">After a moment of silence, Saika and Kuroe broke out into fits of laughter.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Good grief. You never change, do you?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“It’s a relief, at least, to see you acting like yourself.”</p>

    <p class="TX">The two shrugged as they exchanged exasperated glances.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Well, for the time being at least, we seem to lack much in the way of leads on that matter.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Let’s wait until we have Erulka’s test results. We can take it up again then.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 71. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_71" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…In that case, shall we turn to the disappearance of the American city?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Let’s.”</p>

    <p class="TX">With that agreement, the atmosphere in the room turned suddenly tense again after momentarily easing.</p>

    <p class="TX">Erulka’s report had described an incredibly unusual situation—the disappearance of an entire city. The media was in a frenzy over it, of course, with commentators throwing out all manner of speculation on TV and social media. Some claimed it was the result of tectonic movements, others that an experimental superweapon had malfunctioned, while yet others insisted that it was the initial phase of an alien invasion…</p>

    <p class="TX">This frenzy, however, was far from unreasonable. From the point of view of those on the <i>outside</i>, such anomalies were simply unheard of… Or to be more precise, they had no memories of anomalies that were resolved within the window for reversible annihilation.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I knew it… It’s an annihilation factor, isn’t it?” Mushiki asked solemnly.</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika and Kuroe nodded in unison.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Correct. <i>Annihilation factor</i> is a general term for any entity capable of destroying the world. It doesn’t refer just to monsters.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Indeed. Whatever this phenomenon may be, given its enormous impact already, there’s no reason at all why it shouldn’t be classified as an annihilation factor. In fact, the world system has already determined the window for reversible annihilation.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“The window for reversible annihilation<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Mushiki repeated as he lapsed into thought.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe nodded before adding some remarks of her own. “When a large-scale anomaly takes place, the state of the world immediately prior to its occurrence is temporarily saved. If the cause of the disturbance can be eliminated before time runs out, the damage sustained will be rendered as if it never happened. Such is the power of my world… Once the countdown is activated, there can be no questioning that an annihilation factor has indeed reared its head. However…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 72. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_72" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…We still don’t know what it is,” Mushiki finished for her.</p>

    <p class="TX">The two of them nodded and lowered their eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">Right. That was what was so strange about this incident. Normally, when an annihilation factor of this magnitude appeared, the cause was readily apparent.</p>

    <p class="TX">This time, however, seemed to be an exception.</p>

    <p class="TX">There was no trace—not a single clue—as to what exactly had erased the American city from the face of the earth.</p>

    <p class="TX">“The window for reversible annihilation is two hundred and forty hours. In other words, if the annihilation factor is not found and destroyed within approximately ten days, that scene will be recorded in the history of the world as fact.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<i>That</i> is something that must be avoided at all costs. Do you understand?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Yes.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“The Garden has already dispatched a team to investigate. They’ll report back as soon as they learn anything. Depending on the circumstances, this could evolve into a large-scale operation. Be on your toes.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Just before Saika could chime in, the bell sounded across the Garden’s campus to announce the end of classes.</p>

    <p class="TX">A few moments later, they heard a deep rumbling approach from the corridor outside.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then the individual responsible for those footsteps ground to a halt, as if to stop themselves from overshooting their destination. Mushiki heard them take a few steps back before they knocked gently on the door.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah,” he murmured in a small voice.</p>

    <p class="TX">From the knock alone, he could tell the precise identity of this sudden visitor.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Come in,” Kuroe answered calmly.</p>

    <p class="TX">The door swung open slowly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Muushiiikiii!”</p>

    <p class="TX">As expected, Ruri’s voice resounded coldly from the other side as she stormed through the doorway.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 73. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_73" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“You bailed on me, yooouuu!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“R-Ruri…y-you’ve got it all wrong…” He gawked.</p>

    <p class="TX">Faced with the depths of her resentment and fury, he could respond only in the unsettled manner of a man caught cheating by his wife.</p>

    <p class="TX">Watching on from the sidelines, Saika breathed a weak sigh before finally forcing a smile. “We’ve been waiting for you, Ruri. Come now, don’t just stand there. Take a seat,” she said, patting the space next to her.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Eh?!” Ruri exclaimed, her eyes all but popping from their sockets.</p>

    <p class="TX">Just like that, the indignant aura enveloping her body subsided.</p>

    <p class="TX">“U-um… You’re too kind…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh? You don’t want to? I won’t force you, in that case…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Th-that isn’t what I meant! It’s an honor, truly…” Ruri drew her shoulders in and trembled uncontrollably, her cheeks turning bright red. Sure enough, Ruri was like a completely different person when she was dealing with Saika.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Then shall we have some tea? Kuroe, do you mind?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Understood.”</p>

    <p class="TX">With a graceful bow, Kuroe saw to her preparations. It was truly remarkable how quickly her speech and mannerisms had reverted to those of her attendant guise.</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika turned back around.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mushiki. Since you’re here, would you mind fetching some snacks from the break room?” she asked with a wink.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! O-of course!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Sensing her implied meaning at once, he stood up from his chair.</p>

    <p class="TX">The headmistress’s office was already equipped with tea and snacks, so the fact that she had asked him to leave for the break room could only mean that she wanted to help calm Ruri’s nerves in private.</p>

    <p class="TX">And so, with an unspoken word of thanks, he stepped out of the headmistress’s office.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">“Now, Ruri. Please, come over here,” Saika beckoned after Mushiki had left the office.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 74. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_74" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“O-of course<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” Ruri responded, shuffling over to her awkwardly like a windup doll. “E-excuse me,” she squeaked, sitting down at the indicated spot.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yet even after taking her seat on the sofa, she remained stiff with tension, her back stretched as straight as it would go, her muscles quivering. If anything, Ruri seemed to be only barely touching the chair, ready to spring back up again at a moment’s notice.</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika flashed her a wry grin. “There’s no need to be so nervous. You’ll make me feel on edge, too.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I-I’m terribly sorry<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Despite her apology, Ruri still couldn’t bring herself to relax. Every time Saika shifted in her seat, however slightly, a faint floral scent filled the air, further addling Ruri’s already befuddled brain.</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika chuckled once more, before continuing calmly, “Apologies. I’m the one who asked Mushiki to skip class. There was something I needed to make sure of with him. Please, try not to take it out on him too much.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah… Right<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Ruri began, letting out a weak sigh. “…I understand. I’m a mage, so I get that the situation is complicated. I know you won’t harm him, but…er, how should I put it<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” She stopped there, unable to put the vague feeling in her heart into words, her fingertips trembling in her lap.</p>

    <p class="TX">With a divine smile, Saika leaned over to pat her gently on her head.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! M-Madam Witch<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“You really do love him, don’t you?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">She choked up, unable to look back into those eyes that had seen through her so clearly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Yes.”</p>

    <p class="TX">That one word was enough to open the floodgates of her heart.</p>

    <p class="TX">“You’re right, it’s true… I thought I’d been able to put it behind me after everything that happened at the Ark… But, well, whenever I’m near him, I just can’t get my thoughts across properly,” she admitted in the smallest of voices. “I wish I could be more honest with myself…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 75. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_75" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Just then, they heard the click of a lock.</p>

    <p class="TX">Looking up in surprise, Ruri found Kuroe arranging a pair of teacups on the table. Had her hand slipped, perhaps, while setting them down?</p>

    <p class="TX">But what really caught Ruri’s attention was Kuroe’s expression—she was looking around furtively, carefully scanning her surroundings.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Kuroe? Is something wrong<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Perhaps I’m merely imagining things. My apologies,” she said with a polite bow before continuing to set out the tea.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri blinked in suspicion for a moment—yet the sensation of Saika gently stroking her hair once again took hold of her.</p>

    <p class="TX">“It’s all right. I’m sure Mushiki understands how you feel. With time, I hope, you’ll find a way to better express yourself to him.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri trembled with emotion, overwhelmed by this show of kindness from the individual she admired most in the world.</p>

    <p class="TX">“From this day forward, I’ll never wash my hair again…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That won’t do. Be sure to keep it clean, now,” Saika said with a warm smile.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">The next morning, Mushiki awoke in his room in the boys’ dormitory. Only after checking himself over in the mirror to make sure that nothing was amiss did he reach for his cell phone.</p>

    <p class="TX">The cause of his separation from Saika remained unknown. Given the possibility that abnormalities might yet present themselves, Kuroe had advised that both he and Saika check themselves over thoroughly each morning.</p>

    <p class="TX">After recording his observations, Mushiki thought back to the events of the previous day.</p>

    <p class="TX">By the time he had returned to the headmistress’s office with cakes and sweets, Ruri’s mood had completely recovered. He couldn’t have been more impressed by Saika’s ability to so deftly manage the situation.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 76. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_76" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Afterward, they had discussed the mysterious annihilation factor again, this time with Ruri. With that, the meeting was adjourned.</p>

    <p class="TX">It was a worrisome predicament, but without knowing the underlying cause of the disappearance, there was nothing they could do at the moment. As such, their best course of action was to go about their lives as usual while they waited for the investigative team’s report.</p>

    <p class="TX">And so Mushiki began the day in the boys’ dormitory, as per usual.</p>

    <p class="TX">He readied himself for school the same way he always did, exchanged greetings with his fellow dorm mates, and set off for the central school building.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm…”</p>

    <p class="TX">The moment he stepped outside, dazzling sunlight flooded his vision.</p>

    <p class="TX">Squinting slightly, he followed the familiar path through the school grounds.</p>

    <p class="TX">At that moment, he was struck by a peculiar thought.</p>

    <p class="TX">He had already been merged with Saika when he first joined the Garden—and so this was his first time making his way to school purely as himself, Mushiki Kuga.</p>

    <p class="TX">And at the same time, another matter came to mind.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh. Morning, Mushiki.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki startled, grinding to a halt in response to the voice calling out to him on the main street.</p>

    <p class="TX">He glanced over his shoulder to find exactly who he had suspected it was—Saika herself.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Saika…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Now that they were separated, encounters like this were all but inevitable. Nonetheless, the notion of going to school with a uniform-clad Saika was too much for his brain to handle.</p>

    <p class="TX">The moment he laid eyes on her, he felt like dropping to his knees in supplication.</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s enough.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 77. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_77" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Just before he could get carried away, Kuroe raised a hand to stop him.</p>

    <p class="TX">Perhaps unsurprisingly (though Mushiki had failed to consider the possibility), Saika wasn’t alone.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Were you planning on proposing to Lady Saika just now?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“N-no? I mean, you stopped me, and…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Really?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“It’s true. I was just going to ask her ring size; that’s all.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“So you’re laying the groundwork, I take it?” Kuroe observed in a low voice.</p>

    <p class="TX">A short distance behind her, Ruri and her roommate, Hizumi Nagekawa, came into view.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah. Good morning, Madam Witch. You too, Kuga, Karasuma,” Hizumi said in greeting.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki responded with a light wave of his hand.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri, however, fixed him with an impenetrable stare, not so much as uttering a word.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then just like that, she approached at a leisurely pace.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ruri<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Mushiki asked, tilting his head in confusion at this unusual display.</p>

    <p class="TX">She continued to watch him with a vague look, squinting slightly like a predator picking up on the scent of potential prey. And then—</p>

    <p class="TX">“You’re adorable today, Mushiki. Are you asking me out? I’m going to <i>devour</i> you. Grrr.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Eh?” Mushiki gasped, unable to believe that she had said all that with a straight face.</p>

    <p class="TX">He wasn’t alone. Hizumi, Saika, and even Kuroe reacted with wide-eyed astonishment.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri, however, furrowed her brow in confusion, as if she couldn’t comprehend why everyone was gaping back at her.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What’s wrong? Is there something on my face?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“No, that’s not it… Ruri? What was all that about?” Hizumi asked nervously, sweat all but dripping down her cheeks.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 78. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_78" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“What was what<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Ruri repeated, her head cocked to one side. “I was just saying hello to my dear brother… Oh, maybe I wasn’t intimate enough? You’re probably right. You’re so perceptive about these things, Hizumi. Yes, I need to play it cool.”</p>

    <p class="TX">With those words, she tugged at Mushiki’s arm, rubbing her cheek against him and burying her face in his clothes while breathing heavily. Her actions were positively passionate—they could hardly be any less <i>cool</i>.</p>

    <p class="TX">“R-Ruri<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! Hey… What are you<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Aaauuuggghhh! Mushiki! Mushiki! Mushiki! Mushiki! Mushiki! Mushikiii!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ruri?! C-calm down<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Having worked herself into a frenzy, she all but crushed him in a tight embrace, leaving him feeling as if he were at the mercy of a sheet of sandpaper.</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment—</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“This is an urgent message for Headmistress Kuozaki and all Knights of the Garden. Please report to the central command center immediately. I repeat—”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">As if reenacting the events of the previous morning, an emergency summons sounded over the PA system.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1">“…Hah?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki was greeted with Anviet’s dubious gaze when he entered the command center with Saika.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then again, that could hardly be helped. After all, Ruri was clinging so tightly to him that she had practically become part of his outfit.</p>

    <p class="TX">There was no other way to describe it. Her hands were wrapped around his shoulders as she sniffed his neck, letting out what sounded like an intoxicated whimper every now and then. Her legs were hanging limpy and had been scraping against the ground for a good few minutes now as he dragged her along. If they had crossed a sandy path, she would no doubt have left two long trails like a set of train tracks.</p>
