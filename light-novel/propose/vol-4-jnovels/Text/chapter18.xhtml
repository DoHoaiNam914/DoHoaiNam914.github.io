    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 140. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_140" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The minister was far from incompetent, and he wouldn’t permit a special audience without good reason. Whatever it was, it had to be important… Unless, of course, the minister was being manipulated by this sorcerer or poisoned with some kind of mind-altering drug.</p>

    <p class="TX">With those possibilities in mind, Anviet and Sara arrived at the door to the audience chamber, preparing themselves.</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“His Royal Highness, Prince Anviet Svarner, has arrived.”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">With those words, the doors swung open.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet, holding his chest out with pride, slowly entered the chamber and seated himself on the throne. Sara, following suit, took her place by his side.</p>

    <p class="TX">Behind the veil that separated the throne from the rest of the audience chamber knelt a figure in a dark robe. With their face shrouded by a hood, it was impossible to determine their age or even their gender.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What is the meaning of this? To hide your face in front of His Royal Highness<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Sara admonished the figure.</p>

    <p class="TX">She was like a completely different person compared to just a few short moments ago—in every sense the dignified and commanding crown princess.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I beg your pardon. Please forgive my lack of courtesy,” the visitor said, slowly slipping their hands out of their robe to pull back their hood.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet gasped when he at last laid eyes on her.</p>

    <p class="TX">Staring back at him was the beautiful visage of a woman with a set of mesmerizing, iridescent eyes.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB"></div>

    <p class="TX">“It’s an honor to meet you, Your Royal Highness… My name is Saika Kuozaki. I’m a mage.”</p>

    <div class="LI_SB"></div>

    <p class="TX">So said the woman—this Saika—with a thin smile.</p>

    <p class="TX">“A mage<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Anviet murmured, repeating her dubious appellation.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes,” Saika answered with a grand nod. “It’s an honor to make your acquaintance.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 141. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_141" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Hmm…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Her attitude was respectful enough, but there was no mistaking the stench of deception and falsehood emanating from her entire being.</p>

    <p class="TX">“And what brings you here?” Anviet asked, his skepticism plain to see.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah. Yes, to get straight to the point… I humbly ask that Princess Sara relinquish to me the object presently gracing her right ring finger.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What?” Anviet growled, his expression turning stern at the gall of this self-proclaimed Far Eastern mage.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Have you no shame, demandin’ my wife give you her treasures?! You’re bold for a beggar!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I know this is rude of me, but this is a matter of the utmost importance. If Princess Sara continues to wear it, that object will bring grave misfortune down on her.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">She carried herself with an air of mystery, but in the end, this Saika had turned out to be yet another smooth-talking swindler. Anviet motioned the guards to remove her from his presence.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Yet he stopped in his tracks, craning his neck. Sara, it seemed, had turned deathly pale.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sara<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“How…how do you know about the ring<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Who are you?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That object is the Wheel of Fate, Fortuna. It’s a miraculous thing, known for granting the one who wears it whatever they so wish… You seem to have some understanding of its power already, don’t you, Princess Sara?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara gasped, covering the ring with her left hand as if to conceal it from the mage’s gaze.</p>

    <p class="TX">“But it’s a double-edged sword. Excessive desires come at a grave price, and that price must always be paid.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Someone! Remove her at once!” Sara cried out, the guards standing by on duty immediately surrounding Saika.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 142. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_142" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>And yet—</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Be good, now. Sleep.”</p>

    <p class="TX">The moment Saika uttered those words, the guards collapsed to the ground one after the other.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Sara breathed, rising to her feet with a tremble.</p>

    <p class="TX">As if to chase after her, Saika slipped past the fallen guards and began to approach.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I won’t let you have it<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! No! If not for this, I would never have—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sara!” Anviet cried in alarm. “What’s wrong? Calm down! What <i>is</i> that thing?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“An…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara turned to face him, looking for all the world like she was about to burst into tears. A moment later, however, her expression tightened with resolve.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ring! Heed my wish. Be forever mine! Don’t ever leave me<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">A short moment later, the small piece of metal emitted a blinding light.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Uh-oh!” Saika exclaimed, raising her hands in the air.</p>

    <p class="TX">A vibrant three-dimensional pattern formed above Saika’s head, and a beam of lighting shot out from her joined hands.</p>

    <p class="TX">But before that ray of light could reach Sara, her body was enveloped in a radiant robe as a massive halo formed above her.</p>

    <p class="TX">“A pseudo-substantiation<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! You absorbed the annihilation factor?!” Saika shouted, her expression grim.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Shrouded in radiant light, Sara floated into the air in an attempt to flee and passed clean through the ceiling, disappearing into the sky above.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I can’t let you escape,” Saika called out, narrowing her eyes as she, too, defied gravity in pursuit.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mage!” Anviet shouted, taken aback by the situation rapidly unfolding before him. “What’s goin’ on?! What happened to Sara?! You… What have you done with her?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika seemed to hesitate for a moment before answering him. <span aria-label=" Page 143. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_143" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Princess Sara has been possessed by an evil influence. In her present state, she is no longer human… And I…I must destroy the annihilation factor.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Wait! What do you—”</p>

    <p class="TX">Despite his desperate cries, Saika paid him no further heed as she leaped into the air and set off in chase.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1"><i>“Haah… Haah…”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">When Anviet and a handful of his attendants finally caught up to them a short time later, Saika was dressed in what could only be described as a witch’s robe—and Sara had been transformed into <i>something else</i>.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sara<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” Anviet cried, at a loss for all other words as he raced toward her.</p>

    <p class="TX">Her body had been cleaved in two, with only the upper half remaining. Her skin continued to emanate a faint glow, but there was no blood or bones to be found.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yet despite it all, she was still his beloved wife. Cradling what little remained of her, he desperately called out her name: “Sara! Sara<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…An<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” she whispered in an almost imperceptibly small voice as she weakly opened her eyes. “I’m…sorry…”</p>

    <p class="TX">With those last words, what remained of her body disappeared in a cloud of light.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Nooo!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Grief and bewilderment, anger and confusion—myriad emotions flooded Anviet’s mind. For the longest moment, he could only stare at his own hands, the same hands that had cradled his wife just a short time ago, in a murky daze.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">The mage who had stolen his wife slowly approached.</p>

    <p class="TX">Once Saika had reached his side, she whispered, “I won’t try to excuse my role. I killed her. I understand if you resent me.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Her tone was familiar—a far cry from her earlier deferential attitude.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet, however, didn’t care about any of that.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 144. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_144" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Sara… What did you do to her?” he demanded, fixing her with a baleful glare.</p>

    <p class="TX">“She merged with the ring, becoming an annihilation factor.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Annihilation…factor<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Anviet furrowed his brow at the unfamiliar term.</p>

    <p class="TX">“A generic term for an existence capable of bringing the world to ruin,” Saika answered with a slight nod. “That ring granted its user’s wishes, even wishes for utter destruction, but only by exacting tremendous cost from the world itself…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Granting…wishes<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Anviet muttered in disbelief.</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika nodded once more. “So long as annihilation factors are destroyed during the window for reversible annihilation, their effects on the world can be rendered as if they had never occurred… But the same can’t be said for people who merge with the annihilation factor itself, I’m afraid… Normal people retain no memories of an annihilation factor. I’m sorry to say this, but you’ll soon lose all memory of your wife.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet rose to his feet, horror etched into his face.</p>

    <p class="TX">His mind was still in a state of utter turmoil. Nothing Saika had said made any sense.</p>

    <p class="TX">But he simply couldn’t overlook that last remark.</p>

    <p class="TX">“It ain’t enough to snatch her away from me?! You’re robbin’ me of my memories with her, too<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…It’s an unavoidable consequence of the world’s self-preservation system. Only mages who successfully save the world from an annihilation factor retain any memories of it.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet slammed his fist into the ground… Something told him she wasn’t lying.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika’s face contorted with pain. After a long silence, she looked down on him in a way that made him feel like he was being ridiculed. “You poor thing…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 145. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_145" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” he growled, raising his face to glower back at her. “You… What did you just say<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I sympathize, truly. You’re helpless. Unable to do anything but fall to the ground in despair as your wife is taken from you. It’s a sorry sight, especially for a crown prince.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Arrrggghhh!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Pulling out a hidden dagger concealed at his chest, Anviet readied himself to charge at Saika.</p>

    <p class="TX">But just before the blade could reach her, an invisible hand threw him hard against the ground.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Gah… Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Well, that <i>was</i> a surprise. I thought you’d been sapped of the will to live, but it seems you aren’t entirely devoid of spirit.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’ll kill you… You’ll pay<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! You murdered Sara<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmph,” Saika snorted, turning her back on him. “Me? You’ll kill <i>me</i>? That isn’t possible… Not for a mere human, one who isn’t even a mage.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet’s voice caught in his throat.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What did you say<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Earlier?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“So if <i>I</i> become a mage…I can keep my memories of this annihilation factor…of Sara…alive?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah. Yes, that’s right,” Saika answered, her back still turned to him.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Then make me one<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! So I can remember her<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! So one day, I can kill <i>you</i><span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” Anviet howled, clenching his fists so hard that blood seeped from the broken skin of his palms.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">“…Sa…ra…I—I…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet stood there in a daze. His voice was muffled, as if he were trapped in a dream.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Papa!”</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment, Surya appeared by his side—not to cling to him, <span aria-label=" Page 146. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_146" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>but rather to support him, or perhaps to keep him from falling to his knees.</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s enough, Papa… You can stop.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Surya…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet, as if on the verge of an abyss, turned toward her as he slowly recovered.</p>

    <p class="TX">With perfect timing, Kuroe likewise appeared before them.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Knight Anviet Svarner. I am aware of the conflict between you and Lady Saika…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet remained silent for a long while before he finally acknowledged her, his words leaking out in small bursts. “I know…I know it ain’t Kuozaki’s fault. Even back then, when she took on the role of the bad guy…I knew it was all for my sake… But then I figured it out… It was all because of that damned Fortuna…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Figured what out?” Kuroe asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet raised his face to the heavens. “…Kuozaki and Sara spoke. They talked. Before I found them like that.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe had no response to this assertion.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">“…I’m sorry. If only we had been able to locate the annihilation factor before it came to this.”</p>

    <p class="TX">One hundred years prior, Saika, adorned in her third substantiation, gritted her teeth in contrition, her eyes downcast.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Why…are you…apologizing<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” responded Sara weakly, lying broken before the mage.</p>

    <p class="TX">More than half her body had already disappeared following the outcome of their pitched battle. Having merged with the annihilation factor, it was only a matter of time before she ceased to exist entirely.</p>

    <p class="TX">“This is all…my fault… I needed the ring… I needed its power… I was too weak… Because of me…you had to… You had to do this<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” <span aria-label=" Page 147. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_147" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>she whispered, forcing a faint smile. “I have one last wish… If you would hear me out…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Please,” Saika urged. “If it’s something I can do…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Don’t…tell…An<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Sara pleaded. “Don’t tell him…that he could have saved me…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika was at a loss for words.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sara,” she murmured. “You—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“The Fortuna…it’s me now… I finally understand…its true nature…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Though she was fading away, her smile was unwavering.</p>

    <p class="TX">Fortuna, the Wheel of Fate, was an annihilation factor that brought incredibly good luck to its wearer, granting their every wish. But now that Sara had merged with it, she was no longer capable of fulfilling her own wishes.</p>

    <p class="TX">If, however, a third party had wished to separate her from it before her body was completely destroyed, then maybe, just maybe, she could have clung to life.</p>

    <p class="TX">But of course, that wish would come at a price.</p>

    <p class="TX">“If he’d wished for it… If he’d done that…he would become one with the Fortuna in my place…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Yet here was a mage whose mission entailed destroying the annihilation factor.</p>

    <p class="TX">Should anyone make that wish, they would be offering up their own life to save hers.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yet Sara knew—Anviet would make that trade without a moment’s hesitation.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Please… An…is a good person…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I understand. It’s a promise,” Saika answered.</p>

    <p class="TX">Contented, Sara’s eyes drifted closed.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">“If I had died then…Sara might have survived… But for the longest time…I—I didn’t know<i>…</i>!” Anviet cried his eyes out.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 148. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_148" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Faced with this painful sight, Mushiki watched on with a frown.</p>

    <p class="TX">“But Sara and Saika were only thinking of you, Mr. Anviet. They were only—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“You think I don’t get that?!” Anviet interrupted, his mournful cry cutting deep.</p>

    <p class="TX">In truth, Mushiki understood how he must have felt.</p>

    <p class="TX">Sara had made that request of Saika out of consideration for Anviet, while Saika had granted it out of sympathy for them both.</p>

    <p class="TX">But when you suddenly learned that what you had believed so long was nothing more than a lie…</p>

    <p class="TX">How must Anviet have felt?</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki knew the answer.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet hadn’t set out to destroy the world out of desperation, nor was he hoping to exact revenge on Saika.</p>

    <p class="TX">…He just couldn’t forgive himself for having been powerless when it could have mattered.</p>

    <p class="TX">Unable to come to terms with his feelings, unable to express them in any way other than anger, his only choice was to direct it all against Saika.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Don’t say that, Papa,” came a small voice. It was Surya’s.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Surya<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mama’s happy, Papa. She’s so happy you’re still alive, that you haven’t forgotten her.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Anviet’s eyes opened wide.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that was understandable. Given what she had just said, it sounded like Surya had actually spoken directly with Sara.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I see. I understand the situation now.” Kuroe broke her silence with a heavy sigh.</p>

    <p class="TX">She stared deeply into Anviet’s eyes, speaking loud and clear. “This is a crisis, and we don’t have time for your pathetic whining. Get a grip, you moron.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hah<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet’s jaw dropped in shock—and it wasn’t only him. Mushiki was equally taken aback by that outburst, so out of character for Kuroe.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 149. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_149" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Then she declared in an equally firm tone, “You’ve lost, Knight Anviet. You would be doing us all a favor if you surrendered quietly.”</p>

    <p class="TX">…Well, from where Mushiki was standing, the outcome was far from clear, even if Anviet was battered and beaten while he himself was still standing. Of course, there was no need to point that out.</p>

    <p class="TX">A battle between two mages was a battle between two souls, and it was undeniably true that Saika’s fourth substantiation had overwhelmingly shattered Anviet’s.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…You…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“No one who keeps wallowing in self-doubt <i>because</i> someone loves them can possibly defeat a foe who fights to <i>protect</i> their loved ones.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet fell deathly silent.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then, after the longest of pauses—</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“…Haah…”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">Staring first at Surya then Kuroe and Mushiki one by one, he breathed a ragged sigh. It was like he was fully aware of what Kuroe was doing, yet he was going along with the gambit nonetheless.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…You’ve got a point. It doesn’t matter how it happened; a rookie who’s been here all of a few months took down my fourth substantiation. I ain’t got no more pride to hold on to. Do whatever you want with me. Boil me, roast me, serve me up for supper—I don’t give a damn.”</p>

    <p class="TX">He let out a deep breath, his golden armor dissipating to reveal his regular slacks and shirt.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I have no intention of boiling or roasting you.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Assuming this was just an emergency preparedness drill, there would be no need for punishment or anything of the sort. You gave a very real performance, Knight Anviet. You had everyone at the Garden fooled,” Kuroe said, her voice implacably calm.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Huuuh?!” Anviet gawked. “Hold up. A <i>drill</i>? What the hell are you goin’ on about<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes, a drill. A training exercise anticipating an external facility <span aria-label=" Page 150. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_150" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>being taken over by rogue elements from within the Garden. Since only Saika, who came up with this idea, and you, Knight Anviet, chosen to play the role of the culprit on account of your villainous demeanor, were aware of the details, you were able to simulate the emergency with a remarkable degree of verisimilitude.”</p>

    <p class="TX">…Of course, none of that was remotely true. Though her explanation was somewhat forced, Kuroe was essentially saying that she would overlook the matter.</p>

    <p class="TX">“You’ve gotta be kiddin’ me! I meant every bit of it! I don’t need your pity. Or your charity, either.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Pity? Charity? You seem to have misunderstood, Knight Anviet.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Don’t you get it? You have placed yourself in immense debt with Lady Saika. This is a collar. With this, you will dedicate yourself to the Garden in full.” She rested a hand on Anviet’s shoulder.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki, having quickly caught on, struck a provocative pose.</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s right, Mr. Anviet. From now on, you’ll be Saika’s faithful servant, even more than before… I’m kind of jealous. It isn’t fair, Mr. Anviet!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What the hell are <i>you</i> blabberin’ about?!” Anviet shot back, before catching his breath in surrender. “…Fine. Do whatever you want.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Surya wrapped her arms around Anviet in a warm embrace.</p>

    <p class="TX">Seeing just how relieved she looked, Mushiki felt his lips curling in a broad grin.</p>

    <p class="TX">But they couldn’t stay this way forever.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Then I will,” Kuroe continued. “I’m requesting your assistance, Knight Anviet. Immediately.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hah? <i>Now?</i>”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Lady Saika has been abducted by a group believed to be Salix. The culprits have demanded we hand over Surya as a condition for her release.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!” Anviet’s face twisted in a jaw-dropping mixture of <span aria-label=" Page 151. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_151" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>shock and awe. “Kuozaki got herself kidnapped<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! Ain’t no way in hell that happened!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I can explain later. For now, we must return to the Garden.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“But we haven’t heard anything<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Mushiki pointed out, worried. “That means we have no clue where Saika even is, right?”</p>
