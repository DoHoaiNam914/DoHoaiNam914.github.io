    <p class="COTX">“Ah… Morning, Mushiki. Nice weather today, don’t you think?”</p>

    <div class="LI_SB"></div>

    <p class="TX">If…</p>

    <p class="TX">And only if…</p>

    <p class="TX">There was someone you found yourself deeply and uncontrollably attracted to…</p>

    <p class="TX">If just thinking about them was enough to make your heart all but leap from your chest, make the world shine in the most exquisite of colors. <i>If</i> there was someone like that…</p>

    <p class="TX">A simple smile might be enough to melt your brain and send it oozing out through your ears. The softest touch of a fingertip might have you trembling with ecstasy and liquefy in sheer bliss. You would let out the most joyful sigh, feeling like all your time in the world had been building up to this very moment.</p>

    <p class="TX">No, this isn’t about illicit drugs. It isn’t.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anyway, back to the main topic. This is where it gets real.</p>

    <p class="TX">Let’s say you had a crush on someone who made you feel that way…</p>

    <p class="TX">What on earth would you do if you woke up one morning to find them lying next to you in bed?</p>

    <p class="TX">And as naked as the day they first came into this world at that?</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 2. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_2" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>That</i> was the situation Mushiki Kuga found himself in.</p>

    <p class="TX">He could only lie there, completely paralyzed, eyes opened as wide as they could go.</p>

    <p class="TX">A deluge of information and raw data was coursing through his retinas, his eardrums, his nasal cavities.</p>

    <p class="TX">Her sun-colored hair positively glistened in the morning light streaming through the window.</p>

    <p class="TX">Hers was a beauty that could be described as none other than <i>divine</i>; her vivid, iridescent eyes looked like they had been carved by the gods themselves.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then came the smooth ridge extending from just below her neck to—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Right. There could be no doubt about it. Not one little bit.</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>This</i> was the woman he had long yearned for and long sought after—whom in a normal world, he would never, <i>ever</i>, have been able to reach.</p>

    <p class="TX">Saika Kuozaki—the strongest mage in the world.</p>

    <p class="TX">That morning, Mushiki was at last reunited with her.</p>
