    <p class="COTX">Long time no see. Koushi Tachibana here.</p>

    <p class="TX">How did you find Volume 4 of <i>King’s Proposal</i>, <i>The Golden Maiden</i>? I hope you enjoyed it.</p>

    <p class="TX">We have a new character, Surya, on the cover this time around. If you ask me, her white-and-red outfit is super cute. I wanted her hair to be braided to match Anviet’s, but you wouldn’t believe my shock when I saw this version of the picture! My editor and I were thrown for a loop. I mean, who knew this kind of hairstyle even existed?!</p>

    <p class="TX">I was really torn having to decide on a theme for her outfit, but after playing an association game based on the motif of a <i>wheel</i>, I ultimately arrived at something like the costumes worn by promotional models at motorsports events. The second the idea came to me, I knew at once it was the way to go!</p>

    <p class="TX">I have to admit, though, I wanted to see Anviet on the cover. I mean, take a look at the inner illustration of his third substantiation. It’s just too cool. We’ll have to find a way to highlight his ripped pecs another time.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB"></div>

    <p class="TX">Finally, the manga adaptation that I first announced in Volume 3 has kicked off on Gangan Online.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 200. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_200" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Nemo Kurio is the illustrator and Shishitoh the layout artist. They’ve done an amazing job, so please check it out!</p>

    <div class="LI_SB"></div>

    <p class="TX">Now then, it’s time to show my thanks to everyone involved in producing this volume.</p>

    <p class="TX">Tsunako, you’ve outdone yourself again with your wonderful illustrations. Surya’s hairstyle truly is a work of imagination. And to Kusano, thank you again for another cool cover design. I’m always thrilled to see how the volume numbers take center stage on the cover art. To my editor, I really do appreciate your unfailing help.</p>

    <p class="TX">Everyone on the editorial team, all those involved in publication, distribution, and sales, and you, holding this book in your hands—you have my heartfelt thanks.</p>

    <p class="TX">I can’t wait to see you again in Volume 5.</p>
