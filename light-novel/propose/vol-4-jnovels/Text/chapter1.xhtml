    <p class="COTX">There are moments when one’s awareness and powers of concentration are razor-sharp.</p>

    <p class="TX">For instance, when you are totally absorbed in something you love.</p>

    <p class="TX">Or when you are pushing yourself toward a distant goal.</p>

    <p class="TX">Or…when your life is exposed to mortal danger.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">In the midst of that moment of tension, each second stretching out to impossible lengths, Mushiki Kuga clasped his hands tightly around the hilt of his transparent sword as his breathing went ragged.</p>

    <p class="TX">The sheer level of danger one faced when going up against an opponent wielding a weapon was beyond description. It would be impossible for anyone to truly understand what he was going through without experiencing it for themselves.</p>

    <p class="TX">That went double when facing off against one of the highest-ranking mages at Void’s Garden.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki and his opponent were in the training grounds located in the middle of the Garden’s western precinct.</p>

    <p class="TX">Across from him was a girl wearing the most determined expression, her hair bundled in pigtails.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 4. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_4" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Her name was Ruri Fuyajoh, and she was Mushiki’s younger sister and classmate. And a Knight of the Garden to boot.</p>

    <p class="TX">Atop her head hovered a two-part world crest reminiscent of a demon’s horned visage, and in her hands, she gripped a long-handled weapon with a blade like roiling flame.</p>

    <p class="TX">Her world crest, along with her second substantiation. When a modern-day mage activated both of these, it meant that they were ready to wage war.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmph…”</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment, Ruri burst into action. Though her speed was slower than usual, her single-minded enthusiasm was without fault.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword and reflected on the advice he had received earlier as he readied his response.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Haaah!”</p>

    <p class="TX">With an ear-piercing cry, he swung his transparent blade, the Hollow Edge.</p>

    <p class="TX">This was <i>his</i> second substantiation, capable of nullifying all others. When his transparent sword collided with Ruri’s burning <i>naginata</i>, her Luminous Blade, it would erase its very existence.</p>

    <p class="TX">And yet it didn’t.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Ruri gasped in surprise.</p>

    <p class="TX">Since she was aware of his abilities, she had undoubtedly gone into this fight assuming that her second substantiation would be quickly obliterated.</p>

    <p class="TX">But Mushiki had refrained from activating the Hollow Edge’s trademark technique, simply using his sword to physically repel her <i>naginata</i>.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri was clearly taken aback as the two of them exchanged a second, then a third strike in quick succession.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I see… So that’s your game plan.” She broke into a fearless grin, resetting her fighting stance and deftly parrying Mushiki’s attacks.</p>

    <p class="TX">But he had seen that coming, too.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Aaauuuggghhh!”</p>

    <p class="TX">The next instant, Mushiki activated the Hollow Edge and expunged Ruri’s Luminous Blade.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 5. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_5" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Tch<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri broke into a frown. It wasn’t that she hadn’t expected this move, but rather that she had failed to anticipate when exactly he would use it. Though slight, there was a noticeable shift in her battle stance.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Now<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">An opening. Without hesitation, Mushiki swung his blade at Ruri’s undefended shoulder.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmph<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">But Ruri Fuyajoh was a knight. Despite being caught off guard, she leaped into the air to dodge his oncoming strike with nothing more than exquisite footwork. Then with equally fluid movements, she reactivated her second substantiation.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Way to go. But this is the end.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki jumped backward, raised the Hollow Edge in front of him, and reinforced his defenses.</p>

    <p class="TX">And yet—</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment, Ruri let out a frenzied cry.</p>

    <p class="TX">There was a simple reason for that. The moment their weapons made contact, Mushiki deactivated his second substantiation and extinguished his Hollow Edge.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ngh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">The Luminous Blade grazed his arm; if not for his sturdy Garden uniform, it might well have drawn blood.</p>

    <p class="TX">But in exchange for taking that light hit, he gained his greatest chance yet.</p>

    <p class="TX">Focusing, he activated his second substantiation once again and launched into the decisive blow—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ow…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Just then, a soft popping sound reverberated all around, and Mushiki fell to his knees.</p>

    <p class="TX">Somehow, Ruri had struck even faster than he could reactivate his abilities.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 6. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_6" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“That does it. Ruri wins,” a calm voice announced from nearby.</p>

    <p class="TX">Turning toward it, Mushiki laid eyes on a dark-haired, dark-eyed girl holding her right hand up in the air—Kuroe Karasuma, acting as referee.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki rubbed the back of his head and picked himself up, pounding his fist on the ground in frustration.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ugh… I was going to ask Saika for a pat on the head if I won<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What <i>are</i> you talking about?” Kuroe asked, her eyes slightly narrowed.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki shot his head up. “Sorry. That was just how I got myself energized before the match.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Is that so?” Kuroe asked, evidently not amused.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri let out a deep sigh. “You’ve got a ways to go, Mushiki. I was picturing Madam Witch giving me a lap pillow and cleaning my ears if <i>I</i> won.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! No wonder you got promoted to knight!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Being a knight has nothing to do with it,” Kuroe interrupted. “Don’t go giving yourself any weird ideas, you two. Besides, Ruri hasn’t made any particular promises with Lady Saika. Have you now?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“O-of course not! What are you even talking about?!” Mushiki stammered.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I—I would never presume to<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” Ruri exclaimed in panic.</p>

    <p class="TX">The look on Kuroe’s face all but declared, <i>I can’t believe this.</i></p>

    <p class="TX">“…Very well,” she said at last in an effort to change the topic. “In any case, I have no objections to your other suggestion, Mushiki.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Right.” He nodded. “I already knew this, but Ruri really is amazing. I couldn’t keep up with her.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Don’t blame yourself for how it ended, Mushiki,” Ruri answered after taking a moment to catch her breath. “You took out my substantiation, baited me into attacking you, and temporarily erased your own substantiation, too… Did I get that right? Yes, yes, I see… Simply by increasing your move pool, you’ve made it much harder to guess what you’re going to do next. This was your best show yet. If you had managed to reactivate your substantiation sooner, the outcome might have been completely different.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 7. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_7" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“R-really?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Indeed.”</p>

    <p class="TX">This time, it was Kuroe’s turn to answer. She was as expressionless as ever, but Mushiki sensed from her tone that she was secretly pleased with his performance.</p>

    <p class="TX">“The ability to annul opposing substantiations makes you a formidable threat to most mages. No one wants to fall victim to a technique like that. If they can’t gauge when you’re going to put it into action, they’ll have to remain vigilant throughout, which will inevitably prompt them to leave themselves open at times.” Kuroe paused there, raising a hand in front of her. “Expanding your repertoire of moves is crucial in combat situations. Even if your opponent is aware of all your strategies, you won’t necessarily be at a disadvantage so long as you have the flexibility to respond with an optimal move for any given development. Think of it like rock-paper-scissors. No matter how powerful a <i>rock</i> move you might be keeping up your sleeve, it’s easily countered if your opponent uses <i>paper</i>,” she explained, making the matching hand gestures. “But if you have two moves available to pick from, <i>paper</i> or <i>scissors</i>, you can employ a much higher level of strategy.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I—I see…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“In real-life battle, you have much more than just three moves at your disposal. You can make use of practically any kind of tactic—fox, firearms, village headman. Even frog, snake, or slug,” Kuroe said, listing the moves in two other old-fashioned games similar to rock-paper-scissors. She paused there for a moment before continuing. “First and foremost, it’s essential to master each and every one of your potential plays. Right now, we might say that your <i>scissors</i> move takes you too long to invoke.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I guess I don’t have much of an excuse.” Mushiki averted his gaze.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri, on the other hand, broke into a frown. “…You sound like a master schooling their disciple, Kuroe. Have you been giving him private lessons or something?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“No, not at all. I’m merely conveying Lady Saika’s wisdom secondhand,” Kuroe answered nonchalantly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Ruri grumbled, scratching her cheek.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 8. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_8" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>From her expression, it was clear that she still harbored doubts about Kuroe’s true identity. Nevertheless, she had accepted that what Kuroe had just explained <i>was</i> something Madam Witch might teach…</p>

    <p class="TX">“Fine. Anyway, you’d better work on improving yourself, Mushiki. I don’t want you holding me back,” Ruri declared before furrowing her brows as if suddenly remembering something. “Right, speaking of which. Madam Witch’s consciousness is basically dormant inside you, correct? So what do you do when you need to communicate with her?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh?” Mushiki’s eyes widened in response to this unexpected question.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Why do you look so surprised just now?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“S-sorry. I was just thinking, and you caught me off guard.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“If you have a message for Lady Saika, I’ll handle it,” Kuroe said, taking over. “Isn’t that right, Mushiki?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah… Yeah.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I guess that makes sense,” Ruri said at last.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe fixed Mushiki with a probing stare, prompting him to break out into a cold sweat as he recalled their earlier exchange.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">“Her skin’s luxurious texture.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Her gestures, so eloquent and refined.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“The way she maintains perfect posture when she takes a seat.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Her handwriting, so neat and tidy.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“The way she says <i>Achoo!</i> when she sneezes.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What the heck? That’s super cute<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Heh. With this Magic Card, Madam Witch’s skill on the field rises to a full 4,500 points!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ugh… Impressive, Ruri. But I’m just warming up… Time for a reverse card! The look of surprise on her face when she drinks a mug of black coffee thinking it has sugar in it!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What?! Madam Witch is supposed to be a tea person! How did you get your hands on such a rare card?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What are you two doing?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 9. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_9" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Mushiki and Ruri were having a heated discussion in the headmistress’s office in the Garden’s central school building when Kuroe appeared, giving them both a humorless stare.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Isn’t it obvious?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“We’re playing a Madam Witch card game.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Clutching their handmade cards, the two of them responded as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe arched a brow. “…And what exactly is this mysterious game you’re playing?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Heh. Do you want me to teach you how to play?” Ruri asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“No. I’m fine,” Kuroe answered flatly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Did <i>he</i> beat me to the punch?” Ruri pouted.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Don’t tell me <i>this</i> is what you wanted to discuss?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri’s shoulders trembled at the question. Then she caught herself, as if remembering something important. “Right… I’ll let you have this round, Mushiki. Why don’t we sit over there, Kuroe?” she asked, tidying up the cards on the table.</p>

    <p class="TX">Taking a deep breath to regain her composure, she then looked at Mushiki and Kuroe once more. “I’m sure you know why I wanted to see you both. It’s about <i>that</i>. I want you to explain it all to me one more time.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“…”</i></p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki and Kuroe exchanged furtive glances.</p>

    <p class="TX">That being said, neither was particularly surprised. They had, to a certain extent, even anticipated something like this.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Sure, we’ll go over it again,” Mushiki answered. “Besides, you’ve got a right to know. But you have to keep it to yourself, and not just for my sake. This could have extremely serious ramifications for the Garden as a whole. You’ve got to promise me you won’t tell anyone, no matter what.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Of course, I understand. My lips are sealed,” Ruri answered, nodding solemnly.</p>

    <p class="TX">In response, Mushiki raised a hand to his chest.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB"></div>

    <p class="TX">“My body is currently in a state of <i>fusion</i> with Saika’s.”</p>

    <div class="LI_SB"></div>

    <p class="TX">Then, quietly but clearly, he told her the truth.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 10. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_10" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Yes. He gave voice to the secret he carried with him—that Saika Kuozaki, the Witch of Resplendent Color, headmistress of Void’s Garden and the most powerful mage in the whole world, had merged with his own body.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Right now, mine is the dominant side, but when certain conditions are met, Saika’s qualities take over. To anyone who sees this, it might look like I’m actually transforming into Saika.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Upon learning this shocking truth, Ruri betrayed no hint of astonishment or panic. All she did was furrow her brow.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that was to be expected. After all, she had already seen him go through that transformation with her own eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Merged<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? You’re saying Madam Witch used a fusion technique? Sure, that might explain what I saw… But <i>why</i>?” Ruri stroked her chin, her expression stern. “Fusion techniques are incredibly dangerous, especially when they involve people. If the participants’ consciousnesses clash, the whole process can fall apart. Even with her skill, I can’t imagine Madam Witch using something like that lightly…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Well<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Mushiki began. “She—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Madam Witch was facing a unique crisis,” Kuroe interrupted from the seat beside him.</p>

    <p class="TX">“A crisis?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes. Do you remember when I reported that Madam Witch had been attacked?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes, of course. You said it back at the Garden’s regular meeting… Wait. Don’t tell me—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“As you’ve no doubt surmised, both Lady Saika and Mushiki, who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, were critically injured. Lady Saika willingly used the fusion technique in order to save their lives, despite knowing the risks involved.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri widened her eyes as she leaned forward over the table.</p>

    <p class="TX">“A-are you okay?!” Mushiki cried out, caught off guard by the sudden movement.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 11. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_11" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Ah, yeah…” Ruri heaved a sigh. “I shouldn’t be surprised; Madam Witch has a superb mastery of advanced techniques… So does this mean you’ve been fused into a single person? Oh my God. Is this seriously <i>real</i>? It’s like someone specifically set out to make new material to feed my wildest fantasies… Like adding one to infinity<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Ruri murmured under her breath, until at last, her eyebrows twitched. “So where’s Madam Witch’s consciousness? Is it lying dormant, like her physical body is? I mean, it would be difficult to control yourself properly if both consciousnesses were active at the same time…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Um. Well…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes. Lady Saika’s consciousness is lying dormant inside him. Isn’t that right, Mushiki?” Kuroe answered on Mushiki’s behalf, her stare all but compelling him to nod in agreement.</p>

    <p class="TX">“R-right. Yeah… I guess.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Which means that when Madam Witch comes out, Mushiki’s consciousness goes to sleep?” Ruri asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? What? Did I say something funny?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“N-no, not at all.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Just as Mushiki was racking his brain about how best to respond—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Precisely,” Kuroe interrupted again.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri seemed to have no difficulty accepting this response. “So…when can the two of them be separated?” she asked worriedly. “Surely they can’t stay like that forever. <i>Can</i> they?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Of course not.” Kuroe shook her head. “However, it takes considerable preparation to separate two entities who have been fused in this way. In the meantime, we would greatly appreciate your cooperation and assistance.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Of course! Anything for Madam Witch<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! And Mushiki… just tell me what you need,” she declared, giving her chest a strong thump.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Thank you,” Kuroe answered. “I do have one favor to ask you.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sure. What is it?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“We need your help training Mushiki.”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 12. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_12" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Ruri stared back, wide-eyed. “Training him<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? <i>Me…?</i>”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes. As you know, he’s very much a novice in his capacity as a mage. However, if something happened to him, it would affect Lady Saika in equal measure. We can’t allow that to transpire.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…No, we can’t,” Ruri repeated, nodding sternly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Therefore, it is in the best interests of the Garden that we raise his proficiency as quickly as possible,” Kuroe continued. “Not only are you, Ruri, the only one strong enough to take on that task, but you’re also the only other person who understands the situation we find ourselves in.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“But I…” Ruri wore a troubled look. While she understood the circumstances, she had gone through a great deal of effort to keep Mushiki out of harm’s way and no doubt continued to have misgivings about dragging him further into mage society.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ruri…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Please. I understand that you care about Mushiki a great, great, <i>great</i> deal and that you don’t want to see him come to harm, but this—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“H-huh?! Who said anything like that?!” Ruri cried out, her face turning bright red.</p>

    <p class="TX">(The fact that she didn’t deny the charge certainly didn’t go unnoticed.)</p>

    <p class="TX">She stayed that way for a long time before eventually letting out a sigh of resignation. “…All right. I mean, I don’t want to see anything bad happen to Madam Witch.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! Thank you, Ruri!” Mushiki rejoiced.</p>

    <p class="TX">She looked away in embarrassment.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Thank you for your understanding… Do you mind if we get started right away?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’ve already obtained permission to use the training grounds,” Kuroe explained matter-of-factly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…You came here prepared, didn’t you?” Ruri observed in a nervous sweat. “How did you know I would agree to do it?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 13. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_13" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“I just thought it would be prudent.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri continued to wear a suspicious frown, but she was ready to concede. “…Fine, whatever. I’ll do it. I can take my frustration out on Mushiki.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“By all means. However, I will need a few minutes to prepare him. Would you mind going on ahead?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yeah, yeah. See you soon,” Ruri said with a wave as she stepped out of the headmistress’s office.</p>

    <p class="TX">Maybe half a minute later, once Ruri’s footsteps were completely out of earshot, Mushiki turned to Kuroe.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Are you sure about this?” he asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sure about what?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“About who we said was in charge while I’m in my Saika form. A-and about you, too.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe exhaled softly. “It’s fine. Telling the whole truth isn’t always the best course of action.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Now that Ruri had left, Kuroe’s tone of voice had undergone a noticeable change.</p>

    <p class="TX">No, not just her voice. Even her facial expressions and physical mannerisms were completely different from how they had been a moment ago.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that was only natural. After all, Kuroe Karasuma was merely the name of the artificial body in which Saika Kuozaki’s soul now resided.</p>

    <p class="TX">“But—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’m not saying I don’t trust her. But take a moment to think it over. How do you think she would feel if the <i>me</i> she’s been interacting with these past few months was actually her own brother?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki made a sour face.</p>

    <p class="TX">…Right, he could imagine how uncomfortable that would make everyone.</p>

    <p class="TX">For the person Ruri respected and admired most to be replaced by Mushiki on the inside—in other words, knowing that her brother had <span aria-label=" Page 14. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_14" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>seen everything she had said and done in front of Saika… Just thinking about it was enough to fill him with unending shame.</p>

    <p class="TX">“On top of that, how would you explain the fact that you’ve been sneaking into the girls’ changing room and using the public baths in my body all this time?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ugh…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki clammed up. The changing room stuff had all been out of his control, and he had only ever bathed with Kuroe’s assistance in order to protect Saika’s dignity… But that probably wouldn’t mean much if the truth reached Ruri’s ears.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I see. Thanks for your concern,” he said at last.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Don’t mention it,” Kuroe said.</p>

    <p class="TX">She turned her gaze to Mushiki’s cards on the table, which he hadn’t yet put away, then asked: “…So what’s so fun about this game of yours?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah. Are you interested?” Mushiki asked, his eyes sparkling with excitement.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe flashed him a forced smile. “…Later perhaps. Ruri is waiting.”</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">“Did we not agree to keep the matter of Lady Saika’s consciousness a secret from Ruri?” Kuroe demanded in a small voice, cornering Mushiki on the edge of the training grounds.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…S-sorry. It was a slip of the tongue<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he answered, shrinking back in fear.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hey. What are you two whispering about?” Ruri called out in irritation from a short distance away.</p>

    <p class="TX">They both knew it wouldn’t look good if their private conversation dragged on too long, so Mushiki and Kuroe made their way back to her.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Apologies. I had some advice for Mushiki in light of your sparring contest just now.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? So if you’re keeping it a secret from me, that must mean <span aria-label=" Page 15. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_15" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>you’re planning on doing something fancy next time, huh? It better be good,” Ruri joked with a swing of her Luminous Blade.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki broke out into a cold sweat. “T-take it easy on me, please…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That won’t do. You have to be more assertive, Mushiki,” Kuroe interjected. “The purpose of practical combat training is not only to master battle techniques, but also to get used to facing opponents who mean to do you real harm. If you allow yourself to feel intimidated before you even begin, you won’t be capable of winning against anyone… Clara Tokishima is no exception in that regard.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Right.”</p>

    <p class="TX">The second that name came up, both Mushiki’s and Ruri’s expressions turned stern.</p>

    <p class="TX">Clara Tokishima—formerly from the mage-training institute Shadow Tower, now fused with the mythic-class annihilation factor known as the Ouroboros.</p>

    <p class="TX">She was, in a very real sense, the archenemy of all mankind, and she had a history with Mushiki and company.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Clara Tokishima has acquired four pieces of the Ouroboros, which means that her power is steadily increasing. You absolutely cannot afford to let down your guard around her.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What was that?” Ruri asked, one eyebrow raised. “Four<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Hold on a second. Why are so many seals coming undone all at once? Shouldn’t security at each of the facilities have been beefed up?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes. But there was an incident where the outer shell of several facilities sustained major damage recently… It primarily affected those located underwater and along the coast.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“—!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Both Mushiki and Ruri were taken aback by this.</p>

    <p class="TX">Of course, they both knew exactly what Kuroe was referring to.</p>

    <p class="TX">“No way… Are you talking about the Leviathan? I mean, I do remember hearing that Clara was involved with that, but—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Indeed. I had my doubts as to why another Mythologia had been revived so soon, but it has since become quite clear that Clara <span aria-label=" Page 16. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_16" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Tokishima took advantage of the confusion to send her followers to raid several sealing facilities. I suspect that was her true goal from the very beginning.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Damn her,” Ruri growled, clenching her teeth in frustration.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki had little difficulty understanding how she must have felt.</p>

    <p class="TX">Just a short time earlier, the three of them had only narrowly defeated the revived Leviathan in a life-or-death battle at the mage-training institute Hollow Ark.</p>

    <p class="TX">And now they were finding out that that battle had all been a distraction from Clara’s true objective? Mushiki felt like venting his anger, too.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that display of outrage didn’t suit Ruri.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki shook his head. “Still, by defeating the Leviathan, we <i>did</i> lift the curse on the Fuyajoh clan. So it definitely wasn’t pointless.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mushiki…” Ruri sighed weakly.</p>

    <p class="TX">Of course, not even he believed that meant all was well. There was no denying that the threat Clara posed had risen exponentially.</p>

    <p class="TX">But it was better to take pride in what you had gained than to lament that which you had lost. That was how a mage ought to conduct themselves—or so he suspected Saika might say.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri must have sensed his feelings. She lowered her eyes and gave him a brief nod. “…Right. What matters most is winning with the hand we’ve been dealt.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Precisely.” Kuroe nodded in agreement.</p>

    <p class="TX">“In other words, even if Madam Witch is dressed in a school uniform and you only have a plain clothes card on hand, you can still find synergy depending on how you combine different elements.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Exac— What?” Kuroe craned her head to one side.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki, however, responded with a forceful nod. “I see… So that’s how it is.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What makes you so sure you follow?” Kuroe sighed wearily. “Anyway, for now, we have training to do. Once more, let’s—”</p>

    <p class="TX">That was when it happened.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hey! You kids! Whaddaya doin’ over there?” a gruff voice called out from a short distance away.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 17. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_17" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">The three of them turned around to find a tall man approaching, his arms crossed. When did <i>he</i> show up?</p>

    <p class="TX">The man was in his midtwenties and had tanned skin, and he wore his hair in a braid. His features were well defined, though they seemed to come across as somewhat stern.</p>

    <p class="TX">He was dressed in a well-tailored shirt, slacks, and a vest, and his hands and neck were adorned with gold jewelry. One misstep and that outfit would have come across as tacky, but strangely, it didn’t look half bad, thanks to his overall appearance and demeanor.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet Svarner—a Knight of the Garden, just like Ruri, and a member of the teaching staff.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Nice to see you, Knight Anviet.”</p>

    <p class="TX">It was Kuroe who answered him, maintaining perfect composure as she lowered her eyes and offered a respectful bow.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Knight Fuyajoh is currently conducting a special training session for our new student Mushiki Kuga,” she added.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<i>Fuyajoh</i> is trainin’ <i>Kuga</i>?” Anviet repeated, furrowing his brow as he walked right up to Mushiki. “…You know where the medical buildin’ is, right? You’d better not waste any time if you need ’em to reattach a limb or somethin’,” he added under his breath.</p>

    <p class="TX">The look in his eyes remained as harsh as ever, and his manner of speech was equally unrefined, but he evidently did care about Mushiki’s well-being.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. Though he was often misunderstood on account of his appearance and attitude, Anviet Svarner was one of the most levelheaded and reliable individuals at the Garden.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What makes you think I’m gonna hurt him?!” Ruri demanded at the top of her lungs, having apparently overheard.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet fixed a glare on her. “Eh? You’ve been gearin’ up to fight him since his first class! And you keep badgerin’ him to give up on becomin’ a mage every chance you get. Sounds like you’ll do whatever it takes, even if it means cuttin’ off one or two limbs! Or have I got the wrong end of the stick here?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s…true. But still!”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 18. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_18" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Oh…” Mushiki sighed, deflated.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I suspected as much,” Kuroe added.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri let out a defensive huff. “Th-that was a long time ago! And it would only have been a last resort<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! I’d have put you back together right away!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“You <i>were</i> willing to do it, though…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“So you <i>would</i> have gone through with it. I see.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I told you<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>! I mean, it’s not <i>entirely</i> untrue, but it’s not like that!” Indignant, Ruri raked a hand through her hair, only to shoot a glare at him. “Anyway! I’m not gonna do that now! I’m serious about training you! Okay?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I don’t think <i>okay</i> is gonna cut it this time,” Anviet murmured awkwardly. “Well, if you’ve had a change of heart, that’ll have to do. If Kuga’s game, it ain’t my place to butt in. And I guess with Kuozaki’s attendant here, you won’t be able to go <i>too</i> overboard, eh?” he said with a shrug.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri pursed her lips disapprovingly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“What brings you to the training grounds, Mr. Anviet?” Mushiki asked in an effort to change the topic.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm? Ah…” Anviet peered into each of their faces in turn, as if suddenly remembering something. “I guess you kids will do. You got a minute? I need to take care of a little business on the <i>outside</i>. I’m lookin’ for someone to gimme some help.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“On the <i>outside</i>?” Kuroe repeated.</p>

    <p class="TX">In short, he meant beyond the safety of the Garden.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yeah. That good-for-nothin’ Erulka asked me to fetch the catalyst for some potion she ordered. Sounds like it’s gotta be handled only by A-level mages or higher.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“For Ms. Erulka? I thought she got regular deliveries every month?” Ruri asked suspiciously.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Apparently, the only A-level mage runnin’ deliveries has been stealin’ goods behind everyone’s backs.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Oh…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“They’re lookin’ for a replacement, but we’re gonna have to pick up <span aria-label=" Page 19. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_19" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>urgent items ourselves for a while. Talk about a pain in the ass.” Anviet murmured that last part under his breath, shrugging in resignation.</p>

    <p class="TX">He was always one to grumble and complain, but it was very much in character for him that he had ultimately agreed to help out.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I understand the situation. In that case, I’ll tag along. That okay with you, Mushiki, Kuroe?” Ruri asked, glancing across at them.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes.” Kuroe nodded. “This will be a valuable experience for Mushiki and me.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Do whatever you want. But I’ve got one condition,” Anviet added.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…A condition?” Mushiki repeated.</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet stared deep into his soul. “Do I have to spell it out<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? You’ve gotta write a permission request form for off-campus activities.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes, Anviet Svarner was nothing if not meticulous.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">Whoever came up with the term <i>concrete jungle</i> had a true knack for language, the girl thought vaguely as she dashed through the dense collection of towering structures.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hah…hah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">The asphalt roads were easier to run across than mud, but other than that, there was very little to distinguish city and forest. Buildings and trees seemed much the same when they drifted in and out of the corner of your vision, and as for dangerous animals and wildlife—well, they existed in both environments. There might have been a difference when it came to their overall numbers, but even here, she was still being relentlessly pursued.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Over there!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“The other side of the road!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“After her! Don’t let her escape!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Amid the hustle and bustle of the city, faint voices sounded behind her in the distance.</p>

    <p class="TX">The girl sped onto the paved footpath, then bolted down a narrow side street.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hah…hah…hah…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 20. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_20" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>With her long blond hair trailing behind her and the hems of her dirt-stained clothes swaying with her every movement, she tore a clear, unwavering path ahead, kicking away plastic wrappers and garbage bags that she didn’t have the luxury of avoiding in her way.</p>

    <p class="TX">Her lungs constricted with each step, forcing her breath raggedly from her throat. Her limbs creaked with every step, her chest felt numb, and to top it all off, her head was spinning.</p>

    <p class="TX">It was like her life force was slowly ebbing away every time she exhaled.</p>

    <p class="TX">But she couldn’t stop. She couldn’t stop. If she did, she knew that she would be incapacitated for the longest while.</p>

    <p class="TX">Her pursuers wouldn’t kill her, or devour her, either. That she knew.</p>

    <p class="TX">No. If they captured her, they would provide her with a warm room, offer her fine clothes and food, and treat her with every courtesy.</p>

    <p class="TX">But in exchange, she would never see the outside world again. Her trackers would keep her under guard, boxed in and sheltered from the outside world in a very literal sense. In fact, this was the first time in months that she had even been able to catch a glimpse of the sky.</p>

    <p class="TX">It was no exaggeration to say that this escape attempt would be her last chance. If she was captured again, she would no doubt be kept underground. That, or on some remote island.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hah…hah…”</p>

    <p class="TX">She emerged from an alleyway onto a wide street, where the passersby gave her strange looks.</p>

    <p class="TX">But the girl neither clung to these strangers nor begged them for help.</p>

    <p class="TX">It wasn’t out of pride or concern over endangering their lives. Simply put, it was pointless reaching out to normal people.</p>

    <p class="TX">After all, her pursuers were anything but normal. No passerby, whether a pedestrian or an armed police officer, would be able to stand against them.</p>

    <p class="TX">And so the girl ran.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 21. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_21" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Always following the soft voice in her head—forever yearning to reach her beloved’s side.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">After leaving the Garden, it was a thirty-minute drive to their destination.</p>

    <p class="TX">Once they’d reached the sparsely populated area on the outskirts of the city, Anviet parked the car and cut the engine.</p>

    <p class="TX">“We walk from here. Get out,” he said, unbuckling his seat belt and stepping out from the driver’s seat.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki, Ruri, and Kuroe followed suit.</p>

    <p class="TX">The vehicle was the property of the Garden, a white hybrid car of the sort that could be found anywhere in Japan. It was so inconspicuous, in fact, that if they were to leave it in a busy parking lot, they might never see it again.</p>

    <p class="TX">That, however, was precisely the point. Modern-day mages valued privacy more than anything, and the vehicle’s design, which stood out as little as possible, was perfect cover.</p>

    <p class="TX">Incidentally, Anviet’s own car, parked at the edge of the Garden’s parking lot, was a flashy open-top convertible that one could spot from a mile away. In their private lives, well, mages were free to do as they wished.</p>

    <p class="TX">“This way,” Anviet growled as he took the lead.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki and the others followed along behind him.</p>

    <p class="TX">“There’s someone <i>here</i> who sells potion catalysts?” he muttered to himself while inspecting his surroundings.</p>

    <p class="TX">It was a remarkably ordinary town. Convenience stores, chain restaurants, bookshops—not a single thing to raise one’s suspicions.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Didn’t you hear me? Just keep walkin’. It ain’t like what you’re probably expectin’. It’s behind a ward to keep outsiders from wanderin’ in,” Anviet said as he strode confidently down a narrow alley.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Have you been here before?” Mushiki asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh? Ah… Well, Erulka seems to think I’m some kind of jack-of-all-trades or somethin’. Damn her. Always actin’ like I’ve got nothin’ better to do with my time…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 22. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_22" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>No doubt Erulka trusted Anviet to do whatever she asked of him, but even Mushiki knew better than to say as much out loud.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Never heard of a mage courier stealin’ goods before, though. Must’ve been pretty good, too, if they got to A-level. What an idiot.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Stealing goods<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Does that mean they’re selling them somewhere for profit?” Mushiki asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">That question had been on his mind for a while now. He didn’t know exactly what a potion catalyst was, but surely only a mage would know its true value.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ain’t nobody told me what’s goin’ on… But my guess is it’d be those strays.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Strays?” Mushiki tilted his head to one side in confusion.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri, walking alongside him, stepped in to explain, “People who have picked up some degree of magic skill at a mage-training school but who ended up dropping out, people who mastered magic outside one of the schools, mages who ran away from a fight with an annihilation factor—they come from all sorts of backgrounds, but they’re basically mages who don’t fight annihilation factors and don’t go back to living ordinary lives, either. They use the magic they’ve learned for their own personal gain.” She made no effort to conceal the disdain in her voice. “Some traditionalist mages devote themselves to study and learning…but most others are pretty much scum. They get up to all sorts of illegal stuff, and they can be a real headache,” she finished with a snort, crossing her arms in indignation.</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri, serious by nature, wasn’t one to mince words. Clearly, she couldn’t tolerate the existence of people who had acquired powers beyond human understanding, as she had, yet didn’t take on the same responsibilities to be a bulwark against evil.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Well, it kinda sounds like you’ve got a bone to pick with ’em, but that’s pretty much it. We’re not actively huntin’ ’em, but we’ve been authorized to take ’em down if we have to. So if we end up bumpin’ into any…” Having said that much, Anviet suddenly trailed off.</p>

    <p class="TX">Though this puzzled Mushiki for a moment, it didn’t take him long to piece together why Anviet had gone quiet.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 23. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_23" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Just before the older man could round the next corner, a small shadow leaped out and sped forward to collide with him.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Kyargh<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">The figure cried out sharply, falling flat on their behind.</p>

    <p class="TX">It was a small girl, probably around ten years old, with long golden hair glimmering in the sunlight.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Phew. Sorry ’bout that. You okay?” Anviet crouched down to reach out to her.</p>

    <p class="TX">The girl, however, merely stared back wide-eyed in astonishment, her shoulders heaving as she peered into his face.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hey, you’re scaring her, Anviet!” Ruri interrupted.</p>

    <p class="TX">“It <i>was</i> rather ruthless of you to push her to the ground and then glare at her like that,” Kuroe added.</p>

    <p class="TX">“You lot<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” Anviet growled.</p>

    <p class="TX">He soon broke into a frown, however, narrowing his eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">He must have noticed it, too; the girl’s appearance was clearly out of the ordinary.</p>

    <p class="TX">Her beautiful blond hair was disheveled, and there were scratches on her hands and cheeks. Her clothes were unmistakably of the finest quality, but they were stained in places and riddled with holes, as though they had kept getting snagged on obstacles.</p>

    <p class="TX">On closer inspection, it didn’t look like she was trembling out of fear of Anviet. No, she’d been quiet all this time because she was simply struggling to get her breathing under control.</p>

    <p class="TX">And then there were her feet. She wasn’t wearing any shoes, and the soles of her pale feet were stained with dirt and blood. All in all, she looked as if she’d been desperately trying to flee something.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment, another shadow appeared in the direction she had come from, prompting Mushiki to tense up.</p>

    <p class="TX">There was a group of five men in black suits. They noticed Mushiki and the others, then stopped in their tracks and exchanged meaningful glances.</p>

    <p class="TX">A few seconds later, one of them—their representative perhaps—stepped forward.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 24. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_24" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Milady,” he began in a gentle voice, holding out his hand. “Let us take you back to the estate. The master is worried about you.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki’s eyes snapped open at this unexpected development.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Eh? Who the hell are you guys?” Anviet, no less suspicious than before, quickly rose to his feet.</p>

    <p class="TX">In response, the group’s leader offered a respectful bow. “My apologies for disturbing you. We are in the service of a certain gentleman and were chasing the young lady there after she ran away from home… If you’re unhappy with something, milady, we can bring it up with the master on your behalf. Please, don’t make a scene,” he appealed to her, his expression troubled.</p>

    <p class="TX">As if to gauge her reaction, Anviet stared down at the girl, who was still trembling at his feet.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Help…me<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” she begged in a gravelly voice, her shoulders heaving.</p>

    <p class="TX">At this, Anviet turned his gaze back to the group of men while he rose to his feet, as if leaping to the girl’s defense.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Fuyajoh. Take care of her, wouldja?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Of course. Just don’t go overboard,” Ruri answered, crouching down next to the girl.</p>

    <p class="TX">Like Anviet, she was also a Knight of the Garden—she knew what needed to be done.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hmm.” The leader of the opposing group heaved a sigh of resignation at this latest development.</p>

    <p class="TX">In a marked shift from his previous tone, his next words were filled with unbridled hostility: “Don’t try to be a hero. There’s no need for you to get hurt. All we want is the girl. So why don’t you just turn around and pretend you didn’t see anything?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hah! So this is your true face? You’re happy to gang up on a little girl, but now that the grown-ups have come out to play, you’re scared stiff.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What did you just say?” the man asked, visibly twitching.</p>

    <p class="TX">The tension was palpable, and things were ready to blow at a moment’s notice.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Sounds like we’re going to have to drum it into you…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 25. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_25" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>It was the man who moved first. He poured all his strength into his body and lashed out with his fists.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Haaah!” he bellowed, a glowing pattern appearing over his hand and unleashing an invisible shockwave.</p>

    <p class="TX">The blast ricocheted off the walls of the nearby buildings, sending debris all over the place.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet gazed dubiously at the wreckage.</p>

    <p class="TX">Even Mushiki raised an eyebrow. “Kuroe? Was that—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes. Magic—a first substantiation,” she returned with serene composure.</p>

    <p class="TX">The man across from them couldn’t possibly have overheard their conversation, but he broke into a triumphant laugh regardless.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ha-ha-ha! How’s <i>that</i>?! There are things in this world the likes of you can’t possibly hope to match! And next time, I won’t miss! I’ll drill it into that thick skull of yours. So be a good boy and back off, or we’ll—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? I’m guessin’ you all are strays, then?” Anviet interrupted, unperturbed. “That makes this a whole lot easier.”</p>

    <p class="TX">The group’s leader pulled a disbelieving face, when…</p>

    <p class="TX">“What—?”</p>

    <p class="TX">The briefest possible flash of light crossed Mushiki’s vision, and the man collapsed right where he had been standing.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Huh?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What the<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">A moment later, the other four men cried out in panic.</p>

    <p class="TX">A few more seconds after that, they finally noticed it.</p>

    <p class="TX">“That’s a world crest<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” one of them shouted, pointing across at Anviet. “Is that guy a mage?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. A brilliantly radiant halo-like golden crest was now shining brightly atop Anviet’s back.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then another man raised a trembling hand in further realization. “H-hold on. That halo on his back… Is that Anviet Svarner, the Thunder Emperor<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 26. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_26" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“What<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">No sooner had they uttered that name than unease spread among the remaining men. Anviet, it seemed, had a reputation among stray mages.</p>

    <p class="TX">The title also caught Mushiki’s attention. Before he knew it, he was looking at Anviet again.</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>“Thunder Emperor?”</i> he repeated.</p>

    <p class="TX">“So cool,” Ruri exclaimed.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Did you come up with that yourself?” Kuroe asked flatly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Shuddup! Don’t get the wrong idea!” Anviet glared back at them, sounding annoyed and embarrassed in equal measure.</p>

    <p class="TX">All the while, the opposing men were contorting their faces in raw terror.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Wh-what should we do<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? We won’t stand a chance against an S-class opponent from the Garden<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“But you heard the boss! If we let his lucky charm run off, he’ll kill us<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“D-damn it… I’m gonna chance it! You—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Why don’t you give it a rest?” Anviet grumbled, before locking his fingers together.</p>

    <p class="TX">The next moment, an electric spark shot out from his hand, knocking the four men out cold.</p>

    <p class="TX">Only after making sure that they were well and truly unconscious did Anviet deactivate his world crest.</p>

    <p class="TX">“They shouldn’t be wakin’ up for a while. Karasuma, call the Garden and get ’em to send someone to pick these guys up.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Understood,” she answered, pulling out her cell phone.</p>

    <p class="TX">Meanwhile, Anviet approached the girl. “…So? Who are you? Why were those guys chasin’ after you?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Do you<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” the girl uttered in the smallest of voices. “Do you want to hug Sue<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Huh?” Anviet stared back, his eyes wide.</p>

    <p class="TX">With that, the girl rose to her feet and wrapped her arms around his body.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 27. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_27" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“H-hey! Whaddaya doin’?” Anviet asked with a suspicious frown.</p>

    <p class="TX">Deeply moved, the girl poured all her strength into the hug, before calling out in a faltering voice:</p>

    <div class="LI_SB"></div>

    <p class="TX">“You…you’ve been looking for Sue all this time, haven’t you<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Papa.”</p>

    <div class="LI_SB"></div>

    <p class="TX">Yes, that was what she said.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hah?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Haaahhh?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">All four of them cried out in surprise.</p>
