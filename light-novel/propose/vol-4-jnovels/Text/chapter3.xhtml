    <p class="COTX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet Svarner wore a dour look as he made his way across the grounds of the Garden.</p>

    <p class="TX">The reason was simple—the students and teachers passing him were all either staring curiously at him or whispering furtively among themselves.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hey, is that<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yep. Have you heard the rumors<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Whoa… I’m floored.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I thought Mr. Anvi was proper about these things, you know?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Stories about him were spreading like wildfire, especially among the female students. They were trying to keep their voices down, but Anviet could hear them all clearly enough.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Eeek?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">He fixed the nearest group with a stare, raising an eyebrow.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Whoa…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Uh-oh…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Trembling, the girls promptly spun around and fled the scene. The other students nearby similarly beat a quick escape, fearing that they, too, might become the subject of Anviet’s ire.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 30. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_30" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Tch…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Glaring at them, Anviet clicked his tongue in irritation.</p>

    <p class="TX">He had no intention of chasing after them, nor of confronting them directly, either. He understood full well that they bore him no ill will. Besides, even if he did try setting the matter straight with them, he would have the same problem with other students unless he addressed the root cause.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">He came to an abrupt halt, then spun around to face that very <i>root cause</i>.</p>

    <p class="TX">There, standing close behind him, was a small girl.</p>

    <p class="TX">She was petite with an adorable face. Though she had on a new outfit, and her hair was neatly tied up, there could be no mistaking that she was the same girl whom Anviet and the others had rescued on the <i>outside</i>.</p>

    <p class="TX">On top of that—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh? Are you<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">The girl stared back into Anviet’s eyes, not the slightest bit intimidated.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Geez.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Do you want to pat Sue’s head, Papa<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“It’s okay. You don’t have to hold back… Sue understands. You want to show your long-lost daughter how much you love her. Because there’s a unique bond between parent and child.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I told you! I don’t know you or anyone like you!” he screamed, unable to hold back.</p>

    <p class="TX">Yes. <i>This</i> was why Anviet had gotten a bad rap over the past few days.</p>

    <p class="TX">The girl, however, merely stared back at him, dumbfounded.</p>

    <p class="TX"><i>She</i> said nothing, but that didn’t stop a fresh round of whispers from kicking into gear all around them.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Talk about low…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I feel sorry for his daughter…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I’m sure there’s a lot of kids like that out there…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 31. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_31" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“I heard that, you punks!” Anviet shouted angrily, sending the next group of students scattering.</p>

    <p class="TX">The girl watched this, and a hint of worry crept into her voice. “Are you okay<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Whose fault do you think this is<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“You won’t pat Sue’s head<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” the girl asked, leaning forward to place herself within easy reach.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Gently ruffling her hair, Anviet thought back to the events of a few days ago—to the immediate aftermath of his encounter with the stray mages.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB1"></div>

    <p class="TX1"><i>“…Papa?”</i> Anviet repeated, grimacing in the face of the girl’s sudden remark.</p>

    <p class="TX">It wasn’t that he was uncomfortable. He simply couldn’t wrap his head around what she was saying.</p>

    <p class="TX">First of all, he didn’t have any children. Second, she was simply too different from him in terms of build and appearance to be his daughter. It was hard to imagine that they could share any genetic relationship.</p>

    <p class="TX">…Or at least it should have been.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh? I didn’t you know you had a daughter, Mr. Anviet.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“You left her on the <i>outside</i>? If that’s not neglect, I don’t know what is.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I never thought you were the type to do something like this.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki, Ruri, and Kuroe all spoke out against him in turn.</p>

    <p class="TX">“You lot<span class="ellipse_comma">…</span>,” he growled.</p>

    <p class="TX">“We’re kidding,” Ruri responded for the three of them before crouching down until she could meet the girl at eye level. “Hello. You’re all right now. My name is Ruri Fuyajoh. What’s yours?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Surya,” she answered in a small voice.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Surya,” Ruri repeated with an understanding nod. “Do you know the people who were chasing after you?”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 32. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_32" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The girl—Surya—took one glance at the fallen men and then gave her head a strong shake. “No… But I’ve been locked inside for ages…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“You were confined<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?” Ruri asked with suspicion.</p>

    <p class="TX">Surya gave her a weak nod. “Today…I heard we were moving, so they let me outside. I ran off while they weren’t looking…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…I see. You did great,” Ruri said, patting her on the head and glancing across at Kuroe. “What do you think?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…It’s too early to say for sure, but stray mages often engage in organized crime. Their objectives are seldom savory,” Kuroe answered in a roundabout manner.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Right. I thought as much…” Ruri breathed a heavy sigh. “Well, Surya. Can you tell us where you live? Where are your mom and dad?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“My home<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? I don’t know… My papa…” She glanced up at Anviet.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I told you, I’ve never seen you before.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Does this man look like your papa?” Ruri asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">Surya shook her head. “No, he doesn’t <i>look</i> like him… Sue’s name is Surya Svarner. Anviet Svarner is my papa. I’ve always… I’ve always wanted to meet him.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hah<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?! Whaaat?!” Anviet exclaimed, taken aback by the sincerity in the girl’s voice and gaze.</p>

    <p class="TX">There was nothing to suggest that she was lying or trying to deceive them. No, by all appearances, she wholeheartedly believed that Anviet truly was her father.</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki and the others must have come to the same conclusion, turning to him once more.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mr. Anviet<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Are you <i>sure</i> you don’t remember?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“This isn’t the result of a night on the town, is it?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I told you, no!” he cried out in response to their suspicious stares.</p>

    <p class="TX">“But her name…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“You heard how surprised those other guys were to see me, right?! Besides, look at her! It’s clear we’re not related!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Maybe she takes after her mother?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah…”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 33. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_33" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“A blond-haired beauty… The plot thickens.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Cut it out<span class="ellipse_exclamatory">…</span>!” Anviet growled, blood vessels throbbing on his forehead.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe brought her hands together with a loud clap. “In any event, we can’t stay here forever. For now, let’s leave the situation here to the Garden’s cleanup team and head back to base. I know it will be a hassle coming here twice, but Knight Erulka’s request can wait until after we see to Surya.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ah… Wait a sec. You ain’t plannin’ on bringin’ her with us, are you?” Anviet asked, startled.</p>

    <p class="TX">Kuroe tilted her head to one side as if the answer was obvious. “We must take her into our custody until we can definitively identify her. So long as we erase her memories afterward, there shouldn’t be a problem. Or are you suggesting that we simply leave her here?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Tch…” Anviet grimaced. “Have it your way. <i>I’m</i> opposed to this,” he declared, turning heel.</p>

    <p class="TX">But at that moment, he felt a tug on his shirt. Glancing back, he found Surya clutching it tightly, her gaze unwavering.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Papa, do you…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Do you want to carry Sue in your arms<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hah?” he stammered, at a loss for words.</p>

    <p class="TX">Surya, however, continued to stare at him, not once breaking eye contact.</p>

    <p class="TX">Seeing this, Ruri and Kuroe voiced their thoughts.</p>

    <p class="TX">“So that’s it.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Why didn’t you say so earlier?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Eh?! What’re you two blabberin’ about?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Oh. I’m sorry,” Surya apologized, shrinking back at his outburst.</p>

    <p class="TX">For some reason, Anviet’s voice caught in his throat.</p>

    <p class="TX">“No, I mean, I didn’t…”</p>

    <p class="TX">And yet—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Not in your arms… On your back, then?” Surya asked shyly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">He nearly flinched before her keen, pleading gaze.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 34. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_34" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Resigned to his fate, Anviet crouched down and let her climb onto his back.</p>

    <div class="LI_SB"></div>

    <p class="TX">Which brings us back to the present…</p>

    <p class="TX">It had been decided that Surya would stay at the Garden temporarily until both her identity and her relationship with the stray mages who had been pursuing her could be confirmed.</p>

    <p class="TX">The Garden was equipped with a shelter that was built specifically for victims of annihilation factors.</p>

    <p class="TX">So long as an annihilation factor could be defeated within the window for reversible annihilation, the damage caused could be reversed, as though it had never happened. On the flip side, however, any effects that occurred outside that window were recorded permanently in the history of the world. In short, this meant that there was always a possibility that innocent bystanders might sustain injuries beyond the purview of traditional medicine and that children might lose their parents before their time.</p>

    <p class="TX">The shelter’s purpose was to protect and treat such victims before finally wiping their memories of their stay in the Garden and returning them to the outside world. That being said, there were always cases when an individual possessed of outstanding talent might be discovered. In that case, they could be brought into the Garden as a novice mage.</p>

    <p class="TX">Regardless, the plan had been to put Surya in the care of the shelter and its staff. And yet—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Papa? Maybe you want to praise Sue<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet had no idea how she had managed to get out, but the next thing he knew, Surya had popped up by his side and started following him around.</p>

    <p class="TX">On the first few occasions this happened, he would contact the shelter and ask the staff to take her back—but no matter how many times she was returned to the facility, she kept reappearing when he least expected it. Eventually, it reached a point where even the employees at the shelter gave up, deciding to let Anviet take care of Surya himself.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 35. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_35" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>If anything, the fact that she kept addressing him as <i>Papa</i> seemed to have convinced everyone that she really was his daughter. Whenever he called one of the staff to take her off his hands, they would shoot him a death glare, all but saying, <i>How could you abandon your own child?</i> or <i>Such an irresponsible parent</i> or <i>So cruel…</i></p>

    <p class="TX">As a result of all this, the Garden was now home to a teacher bringing a child to work.</p>

    <p class="TX">But of course, Anviet could hardly <i>work</i> under these circumstances.</p>

    <p class="TX">And so, as the bell tolled on the campus grounds, Anviet turned to face Surya.</p>

    <p class="TX">“<i>Why</i> would I be praisin’ you<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? It’s up to you whether or not you go back to the shelter, but don’t get in the way of my job.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mm-hmm.” She nodded in response.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Tch.”</p>

    <p class="TX">He hadn’t done anything wrong, but for some reason, he was struck by a wave of gnawing guilt.</p>

    <p class="TX">But he couldn’t dawdle forever. He had to prepare for his next class, which meant continuing on his way.</p>

    <p class="TX">Naturally, Surya trailed behind him.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I meant to say, <i>Don’t follow me!</i>” he bellowed, unable to take it anymore.</p>

    <p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="TX1">“There’s one other thing I’d like to check, Madam Witch,” Ruri began in a serious tone just before fifth period could get underway.</p>

    <p class="TX">This course was practical training—in other words, a chance for students to use and develop their real-life magic skills. As such, the students had already changed into their tracksuits before gathering in the training area. Ruri and Mushiki were no exception.</p>

    <p class="TX">As might be surmised from Ruri’s tone of voice, Mushiki was presently in his Saika Kuozaki form. He and Kuroe hadn’t decided on a set schedule as such, but they had agreed that he should attend class in both of his separate guises on a regular basis.</p>

    <p class="TX">Simply put, it wouldn’t do for either Mushiki or Saika to remain out <span aria-label=" Page 36. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_36" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>of sight for a long period of time. On top of that, Kuroe maintained that he had to learn how best to use both bodies…</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmm? Do tell, Ruri.” Mushiki gestured in Saika’s tone of voice.</p>

    <p class="TX">Crucially, Ruri was convinced that when Mushiki was in his Saika form, she was actually talking to the real Saika. He couldn’t afford to let slip that he was still himself inside.</p>

    <p class="TX">You might think that since he hadn’t been caught yet, he was in safe territory—but Mushiki wasn’t. After all, he was facing Ruri Fuyajoh here, the first member of the (unofficial) Saika Kuozaki fan club. Moreover, she knew that he and Saika had been fused into a single entity. Under these circumstances, even the slightest mistake could prove fatal.</p>

    <p class="TX">As if grappling with the same concerns, Ruri continued in a hushed voice, “You <i>are</i> Madam Witch inside and out, aren’t you? Mushiki’s consciousness is, like, submerged, right?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Why are you asking me that now?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Though taken aback by this sudden question, Mushiki did his utmost to conceal his disquiet.</p>

    <p class="TX">“I—I didn’t mean to…” Ruri shook her head in a fluster. “I don’t doubt you, I swear. It’s just…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Just?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“If there’s even the slightest chance that he’s awake in there…he might have seen you getting changed, or even taking a bath… If that happened, I’d be so jealous that I could never forgive him.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki broke into a cold sweat.</p>

    <p class="TX">Thankfully, someone else answered Ruri’s question in his place.</p>

    <p class="TX">“You needn’t worry about that. As Lady Saika’s attendant, I’ve made doubly sure.”</p>

    <p class="TX">That someone, of course, was Kuroe. Like the other students, she was dressed in a sports tracksuit.</p>

    <p class="TX">“R-right. That’s good, then.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes. If we weren’t one hundred percent confident, I would not be able to relax, either. Mushiki may be a levelheaded young man, but he <span aria-label=" Page 37. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_37" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>is still a high schooler, with a high schooler’s appetites. This time of his life is no doubt the peak of his interest in the female form. If he happened to awaken inside Lady Saika’s body…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Yes<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Well, he would undoubtedly fondle her breasts, at the very least.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Muuushiiikiii!” Ruri cried out in indignation, prompting her classmates a short distance away to flinch in shock.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Um… Actually…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Naturally, Mushiki wanted to stand up for himself—but all he could do was mince his words.</p>

    <p class="TX">If he tried to defend himself, he might succeed only in arousing further suspicion. Besides, he guiltily recalled that he <i>had</i> fondled Saika’s breasts on one occasion, though only because he had woken up in her body without comprehending how or what had happened to him.</p>

    <p class="TX">That was the first and last time he had touched them, except when otherwise absolutely necessary. Since realizing that their bodies were fused, he had been doing his absolute best to respect her personal dignity…disregarding his sleeping posture, that was.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Calm yourself, Ruri. I’m only talking about a hypothetical situation in the case that Mushiki was still partially conscious. Please be assured that you needn’t worry on that account. Isn’t that right, Lady Saika?” Kuroe asked, turning his way.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Of course.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Her flat gaze was no doubt meant as a warning…but he couldn’t fail to notice a hint of amusement in her eyes.</p>

    <p class="TX">It seemed she was teasing both Ruri <i>and</i> him. Frankly, that made him a little nervous.</p>

    <p class="TX">A second later, the bell rang throughout to announce the beginning of their practice class.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh? Is it already time?” Kuroe sat up straight.</p>

    <p class="TX">She and the rest of the students quickly rose to their feet in preparation for the teacher’s arrival.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then, with perfect timing, a tall figure appeared by the entrance to the training hall.</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 38. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_38" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>However—</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Hmm?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki broke into a surprised frown.</p>

    <p class="TX">It wasn’t just him. Ruri and the rest of the students were similarly bewildered.</p>

    <p class="TX">But that was to be expected. After all, a petite girl wearing a cute little backpack was tugging at Anviet’s hand.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mr. Anviet…is that<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“The girl everyone’s talking about<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Huh? What girl?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“You haven’t heard? Everyone’s saying Mr. Anvi has an illegitimate child, and—”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Hmph!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet let out a loud, feigned cough to quiet the gossiping students as he shot them all a fierce glare.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Shuddup, you hear<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? I don’t want any chitchat, got it? If you’ve got that much energy to spare, I can whip up a special trainin’ regimen for you. You want that?!” Anviet’s voice dripped with menace.</p>

    <p class="TX">Although he was renowned for his coarse language and aggressive behavior, today Anviet was even more intimidating than usual. Like a wounded beast, almost. He was single-mindedly determined not to let himself become the subject of any classroom conversation.</p>

    <p class="TX">Presented with such a foreboding S-class mage, any regular student would have no choice but to fall silent. Naturally, everyone remained immensely curious about the girl, but they couldn’t risk expressing those thoughts out loud.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Conversation is one thing, but just what kind of class do you think you’re bringing your daughter to here?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Ruri, however, was also an S-class mage, so she was under no obligation to hold back, casually voicing a question that was undoubtedly on everyone’s mind.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Ngh… I told you, she’s not my kid!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Then why did you bring her here<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“I didn’t! She followed me!”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 39. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_39" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Then why are you holding her hand<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Because if I didn’t, she would’ve fallen over, damn it!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“What about the backpack, then<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“You think I can leave her in the trainin’ hall with nothin’ to do for a whole hour?!” Anviet shouted in exasperation.</p>

    <p class="TX">With that, he pulled a vinyl picnic blanket with a cute character design on it from the backpack and laid it on the ground in a shady corner of the training grounds.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then he sat Surya down, placed a hat on her head, and pulled a water bottle and a bag of snacks from her backpack, arranging them beside her.</p>

    <p class="TX">Only then did he fix her with a menacing glower.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Listen up, you little brat. Keep outta my way. Got that?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mm-hmm.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Drink plenty of water!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mm-hmm.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“You’ve just had lunch, so don’t dive straight into your snacks, you hear?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Mm-hmm.”</p>

    <p class="TX">Surya nodded along to Anviet’s every word. She didn’t come across as afraid in the slightest—rather, she seemed somewhat pleased.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…You’re <i>sure</i> she isn’t your daughter?” Ruri asked uncertainly.</p>

    <p class="TX">“How many times do I gotta say it?!” Anviet roared—but as forceful as his voice was, it was completely unpersuasive.</p>

    <p class="TX">As if to drive the impression home, Surya tugged softly on Anviet’s shirt.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Papa? Papa?” she asked.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…What? I thought I told you not to interrupt my class.”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Maybe you want to take Sue to the bathroom?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">Anviet glanced across at the students, hesitation flickering through his eyes before he stamped it down and fixed them all with a powerful glare.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…Get into pairs! Start your warm-ups! After that, three laps around the track! Well?! Get movin’!”</p>

    <p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 40. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_40" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>With those instructions, he took Surya under his arm and bolted back to the entrance.</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“…”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Lady Saika?”</p>

    <p class="TX">“Y-yes?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Amid the group of thunderstruck students, Kuroe and Mushiki started their warm-up exercises.</p>

    <p class="TX1">Three days later, Surya was still following Anviet around, always calling out, “Papa! Papa!”</p>

    <p class="TX">Despite his foul mouth, Anviet was earnest and considerate at heart. Unable to ignore her, he continued to reluctantly see to her every need, no matter how much trouble she caused him.</p>

    <p class="TX">With the pair’s interactions occurring throughout the Garden in the public eye, people increasingly started to treat the suggestion that Surya really was Anviet’s illegitimate child less as rumor and more as established fact.</p>

    <p class="TX">Then one day after school—</p>

    <p class="TX">“Excuse me… Huh?!”</p>

    <p class="TX">As Mushiki stepped into the central school building’s staff room alongside Kuroe, his eyes shot open.</p>

    <p class="TX">Staff rooms in the Garden were larger and more spacious than those at normal schools, and they were equipped with partitions dividing them into smaller private spaces… One of them, namely the one belonging to Anviet Svarner, was a sight to behold.</p>

    <p class="TX">On his desk, he had a desktop computer, various documents and folders, and his favorite mug…along with an array of cute stuffed animals and children’s characters. The computer monitor and mouse were covered in sparkling stickers, and a portrait of Anviet drawn in an immature scribble was pasted on one of the partition walls.</p>

    <p class="TX">“Oh<span class="ellipse_questionmark">…</span>? Kuga. Karasuma. Tch. Whaddaya want?”</p>

    <p class="TX">Mushiki’s exclamation must have alerted Anviet to their arrival. Haggardly, he glanced up from his computer monitor in irritation. Mushiki took a closer look at the man and noticed faint dark circles under his eyes.</p>
