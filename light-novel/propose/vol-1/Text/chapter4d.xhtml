<p class="TX">Mushiki did worry that she was eating a little too much…but the innocent smile she flashed him brought back fond memories.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">After spending a good three hours walking a route that should have taken no more than thirty minutes without distractions, Mushiki and the others finally arrived at the park next to their destination.</p>
<p class="TX">Apart from some time spent window-shopping and taking some photo stickers at the game arcade, the trip had been largely uneventful.</p>
<p class="TX">The three of them sat side by side on a park bench sipping at some iced tea they had bought from a vending machine.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Kuroe. I was walking down an alley near here when I wound up in some strange world,” Mushiki whispered softly in her ear so Ruri wouldn’t overhear them.</p>
<p class="TX">Giving him a small nod of understanding, Kuroe quickly rose to her feet. “Ruri, I need to find a restroom. I’ll be back in a minute.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, okay. We’ll wait here, then.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Very well,” Kuroe said before glancing toward Mushiki.</p>
<p class="TX">Sensing her intentions, Mushiki decided to follow her lead. “Ah, I’ll go, too,” he said, rising from the bench.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? You too? Have you had too much tea? Are you feeling all right? Are you giving up on becoming a mage?” Ruri asked inquisitively.</p>
<p class="TX">Her obsession with him leaving the Garden had practically become a fixed tagline at the end of her sentences.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki let out a forced chuckle as he waved his hands, before taking off in the direction of the public restrooms with Kuroe by his side—and then ducking quietly into the shadows.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, a little quicker on their feet, the two of them headed toward their real destination.</p>
<p class="TX">“Is it really safe to leave Ruri like this?” Mushiki asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“It <i>is</i> a risk, but we can’t afford to let her see the scene of the crime, so it can’t be helped. Let’s wrap this up quickly so we can go back,” Kuroe answered.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 146. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_146" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Mushiki nodded as they made their way down the street.</p>
<p class="TX">It wasn’t long before the familiar alleyway opened up before him.</p>
<p class="TX">“It was around here, I believe?” Kuroe came to a stop, glancing around.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s eyes opened wide in surprise. “How did you know?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Just a hunch,” Kuroe answered as if it was a matter of course.</p>
<p class="TX">The alleyway was situated roughly halfway between his old school and his home and was most certainly the same area he had entered before getting lost in that urban labyrinth. It was a bit of a distance from the downtown area, so there weren’t any pedestrians around, only the sound of the wind rustling through the nearby trees.</p>
<p class="TX">At first glance, it looked like an ordinary alley… But maybe Kuroe had another way of scanning it that remained as of yet unknown to him.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe glanced carefully around, then slowly fell to her knees and let her fingertips graze softly against the asphalt.</p>
<p class="TX">“We will need to examine the area in detail. Mushiki, give me a hand.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Right. What do you want me to do?”</p>
<p class="TX">No sooner did he finish speaking than Kuroe stood up, her pace brisk as she pushed him against a nearby wall.</p>
<p class="TX">“Um, Kuroe…? Are you…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Precisely. Once you’ve changed into Lady Saika’s form, disperse the magical energy around you. With that catalyst, you can check for any remaining traces that were left behind on the same wavelength. That should help us to zero in on any traces of the fourth substantiation used at the time.”</p>
<p class="TX">“But there must have been all kinds of comings and goings here since then… Besides, Ruri is waiting for us, and once I transform, it isn’t exactly easy to change back.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t worry about that. You’re remarkably simple to deal with.”</p>
<p class="TX">“How rude.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 147. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_147" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“No more grumbling, please. Open your mouth. I’ll turn you into a girl.”</p>
<p class="TX">“That could be easily misconstrued—<i>ngh…</i>”</p>
<p class="TX">Before he could finish his sentence, Kuroe pulled him down by the collar and initiated a forceful kiss.</p>
<p class="TX">All at once, a warmth took hold of his body, his skin radiating a faint glow… And with that, he became Saika. The clothes he was wearing, being woven from spirit thread, likewise adjusted to a women’s fit.</p>
<p class="TX">“The Witch of Resplendent Color, Saika Kuozaki, will descend upon the world tonight,” Mushiki said.</p>
<p class="TX">“…What kind of embarrassing quip is that?” Kuroe asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“I—I just thought it would be cool to have a catchphrase or something.”</p>
<p class="TX">“There’s no need… Now, let’s get started. Stand in the middle of the road here.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Right. Um… How do I disperse the magical energy, though?”</p>
<p class="TX">“As I’ve told you before, you have yet to bring your powers under control, Mushiki, and are constantly releasing small amounts of magical energy. It will be enough for you just to stand right there as you are. Just try not to do anything unnecessary. We wouldn’t want a repeat of what happened in the classroom the other day.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm,” he murmured as he approached the designated spot, adopting a fancy model-like pose.</p>
<p class="TX">“Standing normally will be fine,” Kuroe said flatly.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? But—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Normal will be fine.”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s shoulders slumped in disappointment. <i>He</i> had thought it would look cool.</p>
<p class="TX">“In that case, let’s begin.” Kuroe raised a hand in front of her, took a deep breath, and then chanted, “First Substantiation: Eye of Inquiry.”</p>
<p class="TX">With that, a crest spread around her neck like a collar, her eyes flashing with an inner light.</p>
<p class="TX">“…! Kuroe! Is that…?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 148. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_148" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“A magical technique to analyze the composition and structure of targeted objects. I am, after all, a mage of the Garden.”</p>
<p class="TX">As she spoke, her dimly glowing eyes took in the area around her.</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">“Tra-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la… <span class="Apple_Symbols_Regular_28">♪</span>”</p>
<p class="TX">Sitting on the park bench, Ruri was humming a happy tune to herself as she shook her bottle of cold tea.</p>
<p class="TX">There was nothing unexpected about that. After all, she was out on a date with Mushiki.</p>
<p class="TX">How many years had it been since she had last gone exploring with him? This must have been their first time since she was in elementary school.</p>
<p class="TX">It wasn’t like they were doing anything important today—just walking around town, stopping to get something to eat, and doing a little shopping. However, the mere addition of a little spice to her life—Mushiki—had been enough to make everything refreshingly, irresistibly fun. In fact, she had been looking forward to this so much that she had barely been able to get any sleep the past few days since receiving his invitation.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hmm, no, wait. Calm down, calm down…,” she muttered under her breath as she shook her head.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes, it was certainly true that she was having a good time on her date with Mushiki. Still, that didn’t mean she could permit him to remain at the Garden. If she let it show just how happy she was, he might not take her objections seriously.</p>
<p class="TX">She clapped her cheeks in self-remonstration, then glanced back to the clock in the middle of the park.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? They’re taking their time…,” she muttered.</p>
<p class="TX">It would be a violation of basic etiquette to go snooping on them while they were both using the restroom, and normally, she would hardly worry about anything like this.</p>
<p class="TX">However, the fact that the two of them had both decided to go at the exact same time <i>did</i> have her a little on edge.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Th-they couldn’t…”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 149. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_149" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>At that moment, an unpleasant vision took hold of her brain.</p>
<p class="TX">She envisioned that Mushiki and Kuroe had both made their way toward the public restroom, but when the two of them were out of her sight, Kuroe licked her lips and looked at Mushiki with lewd smile.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“I’ll be back in a minute, Kuroe.”</i></p>
<p class="TX"><i>“Oh-ho-ho… Whatever are you talking about, Mushiki? We’ve finally got some time alone, just the two of us.”</i></p>
<p class="TX"><i>“Huh?! Wh-what are you doing, Kuroe?! Ruri’s just around the corner…!”</i></p>
<p class="TX"><i>“Don’t worry. I can’t stand it, watching the two of you being lovey-dovey all day. Come here. I’ll teach you what</i> real <i>pleasure feels like.”</i></p>
<p class="TX"><i>“Wha—?! Help, Ruri! Heeelp! Ruriii!”</i></p>
<p class="TX">“Damn you, Kuroe! Get your hands off my brother…!”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri’s eyes widened as she crushed the plastic bottle in her hand and took off with explosive force.</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Roughly three minutes after deploying her first substantiation, Kuroe squinted and lowered her hands.</p>
<p class="TX">In perfect sync, the crest that had appeared around her neck likewise dissipated.</p>
<p class="TX">“Did you find anything, Kuroe?” Mushiki asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Yes. I detected Lady Saika’s residual magical energy. It seems this is definitely where the incident took place. Fourth substantiation techniques are used to create their own miniature planes of existence, but they always have a starting point here in the real world.” Despite that response, her tone and expression were stiff. “However, I can’t detect any other traces of magical energy. Of course, I can sense weak amounts of mana, ubiquitous throughout the world, but nothing to suggest that a fourth substantiation was deployed…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Does that mean the perpetrator covered his tracks…? Or that they didn’t use a fourth substantiation in the first place…?” Mushiki asked.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe stroked her chin before responding. “The former, if I had to guess… It’s hard to imagine the latter situation, given the circumstances. However, it’s equally hard to imagine using enough power to <span aria-label=" Page 150. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_150" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>trigger a fourth substantiation and then erasing all trace of that… And there is something else here that is bothering me.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What’s that?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Lady Saika’s residual magical energy is unusually dense. I can only assume that she was in the midst of deploying her own fourth substantiation.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hold on; are you saying she was trying to use it against her attacker? And that whoever it was then got her and erased all evidence of the fact?”</p>
<p class="TX">“That wouldn’t be possible,” Kuroe said brusquely with a shake of her head. “If she <i>had</i> deployed her fourth substantiation, there is no way she could have lost.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Right.”</p>
<p class="TX">He thought back to his duel with Anviet, then to what had happened during the attack by the annihilation factors, and broke out in a sweat.</p>
<p class="TX">“But in that case…what on earth happened?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…That is indeed the question. There is one possibility—”</p>
<p class="TX">But at that moment—</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushikiii! Kuroeee!”</p>
<p class="TX">Behind them, from the direction of the park, came a deafening cry followed by the sound of thunderous footsteps.</p>
<p class="TX">“Is that…Ruri?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…! Madam Witch?!”</p>
<p class="TX">By the time Mushiki turned around, Ruri was already running toward him. No doubt startled to see him—or rather, Saika—she slammed on the brakes and came to a quick stop. There were faint skid marks behind her, and smoke was rising from her feet.</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s an honor to bump into you in a place like this! What are you doing out and about today, Madam Witch?!” she said with a bow.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki did his best to give her a vague smile. “A-ah. I decided to go out for a walk for a change. What brings you here, Ruri?”</p>
<p class="TX">Only then did Ruri let out a labored breath as though suddenly remembering something. “Right…! Madam Witch, have you seen my brother and Kuroe around here? I mean… Ah, you probably don’t <span aria-label=" Page 151. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_151" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>know him… Er, he’s a boy, and Kuroe looks like she’ll take advantage of him! And something about that just triggers my maternal instincts! I have to find them!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Oh… Um…?”</p>
<p class="TX">It sounded like she had come looking for the two of them. Wondering how best to answer, Mushiki looked to Kuroe—only to find she had disappeared.</p>
<p class="TX">Looking carefully, he spotted her lurking behind a fence some distance away. She must have hidden herself the second she had sensed Ruri approaching.</p>
<p class="TX">This called for an immediate decision. There was no denying that things would have been even more complicated if Kuroe, who was supposed to have gone to the bathroom, had instead been standing beside him.</p>
<p class="TX">“…” Kuroe attempted a silent gesture his way. Mushiki could only interpret it as the words <i>Brush her off</i>.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, Kuroe? I saw her a moment ago. Um…yes, I think she said something about finding a convenience store because the restroom in the park was so crowded…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…! R-really?!” Ruri exhaled loudly in relief. “So I <i>was</i> overthinking it… I was so sure of it…”</p>
<p class="TX">“So sure of what?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah! N-nothing!” Ruri shook her head, her cheeks bright red.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki glanced over at Kuroe once more. This time, her hands seemed to be saying <i>I’ll join you later, so buy us some time</i>. Apparently, she had something else she wanted to look into.</p>
<p class="TX">“Um… Ruri. If you don’t mind, how about you join me for a short while?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?! A-are you sure?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. I’m a little tired after all that walking. I was just about to take a break. But I don’t want to interrupt you if you’re busy.”</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s no interruption! P-please come this way!” Ruri seemed fearful but thankful at the same time as she motioned toward the park.</p>
<p class="TX">With that, Mushiki followed beside her as they made their way there at a slow pace.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 152. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_152" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Could you wait here a moment, please…?” Ruri said once they arrived…before spreading a handkerchief on a bench in the shade of a tree.</p>
<p class="TX">“Please, after you,” she said, gesturing.</p>
<p class="TX">“A-ah. Thank you.”</p>
<p class="TX">It was a bit too much, but he felt guilty disrespecting the hospitality she was extending to him, so he availed himself of her kindness.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, even after he took the seat on the bench, Ruri continued to stand directly in front of him.</p>
<p class="TX">Sensing her intention to wait on him, Mushiki showed her a gentle smile. “Oh-ho, do sit down, Ruri. You’ll make me feel uncomfortable doing that.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…! M-my apologies…” With a look of utmost embarrassment, she sat beside him, her back straight.</p>
<p class="TX">The depths of her respect for Saika must have been considerable, Mushiki mused. He couldn’t help but break into a smile as he watched her.</p>
<p class="TX">“Madam Witch…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh. No, it’s nothing… How have you been today? It’s unusual for you to go out and about with Kuroe, no?”</p>
<p class="TX">Needless to say, Mushiki was fully aware of the situation. However, he would have to make sure that Ruri relayed it all to Saika for the conversation to proceed smoothly, so he made a point of asking her about her day.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri blushed, scratching nervously at her cheek. “Ah… Well, to tell you the truth… Hee-hee-hee… I’m on a date with my brother…,” she said shyly.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?” He stared back wide-eyed.</p>
<p class="TX">“Is something the matter?” Ruri tilted her head.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, no. Not at all.” Mushiki shook his head in an attempt to brush his question aside.</p>
<p class="TX">The two of them had seemed to be talking at cross-purposes since morning, but to think things had gotten so misconstrued…</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah… So that’s why you looked to be having so much fun, Ruri.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Is it that obvious?! Uh-oh, this isn’t good…” With that, Ruri <span aria-label=" Page 153. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_153" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>began to rub her cheeks with her hands, as though hoping to change her facial expression.</p>
<p class="TX">“…? <i>What</i> isn’t good? If you’re enjoying yourself, you ought to let it show, no?”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, I can’t. I <i>am</i> enjoying myself… But I can’t let my brother know that.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…? Why not?” Mushiki asked.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri wore a troubled expression. “Well… While you were absent from class, we had two new transfer students join us… The first was Kuroe, and the second was Mushiki Kuga—my brother from the <i>outside</i>. I don’t know how on earth he found out about the Garden…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah… Is that so?” he answered vaguely.</p>
<p class="TX">After all, it would be unusual for the headmistress not to know about any new transfer students, and Kuroe was, after all, Saika’s own attendant. It would be best not to pretend that this was entirely new information.</p>
<p class="TX">“So I… It’s hard for me to ask this of the head of the Garden… But I really don’t want my brother to be a mage…”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hmm,” Mushiki hummed, crossing his arms. He already knew that. “Do you…dislike your brother, Ruri?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Not at all!” she cried back.</p>
<p class="TX">She immediately adopted a frightened look and shrugged. “S-sorry…”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, it’s fine. But can you tell me why?” Mushiki asked.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri looked conflicted but, making up her mind, began to speak: “It’s a simple reason. Annihilation factors are capable of destroying the whole world, and the damage they cause is enormous. It isn’t unusual for even relatively small annihilation factors to cause deaths numbering in the thousands in the blink of an eye. If they can be defeated within the window for reversible annihilation, that damage can be made like it never happened… But any mage who sees it for themselves will still be injured. And there’s no way to undo death then… I can’t lie to you, Madam Witch. As shameful as it is, that’s the honest truth. I don’t want my brother to get hurt. I don’t want to lose him. I mean—I became a mage to protect him.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 154. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_154" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…” Mushiki was at a loss for words at this confession.</p>
<p class="TX">“I know that once you’ve entered the Garden, you’ll see an annihilation factor,” Ruri continued, her gaze burning with determination. “But it can’t be too late. There <i>has</i> to be a way. If we can block his access to magic and erase his memories, he should still be able to go back to the outside world. I’m glad he followed me all the way to the Garden, but I can’t… I can’t…” She fell silent, clenching her fists tightly.</p>
<p class="TX">She seemed to stumble over her words toward the end there… But maybe that was just his imagination.</p>
<p class="TX">“I know you can’t just ignore his wishes. But I’ll make sure he accepts it. When he does, I’ll do anything for your help.” With that, she looked straight into his eyes.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki stifled his urge to speak. He felt like he was being compelled to action by Ruri’s sheer strength of will.</p>
<p class="TX">His words right now wouldn’t be those of the real Saika. He couldn’t speak for her on a matter of such importance.</p>
<p class="TX">After giving it some thought, he let out a deep sigh. “That must have been a slip of the tongue just now. Ruri…I can see you really do love your brother.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes! I do!” she replied with a brilliant smile, completely at odds with her prior demeanor.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes! What is it?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Can I hug you? Just a little?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Of course— Huh?!” Her face turned bright red as she flew into a panic.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki had spoken too quickly out of love, but he was, after all, presently inhabiting Saika’s body. Ruri’s confession just now must have hit him too strongly. With a wave of his hand, he said, “I’m sorry. Don’t worry about it. I suppose I just got a little emotional.”</p>
<p class="TX">“N-not at all…” Ruri looked relieved, but at the same time, somehow disappointed.</p>
<p class="TX">Then she suddenly jolted upright, glancing around quickly.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 155. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_155" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Ruri? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah… I just thought it’s about time those two came back… Madam Witch, please don’t tell Mushiki what I said. If he knew, I’m sure he would absolutely refuse to leave the Garden.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Ah. I won’t say anything… Not a word.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Please. Ah, and the same for Kuroe. Those two seem to be really close for some reason…” She stopped there, looking like she had suddenly remembered something. “Oh, and about Kuroe, Madam Witch… There’s something I’ve been wondering for a while now…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm? What would that be?”</p>
<p class="TX">“When exactly did you hire her?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s throat constricted in alarm at that question.</p>
<p class="TX">“What do you mean? <i>When did I hire her…?</i>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. I mean, you’ve never had an attendant before, right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…?! What…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">He realized at once it was a very un-Saika-like reaction, but for a few brief seconds, he was unable to compose himself. Fully aware that his last question made absolutely no sense spoken from Saika’s lips, he hastened to add: “Hold on a minute. Kuroe has been serving in the mansion, right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…? Was that it? I’m sorry, Madam Witch. I’ve visited countless times, but I never saw her before.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…” As he listened to her go on, Mushiki’s heart began to race.</p>
<p class="TX">He was well aware of Ruri’s earnest and persistent personality and had come to appreciate over the past few days how painfully devoted she was to Saika.</p>
<p class="TX">Which was why he couldn’t stop a certain thought from coming to mind.</p>
<p class="TX">Was it really possible that Ruri was completely unaware of Saika’s attendant, who assisted her in every aspect of life?</p>
<p class="TX">Was this simply an oversight on her part?</p>
<p class="TX">Had Saika gone to lengths to conceal Kuroe’s existence?</p>
<p class="TX">Or else…</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 156. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_156" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Several possibilities swirled through his head. With a trembling voice, he asked, “Ruri, when <i>did</i> you first learn about Kuroe?”</p>
<p class="TX">She placed her finger against her cheek as though probing her memories. “Well, the first time I saw her…was at the last regular meeting. You brought her with you to the conference room, then, right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…” Once more, Mushiki was left speechless.</p>
<p class="TX">The day of the regular meeting. He remembered it well.</p>
<p class="TX">After all, it was the very same day when he had merged with Saika and woken up in the Garden.</p>
<p class="TX">…And before that day, Ruri hadn’t so much as laid eyes on Kuroe.</p>
<p class="TX">Was that to say that Kuroe had only come to the mansion <i>after</i> he and Saika were attacked…?</p>
<p class="TX">If that was true…</p>
<p class="TX">How had she established herself in Saika’s mansion?</p>
<p class="TX">How had she seemed to know everything about his situation?</p>
<p class="TX">How was she guiding his every action?</p>
<p class="TX"><i>Who on earth was she?</i></p>
<p class="TX">“It can’t be…” Mushiki moaned as a cold premonition took root in his stomach.</p>
<p class="TX">If he said any more, there would be no going back. He understood that perfectly, but he had to ask. Already, his mouth was putting into words the worst possible scenario.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kuroe, are you—?”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, as though to cut him off midspeech, the scenery around them <i>changed</i>.</p>
<p class="TX">“What…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“…!”</p>
<p class="TX">It was a strange feeling, as though darkness was flooding the beautiful afternoon park.</p>
<p class="TX">That darkness enveloped the area instantly, and several huge structures suddenly emerged from the ground.</p>
<p class="TX">An urban labyrinth with no end in sight. A gray world comprised of iron and stone.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes, there could be no mistaking it—this was the eerie space into which Mushiki had wandered that day.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 157. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_157" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…! A fourth substantiation…?! But who could be—?!” Ruri choked on her words for a moment—but her expression quickly took on that of a warrior.</p>
<p class="TX">No doubt she had realized what this was. They had already brought it up at the general meeting a few days earlier. This was the mysterious mage who had attacked Saika.</p>
<p class="TX">“Luminous Blade!” she chanted, two lapis lazuli–colored crests glowing atop her head as a <i>naginata</i> comprised entirely of light materialized in her hand. Her second substantiation, with the rank of <i>matter</i>.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri braced herself with her sword—and as if in response to her defensive posture, several human-shaped shadows crawled out from amid the towering structures that had appeared around them.</p>
<p class="TX">When she saw this, she glowered. “Annihilation Factor No. 414: Wraith. Still, how can there be annihilation factors within a fourth substantiation…?”</p>
<p class="TX">The shadows offered no answer. They turned their unreadable countenances toward Ruri and Mushiki, then threw themselves forward in one lunge.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hah!” With a frenzied cry, Ruri lashed out with her blade of light.</p>
<p class="TX">As she moved, that weapon stretched long and thin like a thread of string.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, as if imbued with a will of its own, it fanned out in all directions, effortlessly slicing through the amassing shadows that continued to surround them.</p>
<p class="TX">Defeated, those figures faded into thin air without even having had time to let out a final gasp.</p>
<p class="TX">But even after overcoming those creatures, Ruri and Mushiki were still trapped in the gray labyrinth.</p>
<p class="TX">“Tch… Just because we stepped foot outside the Garden, <i>someone</i> thinks they can mess around with us,” Ruri said with a click of her tongue before raising her voice as though calling to someone atop the towering edifices nearby. “Whoever you are in charge of this plane, come out! A mage who’s reached their fourth substantiation ought to be capable of more than just that last stingy assault! What are you trying to achieve? Do you even know who you just attacked?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 158. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_158" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Her call echoed across the walls of the myriad buildings, like the rumbling voice of a mountain deity.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, as if in response, a soft pitter-patter of footsteps began to sound from deep within the darkness.</p>
<p class="TX">“…! Ruri!” Mushiki called out in warning.</p>
<p class="TX">“I know,” she said with a small nod, holding her <i>naginata</i> at the ready.</p>
<p class="TX">Finally, a lone figure stepped out from the gap between two tangled buildings.</p>
<p class="TX">They were covered from head to toe in a dark robe, their face concealed by a hood that obscured their appearance and age—even whether they were a man or a woman.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, the four-layered crest floating above their head in a sharp, piercing design akin to a wide-brimmed hat clearly indicated that they were the master of this plane.</p>
<p class="TX">“You’ve finally decided to show yourself. In the name of the Knights of the Garden, you’re under—”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri, still holding her <i>naginata</i> at the approaching figure, choked on her words.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri?” Mushiki asked, looking at her in concern.</p>
<p class="TX">That was only natural. After all, though she had until that moment been staring calmly toward their enemy, Ruri’s face was now tinged with indescribable dismay and consternation.</p>
<p class="TX">Sweat dripped down her face, her lips quivering silently. Her eyes had opened wider than he had ever seen before, her gaze wavering—and, it seemed, slightly out of focus.</p>
<p class="TX">“You…,” emerged a gravelly sound from deep in her throat.</p>
<p class="TX">Those words. Her voice.</p>
<p class="TX">She must have realized just who their opponent truly was.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Ruri!” Mushiki called out.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">The approaching mage lifted an arm into the air—a slender, beautiful hand poking out from their sleeve.</p>
<p class="TX">Then the figure snapped their fingers.</p>
<p class="TX">“…?!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 159. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_159" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>All of a sudden, the glowing blade in Ruri’s hands swelled in size, a thousand needles erupting from it to pierce her hands, her legs, her chest.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ugh…”</p>
<p class="TX">Unable to even process what had just happened, she choked on her words as she sank to the ground, an ocean of blood spewing from her body.</p>
<p class="TX">It had all happened in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruriii!” Mushiki screamed, running to her side as she collapsed in a pool of blood.</p>
<p class="TX">A second later, the crest above her head faded away, and the <i>naginata</i> in her hands vanished in a flash of light.</p>
<p class="TX">She was barely breathing, and it was clear that she was in critical condition. Blood continued to pour from the countless wounds that covered her body. Among them, one of those light-based needles that had pierced her chest seemed to have hit a vital organ. She needed immediate treatment, lest her injuries prove fatal. But even then, it might not be enough…</p>
<p class="TX">“…Ugh…”</p>
<p class="TX">The tragic sight of his sister bleeding out tore at Mushiki’s heart.</p>
<p class="TX">Searing rage and enmity building up inside him, he glared across at the mage standing before them.</p>
<p class="TX">“You…!”</p>
<p class="TX">The unforgivable enemy who had attacked Saika, mortally wounded him, and now dealt a fatal injury to his precious sister.</p>
<p class="TX">…He had to defeat this foe. Here and now.</p>
<p class="TX">If he didn’t, Ruri would die. Saika would die. <i>He</i> would die.</p>
<p class="TX">He understood how impossible this task seemed. Even so, having made up his mind, he rose to his feet and lifted his hands toward the mage.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Heh.”</p>
<p class="TX">Having seen his state, and after one exhalation of breath, the mage turned on their heel.</p>
<p class="TX">As if to say they had accomplished their goal for the day.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 160. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_160" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Or perhaps even that Mushiki wasn’t worth their time.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wait—,” Mushiki began before swallowing his words.</p>
<p class="TX">No, he couldn’t let this enemy get away with everything that they had done. But what would happen to Ruri if their foe turned back around?</p>
<p class="TX">He couldn’t risk Ruri’s life in a moment of recklessness when he didn’t have the faintest hope of emerging victorious. Digging his fingernails into his palms and biting his lip in frustration, he stared at the mage’s back as the figure walked away, vanishing into the darkness.</p>
<p class="TX">A moment later, the labyrinthine landscape that had enveloped them all crumbled away, and the peaceful, late-afternoon park returned to take its place.</p>
<p class="TX">One thing, however, had most certainly changed.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Arrrggghhh…”</p>
<p class="TX">Unable to contain his rage, clenching his fists smeared with his sister’s blood, he cried out into the heavens.</p>
