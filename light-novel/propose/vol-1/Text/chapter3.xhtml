<p class="COTX">Void’s Garden could be roughly divided into five main areas.</p>
<p class="TX">First came the central area, where the central school building and the headquarters overseeing anti-annihilation factor operations were located.</p>
<p class="TX">Next came the eastern area, densely packed with the school’s annexes, its medical buildings, and various research facilities.</p>
<p class="TX">After that was the western area, largely taken up by most of the school’s training facilities and grounds.</p>
<p class="TX">Then there was the northern area, most of it off-limits to the general public and that included facilities like the headmistress’s residence and several private institutions.</p>
<p class="TX">Finally, the southern area was filled with dormitories and various commercial facilities.</p>
<p class="TX">Naturally, Mushiki had assumed he would be expected to return to the northern area at the end of the school day.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless—</p>
<p class="TX">“Kuroe? What is this place?” he asked as he took in the building in front of him.</p>
<p class="TX">“As you can see, it’s the Garden’s first girls’ dormitory building,” Kuroe answered flatly.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 80. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_80" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Right. After finishing his first day of classes, he had found Kuroe waiting for him in front of the central school building, and now she had led him all the way to this dormitory in the school’s southern precinct.</p>
<p class="TX">It was a large, three-storied structure, with an understated yet sophisticated appearance. It looked more like a low-rise apartment building than a student dormitory.</p>
<p class="TX">“Unless I’m mistaken, aren’t girls’ dormitories places where female students live together?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Just so. And right now, Lady Saika is both a girl and a student.”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s true, I guess, but you know… Are you sure you don’t have any other reasons for suggesting this?”</p>
<p class="TX">“You’re very perceptive, Lady Saika.” Kuroe, growing weary of this roundabout conversation, continued in a hushed voice: “I won’t be able to protect you well in the mansion, Mushiki. In other words, the safest place for you is the same dormitory as Knight Fuyajoh.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…I see.”</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed, it would be his residence rather than the school facilities where he would end up spending most of his time at the Garden. No matter how many knights he had by his side during the day, it wouldn’t mean anything if he was left completely undefended while asleep at night.</p>
<p class="TX">“But won’t that pose another problem? I mean, I know I’m now an S-class beauty, the envy of the world, but—”</p>
<p class="TX">“There’s no need to go that far.” Kuroe gave him an unamused look.</p>
<p class="TX">“Right,” Mushiki murmured. “Still, I’m a guy on the inside. Wouldn’t it be wrong for me to stay in the girls’ dormitory?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I understand what you’re saying, but this is an emergency situation. After all, if you should be killed, Mushiki, that would also mean Lady Saika’s demise. And her death would mean the end of the world.”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s…true, I guess, but still…”</p>
<p class="TX">Despite saying that, Mushiki felt a sense of unease hearing Kuroe’s words.</p>
<p class="TX">He understood that if he was killed, Saika would also die. But to him, equating that to the end of the world seemed a bit extreme.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 81. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_81" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>It was true that, without her, the world might face a crisis. Nonetheless, he couldn’t help but think that Kuroe had implied just now something much more—that the moment Lady Saika died, the whole world would be destroyed along with her.</p>
<p class="TX">“In any event, don’t worry.” Whether or not she had read his thoughts, Kuroe looked unconcerned and continued: “Usually, we assign two students to a room, but I’ve arranged for you to have your own private quarters.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I see. That makes sense.”</p>
<p class="TX">“You’re a man, after all, so there are a lot of things we need to take into account.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I wouldn’t go that far…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh? Are you saying we needn’t worry, then?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…I appreciate the concern, I guess…” Defeated, Mushiki averted his eyes.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe let out a deep sigh and, with a shrug, added: “In that case, follow me.”</p>
<p class="TX">With that, she led him through the doors of the girls’ dormitory.</p>
<p class="TX">Though still somewhat nervous, Mushiki followed after her and stepped into this world of women.</p>
<p class="TX">First they passed through an electronic authentication system, then into the lobby. The building decor and the facilities were startlingly luxurious for a student dormitory.</p>
<p class="TX">“By the way, Mushiki, how was school today?” Kuroe asked in a whisper.</p>
<p class="TX">He gave her a small nod. “Right. I was a little nervous, but everyone else seemed even more on edge, so that helped me keep my cool, I think… I’m guessing it will probably take me a while to use magic properly, though…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Did you run into any problems?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Um, I guess you could say that…”</p>
<p class="TX">“I saw a request had been put in for repairs to classroom 2-A.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Yeah. My bad…,” Mushiki answered, his gaze fixed on the floor ahead of him.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 82. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_82" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…” Kuroe gave him a cold stare.</p>
<p class="TX">Despite all that, she had suspected from the very beginning that things wouldn’t go entirely smoothly. She let out an exasperated sigh but said nothing more as they made their way down the corridor until she came to a stop outside another door.</p>
<p class="TX">“This is your room.”</p>
<p class="TX">She had led him to a room on the third floor, around ten tatami mats in size and fitted with an extravagant bed, desk, closet, and dressing table all lined up in a row. The overall impression wasn’t all that different from Saika’s bedroom in which he had first awakened in his <i>merged</i> form.</p>
<p class="TX">“This is amazing. I know it’s a student dorm, but it’s so extravagant…”</p>
<p class="TX">“The other rooms are fitted with regular furniture. As this will be Lady Saika’s quarters for the time being, I arranged to have it properly prepared for her in advance,” Kuroe said before motioning to one item after the next. “We’ve brought you changes of clothes and a number of personal items, though we’ve kept them to the bare minimum required. If there is anything here that you don’t know how to use, please let me know. I’ll be staying in the room to your right, number 316.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah. So you’re moving into the dorm, too, then?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Of course. Taking care of Lady Saika is my responsibility. Just so you know, the room to your left, number 314, belongs to Knight Fuyajoh. In the event of an emergency, she should be able to offer immediate assistance. Now, that’s it for our tour. Let’s move on.”</p>
<p class="TX">She opened the door and ushered Mushiki back out into the corridor.</p>
<p class="TX">“Where are we going now?” he asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“The first floor… In a sense, it would be no exaggeration to say that this is the most important issue for us to address during your stay in the dormitory.”</p>
<p class="TX">“The most important issue…? Wh-what is it?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Look ahead.”</p>
<p class="TX">As they stepped through the hall—</p>
<p class="TX">“M-Madam Witch?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 83. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_83" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Turning a corner, they came across Ruri and Hizumi coming from the other direction.</p>
<p class="TX">Both stared back wide-eyed at this unexpected and sudden situation. Their reactions were understandable, though, seeing as Saika had popped up out of nowhere in the middle of their everyday dormitory.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri turned to Hizumi, her face awash with a look of disbelief. “H-Hizumi. Pinch me. As hard as you can. I’m definitely dreaming here. This is just too unreal. I mean, this is the stuff of love comedies, having the person of your dreams transfer into your class and then start living in your very own dorm, right? At this rate, I’m going to turn into one of those lucky pervert cartoon characters… Hurry…! Before I defile Madam Witch with my thoughts…!”</p>
<p class="TX">“C-calm down, Ruri. I can see her, too.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ha-ha-ha. There you go joking again.” With a dry smile, Ruri pinched herself on the cheek and turned back to Mushiki. “What?! That’s the <i>real</i> Madam Witch?!” She cried out in astonishment, falling to the ground and landing hard on her posterior.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki did his best to address her in a refined voice. “Ah, we meet again, Ruri, Hizumi… I’m a student now, you know? So I was thinking I would move to the dormitory for a while.”</p>
<p class="TX">“R-r-really?! Really?! Wh-which room…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Number 315.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Next doooooor?!” Ruri all but screamed her soul out, collapsing to the floor flat on her back.</p>
<p class="TX">Hizumi rushed to her side. “Ruri?! Are you all right?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“I—I might be done for… Clearly, I’ve already received my allotment of happiness in this life… When I die, tell my brother…tell him I lived to the best of my ability…and that I loved him with all my heart.”</p>
<p class="TX">With that, her strength left her, and she fell limp. Her expression, however, remained one of utmost joy.</p>
<p class="TX">“R-Ruriii!” Hizumi cried out as she held her in her arms.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, too, was naturally a little worried and looked into his sister’s face.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Is she okay?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 84. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_84" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Oh, yes. She does this from time to time. She should be back to normal in a little while,” Hizumi replied, her voice suddenly collected and cool.</p>
<p class="TX">While Mushiki did his best to feign composure, he couldn’t help but be a little concerned.</p>
<p class="TX">“Excuse me,” Hizumi said, grabbing the limp Ruri and dragging her roughly away in a manner that made her look an awful lot like a serial killer disposing of a corpse.</p>
<p class="TX">After watching the two disappear into Room 314, Mushiki glanced at Kuroe. “She <i>is</i> an S-class mage, right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“She is…” Kuroe let out a faint cough in an attempt to collect herself. “Let’s continue on. We don’t have a lot of time left.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, right. So what’s this important problem we need to think about?” Mushiki asked.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe gave him a serious look. “The bathing area.”</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">A few minutes later, Kuroe led Mushiki into the changing room adjacent to the large bathroom on the first floor of the dormitory building.</p>
<p class="TX">It was an expansive space, lined with shelves along the walls stacked with several baskets. At the back of the room was a row of washbasins—and farther in, a set of large glass doors leading into the bathing area.</p>
<p class="TX">“The most important problem…is this?” Mushiki asked in all seriousness.</p>
<p class="TX">That being said, it wasn’t all that difficult to understand what Kuroe had meant by that. Yesterday, Kuroe had washed him while he had been occupied watching a video recording of Saika to familiarize himself with her character, so this would be his first time properly bathing since ending up in her body.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. There is a sign out front saying that the bathing area is currently off-limits due to a gas inspection. Let’s finish up in here while we still have time. As I’m sure you can imagine, we can’t allow the other female students to enter while you’re present.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah… Right. I’m glad you thought about all this, Kuroe.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 85. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_85" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>For her part, Kuroe let out a soft snort, watching him through narrowed eyes. “I’m not doing this out of concern for the students. The fate of the entire world is at stake. We can’t afford to worry about one or two naked bodies. But what we absolutely need to avoid right now is any chance that your true identity could be revealed.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“We can talk about the details inside. We don’t have a lot of time to spare, so let’s keep any vulnerable moments to a minimum,” Kuroe said, urging him to get started.</p>
<p class="TX">Still somewhat uncertain, Mushiki pulled out a clothes basket—only to stop midway.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kuroe?” he asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“What is it? Why do you look so serious all of a sudden?”</p>
<p class="TX">“If we’re taking a bath…that means undressing, right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Well, yes.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Of course, there’s no way Saika’s beautiful body could be lacking in any way. She’s a supreme work of art. There shouldn’t be any shame in showing it off, no? Besides, I’m a man, a high schooler at the peak of puberty. To be honest with you, I would kill to get a look at this body. I want to etch that sight into my very mind. And if I’m going to wash myself, naturally that means I’m going to be touching things that are normally out of reach. My heart’s racing with excitement here.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I think it would be best if you didn’t speak such thoughts aloud,” Kuroe said with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, however, ignored her, his voice feverish: “But, but…! Even if she’s basically unconscious, Saika’s body still belongs to her. I can’t look at it, I can’t touch it, I can’t feel it up…not without her permission…!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Your behavior doesn’t exactly add up, you realize?” Kuroe said, sounding disgusted. Nonetheless, she did eventually give him a small nod. “Given the circumstances, I’m sure Lady Saika will allow you to some extent… But I can’t say I don’t understand where you’re coming from. I’m surprised. You’re quite the gentleman inside.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Thank you. Yep, I’d rather build up this relationship properly than take advantage of her in some underhanded way. Discretion is important.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 86. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_86" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Are you trying to see how fast you can get me to retract my previous statement?” Kuroe paused before letting out a deep sigh as she retrieved what looked like a long piece of black cloth from her pocket. “But I understand. I will try to accommodate you as best I can.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What’s that?” Mushiki asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“Excuse me,” Kuroe said in response before covering his eyes with the strip of cloth.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki was taken aback at being blindfolded all of a sudden, but it wasn’t long before he understood Kuroe’s intentions.</p>
<p class="TX">Right. This way, he wouldn’t be able to steal a glimpse of Saika’s naked body.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah… But isn’t it dangerous to take a bath blindfolded…? I mean, what if I slip and fall?”</p>
<p class="TX">“You needn’t worry about that. We’ll bathe together, and I’ll take care of everything. Washing your hair, your body, changing you into your clothes.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I think that’s another problem, though…”</p>
<p class="TX">“There’s no problem. I’ve served Lady Saika this way before.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh…?! H-hold on, tell me more!”</p>
<p class="TX">“I doubt there will be any issue, but all the same, I’ll have to strongly decline. Now, let me undress you.”</p>
<p class="TX">Before he knew it, Kuroe had already reached out, her hands gliding over his body as she removed his uniform piece by piece.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kyargh… Th-that was a little fast…” He gasped at this unexpected feeling.</p>
<p class="TX">It was a new experience for him, being stripped naked by someone else. Moreover, being blindfolded, he couldn’t know where her hands would go next. His heart raced as this unforeseen danger game began.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe showed no sign of slowing down or stopping.</p>
<p class="TX">Before he knew it, the moment of truth was upon him. He sensed her hand circling around his back, then he heard a soft click, and the band that had been wrapped tightly around his chest came undone.</p>
<p class="TX">“Whoa…”</p>
<p class="TX">Barely a second had passed since he realized that the bra had been <span aria-label=" Page 87. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_87" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>unhooked. The two weights at his chest were so substantial that he almost reached out to support them with his hands.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Kuroe,” he called out, trying to calm his ragged breathing.</p>
<p class="TX">“What?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Sure, I can’t see them…but this still feels wrong.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Maybe I <i>should</i> have knocked you out?” Kuroe remarked, her cold tone suggesting that she may in fact have actually considered that option.</p>
<p class="TX">She grasped his neck in her hand, leaving Mushiki with the unmistakable impression that if he was to say any more, she might follow through on that threat and clamp down on his carotid artery, so he kept his response to an unsteady shake of his head.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, from in front of him, he made out a faint rustling sound.</p>
<p class="TX">Naturally, his eyebrows pulled up in suspicion.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Um, Kuroe? What was that?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m just getting ready. Don’t mind me,” she said as something soft pressed against his arm.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hyargh?!” he cried out, a tremor coursing through his body.</p>
<p class="TX">“Excuse me,” Kuroe’s cool voice sounded. “I’m pressing my body against yours to guide you into the bathing area.”</p>
<p class="TX">“A-ah… R-right… I-I’m not imagining this, am I? Have you taken off your clothes, too?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Of course.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Why?”</p>
<p class="TX">“What an odd question. They would get wet otherwise.”</p>
<p class="TX"><i>That isn’t the point</i>, Mushiki felt like saying, but his throat clamped up.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe clung even more snugly to him than she had a moment ago.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hey, Kuroe? Um, aren’t you a little close…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“You can’t see at the moment. I can’t allow you to trip and hurt yourself. Now, come this way.”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki had no idea what on earth was going on anymore, so he allowed her to lead him into the bathing area and sit him down on a stool.</p>
<p class="TX">“Now then, I’m going to pour some warm water over your shoulders.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 88. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_88" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“O-okay…”</p>
<p class="TX">No sooner did he finish responding than she did just that. The temperature was perfect, neither too hot nor too cold.</p>
<p class="TX">After repeating this several times, she began to wash his hair with a practiced hand.</p>
<p class="TX">His hair hadn’t been anywhere near this long in his original body, so it was an uncanny feeling.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Speaking of which, about that previous topic,” said Kuroe as she washed his hair, having just remembered something.</p>
<p class="TX">“Previous topic…? You mean about me returning to my original body? Or that I shouldn’t enter the girls’ bathing area?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Both.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="TX">She lathered his hair in foam and began to gently massage his scalp. “I’ve never seen another example of a merged human being, so I’m only speculating here, but I think the reason why your body transformed back into your original form had something to do with the amount of magical energy being released.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Magical energy…? You mean, because it’s leaking all over the place…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. The situation has yet to be brought under control, so Lady Saika’s magic continued to be released from your body little by little.” Kuroe stopped there, rinsed off the shampoo, and then began to carefully apply a treatment to his hair. “Lady Saika has an enormous reserve of magical energy, and there is certainly no chance of it being exhausted this way… However, when the amount being released increases past a certain level, there is a chance that the body will respond with a defensive reaction.”</p>
<p class="TX">“A defensive reaction…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“To put it simply, I believe that when the body detects a serious abnormality, it automatically enters a state of low magical energy consumption. Effectively, a kind of safe mode.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah…”</p>
<p class="TX">Underneath the blindfold, Mushiki blinked several times.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 89. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_89" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Right now, the body of the most powerful mage in the world had been combined with that of a complete amateur, resulting in this distorted state.</p>
<p class="TX">As such, if those elements that comprised Mushiki were to manifest more strongly, the natural result would be that the total amount of magical energy being consumed would decrease.</p>
<p class="TX">“I see… That’s a good analogy, huh?” He sighed in understanding. “So when you made my body transform back into Saika’s…”</p>
<p class="TX">“You mean the kiss?”</p>
<p class="TX">With Kuroe putting that so bluntly, Mushiki found himself momentarily at a loss for words. “Yeah. What was that?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I offered you more magical energy. That seemed like the most efficient solution,” she said indifferently.</p>
<p class="TX">Maybe this all meant nothing to her? Mushiki felt somewhat embarrassed that he seemed to be the only one bothered by her behavior, so he tried to change the topic.</p>
<p class="TX">“…So it’s all about the amount of magical energy being released? I guess I did let a lot out in the classroom earlier, and there was a bit of a close call during the practical class afterward… Ah, and there was that fight with Anviet yesterday, too. A guess it all just piled up, huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Well, they probably contributed to it, but I’m referring more to moments when you aren’t using magic. I suspect the immediate trigger might have been something else entirely.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?” Mushiki’s expression at this was one of genuine puzzlement.</p>
<p class="TX">But then, as though to wash that look from his face, Kuroe ran the shower over his head once more.</p>
<p class="TX">“One’s state of mind has a considerable effect on the flow of one’s magical energy and its total amount. Determination, anger, excitement—emotions like those can often grant a mage more power than they would otherwise possess.”</p>
<p class="TX">“So what you’re saying is…,” Mushiki said hesitantly.</p>
<p class="TX">“When you were in the girls’ locker room,” Kuroe said dispassionately, “perhaps your <i>excitement</i>, so to speak, triggered an increase in the flow of your magical energy.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 90. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_90" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…Ahem…”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki could let out only a pained moan. Kuroe’s accusation had struck too close to home.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hey… Um, I mean, I didn’t really…you know…”</p>
<p class="TX">“If you say so,” Kuroe said.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki felt somewhat pathetic but continued on. “In other words, that sign in front of the bathing area…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. You wouldn’t be able to last seeing other women in their underwear, let alone naked. If you <i>did</i> see anyone in such a state, you would be outed immediately.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…” Mushiki, still overwhelmed by a sense of self-disgust, fell silent.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Kuroe said something amusing: “You mentioned you fell in love with Lady Saika at first sight, didn’t you? It’s interesting, don’t you think, how men are capable of being aroused by a woman irrespective of her age? Then again, maybe that’s proof of a healthy physiology.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh, I’ve got my heart set on her!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Is that so? I suppose I can rest at ease, then,” Kuroe responded.</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, without any warning, there came an audible plopping sound as something soft pressed against Mushiki’s—or strictly speaking, Saika’s—breast.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kyah!”</p>
<p class="TX">The sudden, furtive graze prompted him to let out a loud screech as he arched his back.</p>
<p class="TX">That mysterious touch paid him no mind as it crawled across his neck, his abdomen, his buttocks, and everywhere else across his body without even the faintest hint of restraint.</p>
<p class="TX">“K-Kuroe…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Is something the matter? I’m not Lady Saika, you realize?”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, n-n-no. That isn’t what I—”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki stammered, doing his best to pull himself free from her roving hands.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, those hands knew no restraint as they traveled across his skin, and Mushiki soon found himself succumbing to their touch.</p>
