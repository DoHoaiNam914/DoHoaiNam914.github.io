<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 129. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_129" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Once again, a fresh cat-and-mouse game, a new rough-and-tumble had erupted in the examination room.</p>
<p class="TX">Beyond the door, the other students in the waiting room could easily make out the pair’s raised voices.</p>
<p class="TX">Afterward, rumors that Knight Erulka Flaera had been trying to get physical with a male student spread like wildfire, but at this moment in time, Mushiki was in no state to worry about such things.</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">“I’ve been looking all over for you, Mushiki. Where on earth have you been?”</p>
<p class="TX">About ten minutes after the attack in the examination room, Kuroe called out to Mushiki as he staggered down the corridors of the medical building.</p>
<p class="TX">“…And what made you transform again in such a short period of time? And why do your gym clothes look so worn-out? I take my eyes off you for a couple of minutes… Just what did you get up to? Something dirty, I’m sure…” Kuroe stared at him, her eyes filled with disdain.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki shook his head. “No, you’ve got the wrong idea, Kuroe.”</p>
<p class="TX">After he explained the situation to her, Kuroe watched him through half-open eyes. “I see. Knight Erulka, you said? She hasn’t learned your true identity, I hope?”</p>
<p class="TX">“No. It was a close call, but I don’t think she caught on…”</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="TX">That respite was short-lived, though. Her expression quickly turned grim. “Mushiki. We need to talk. But there are too many people here. Please come with me.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Ah, okay.” He followed her down the medical building corridors.</p>
<p class="TX">Eventually, they arrived at a deserted area. Kuroe glanced around to make sure they were alone before speaking. “We will have to wait for the investigation department’s report to know the details, but it appears that today’s mass outbreak of annihilation factors may have been man-made.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 130. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_130" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“What…?” Mushiki’s eyes shot open. “Are you saying those dragons attacked us on someone’s orders?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I wouldn’t go so far as to say that someone was <i>directly</i> using them. However, it’s possible that the timing and location of the annihilation factors were somehow manipulated—or that a great number of annihilation factors were transferred to a single location.”</p>
<p class="TX">“But how…? And aren’t annihilation factors capable of destroying the whole world? Who would…?” But before Mushiki could finish that sentence, he suddenly fell silent.</p>
<p class="TX">No doubt having realized the same thing that he had, Kuroe gave him a brief nod. “Yes. A trick like that couldn’t be pulled off by any ordinary mage. However…”</p>
<p class="TX">It was exactly as she said.</p>
<p class="TX">The same mage who had attacked both Saika and Mushiki could very well have been behind this latest incident.</p>
<p class="TX">“If you stop to think about it, it was exquisitely put together. A swarm of annihilation factors each of a level that they could easily be defeated individually. However, by the time they were all dealt with, there was a very real possibility that the students would be put in harm’s way…”</p>
<p class="TX">“…So what you’re saying is…,” Mushiki began solemnly.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe nodded. “It was beautifully staged to confirm whether the Lady Saika currently present at the Garden is the real thing—to see whether <i>you</i> were capable of using her fourth substantiation.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…So I’m…?” Mushiki fell silent, looking upset.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe, her eyes downcast, shook her head. “There is no need for you to feel responsible, Mushiki. If you hadn’t acted, the students could have been injured. No doubt if Lady Saika was here, she would have done exactly the same thing. No, you should be proud, I think, that you successfully pulled off her fourth substantiation on such short notice.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I know, right? This really is Saika’s body, huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“But it <i>is</i> strange. When you talk honestly, it makes me think that you <i>do</i> care a little.” Kuroe sighed.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 131. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_131" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>As she watched him through half-open eyes, Mushiki folded his arms in thought. “But this is bad, isn’t it? If that really was caused by whoever attacked Saika and me…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. They would have been able to confirm that Lady Saika is still alive. That said, we wouldn’t have been able to keep that a secret forever. The truth would have come out sooner or later. Although…” Kuroe paused for a moment. “There is a certain course of action only available to us now that we know the assailant is aware of Lady Saika’s survival.”</p>
<p class="TX">“A certain course of action…?” Mushiki repeated.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes,” Kuroe answered before briefly explaining what she had in mind.</p>
<p class="TX">“…I see. But wouldn’t that be pretty dangerous?” he asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“I won’t deny it. But if we succeed, we should be able to fully identify your attacker or attackers. It’s worth a try.” With that, Kuroe spun around with a click of her heels. “I will examine any lingering traces left behind in the training hall. You, Mushiki, should return to your classes. In your present <i>excited</i> state, I doubt you will undergo another state conversion anytime soon.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Um, Kuroe…?” Mushiki called out, but she had already disappeared down the corridor without looking back.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Left to himself, Mushiki stood there in stunned silence for a moment. After deciding that it would do him no good to remain that way forever, he started toward the medical treatment area, when—</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushikiii!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?!”</p>
<p class="TX">No sooner did he step out from the room than a figure leaped out in front of him, the surprise sending him falling flat on his butt.</p>
<p class="TX">“Owww… Wh-what?” Mushiki frowned.</p>
<p class="TX">The girl now sitting astride him—Ruri—breathed an audible sigh of relief. “Mushiki! Ah, thank goodness you’re okay…!”</p>
<p class="TX">She was out of breath as though having run all the way there, her sportswear damp with sweat. Judging by the redness around her eyes, it looked like she had been crying.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 132. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_132" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Ruri…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t scare me like that! When I lost sight of you, I—”</p>
<p class="TX">She stopped there, no doubt realizing that she and Mushiki were attracting considerable attention from the students and medical staff around them.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Come over here for a minute,” she said brusquely, rising to her feet and tugging at his hand.</p>
<p class="TX">She led him out of the medical building, only releasing him once they had circled around to the back.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m amazed you survived all that. I really thought you were dead,” she said sullenly, folding her arms.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s eyes opened wide. “Huh? You’re acting different, aren’t you? You seemed so worried…”</p>
<p class="TX">“What are you talking about? I wasn’t <i>worried…</i>” Ruri played dumb, before her gaze sharpened. “Anyway, do you get it now? How dangerous it is to be a mage here at the Garden? I don’t know how you found out about this place, but you’re just not up to it. So pack your bags and get out of here. Forget everything you’ve seen here and go and live your life in peace,” she ordered, pointing her finger right under his nose.</p>
<p class="TX">It <i>was</i> a sensible suggestion, but Mushiki found himself letting out a groan. “I’m sorry, Ruri. I know I’m not good enough. But I can’t leave. I’ve got my own reasons.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<i>Reasons…?</i> What <i>reasons</i>?” she demanded, squinting back at him.</p>
<p class="TX">Of course, he couldn’t tell her the truth.</p>
<p class="TX">So he gave more pretext.</p>
<p class="TX">“Well… I’ve kind of…fallen in love with someone.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?” Ruri stared back at him blankly for a moment before—</p>
<p class="TX">“Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Her scream was so loud it could probably be heard from up in the heavens.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-wh-what the heck?! Y-you mean there’s someone here, at the Garden, who you <i>like</i>?! You decided to become a mage just to get close to them?!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 133. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_133" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Um, yeah. The details are a little different, but that’s basically it…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh…?!” Ruri’s eyebrows seemed to shoot halfway up her forehead, her eyes spinning in their sockets. “Th-that’s…insane! Are you that stupid?! You threw yourself onto a real-life battlefield for something like <i>that…</i>?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Sorry. But right now, nothing matters to me more.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…” Ruri bit her lip in frustration at this last remark.</p>
<p class="TX">Almost as though she wanted to say something more.</p>
<p class="TX">She seemed to have second thoughts but ended up shaking her head. “N-nope, I can’t accept it. That’s just so, so…”</p>
<p class="TX">Looking conflicted, she seemed ready to say more—but having remembered something important, Mushiki interrupted her before she could continue.</p>
<p class="TX">“Right, Ruri. There’s something I need to ask you.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Wh-what?” she demanded with a quizzical frown.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m heading outside the Garden on Saturday, so if you’re free, do you mind tagging along?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Eh?” She stared back at him blankly for a while.</p>
<p class="TX">As her brain finally registered the meaning of his words, her eyes rounded in shock. “Wh-wh-what’s <i>that</i> supposed to mean, all of a sudden?! Why would I—?”</p>
<p class="TX">“So it’s no good? I really do need your help, though,” Mushiki added.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">In what seemed like less than a second, her face turned bright red. “D-don’t tell me… This person you’re chasing after; you don’t mean—”</p>
<p class="TX">Then mumbling something under her breath, she turned her body away from him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…I-I’ll think about it…! I’m thinking…!” she shouted as she wagged a finger under his chin before taking off down the pathway at a run.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">“Hizumiii!” Ruri cried out at the top of her lungs as she slammed open the door to her dormitory room after classes.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 134. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_134" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Hizumi, who had returned to their room ahead of her, glanced timidly over her shoulder. “Huh?! Wh-what…?! Ah, Ruri? Good work tidying up after the attack. What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s an e-e-emergency! M-my brother!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Your brother…? You mean Kuga?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Right! That brother! H-h-he asked me out on a <i>date</i>!”</p>
<p class="TX">“A date…? But you’re siblings? Don’t you mean just talking together…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“No! He practically said it! <i>I came to this Garden because I love you, Ruri!</i>”</p>
<p class="TX">“Eh…eh?!” Hizumi exclaimed with alarm. “B-b-but…you’re brother and sister… What…? Wh-what exactly did he say…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“He looked me right in the eye. And then he said: <i>I need you, Ruri.</i> And he had me cornered against a wall, I think…? Right… He was basically leaning over me all romantically… A-and then he lifted my face by my chin!”</p>
<p class="TX">Her interest piqued, Hizumi leaned forward, her cheeks having turned faintly pink. “W-wow… Despite his looks, Kuga sounds really up-front and assertive…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-what am I supposed to do?! I’ve never been on a date before…!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Why are you asking <i>me</i> of all people…? Well, um, just so we’re clear, you <i>are</i> thinking of going, right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Of course! Why do you ask? I mean, my own brother invited me! I <i>have</i> to go!”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, I just mean… It sounds like he was hitting on you, is all.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I get that… It’s complicated, you know?! But that’s that, and this is this!”</p>
<p class="TX">“R-right…” Hizumi scratched nervously at her reddened cheeks before asking: “Um… So when is it?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Saturday!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Saturday… A day off school, then. Well, you can’t wear your uniform. First of all, you’ll have to pick out something nice to wear, I suppose…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s it! Smart thinking, Hizumi! You know your stuff!”</p>
<p class="TX">“I wouldn’t go that far…” Something about Hizumi’s expression suggested she didn’t totally agree with that assessment, but Ruri ignored <span aria-label=" Page 135. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_135" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>her as she threw open the closet doors and began to sift carefully through the underwear folded up inside.</p>
<p class="TX">“The basics first. The top and bottom have to match… Maybe blue, like what I usually go with? Or maybe I should be a little more daring and try black…? Or I could use the garters I bought just for this kind of occasion…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hold on, Ruri. You’re jumping the gun a little.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…! You’re absolutely right. Thank you. I was so excited I got ahead of myself. The real ace in the hole isn’t erotic lingerie, but neat white underwear.”</p>
<p class="TX">“That isn’t what I meant.”</p>
<p class="TX">“You’re always so cool and reserved, Hizumi. I’m so grateful, you know? You’re always here for me, my good friend—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Could you put yourself in the shoes of this <i>good friend</i> for a minute?” Hizumi said in all seriousness, her expression sullen. “Why are you going on about underwear all of a sudden…? Why don’t we start from the outside…? Hold on; is there really a chance he might <i>see</i> them…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Well, you know… He’s my brother… And it’s not like he should have eyes for his own sister, but still…”</p>
<p class="TX">“H-how lewd…” Hizumi covered her mouth with her hands as her face turned bright red. She quickly shook her head as though to dispel unwanted thoughts. “How’s this, Ruri? If this is what you want, I’ll support you. But don’t let yourself get carried away. You have to look after yourself, all right…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yep… Got it. I guess I’ll go with gift catalogues with vouchers to give to the guests at our wedding instead of commemorative plates…”</p>
<p class="TX">“You’re jumping the gun again!” Hizumi couldn’t help but cry out loud.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">That Saturday, at nine thirty in the morning—</p>
<p class="TX">“Here we go!”</p>
<p class="TX">Knight Ruri Fuyajoh, dressed in her finest clothes, set out from the Garden.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 136. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_136" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>After completing all the formalities to leave the grounds, she passed through the main gate. Glancing over her shoulder, the huge school buildings and its various ancillary facilities that she had left behind just a moment earlier had been transformed now into a regular everyday school.</p>
<p class="TX">Of course, they hadn’t really been transformed. Due to an illusion designed to conceal the Garden from <i>the outside</i>, they had simply been disguised as something else.</p>
<p class="TX">Returning her gaze to the road ahead, she let out a sigh to calm herself and started down the footpath.</p>
<p class="TX">Her destination was the plaza in front of the station, where she had agreed to meet Mushiki. From the Garden, it should take her around fifteen minutes to reach it. Their rendezvous was scheduled for ten o’clock, so she ought to have plenty of time to spare.</p>
<p class="TX">That said, she had to consciously slow her steps to keep from walking too fast. If she didn’t, she would have ended up skipping along at a brisk pace.</p>
<p class="TX">Only that was understandable.</p>
<p class="TX">After all… Today she was going on a date with Mushiki.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">She had to muster her iron will to suppress the bubbly feelings welling up inside her.</p>
<p class="TX">It wouldn’t do to look too excited. If Mushiki saw her in such a state, he would end up taking advantage of her.</p>
<p class="TX">Exactly. That was that. This was this. While she might have accepted his invitation to go on a date, she was still committed to getting him kicked out of the Garden.</p>
<p class="TX">So she had to keep her cool today. No matter how much fun she was having, she couldn’t let it show. She made sure to carve that thought into her mind.</p>
<p class="TX">However…</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">She walked for fifteen minutes with those thoughts jostling around in her head. Yet the second she spotted Mushiki at their arranged <span aria-label=" Page 137. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_137" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>meeting place, she all but forgot her previous self-remonstrations as her heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p class="TX">No doubt having noticed her, Mushiki glanced her way. “Ruri!” he called out.</p>
<p class="TX">“…!”</p>
<p class="TX">She jumped in surprise but quickly feigned composure and adopted a moody pose.</p>
<p class="TX">“What’s the matter now? You ought to be thanking me for even coming, no?”</p>
<p class="TX">Having heard that, Mushiki’s eyes widened in surprise as he looked at her. “You’re beautiful,” he said. “You surprised me when I first saw you.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri felt the blood rushing to her head, and she pulled away sharply at this unexpected compliment.</p>
<p class="TX">Not a second later, however, she slapped herself on the cheek to control her expression.</p>
<p class="TX">“R-Ruri?” Mushiki asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“Never mind. It was just a mosquito. Anyway, where are we going…?”</p>
<p class="TX">Before she could finish that question, she fell silent, blinking several times over.</p>
<p class="TX">There was another figure standing behind Mushiki—Saika’s attendant, Kuroe Karasuma.</p>
<p class="TX">“Good morning,” the plain-clothed Kuroe said with a short bow.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri likewise bobbed her head in response. “Hmm? Ah, right. Hi.”</p>
<p class="TX">Then, a few seconds later—</p>
<p class="TX">“Wait, whaaat?!” she screamed at the top of her lungs.</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">“Wh-what’s wrong, Ruri?” Mushiki asked, pulling away at her sudden outcry.</p>
<p class="TX">“Isn’t that <i>my</i> line?! What’s Kuroe doing here?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“What…? Because we’re going out together.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hah…?!” Ruri’s eyes widened even more when she heard this.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 138. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_138" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…What?” she began to mutter under her breath, her hands trembling. “What’s the meaning of this…? <i>Together…?</i> A three-person date? Don’t tell me he was into Kuroe, not me? Then why invite <i>me</i> here…? Is he just trying to flaunt some lovey-dovey relationship…?! No, no, no, you have to keep cool, Ruri Fuyajoh. A mage can’t afford to lose her nerve… You’ve got to consider all the possibilities…”</p>
<p class="TX">She rested her hands on her forehead and fell to pondering with a serious look.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki couldn’t make out what she was saying, but he understood at some vague level that she was taken aback by Kuroe’s presence.</p>
<p class="TX">Although that didn’t make any sense. Without Kuroe, today’s investigation would have been impossible.</p>
<p class="TX">For a moment, he let his mind take him back to the conversation he’d had with Kuroe a few days earlier, just after the attack by the annihilation factors.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“There is a certain course of action only available to us now that we know the assailant is aware of Lady Saika’s survival.”</i></p>
<p class="TX"><i>“A certain course of action…?”</i></p>
<p class="TX"><i>“Yes. An investigation outside the walls of the Garden. Until now, we have remained within the Garden to try to keep Lady Saika’s survival a secret from your assailant. However, if the truth has already been exposed, that strategy is rendered useless. So let’s return to the site where she was attacked and examine any lingering traces of magical energy. Of course, we will need a knight to escort us…”</i></p>
<p class="TX">So when Mushiki had stumbled upon Ruri shortly after parting ways with Kuroe, he had asked her to join them. Kuroe had been unusually appreciative of his quick thinking.</p>
<p class="TX">Seeing Ruri’s reaction now, Kuroe cupped her chin in her hand. “Hmm…” Then she slid across to Mushiki, leaning close to his ear. “You mentioned that you had convinced her to join us, but she doesn’t seem entirely satisfied by this arrangement. In that case, there is nothing we can do about it. We shall have to set out alone, just the two of us.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 139. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_139" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“What…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri’s eyes snapped wide open at the sound of the word <i>alone</i>. “Wh-why would you say that?! I don’t mind!”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, please, there’s no need for you to go out of your way. I can escort my darling Mushiki—<i>ahem</i>—by myself.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<i>Darling?!</i> Did you just call him your <i>darling</i>?!” Ruri cried in shock. After pulling at the roots of her hair, she leaped toward Mushiki and snatched him away. “All right, all right, got it! Argh, I don’t get it! Let’s just go already, all right?!” she said in a desperate tone.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki didn’t exactly follow, but it looked like they were ready to go, so he breathed a sigh of relief. “Thank you. I was afraid you wouldn’t want to join us,” he said, flashing her a smile.</p>
<p class="TX">“Nggghhh!” Ruri let out a smothered cough.</p>
<p class="TX">“It looks like that worked,” Kuroe said in a small voice as she watched from the sidelines.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kuroe… Why did you say that?” Mushiki asked in an equally low whisper.</p>
<p class="TX">“There seems to have been some misunderstanding,” Kuroe explained. “She may have gone home if I didn’t put on an act, so I decided to fan the flames a little.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, I see…”</p>
<p class="TX">“And also…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Knight Fuyajoh’s reaction <i>was</i> somewhat amusing.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki couldn’t help but think <i>that</i> was the main reason behind her choice of words…but he tried to convince himself that he was just imagining things.</p>
<p class="TX">While the two of them were busy whispering back and forth, Ruri, it seemed, had managed to regain her composure and now turned her attention back to them.</p>
<p class="TX">“…So where are we going?” she asked. “To see a movie? The aquarium? Or maybe something adventurous, like an amusement park?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?” Mushiki stared back at her blankly.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 140. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_140" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Ruri’s lips twitched in disapproval. “Hah? So you invited me here with no plan at all? You really are hopeless, huh…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“N-no, I <i>do</i> have a plan. We’re just not going anywhere like that today. We have somewhere more important to go.”</p>
<p class="TX">“More important…?” Ruri muttered before suddenly choking up, her cheeks turning bright red, as though her thoughts had just led her to the wrong conclusion.</p>
<p class="TX">“I-it’s a little too soon for <i>that</i>, no?! And Kuroe’s here, too!”</p>
<p class="TX">“…? Yeah, we need her to join us for it.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…! So you planned this from the beginning…? Er, you can’t mean you want her to watch…?! Or that you want <i>me</i> to watch…?!” she exclaimed in confusion, breaking out in a sweat.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki tilted his head and reached out toward her. “What are you doing, Ruri? Let’s go?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Ah, um, er…” With a hesitant nod, she took his hand in her own.</p>
<p class="TX">Her whole body was trembling all over.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Mushiki realized something. She was trying to hold hands with him just like they used to as children.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, sorry. But you’re a high schooler now.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…! Wh-what does that matter?! If you want to hold hands, I’m not going to stop you!”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, I wasn’t trying to—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki! I don’t care! If you want to, I won’t stop you!” Ruri shouted, emphasizing each and every word.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki could only watch on in bewilderment.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe, by his other side, acted natural, and as she took off at a walk, she said, “All right. Let’s go.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, yeah.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Wait for meee!” Ruri called after them as the two began to leave. “What…? Kuroe, what are you…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“I’ve nothing more to say,” Kuroe responded, her tone of voice as calm as could be.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh…” Ruri could only gnash her teeth in frustration. Even so, she <span aria-label=" Page 141. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_141" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>seemed to quickly make up her mind, and as her face turned bright red, she grabbed Mushiki’s right hand in her own. “L-let’s go.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Eh? Ah… Right.”</p>
<p class="TX">So holding hands with Kuroe on his left and Ruri on his right, Mushiki began to make his way past the square in front of the station and down the main street.</p>
<p class="TX">Holding hands with not one but two girls was attracting considerable attention from passersby. Nonetheless, he was moved by the fact that he had finally managed to return to the outside world after what seemed like an eternity.</p>
<p class="TX">It had only been a few days, but it felt like forever since he had last laid eyes on the familiar scenery, the nostalgic cityscape. He found himself catching his breath as he looked up into the sky and savored the feeling of having returned home filling his lungs.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Ah,” Ruri exclaimed after a few minutes, seemingly having spotted something.</p>
<p class="TX">At the end of her line of sight was a food truck that sold crepes.</p>
<p class="TX">“Well, if that’s what you want, I suppose I’ll share a crepe with you!” she declared.</p>
<p class="TX">“I didn’t say anything… But do you want one?” Mushiki answered with a forced smile.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri puffed out her cheeks. “Isn’t it natural to stop for a bite to eat when you invite a girl out on a date?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Huh? But you don’t normally eat all that much when you’re out on a survey, do you…?”</p>
<p class="TX">The two of them watched each other for a long moment, both similarly confused.</p>
<p class="TX">Well, Mushiki thought, if she wanted a snack that badly, he didn’t have any good reason to refuse.</p>
<p class="TX">He glanced across at Kuroe, as though asking permission. Having understood his unvoiced question, she nodded, her gaze fixed on the ground ahead of her.</p>
<p class="TX">“All right. We’re here, so we might as well get something.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Really?!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 142. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_142" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Ruri’s face lit up at once—before quickly turning grim again as she let out a huff. “W-well… We might as well, no? I mean, you’re going to be leaving the Garden soon anyway, so let’s treat it as a farewell gift. A last supper of sorts.”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki felt strangely on edge. “Where did that come from…? Anyway, what flavors do you two want?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Strawberries and cream.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I’ll have banana and chocolate.”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri and Kuroe said simultaneously as they both looked over the menu.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm. I guess I’ll go with strawberries and cream, too,” Mushiki said after giving it a little thought.</p>
<p class="TX">“…!” Ruri struck a victorious pose at this decision before peering at Kuroe with a look of triumph. “I knew it! Even if we haven’t seen each other in years, we’re still brother and sister, right? Maybe we have similar tastes? I’m sure we’ve got so much in common.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…” Kuroe said nothing in response, her face expressionless… But for some reason, she looked slightly annoyed.</p>
<p class="TX">“Er, um… Right, I’m ordering, then.”</p>
<p class="TX">After paying at the counter and receiving the crepes, the three of them sat at a nearby bench. Ruri on the right, Kuroe on the left, and Mushiki sandwiched in between.</p>
<p class="TX">“Well, let’s dig in…”</p>
<p class="TX">He took a bite of his crepe, the spongy wrap filled with strawberries and whipped cream. The blend of rich sweetness and refreshing tartness created a perfect harmony in his mouth.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm… It’s been a while since I last had a crepe. It tastes pretty good, huh?” he said.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yep.” Ruri nodded. “And it’s even more delicious eating it here with my brother!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I said you should give up on becoming a mage and drop out of the Garden.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What? That wasn’t what I heard, though?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki was visibly confused—but at that moment, Kuroe, chewing on a bite of her banana-and-chocolate crepe, glanced his way. “Hmm. <span aria-label=" Page 143. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_143" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>I wonder what that one tastes like. Do you want to swap for a minute, Mushiki?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, okay. Here you go.” He held out his crepe, letting her take a bite.</p>
<p class="TX">Then Kuroe, likewise, offered him a taste of her own.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-whaaaaaat?!” Ruri screamed like a character in some horror comic.</p>
<p class="TX">“Whoa. You surprised me there. What’s wrong, Ruri?”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s <i>my</i> line! How can you be doing that like it’s so natural?! I mean, it’s…it’s basically…you know?!” she exclaimed, pointing back and forth between Mushiki and Kuroe.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah,” Mushiki let out after a long moment, his eyes widening in realization. “Now that you mention it…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm. But there’s no point making a fuss over a little indirect kiss after all we’ve done together,” Kuroe said matter-of-factly.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“All we’ve done together?! All we’ve done together?!”</i> Ruri gasped, her eyes swirling dangerously.</p>
<p class="TX">“Why worry about a light drizzle after you’ve just gone for a swim in the lake?” Kuroe asked her.</p>
<p class="TX">“Can you stop with the suggestive metaphors?!” Ruri screamed. “Nggghhh…” She groaned in frustration before holding out her own crepe. “Here, Mushiki! Take a bite of mine!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh…? But they’re the same flavor.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What…?!” Ruri let out a silent gasp. “Y-you planned this, Kuroe…!”</p>
<p class="TX">“What a rude accusation,” Kuroe said with an unreadable glower.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri, however, paid her no more attention, stuffing what remained of her crepe into her mouth and running back to the van to buy a fresh one.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, after taking a bite of her second one, she held it out to Mushiki. “It’s tropical mango! You can’t complain about this one, can you…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Um, I guess not…”</p>
<p class="TX">Feeling like he had little choice in the matter, Mushiki took a small bite of the new crepe.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hee-hee-hee.” Ruri chuckled as she, too, took another mouthful.</p>
