<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 72. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_72" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“<i>Madam Witch?! Are you okay?!</i>” Ruri’s panicked voice sounded from the other side of the door.</p>
<p class="TX">That was to be expected. After all, from where she was standing, it looked like Saika had suddenly decided to hole herself up in the shower room of all places.</p>
<p class="TX">“A-ah… Don’t worry about me. I’m just…”</p>
<p class="TX">No sooner did he start trying to peddle yet another excuse than he became quiet.</p>
<p class="TX">His body, he realized, was letting out a soft glow.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-what…?”</p>
<p class="TX">Unable to process what was happening to him, his eyes opened wide in alarm.</p>
<p class="TX">After a few seconds, it seemed to gradually subside, and the burning sensation coursing through his flesh likewise faded into memory.</p>
<p class="TX">As far as he could see, at least, nothing serious seemed to have happened. Relieved, he lifted his hands to his chest. However—</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-what the heck…?”</p>
<p class="TX">As he murmured under his breath, he was struck by a tremendous sense of discomfort.</p>
<p class="TX">The voice emanating from his own throat had turned into something unfamiliar—and at the same time, <i>all too</i> familiar.</p>
<p class="TX">“…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Choking on his words, he glanced down at his hands.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>No…</i></p>
<p class="TX">Those weren’t Saika’s beautiful, slender fingers, but the rugged, bulky digits of a young man.</p>
<p class="TX">On top of that, those magnificent breasts that had formerly graced his chest were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="TX">“It can’t be…”</p>
<p class="TX">After a quick survey of the area, he ran to the wall to catch a peek of his reflection in one of the slightly elevated windowpanes.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 73. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_73" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>When he saw the face staring back at him, he was rendered speechless.</p>
<p class="TX">Of course he was. Because in his reflection, staring back at him with a look of utter bewilderment—was Mushiki Kuga himself.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Me…? B-but why…?”</p>
<p class="TX">Yes. The long bangs hanging over his forehead, the somewhat blurred impression of his eyes, his pale white skin.</p>
<p class="TX">This was unmistakably him before merging with the mage Saika.</p>
<p class="TX">Right, Kuroe had said something along these lines. That the two identities were in a state of coalescence, and that Saika was merely the more dominant at the present moment.</p>
<p class="TX">Although for this transformation to have taken place so suddenly…</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh…”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Mushiki had a fit of recollection.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe had given him a final point of caution the previous night.</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">“Now then, the third and final thing to note…”</p>
<p class="TX">In the headmistress’s office on the top floor of the central school building, Kuroe raised a third finger into the air and suddenly fell silent.</p>
<p class="TX">She remained that way for a long time, as though carefully pondering her next words.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hmm? The third point?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…No, never mind. You’ll probably be fine.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What? You can’t not tell me now. You’ve got my full attention.”</p>
<p class="TX">“It might be best not to worry about this one. After all, it will be difficult to develop appropriate countermeasures regardless… Very well. In the event that something happens, I’ll step in directly, so don’t concern yourself about it,” Kuroe said flatly.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, let down by this response, puckered his lips. “You aren’t saying this on purpose to <i>make</i> me worry, are you, Kuroe?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t be absurd,” she answered, her knowing eyes avoiding his gaze.</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">“No way. She couldn’t have meant <i>this…</i>?!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 74. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_74" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Except he could think of no other explanation. It was certainly true that this was beyond <i>countermeasures</i>, and if he had known in advance, he might have acted strangely from sheer fear… But even so, if something like this could happen, he ought to have been given <i>some</i> warning!</p>
<p class="TX">“<i>Madam Witch! Madam Witch! Are you okay?! I’m coming in!</i>” Ruri continued to shout as she knocked on the door.</p>
<p class="TX">“…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s shoulders quivered with fear.</p>
<p class="TX">This was the shower room inside the girls’ locker room. And right now, he was a man.</p>
<p class="TX">There was no way he could let anyone walk in on him like this.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hold on,” he cried back without thinking. “I’m okay, so don’t—”</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“…?! Whose voice was that?!”</i></p>
<p class="TX">“…Uh-oh.”</p>
<p class="TX">He covered his mouth with his hands, but by then, it was already too late.</p>
<p class="TX">He could hear a commotion breaking out among the girls on the other side of the door.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“Eh…? Huh? Was that a</i> man’s <i>voice…?”</i></p>
<p class="TX"><i>“But Madam Witch just went in there, didn’t she?”</i></p>
<p class="TX"><i>“Was he lurking in the shower room before we came in…?!”</i></p>
<p class="TX"><i>“A high-level pervert?!”</i></p>
<p class="TX"><i>“Maybe Madam Witch noticed that sick freak and decided to deal with him herself!”</i></p>
<p class="TX"><i>“I’ll help you, Madam Witch…!”</i></p>
<p class="TX"><i>“J-just gimme a minute to put my clothes on…!”</i></p>
<p class="TX">All of a sudden, the locker room was abuzz.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki let out a strangled cry, his throat constricting.</p>
<p class="TX">He couldn’t let them find him like this. But there was no way out other than going through the locker room. The window at the end of the shower room was certainly too small for a man of his size to escape through.</p>
<p class="TX">“I-I’d better call Kuroe—”</p>
<p class="TX">“You wanted to see me?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Wha—?!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 75. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_75" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>At that moment, the window rattled open, and Kuroe poked her head through.</p>
<p class="TX">In response to the sudden appearance, Mushiki fell over, landing hard on his buttocks.</p>
<p class="TX">“Owww…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Do be careful. Right now, your body is also Lady Saika’s,” Kuroe said as she twisted and turned through the window until she had fully entered the shower room.</p>
<p class="TX">She had a slender build, but it was clear now that she was also unexpectedly dexterous. Mushiki felt like he was watching an acrobat at work—or maybe an escaped fugitive.</p>
<p class="TX">“I came as soon as I sensed a disruption in your magical energy. So you <i>have</i> undergone a state conversion…”</p>
<p class="TX">“A <i>state conversion</i>? Wh-what’s that supposed to mean…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Let’s save the detailed explanation for later. Right now, we need to deal with the situation at hand,” Kuroe said, drawing close to him.</p>
<p class="TX">Come to think of it, she <i>had</i> said she would step in directly should anything happen.</p>
<p class="TX">“Is there any way out of this? Please, you have to—”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki clammed up before he could finish his sentence.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe had pushed him up against the wall, pressing her hand against it next to his face.</p>
<p class="TX">“Um, Kuroe…? What are you…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Be quiet. Your hands are flailing about—no, maybe your mouth?” So saying, Kuroe grabbed his chin with her free hand—and without stopping, she brought her face even closer.</p>
<p class="TX">Her nose, her cheeks, even the soft graze of her breath.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s heart skipped a beat at the sight of her fine skin, those jet-black eyes that seemed to draw him in, those long eyelashes that filled his field of vision…</p>
<p class="TX">“Kuroe, hold on—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh…”</p>
<p class="TX">As though to completely silence him, she pressed her lips against his own.</p>
<p class="TX">A soft touch. The sound of that slightly moist contact. That numbing <span aria-label=" Page 76. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_76" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>aroma. All at once, an unstoppable assault overran his body and mind alike.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">For some reason, in his confusion, the memory that stood out most to him was the kiss he had shared with Saika that night.</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">“Madam Witch! Are you okay?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri, wearing her gym clothes backward, stormed through the shower room door.</p>
<p class="TX">Behind her, Hizumi and their other classmates peered in anxiously. They might not have deployed their magic crests, but they were all ready for battle.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri had meant to barge in as soon as possible, except that Hizumi had begged her to at least put her gym clothes back on before knocking the door down. Now she scanned the entire shower room as though attempting to make up for the delay.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Huh?” she gasped as she took in the scene in front of her.</p>
<p class="TX">The only other person in the shower room was Saika, still fully dressed.</p>
<p class="TX">“Madam Witch…? Wasn’t there a boy lurking in here…?” Ruri asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hmm? What are you talking about? There’s no one here,” Saika answered.</p>
<p class="TX">…But how? She felt a little uneasy and tilted her head in consternation. “Um, Madam Witch?”</p>
<p class="TX">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Why <i>did</i> you run into the shower room all of a sudden?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh, that… I thought I had worked up a bit of a sweat; that was all.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Why are you leaning against the wall, though?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah… I must have slipped, I suppose.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…And why is your face so red?”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s…” She raised a hand to touch her fingers, then stared back at them. “…a secret, I suppose?”</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1"><span aria-label=" Page 77. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_77" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“It looks like I made it in time,” Kuroe murmured after completing the so-called treatment, exiting back through the window she had entered, her skirt now slightly wet.</p>
<p class="TX">It looked like it would take some time to dry, but as she had literally crawled out from the shower room, it probably couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p class="TX">“But to think he underwent a state conversion on his very first day… He’ll most likely need further treatment down the road.” She stopped and crouched on the ground, covering her face with her hands.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">To any outside observer, it must have looked like she was trying to hide her blushing cheeks.</p>
<p class="TX">“…I thought I was prepared for this…but it’s still rather embarrassing, when it comes to it…,” she whispered, her voice so small that no one could have possibly overhead.</p>
<p class="TX">She remained that way for close to a full minute.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Well, then.”</p>
<p class="TX">Having managed to return to her usual expressionless face, she quickly rose back to her feet and sped across the grounds of the Garden as though nothing had happened.</p>
