<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 28. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_28" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Violence so overpowering that not even reason could stand up to it. A primitive, instinctual urge to survive. Even to Mushiki, who didn’t understand the first thing about magic, it was clear as day that this would be a fatal blow. Soon that raging golden lightning strike would tear his body to pieces.</p>
<p class="TX">That said—</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">What dominated his mind wasn’t fear or despair—but a curious sense of unease.</p>
<p class="TX">The burst of electricity that should have rent his flesh apart was moving strangely slow, as though time itself had somehow drawn to a halt.</p>
<p class="TX">Yet in this slow-motion world, his thoughts continued to turn at the same pace as before. It was a transcendental experience.</p>
<p class="TX">Was this what it meant to see your life flashing before your eyes as you approached death?</p>
<p class="TX">It was said that, at the moment of death, the human brain starts to think at an incredibly high speed, sorting through its prior experiences in the hope of finding a way out. As a result, time seems to move more slowly.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, it was all well and good for his brain to be dredging through his past memories, but there was nothing in there that would help him get out of <i>this</i> situation.</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX"><i>Don’t be afraid. You have the strongest body in the world now.</i></p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">…</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">Out of nowhere, a voice had echoed in his head. Mushiki’s eyes widened in alarm.</p>
<p class="TX">It was faint and distant but too clear to be an auditory hallucination.</p>
<p class="TX">But what on earth <i>was</i> it?</p>
<p class="TX">Strangely, the moment he had heard it, an eerie sense of peace washed over him.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 29. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_29" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Something told him that it was the same voice he had heard before passing out the night before, the voice of his first love.</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX"><i>Your body remembers how to use its powers. Trust it.</i></p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Mushiki raised his hands in front of him.</p>
<p class="TX">Not even he properly understood what was driving his actions. Nonetheless, he was sure this was the right course of action.</p>
<p class="TX">A heat was building up inside him, as though the blood running through his veins was warming up.</p>
<p class="TX">Soon a glow filled his field of vision, enveloping numerous thunderbolts, while above his head, radiant rings of light came into being.</p>
<p class="TX">One by one, they came together to form something resembling an angel’s halo, while at the same time, others joined vertically—almost like a witch’s hat.</p>
<p class="TX">“<i>…Four</i> points?!” Kuroe’s awestruck voice echoed behind him.</p>
<p class="TX">In an instant, space began to bend and warp around him—<i>and the world was transformed</i>.</p>
<p class="TX">That wasn’t metaphor or hyperbole.</p>
<p class="TX">Until that moment, Mushiki, Kuroe, and Anviet had been standing on the rooftop of the central school building.</p>
<p class="TX">Yet a split second later, everything around them had changed—replaced by a blue sky extending forever into the distance.</p>
<p class="TX">That wasn’t all. Mushiki looked down below and took in both earth <i>and</i> sky.</p>
<p class="TX">On the ground was a vast urban cityscape, and in the sky, a similar metropolitan scene, only upside down.</p>
<p class="TX">It was familiar—and yet at the same time uncanny. The tips of so many tall buildings and radio towers were pointed downward straight at them. All in all, it reminded Mushiki of the jaw of a huge beast.</p>
<p class="TX">Then Anviet’s panicked voice rang out. “A fourth substantiation…?! Hey, Kuozaki! No fair! That’s a forbidden—”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 30. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_30" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Before he could finish his sentence, Anviet’s cries were cut off then and there.</p>
<p class="TX">The cityscape below had begun to rise, or perhaps that above had begun to fall, both coursing toward him as though to rend him to pieces.</p>
<p class="TX">“…The creation of all things. Heaven and earth alike reside in the palm of my hand. Pledge obedience—for I will make you my bride.” Though he was only half conscious, those were the words that emanated from deep inside his chest.</p>
<p class="TX">Anviet, still hoping to resist, lifted his arms to the heavens—but the lightning that he summoned scattered without effect.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh…?! D-dammit! Aaauuuggghhh!”</p>
<p class="TX">Like a bamboo boat being thrown about by the waves, poor Anviet was consumed by the gaping maw of those towering edifices.</p>
<p class="TX">The world was progressively losing its form.</p>
<p class="TX">Yet a few moments later, everything returned to normal, with Mushiki and the others back on the rooftop of the central school building. The rings of light that had appeared over his head were also gone.</p>
<p class="TX">The only difference was that Anviet was now lying flat on his back.</p>
<p class="TX">His high-quality shirt and slacks were stained and torn, barely maintaining their function as articles of clothing. His long hair was covered in dirt, his body riddled with cuts and bruises. Nonetheless, his limbs were twitching at odd intervals, so he must have still been alive.</p>
<p class="TX">“What was all that…?” Mushiki stammered in a daze, glancing down at his hands as he clenched them into fists over and over. Those thin and beautiful fingers moved in accordance with his will.</p>
<p class="TX">He didn’t have the faintest inkling of what he had just done.</p>
<p class="TX">Still, he understood that the inexplicable scene that had unfolded in front of him had been the result of his own power.</p>
<p class="TX">It was an indescribable feeling, unlike anything he had ever experienced before.</p>
<p class="TX">A burning sensation, as though his blood was at a boil as it flowed from his brain to the ends of his fingertips.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 31. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_31" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>A sense of elation, as if his very existence had swelled like an inflating balloon.</p>
<p class="TX">Most of all—a sense of omnipotence, as if he could fit the entire world into the palm of his hand.</p>
<p class="TX">This strange concoction of impressions struck him all at once, leaving him momentarily stunned.</p>
<p class="TX">“D-damn you…!”</p>
<p class="TX">“…!”</p>
<p class="TX">Anviet’s resentful voice, trickling from a body still lying flat on the roof, pulled Mushiki back to the present.</p>
<p class="TX">“Um, are you okay…?” Mushiki approached, crouching down to check that the man was all right.</p>
<p class="TX">Anviet, for his part, struggled to raise his face, until his bloodshot gaze landed on Mushiki. “I-I’ll remember…this… I’ll…kill you, y-you—”</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, he wasn’t able to complete that sentence, as Kuroe trampled his face underfoot.</p>
<p class="TX">“Gyargh!”</p>
<p class="TX">At once, he fell motionless. Not even his limbs, until now twitching slightly, still moved.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">It didn’t look like she had intended to silence him—or even to deal the finishing blow. If anything, it might have simply been an act of carelessness as she approached Mushiki.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kuroe?” he called out to her.</p>
<p class="TX">Her expressionless countenance was the same as ever—other than that, she was unable to contain a shred of astonishment, mixed with the zest of excitement.</p>
<p class="TX">“…I can’t believe it. Even with Lady Saika’s body, for you to perform a fourth substantiation like that… But this could only mean—”</p>
<p class="TX">No sooner did she begin to mutter under her breath than she cut herself off, glancing back his way. “Mushiki.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Y-yes?” Feeling pressured by her intense stare, he could only nod in uncertainty.</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s unfortunate that you find yourself dragged into all this,” she <span aria-label=" Page 32. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_32" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>said. “Even so, I must ask you for your help. The fate of the world rests on your shoulders.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Uh, I’m not really cut out for all that…,” Mushiki answered.</p>
<p class="TX">That was to be expected. He was just an ordinary high school student. What was <i>he</i> supposed to do if called upon to save the world just like that?</p>
<p class="TX">“…” Kuroe scowled, making him break out in a cold sweat. “Is this not one of those situations where you should just <i>go with the flow</i>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“All the same…”</p>
<p class="TX">She stopped for a moment to ponder before continuing: “With your cooperation, we may be able to find a way to separate you and Lady Saika. Should that effort prove successful, I would be happy to introduce you to her anew, as someone to whom we all owe our lives.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What have I got to do? I was just thinking I was in the right mood for a little world-saving,” Mushiki blurted out.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe fell silent, breathing out a resigned sigh. “We need to make the necessary preparations. But we should deal with a certain contentious issue first.”</p>
<p class="TX">“A certain <i>contentious issue</i>?” Mushiki repeated blankly.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe responded with a single nod.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">Around thirty minutes after the scuffle on the roof, Mushiki was led to a large set of doors inside the central school building.</p>
<p class="TX">“What’s this, Kuroe?” he asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“The conference room. The Garden’s management department is holding its regular meeting today… Given the circumstances, I would prefer not to attend, but it would be out of the question for Lady Saika to not be present.” Kuroe paused there before coming out with a warning: “The management department and various knights should already be inside. I will deal with them as best I can, so please keep any comments to a minimum.”</p>
<p class="TX">“All right. We can’t ruin Lady Saika’s image, right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes, indeed.” Kuroe’s expression seemed to suggest that wasn’t what she was thinking at all, but she evidently decided to leave it at that.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 33. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_33" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She knocked loudly on the door, gradually swung it open, and gestured for Mushiki to enter.</p>
<p class="TX">Though somewhat on edge, he did as she instructed.</p>
<p class="TX">“Whoa…”</p>
<p class="TX">The moment he stepped inside, Mushiki let out an audible gasp, despite already having been warned to keep silent.</p>
<p class="TX">He couldn’t help it. There were already close to ten figures in the meeting room, and they each rose to their feet to welcome him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Lady Saika. Please take a seat,” Kuroe urged in an attempt to break through his stupor.</p>
<p class="TX">Right, he couldn’t just stand there in the doorway forever. He made his way awkwardly to the large table and sat himself in a vacant chair.</p>
<p class="TX">When he did, the others in the room, still standing, gave perplexed looks.</p>
<p class="TX">“M-Madam Witch…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Is everything all right…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh…?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki looked on quizzically, when Kuroe approached from behind. “Lady Saika’s seat is over there,” she whispered, pointing to the place at the head of the table.</p>
<p class="TX">The seat of honor. Although given the room’s unsettling atmosphere, it seemed more like the place where the boss of an evil organization might sit.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah…” He rose to his feet and hurried to reseat himself at the right position.</p>
<p class="TX">Only then did the others sit down.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Well aware of a strange tension that had fallen over the room, Mushiki glanced around at the other members.</p>
<p class="TX">Then he slightly frowned. Most of them were dressed in tidy suits, but two were clearly out of place.</p>
<p class="TX">One was a girl who seemed to be in her early teens, though her firm eyebrows and slightly reddened cheeks made her look even younger. She was wearing a long white robe, but for some reason, beneath that, she <span aria-label=" Page 34. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_34" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>was clad only in a top and a pair of skintight leggings like something from a tribal costume. It almost looked like casual underwear and was a complete mismatch in comparison to the rest of the members.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Kuroe, who’s that?” Mushiki asked in a small voice.</p>
<p class="TX">“Knight Erulka Flaera,” Kuroe whispered. “She may look young, but she’s the second longest-serving mage here at the Garden after Lady Saika.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh…”</p>
<p class="TX">As the saying went, you couldn’t judge a book by its cover. Mushiki was struck with wonder.</p>
<p class="TX">Next, his gaze turned to the girl sitting directly across from him.</p>
<p class="TX">She, too, looked young in years, though not quite to the same extent as Erulka—sixteen or seventeen years old, if he had to guess. She was dressed in the same uniform as the other students he had seen outside.</p>
<p class="TX">Her hair was tied back into two long pigtails, her eyes were a lovely almond shape, and her thin, well-defined lips told of great strength of will…</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Mushiki stopped.</p>
<p class="TX">Her face—he had seen it somewhere before.</p>
<p class="TX">“…It can’t be… Ruri?” he murmured.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Yes? What is it, Madam Witch?” responded the girl, her head cocked to one side. She was clearly elated to have been addressed directly by the esteemed Lady Saika.</p>
<p class="TX">“Er… It’s nothing,” he murmured softly.</p>
<p class="TX">He hadn’t meant to call out to her, but she had clearly heard him.</p>
<p class="TX">Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Kuroe staring at him in suspicion.</p>
<p class="TX">He could hardly blame her. After all, he had suddenly called out the name of someone whom he wasn’t supposed to know.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment—</p>
<p class="TX">“…!”</p>
<p class="TX">Just as he was wondering how he could brush this all off, the doors <span aria-label=" Page 35. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_35" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>to the conference room slammed open, and a man, covered from head to toe in bandages, staggered inside.</p>
<p class="TX">At first, Mushiki wasn’t sure who he was looking at, but when the newcomer gave him a piercing glare, he knew—it was the knight he had fought just a short time ago, Anviet Svarner.</p>
<p class="TX">The various faces of the management department stared at the knight wide-eyed.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kn-Knight Svarner! Your injuries…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t tell me they’re from your fight with an annihilation factor?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Impossible! For Anviet, an S-ranked mage, to end up like this?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Anviet clicked his tongue to silence the flustered onlookers. “Shuddup. As if I would ever lose to a drip like that.”</p>
<p class="TX">“B-but your injuries…?” a man wearing glasses asked—to which Anviet fixed Mushiki with a hateful glower.</p>
<p class="TX">At this, the other faces assembled each let out understanding sighs.</p>
<p class="TX">“…So it was Madam Witch.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, I suppose it can’t be helped, then.”</p>
<p class="TX">“You’re lucky to be alive, Anviet.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t just nod your heads, you bastards!” Anviet grunted as he threw himself down in the seat beside Erulka.</p>
<p class="TX">He must have been in considerable pain, as his body was trembling and his face was twisted in a grimace…but he clearly didn’t want the others to realize just how bad a condition he was in, as he didn’t make so much as a noise.</p>
<p class="TX">“You’re late, Anviet,” Ruri said, glowering. “What do you have to say for yourself, making Madam Witch wait?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Shut up. Just be grateful I’m here at all,” Anviet snapped back.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri shook her head, then turned her gaze back to the others assembled around the table. “In that case, now that we’re all here, let’s begin. The first item on our agenda today is…” As she spoke, she reached out to the computer terminal in front of her and projected an image over the center of the table. “Since our last briefing, there have been two annihilation events: a number five hundred and eleven, a leprechaun, and a number two hundred and six, a dragon. Both were <span aria-label=" Page 36. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_36" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>successfully subdued within the window for reversible annihilation. Injuries sustained by our mages…” In a loud, clear voice, she moved on from one item on her report to the next.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki couldn’t really follow everything she was saying, but he knew that it wouldn’t be appropriate to let his boredom show. As such, paying constant attention to his posture and deportment, he resolved to listen along with all due diligence.</p>
<p class="TX">After Ruri had finished, several others had reports of their own to share.</p>
<p class="TX">“Thank you, all. Does anyone else have anything to add?” Ruri asked roughly forty minutes later once everyone had spoken, glancing around the room.</p>
<p class="TX">The assembled members responded with silence.</p>
<p class="TX">Perhaps sensing the strained atmosphere, Ruri gave them all a single nod. “In that case—”</p>
<p class="TX">But at that moment, Kuroe, until now standing behind Mushiki’s back, stepped forward. “Excuse me. Might I be permitted to make an announcement?”</p>
<p class="TX">“And you are?”</p>
<p class="TX">“My apologies. My name is Kuroe Karasuma, Lady Saika’s attendant. Lady Saika permitted me to attend today on account of her ill health.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What?!” Ruri exclaimed in response to this. “I-ill health?! I-is she okay?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. There is no need for concern. Is there, Lady Saika?” Kuroe’s gaze all but impelled him to play along.</p>
<p class="TX">“H-huh? Ah, r-right.” Mushiki nodded.</p>
<p class="TX">“So? What did you want to say?” Erulka asked, chin in hand.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe gave a nod of assent. “Yesterday, Lady Saika was attacked by an unknown assailant. We suspect they were most likely a mage, but we haven’t been able to confirm their identity. It’s possible they might try to strike again, so we would like to request a strengthening of the security net.”</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“…?!”</i></p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 37. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_37" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The faces of everyone gathered stiffened.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wha—?! M-Madam Witch was attacked?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“And they managed to get away without being identified…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Th-that’s not possible!”</p>
<p class="TX">The members of the Garden’s management department were visibly shaken.</p>
<p class="TX">To be honest, so was Mushiki.</p>
<p class="TX">Lowering his voice, he whispered: “Is it really okay to tell them that, Kuroe?”</p>
<p class="TX">“There should be no issue so long as we keep Lady Saika’s present state under wraps. Rather, this should ensure that they remain more vigilant from now on,” Kuroe said flatly while observing the panic of the others present.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki nodded in understanding. Right. If they said nothing, his assailant could try to strike again while he was still vulnerable.</p>
<p class="TX">“Bah! Ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!”</p>
<p class="TX">In the midst of that great confusion, one voice broke out into laughter—Anviet’s.</p>
<p class="TX">“You’re sayin’ you let an enemy knock you for a loop, <i>and</i> you let ’em get away without even figurin’ out who they were? Ha! Disgraceful! I guess our good old Madam Witch has gotta be feelin’ her age, huh?” he scoffed with an exaggerated shrug.</p>
<p class="TX">At this, Ruri, who until that moment had been watching Mushiki with concern, turned to Anviet with a scowl. “You’ve got a big mouth today, Anviet. <i>You</i> can hardly talk, seeing how many times you’ve lost to Madam Witch yourself. Isn’t that right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hah…?” One eyebrow twitching, Anviet glared back at her.</p>
<p class="TX">Yet Ruri sought to fan the flames further. “This mysterious assailant couldn’t be <i>you</i>, could it? Did you finally realize you’re no match for her and so decided to ambush her in a sneak attack?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Haaah?! Wh-why, you—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh, my apologies. I let myself get carried away just then. There’s no way <i>you</i> could be the attacker… If <i>you</i> had tried anything, she would have turned the tables on you before you could so much as bat an eye!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 38. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_38" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“I’ll kill you, dammit!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Bring it on!”</p>
<p class="TX">Anviet and Ruri both jumped up from their seats so fast that they sent their chairs flying.</p>
<p class="TX">All at once, the room was filled with an oppressive air, light itself whirling around the two opposing figures.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless—</p>
<p class="TX">“Silence! Fight on your own time!”</p>
<p class="TX">Erulka, seated between Anviet and Ruri and clearly irritated, slapped the both of them with the sleeves of her long robe.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh…”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Ms. Erulka.”</p>
<p class="TX">Though reluctant and still on edge, the two calmed down and retook their seats. The various faces of the management department each breathed sighs of relief.</p>
<p class="TX">“Very well. We’ll make the necessary arrangements… Do you have anything else to report?” Erulka demanded, her eyes locked on Kuroe.</p>
<p class="TX">Taking this as her cue, Kuroe added softly: “Lady Saika would like to make a proposal.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh? And what would that be? Speak.”</p>
<p class="TX">“First, for the time being, she will refrain from responding personally to annihilation events lower than obliteration-grade. She also wishes to reduce the frequency of these regular meetings.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm… That can be arranged, but why? Don’t tell me she was injured in the attack?” Erulka stared straight into Mushiki’s eyes.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki felt his heart skip a beat in the face of that gaze, which seemed to look right through him.</p>
<p class="TX">Nevertheless, Kuroe remained serenely calm as she shook her head. “That would be preposterous. Regardless of the opponent, it’s unthinkable that Lady Saika would suffer injury.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I know. I was joking… But why, then?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Lady Saika has another matter to attend to.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What other matter?” Erulka tilted her head quizzically.</p>
<p class="TX">With that, Kuroe gave her a single, confident nod before declaring:</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 39. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_39" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Yes. Starting tomorrow, Lady Saika will be attending the Garden as a student.”</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX"><i>“…Huh?”</i></p>
<p class="TX">All those in the room, Mushiki included, were rendered thunderstruck by those words.</p>
