<p class="COTX">When Mushiki next regained consciousness, he found himself looking out at the same scene as when he had first arrived at the Garden.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah…”</p>
<p class="TX">A large bedroom. A huge canopy bed. Antique furniture. Thick carpets. Everything, even down to the angle of the morning sun cutting across the room, was like a reenactment of his first time here.</p>
<p class="TX">There could be no doubt about it. He was in Saika’s bedroom in her mansion. For a moment, he wondered whether he hadn’t slipped back in time.</p>
<p class="TX">No. As he sat up in bed, he noticed one crucial difference.</p>
<p class="TX">Right now, he was in his own body, not Saika’s.</p>
<p class="TX">His mind cleared, and his hazy memories came together to form a picture.</p>
<p class="TX">The situation that he had found himself in. Fighting against a Saika from the future. And then…</p>
<p class="TX">“…Future Saika…”</p>
<p class="TX">Just as he was about to climb down from the bed in his haste—</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh, so you’re awake?” came a voice from his side.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah…” Taken by surprise, he glanced across the room.</p>
<p class="TX">There, sitting alone in a chair, was Kuroe.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 196. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_196" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s eyes widened in astonishment as he all but fell from the bed, hitting his head on the floor with a tremendous thud.</p>
<p class="TX">“Owww…”</p>
<p class="TX">“There’s no need to panic. I’m not going to run away,” Kuroe said with a shrug.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">In silence, Mushiki lifted himself up from the floor and knelt down on one knee.</p>
<p class="TX">…Yes, much like a knight in the service of a royal princess.</p>
<p class="TX">“What happened? You look different. Did you have a change of heart?” Kuroe asked, tilting her head inquisitively.</p>
<p class="TX">“Thank you, Saika,” Mushiki said as he looked up at her.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Huh?” Kuroe answered, raising one eyebrow in consternation.</p>
<p class="TX">He lacked definitive proof, but in his heart, he was certain.</p>
<p class="TX">“You say some strange things,” Kuroe said. “What makes you think <i>I’m</i> Saika?”</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s difficult to put it into words…but if I had to say…your aura, maybe?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh…? Ha—ha-ha-ha.” Kuroe, apparently finding his response amusing, broke into laughter. “I see, I see… So you saw through me so easily. Perhaps I should have expected no less of you, Mushiki.”</p>
<p class="TX">Then, after a brief chuckle, she gave him a kind smile. “It feels like it’s been a long time since I was last in a situation like this… But yes, I am Saika Kuozaki, headmistress of Void’s Garden. You’ve done well, Mushiki.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Thank you.”</p>
<p class="TX">This honor, an acknowledgment from Saika herself, was more than he deserved. Mushiki bowed his head in gratitude.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, quickly remembering something, he looked up. “Ah, right! Are you okay? Your injuries?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t worry. That body is being repaired as we speak,” Kuroe—or rather, Saika—responded with a wave of her hand.</p>
<p class="TX">Her explanation struck Mushiki as somewhat puzzling.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“That body…?”</i></p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 197. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_197" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Ah. Strictly speaking, the body you saw yesterday and this one now are different. Both are experimental homunculi. Their composition is very close to that of regular human beings, but they have no souls. They’re essentially living dolls. I prepared them to serve as refuges for my soul—substitute bodies, you could say—in the event that something should happen to me. Though, I never suspected I would have to use them so soon.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<i>Homunculi…?</i>” Mushiki repeated in a daze.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes.” Saika nodded. “So long as my original body is still alive, my assailant would attempt to strike again. As such, I disguised myself as Saika Kuozaki’s attendant to support you… I must apologize. I did want to reveal myself sooner, but I was cautious. I didn’t know the full extent of our enemy’s strength.”</p>
<p class="TX">“N-no, it’s okay…” Mushiki shook his head.</p>
<p class="TX">…So Kuroe had been Saika all along.</p>
<p class="TX">Knowing that, everything that had happened since he had merged with her and had been brought to this Garden, from the first event to the last, took on new meaning.</p>
<p class="TX">He had been alongside her this whole time, all while occupying her original body.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s like they say, true happiness really is close at hand.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…I mean it; is something wrong?” Saika asked, cocking her head to one side with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p class="TX">Perhaps realizing that that question wouldn’t provide much in the way of a response, she stood up from her chair. “Mushiki,” she began. “Again, I thank you. I truly am in your debt. That’s no joke—without you, I would have died… I never would have imagined that my future self might travel back in time to kill me,” she said with a hint of self-derision.</p>
<p class="TX">At these words, Mushiki lifted his face. “Right, about that. What happened to the future you? I passed out, so…”</p>
<p class="TX">Saika averted her gaze. “She’s already gone. I suspect her life force ran out.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 198. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_198" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…?! I couldn’t have—”</p>
<p class="TX">Saika stopped him there with a shake of her head. “She said the world was destroyed in the future… The World King and the world itself are one and the same. She must have already been close to her limit. So it isn’t your fault. Don’t make the mistake of blaming yourself for her death.”</p>
<p class="TX">After that stern remonstration, Saika’s expression relaxed. “One thing is certain—the fact that you are still alive is proof that you won… So stand proud. You surpassed me—albeit under special circumstances.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…! No, I could never surpass you. I just kind of lost myself, and then one thing led to another…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ha-ha. So I lost to someone who didn’t even have full control over his magic? Maybe I ought to give <i>you</i> the title of strongest mage?” Saika joked.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki shrugged in gratitude and embarrassment.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, flashing him another smile, Saika added, “Now, then. You’re the one who saved this world, and you deserve to be properly rewarded. Under normal circumstances, I would like to see you properly compensated and offer to let you return to the outside…” She paused for a moment before continuing: “But unfortunately, it won’t be that easy. My body is still merged with yours. And above all, my future self left behind a terrible legacy—her prophecy that in the not-too-distant future, the world <i>will</i> be destroyed. She provided us with no more information to go on… So I’m sorry to have to say this, but I don’t think I’ll be able to let you go free. At least not until we find a way to separate my body from yours.” She spoke with authority, though her face was apologetic.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki shook his head. “I made a promise with the future Saika. I’ll find a way to save the world. You’ll just make me angry if you try to stop me.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki…” Saika seemed somewhat surprised for a moment but quickly looked away as she shook her head. “Ah… Yes, I see. You <i>are</i> that kind of person… You really should value your own life a little more.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 199. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_199" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Despite her words, she seemed slightly amused. Then, staring into his eyes, she said, “In that case, Mushiki, I command you.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Become the other half of my body and keep on saving the world until the time comes for us to separate.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Er, I don’t like the sound of that.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…” Saika stared back at him in all seriousness. “Can’t you just go along with it for now?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I don’t like the second part. About having to separate at some later date,” Mushiki said.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Oh?” Saika answered, her eyebrows climbing up her forehead. “I see. If you’re so determined, I suppose it would be an insult to ask you to reconsider.” Still staring into his eyes, she extended her hand. “Then dedicate yourself to me. Save the world by my side.”</p>
<p class="TX">“With pleasure,” Mushiki answered without hesitation as he took her hand in his own. “Also, once this crisis is over, and if we find a way to separate our bodies, I do have one request.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh? Then ask,” Saika said, watching him with piqued interest.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki looked straight back into her eyes as he answered: “Give me the right to propose to you.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…What did you just say?” Saika muttered, her eyes widening in surprise.</p>
<p class="TX">After a brief second, she showed him a soft smile. “Very well. I look forward to it.”</p>
