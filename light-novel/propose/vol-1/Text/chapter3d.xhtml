<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 99. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_99" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Hmm…? Have we met before? Oh-ho, or are you trying a pickup line on me in front of the whole class?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Um, er, that isn’t what I meant…” Mushiki shook his head in an attempt to defuse the situation.</p>
<p class="TX">Tomoe, however, licked her lips, narrowed her eyes, and stroked Mushiki’s chin with the tip of her finger… “Oh-ho… That <i>is</i> a rather generic pickup strategy, but I don’t mind. You’ve got some audacity. I’ll play along. Come see me in the staff room after school. I’ll give you one of my <i>special extracurricular lessons</i>,” she said in a sexy whisper.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s eyes all but popped from their sockets at this stark difference in her attitude.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Kuroe glanced deliberately toward the door at the side of the room. “Oh! Good morning, Lady Saika.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Kyaaarrrggghhh…?! N-n-no, it isn’t what it looks like, Madam Witch…! It’s all a misunderstanding! I would never, ever try to seduce a pretty young boy while on duty…!”</p>
<p class="TX">All of a sudden, Tomoe, who had until just then been emitting a sickly scent of self-confidence and seductive sex appeal, fell to the floor with tears in her eyes, pressing her forehead against the ground as though begging for her very life.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oops, excuse me. I must have mistaken someone else for her.”</p>
<p class="TX">“U-ugh… Be more careful in the future, please. You made my heart skip a beat just then. You could have shaved years off my life span… Anyway, Kuga, see me after—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah. I think it might be Lady Saika, after all.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Kyaaarrrggghhh! I’m kidding! You know I have a weak heart, Madam Witch! I would never say something like that seriously! It’s just one of my little jokes… Ohhh! I’m sure I’ll live an even longer life by worshipping you, Madam Witch…! Thank you, thank you!”</p>
<p class="TX">Once again, Tomoe was lying flat on the floor like an obsequious grasshopper.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 100. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_100" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Kuroe stared down at her coldly before glancing back at Mushiki. “Don’t worry. Lady Saika will be absent today.”</p>
<p class="TX">With that announcement, the other students, watching on with bated breaths, let out sighs of relief. They were probably all on tenterhooks, wondering when Saika would arrive to join them.</p>
<p class="TX">Tomoe was the only one who didn’t seem to hear her, still bowing her head low to the ground.</p>
<p class="TX">“Well, the teacher doesn’t look ready to get up yet. Let’s take our seats,” Kuroe suggested.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Right.”</p>
<p class="TX">Following Kuroe’s lead did seem to be the best way forward here, so Mushiki left Tomoe, still cowering on the floor at the prospect of Saika’s reappearance, to the back of the room.</p>
<p class="TX">Only then did he notice it.</p>
<p class="TX">While most students were watching Tomoe’s scandalous behavior with some combination of forced smiles and abject shock, one was staring straight at Mushiki, her face awash with pure astonishment.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-wh-what…?”</p>
<p class="TX">It was the genius mage, the knight serving directly under the school’s headmistress, and Mushiki’s younger sister, who had last seen him back when their parents separated.</p>
<p class="TX">With a rattling clatter, Ruri Fuyajoh rose to her feet and pointed at him.</p>
<p class="TX">“…What are <i>you</i> doing <i>here</i>, Mushiki…?!” she cried.</p>
<p class="TX">The suddenness of her outburst prompted the remaining students to turn her way in surprise, then to follow her outstretched hand until their eyes rested on Mushiki.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh…? Do you know him?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Didn’t we see him in the corridor this morning, though?”</p>
<p class="TX">As various voices echoed throughout the room, Hizumi’s eyes opened wide in sudden remembrance. “I thought I recognized that name… Don’t tell me; is he your brother, Ruri…?”</p>
<p class="TX">That exclamation only added fuel to the fire that had already engulfed the room.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 101. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_101" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Eh? Didn’t you say your brother was born in April?”</p>
<p class="TX">“But Ruri was born in March, so even though he’s almost a year older than her, that would put them in the same year level.”</p>
<p class="TX">“He’s the one you gave a picture frame made of seashells to for his fifth birthday?”</p>
<p class="TX">“The one with the charming little mole on his neck?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? How do all these people I’ve never even met before know so much about me?” Mushiki exclaimed, the sound of his voice adding to the chorus coming as a surprise even to himself.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, as though offering an answer to that question, all eyes turned to Ruri… Apparently, she was the source of that information.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, Ruri, seemingly unable to hear those around her, took one shaky step after another toward Mushiki.</p>
<p class="TX">Only then, fixing him in her fiery gaze, did she say: “I’ll ask you again. What are you doing at the Garden? No…first of all, how did you even find out about this place? Were you scouted by the administrative department? Or did another Fuyajoh put this idea in your head?” Using an aggressive voice, she interrogated him.</p>
<p class="TX">Menace, power, resolution—there were many words for it, but she exuded an invisible sense of pressure that had been handed down across the generations, and at that moment, Mushiki was experiencing it firsthand. Perhaps his classmates had sensed it, too, as they remained completely silent.</p>
<p class="TX">The atmosphere in the room was indeed different from yesterday and the excitement when Saika had joined the class. It was as though some ancient instinct, lost amid the peace of modern civilization, had just been reawakened. It was a feeling of being confronted by an apex predator, a commanding force that would take no half answers.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Ruri felt so <i>real</i> that even Mushiki, with all his ignorance and inexperience, could sense it.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri…”</p>
<p class="TX">Of course, he could hardly give her an honest answer with everyone <span aria-label=" Page 102. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_102" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>watching. It would be a betrayal to Saika and could even put his own life in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="TX">It was clear that she wouldn’t accept any lies, and something told him that she would see straight through any attempt at deception.</p>
<p class="TX">As such, he decided to lay bare his true feelings free from deceit and came out with the words he had been unable to give voice to in Saika’s body: “I’m so happy to see you again, Ruri.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh?!” She spun around, letting out a crazed cry.</p>
<p class="TX">Her face had turned bright red, her eyes swimming like a pair of migratory fish.</p>
<p class="TX">Nevertheless, she soon regained her mental fortitude, straightening her back as she took in a deep breath. Perhaps she was sweating a little, as her bangs stuck to her forehead.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Y-you can’t fool me. Give me a proper answer—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Look at you. You’ve grown into a real beauty, Ruri.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Guew-eh-geh-heh…!” She choked, her appearance at that moment somewhat far from beautiful.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki rushed over, sitting her back down and patting her on the back. “Are you all right? There’s no need to rush, so just—”</p>
<p class="TX">“…!”</p>
<p class="TX">A moment later, she suddenly jerked away, jumping up and fleeing from his outstretched hand.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, glaring at him, her face as red as a tomato and with tears streaming down her eyes, she cried, “D-don’t think you’ve won! I won’t accept this! I swear, I’m going to get you kicked out of this Garden! I swear it! Aaauuuggghhh!”</p>
<p class="TX">With that, she bolted for the entrance and disappeared into the hallway.</p>
<p class="TX">A pensive air filled the classroom, until finally the bell rang to signal the end of homeroom.</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">Around ten minutes later, once Tomoe Kurieda finally regained her composure, the first class of the day started.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 103. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_103" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“In other words, just because a new discovery has ushered in a new generation doesn’t mean that old techniques are rendered meaningless. Rather…”</p>
<p class="TX">As with the day before, Tomoe was making use of the electronic blackboard as she continued her lecture on the history of magic.</p>
<p class="TX">No, actually, there <i>was</i> something different from the previous day, unflattering though it might be to point out. Unlike yesterday, when she had been visibly intimidated by Saika’s presence, she now came across as truly imposing.</p>
<p class="TX">She had puffed out her chest with confidence, and her words were flowing one after the next without a hint of hesitation. She even had the presence of mind to joke with the students sometimes, inviting every now and then the occasional laugh. This, no doubt, was her usual teaching style.</p>
<p class="TX">The overall mood in the classroom was much more relaxed this time around.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki was naturally attracting some attention, but all the same, his classmates seemed considerably more at ease. That said, a few continued to watch his every move.</p>
<p class="TX">Well, there was <i>one</i> female student who kept glowering at him.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes, while Ruri had fled from the classroom, she returned to her seat in time for first period.</p>
<p class="TX">The siblings had managed to become the center of attention, but with Ruri’s steely mental fortitude, she didn’t seem to be particularly bothered by it.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Mushiki.” Perhaps that stare was getting to <i>her</i>, though, as with Tomoe still lecturing at the front of the room, Kuroe whispered across to him.</p>
<p class="TX">“What now, Kuroe?”</p>
<p class="TX">“You did mention that you and Knight Fuyajoh are brother and sister, but was your relationship an acrimonious one, by any chance?”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, I wouldn’t say that… We got along well.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Then why is she glaring at you like that?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Well…,” Mushiki murmured, at a loss for an answer.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 104. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_104" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>At that moment, Tomoe, standing beside the teacher’s table, pointed straight at him. “Kuga! I can see that you’re excited about your first class, but no private conversations while I’m talking, okay?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah… Sorry.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm, you’re a hopeless one, aren’t you? Yep, you’re going to need some discipline, I think. A firm hand. After school—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Look,” Kuroe said, pointing into the hallway as though having just noticed something.</p>
<p class="TX">Tomoe fell silent, glancing nervously behind her. “Eh… It isn’t <i>her</i>, is it?” Fear having taken hold of her, she glanced carefully through the entrance, inspected the corridor, then returned to her position by the electronic blackboard with a look of relief.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, after taking a deep breath to calm herself, she turned back to Mushiki. “Well, never mind. So, Kuga. If you have time to chat, that must mean you already understand what we’re here to learn, no? Why don’t you try answering a few questions, then?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Um, but I don’t really understand…,” he answered without delay.</p>
<p class="TX">Tomoe nonetheless let out a fearless laugh. “In that case, I wish you could at least <i>act</i> a little more worried for me, though…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Sorry,” Mushiki said. “But I still don’t really understand what magic actually is in the first place…”</p>
<p class="TX">With that admission, he heard the others throughout the room exhaling in exasperation or otherwise letting out amused chuckles.</p>
<p class="TX">The meaning behind those words was almost identical to what he had said the day before, but the reactions now were at stark odds to when Saika had asked a similar question.</p>
<p class="TX">“Come on, seriously? How did an amateur like this even get into our prestigious Garden?” said a tall male student with an exaggerated shrug (incidentally, the very same student who had described Saika’s similar query as deep and profound).</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh dear… Does he really think he’s on the same level as the rest of us?” A bespectacled female student added (the same one who had held her head in her hands in acute distress when he had asked about magic and magical energy).</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 105. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_105" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Heh… Look how dumb and naive he is. This’ll be interesting,” said a male student sitting by the window as he brushed a hand through his long bangs (he had praised Saika’s question as thought-provoking and insightful).</p>
<p class="TX">And finally…</p>
<p class="TX">“…Ah?”</p>
<p class="TX">Perhaps in response to those other reactions, a chilling voice echoed throughout the room.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri glanced around with bloodshot eyes, her brow wrinkled, veins throbbing on her forehead.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“…?!”</i></p>
<p class="TX">Pinned down by her gaze, the students who had been laughing at Mushiki’s expense fell suddenly silent.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, Ruri herself said nothing more.</p>
<p class="TX">Having announced that she would throw him out of the Garden, she could hardly come to his defense now. That said, she wouldn’t stand to hear anyone other than herself speak ill of him, either. Or so it seemed to Mushiki. She was almost like a rival character in a boys’ comic book.</p>
<p class="TX">“R-Ruri? Ruri…?” Hizumi asked, flustered as she tapped her on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="TX">Finally, bringing her anger back under control, Ruri let out a loud snort and turned back to the front of the room.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Er, um… I-is it okay to continue the lesson…?” Tomoe, having no doubt sensed the fraught atmosphere, was visibly sweating.</p>
<p class="TX">“Of course,” Ruri answered matter-of-factly. “Hurry along, please. This <i>is</i> your job, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Uh…”</p>
<p class="TX">After that snide remark, pulling a long face, Tomoe reluctantly turned back to the class.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">After somehow pulling through that distressing lecture, third period finally rolled around, and Mushiki headed to the training hall at the <span aria-label=" Page 106. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_106" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>central school building with the rest of his class. Like fifth and sixth periods yesterday, it was time for another of Anviet’s practical skills classes.</p>
<p class="TX">Having changed into his gym clothes, Mushiki shrugged lightly as he stepped foot into the hall.</p>
<p class="TX">Like his uniform, the outfit Kuroe had picked out for him fit perfectly. He had no idea when she had managed to take his measurements, but she was clearly very diligent.</p>
<p class="TX">“I was a little concerned about letting you out of my sight, but it looks like I needn’t have worried,” sounded a voice from behind him.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki glanced over his shoulder and laid eyes on Kuroe, dressed in the same style of gym clothes as him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? But a state conversion from Saika’s body to mine should only happen when I release too much magical energy, right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I expect so, but this <i>is</i> the first time I’ve ever actually dealt with two people merged into one. You never know.”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki could only force a smile at that off-putting remark. “Well… I’ll be okay. I mean, I’m using the men’s locker room this time. Seriously, it’s wonderful. With no girls around, you really can relax in there.”</p>
<p class="TX">“That statement could invite a misunderstanding,” Kuroe said, watching him through narrowed eyes.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Anviet came in from the back of the training hall. “All right, let’s get started. Gather round, you hear?” he said as though weighed down, beckoning lazily.</p>
<p class="TX">As a group, the students lined up in front of him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Okay, then. Once you’re finished with the prep exercises, we’re gonna continue with the same practice we started yesterday. We’ve got a lot of targets, so we’ll divide into groups, and…” His voice dropped off there.</p>
<p class="TX">For a second, Mushiki wondered whether something had gone wrong, but it wasn’t long before he realized what exactly it was.</p>
<p class="TX">Among the students, Ruri was holding her hand raised high into the air.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 107. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_107" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Can I ask something, Mr. Svarner?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh. Fuyajoh? What do you want?”</p>
<p class="TX">“We have two new transfer students today. This will be their first practical class.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Transfer students…? Ah, right, I did hear somethin’ about that…,” Anviet said as he rubbed the back of his head. He surveyed the assembled students before locking onto Mushiki and Kuroe. “You two… Huh? Aren’t you Kuozaki’s servant or somethin’? What are <i>you</i> doin’ here?”</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe paid his scowl little mind as she nodded back to him in greeting.</p>
<p class="TX">Looking like he had no interest in continuing that conversation, Anviet let out a loud snort and turned next to Mushiki. “And you are…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki Kuga.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, right, got it. Let’s see how memorable you are,” Anviet said with a dismissive wave of his hand before turning back to Ruri. “There. Are you happy now? Newbies, if you don’t know how to do the prep exercises, get one of these guys to teach you. As for the real trainin’…if you can handle it, good. If you can’t, watch the others first. Observation is part of the learnin’ process.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Can I ask permission for something?” Ruri asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“Permission? What for?” Anviet responded suspiciously.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri then turned her piercing gaze toward Mushiki. “To fight Mushiki Kuga in a mock battle.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hah?”</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“…!”</i></p>
<p class="TX">Anviet furrowed his brow at this challenge, while the other students watched in utter astonishment. Kuroe’s eyes likewise twitched in concern.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri’s comment back in the classroom echoed in Mushiki’s mind. She had said that she would throw him out of the Garden, though he wasn’t sure why. Perhaps she meant to hurt him, to break his heart?</p>
<p class="TX">Had she chosen a mock battle in the middle of class over a duel or a <span aria-label=" Page 108. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_108" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>sneak ambush out of a sense of discipline, or did she want her classmates to witness the mortification from this unseemly encounter?</p>
<p class="TX">Whatever the case, the situation in the training hall took a turn for the worse.</p>
<p class="TX">Even so…</p>
<p class="TX">“…Huh? What’re you goin’ on about? There’s no way I’m lettin’ you fight in here,” Anviet said sternly but decisively.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri must have convinced herself that he would go along with her proposal, as her eyes showed dissatisfaction. “Why not?” she asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“<i>Why not…?</i> Maybe because you’re an S-class mage, and he’s a newbie transfer student? You tell me, why <i>would</i> I allow it? Are you a battle maniac or somethin’…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Anviet’s argument was a sound one, and Ruri could only bite her lip in frustration.</p>
<p class="TX">Somehow, Mushiki felt as if he could sense her bloodred gaze on him.</p>
<p class="TX">In truth, he felt a little sorry for her.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hey! Quit dawdlin’ and get on those prep exercises! When you’re done, run three laps around the trainin’ ground and get your asses back here!” Anviet shouted, interrupting the frayed atmosphere that had fallen over the hall.</p>
<p class="TX">The students, though still looking ill at ease, did as instructed.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri likewise started her preparatory exercises, though her eyes were bloodshot. If anything, she pushed herself more than anyone else in the room. When she ran, her arms and legs swung beautifully. She may have been his own sister, but Mushiki caught his breath in admiration at her diligence and dedication.</p>
<p class="TX">After finishing the warm-up exercises, the students gathered around once more in the center of the hall.</p>
<p class="TX">By then, Anviet had readied close to a dozen ball-shaped targets complete with arms and legs.</p>
<p class="TX">“One at a time, got that? Up to your second substantiations. If you can’t handle them alone, you can surround the targets in groups of <span aria-label=" Page 109. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_109" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>two or three. And if you slack off, I’ll be there to give you a good kick in the ass!”</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“Right!”</i></p>
<p class="TX">Following those orders, the students turned to their targets of choice, giving them their full attention.</p>
<p class="TX">“…!”</p>
<p class="TX">As he watched, Mushiki found himself rubbing his eyes in disbelief.</p>
<p class="TX">“Is something the matter, Mushiki?” Kuroe asked.</p>
<p class="TX">He blinked a few times before answering. “Ah, um… It’s kind of vague, but I think I can see everyone’s magical energy a little…”</p>
<p class="TX">Right. At this point in time, Mushiki wasn’t in his Saika mode—and yet he could make out, albeit only vaguely, the magical energy emanating from his classmates’ bodies.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe, however, didn’t seem at all surprised as she nodded. “That isn’t inconceivable. As I said before, the first hurdle to learning magic is being able to grasp a formerly unknown sense. But you, Mushiki, have already passed through that stage thanks to your merging with Lady Saika. Your mind is already that of a fully developed mage.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What…?” He glanced down at his own hands. “Are you saying Saika has made my body mature, too?”</p>
<p class="TX">“In a manner of speaking,” Kuroe said coolly before clearing her throat. “That being said, any other mage would be green with envy to have what you currently possess. After all, you have overcome the first hurdle unknowingly, all by drawing on the powers and abilities of the world’s most powerful mage.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Does that mean I can actually <i>use</i> magic, then?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Something tells me it won’t be that convenient… But you may at least be able to release some power. Why don’t you give it a try?” With that, Kuroe pointed to a target on the far wall.</p>
<p class="TX">There, across the room, a small glowing ball complete with a pair of legs was standing there forlornly.</p>
<p class="TX">“Right. It might not work, but I’ll give it a try.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 110. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_110" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Saying that, Mushiki faced his target and began to focus, doing his best to recall what it had felt like to wield magic in Saika’s body.</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">“You, Munakata. You ain’t channelin’ your magical energy there properly. Don’t think of your substantiations as weapons. Think of them as extensions of your limbs… And you, Mabuchi. If all you can pull off is your first substantiation, that’ll do. You should still be able to get in a hit, so long as you focus. Find a way to get the result you want with the cards you have.”</p>
<p class="TX">Anviet, his hands stuffed into his tracksuit pockets, was walking around the room giving each of the students advice in turn as they faced off against their targets.</p>
<p class="TX">One or two crests had appeared somewhere on each of the students’ bodies, a telltale sign that they were activating their substantiation techniques.</p>
<p class="TX">It was a rare thing for a mage to be able to activate their second substantiation. <i>How many of these kids would be able to unlock their third substantiations over the course of their lifetimes?</i> Anviet wondered.</p>
<p class="TX">“…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, as he surveyed the training hall, he felt a sudden chill run down his spine. He turned around.</p>
<p class="TX">It wasn’t an exceptionally strong source of magical power that he had recognized, nor malevolent intent, but rather some sensation that he found difficult to put into words.</p>
<p class="TX">Nevertheless, his instincts as a mage, and his intuition as a knight, prevented him from regaining his composure.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted Ruri. She, it seemed, had noticed it, too, and was scanning the room intently.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>What the hell?</i></p>
<p class="TX">Anviet gulped, his eyes opening wide.</p>
<p class="TX">Across the hall were several students, most of them struggling to reach their targets.</p>
<p class="TX">One was surrounded by a plume of wind, her first substantiation.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 111. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_111" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Another was wielding the massive hammer that characterized his second substantiation.</p>
<p class="TX">And another…one of the new transfer students, simply stood there, hands raised, no crest whatsoever appearing on his body.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">At this last sight, Anviet found himself scratching at his cheek. “No way,” he murmured, when—</p>
<p class="TX">“What…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">A loud alarm had begun to sound throughout the Garden, followed by countless cracks erupting in the sky overhead.</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">“Huh…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, his eyes squeezed shut from concentrating, suddenly glanced upward as the alarm echoed around them.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, several deep fissures broke through the sky hanging over the training hall.</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki,” Kuroe called out, running toward him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kuroe!” he called back, flustered. “Is this…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">That sound. This phenomenon.</p>
<p class="TX">It was just like what had happened the first day of his arrival at the Garden.</p>
<p class="TX">“There’s no doubt about it. It’s an annihilation factor. But to appear without warning like this…”</p>
<p class="TX">As though to silence her, one of the fissures hanging overhead tore larger and larger—until before they knew it, a huge, hulking monster began to emerge from behind it.</p>
<p class="TX">Razor-sharp claws. A body lined with toughened scales. Wings reminiscent of a bat. A head lined with horns and fangs.</p>
<p class="TX">Annihilation Factor No. 206: Dragon.</p>
<p class="TX">It was the exact same kind of mythical beast that Anviet had defeated with a single blow.</p>
<p class="TX">However, there was something decidedly different this time—the sheer number of those creatures.</p>
<p class="TX">Back then, there had been only one, though that alone had been <span aria-label=" Page 112. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_112" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>enough to reduce the city beyond the Garden’s walls into a sea of flames.</p>
<p class="TX">But now…</p>
<p class="TX">“A hundred…two hundred…no, there’s more of them…?!” A lone, dismayed voice reverberated through the training hall.</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed. Those dragons were now so numerous, all but shrouding the sky above, that it was impossible to ascertain their exact number.</p>
<p class="TX">That wasn’t all.</p>
<p class="TX">Deep amid the throng, through a massive spatial fissure, a giant specimen reared its head.</p>
<p class="TX">As he took in that sight, Anviet stared back wide-eyed. “Hah?! Annihilation Factor No. 48: Fafnir?! What the hell is a double-digit monster doing <i>here</i>?! And with all these dragons?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“This is no time for your whining! Get the students out of here!” Ruri thundered.</p>
<p class="TX">Her voice now was no longer that of a student, but of a knight, one of the Garden’s most capable guardians.</p>
<p class="TX">“Like I need <i>you</i> to tell <i>me</i> that! B-class mages and above, return fire! C-class and below, fall back to the central area!”</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“R-right…!”</i></p>
<p class="TX">As instructed, most of the students hurried to evacuate the training ground, with only a small few remaining behind.</p>
<p class="TX">As though having anticipated the students’ attempt to flee to safety, several dragons descended from above, planting themselves directly in their path.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-whoa!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Kyah?!”</p>
<p class="TX">The students cowered in terror as the dragons let out tremendous roars.</p>
<p class="TX">“Tch…”</p>
<p class="TX">But before the creatures could attack those who had attempted to flee, two halo rings shimmered to life on Anviet’s back.</p>
<p class="TX">“Second Substantiation: Vajdola!”</p>
<p class="TX">Two vajras appeared by his side as he fired a barrage of thunderbolts.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 113. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_113" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>At that moment, the first dragon’s head as it closed in on the students was dismembered and sent flying. With a heavy crash, its hulking body sank to the floor, disappearing in a burst of light.</p>
<p class="TX">“Are you okay?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Y-yes!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Then get the hell out of here!” Anviet roared.</p>
<p class="TX">The students, though panicked, took off once more.</p>
<p class="TX">There was no end to the number of dragons. One after another, they descended onto the training ground, clearly unwilling to let even a single person escape.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ugh…” Frowning, Anviet used another lightning bolt to send a dragon’s head flying, before shredding its wings and punching a huge hole through its body.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki was reminded of a thunder-clad god of war as he watched Anviet rage.</p>
<p class="TX">There was an obvious difference in their respective power levels. One after the next, he crushed dragon after dragon underfoot.</p>
<p class="TX">The problem, however, was the overwhelming number of those annihilation factors. Searching for gaps in Anviet’s defenses, the dragons continued to charge toward the students.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki and Kuroe were no exception.</p>
<p class="TX">“Whoa…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“…! Ngh…”</p>
<p class="TX">Seeing the two, a huge dragon descended from the sky. Kuroe threw herself in front of him, as though to use herself as a shield.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kuroe!” Mushiki cried, grabbing her by the shoulder and pulling her toward himself as he turned his back to the creature.</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki…?!” Her voice, tinged with astonishment, echoed in his ears.</p>
<p class="TX">The impact he was expecting failed to reach him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Second Substantiation: Luminous Blade!”</p>
<p class="TX">Just as Ruri’s voice sounded out, the dragon’s massive body was sliced into pieces before it could touch him or the other students.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wha—?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 114. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_114" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>With dismembered pieces of the dragon still raining around her, Ruri landed directly in front of him.</p>
<p class="TX">Two patterns reminiscent of demon masks had appeared above her head, while in her hands she grasped a <i>naginata</i>, its blade gleaming like a demonic will-o’-the-wisp.</p>
<p class="TX">For a moment, Mushiki caught his breath at the divine majesty of that sight.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri, however, wore a grim expression as she grabbed him by the front of his shirt. “This is a mage’s battlefield. I don’t know how you found out about the Garden, but give it up! You’re no mage…! Get out of here! And don’t ever get involved in our world again!” she ordered him.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, in a quiet voice, she addressed Kuroe. “And you, Kuroe, was it? I don’t know what interest an attendant to Madam Witch might have with Mushiki, but you must know how to handle yourself, right? Look after him for me.”</p>
<p class="TX">With that, she took off, leaving a trail of light as she stormed toward the remaining dragons.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Mushiki.”</p>
<p class="TX">As he watched on in dismay as Ruri fought up above, Kuroe, her arms crossed, called out to him in a disgruntled voice.</p>
<p class="TX">Flustered, Mushiki released her from his arms.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe’s grim expression remained unchanged. Her brow still furrowed, she began to list her grievances. “What on earth were you thinking just then? How many times have I told you? Your body is Lady Saika’s body. <i>Your</i> death would mean <i>her</i> death.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Sorry. It just kind of happened.”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, it didn’t.” Kuroe turned away, pouting. She looked legitimately angry this time.</p>
<p class="TX">Concerned, Mushiki glanced up once more. “B-but it worked out okay, huh? Anviet is here… And Ruri is pretty strong, too. Those dragons took me by surprise, but things are looking—”</p>
<p class="TX">“…” Though Mushiki had tried to make light of the situation, Kuroe wore a troubled look. “I wonder if it really will be that easy…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 115. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_115" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“The two of them are indeed a force to be reckoned with. Moreover, backup should be on the way soon. Eventually, they <i>will</i> be able to defeat all these annihilation factors… But there are so many of them. It’s all but inevitable that they’ll cause considerable damage.”</p>
<p class="TX">“But once they’re defeated, won’t that undo all the destruction…?” Mushiki asked, remembering what had happened a few days prior.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe wrinkled her brow. “It’s true—if the annihilation factors are defeated during the window for reversible destruction, this whole incident will be as if it never happened.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Right. In that case—”</p>
<p class="TX">“However, that doesn’t apply to those who have witnessed the annihilation factors themselves—mages, in other words.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…! Are you saying if any mages die, that it will be permanent?” Mushiki demanded.</p>
<p class="TX">“That is <i>exactly</i> what I mean,” Kuroe confirmed with a pained look. “There’s only one person who could overcome this situation without suffering any casualties… Only one person who could eradicate all these dragons from the sky above us while sparing the mages down below.”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki clenched his fists and muttered, “I can only think of one mage like that…”</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">“Aaauuuggghhh!”</p>
<p class="TX">With an ear-splitting cry, Ruri brought her <i>naginata</i> swinging down.</p>
<p class="TX">Her second substantiation, Luminous Blade. That sharp blade of light jutting out at the end of the weapon’s long handle stretched like a whip, tracing an inexhaustible path as it lashed out at the annihilation factors emerging from all directions.</p>
<p class="TX">Not even those dragons with their tough hides and their all-consuming fiery breath posed much of a challenge for a Knight of the Garden. In fact, Ruri and Anviet had already defeated more than thirty of the creatures between them.</p>
<p class="TX">The problem, however, was their sheer number.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 116. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_116" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Countless dragons were still soaring above, attacking the Garden—and the outside world beyond its walls—one after the next. Through their collective efforts, the mages had somehow managed to pull through with minimal damage so far, but the surrounding city had already been reduced to smoldering ruins.</p>
<p class="TX">That horrendous sight could be restored so long as the annihilation factors were destroyed within the window for reversible destruction, but it was still a painful scene to see. Her brow furrowed in a deep frown, Ruri tightened her grip on her <i>naginata</i>.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, as though aiming for just that moment, a dragon lashed out with a plume of flames at the training ground, the air erupting with blistering heat.</p>
<p class="TX">“Tch…”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri launched into the air, using her weapon to decapitate the fire-breathing monster. Even after its enormous head crashed into the ground, flames continued to scatter around it for a few seconds.</p>
<p class="TX">There were still several students lingering in the training hall, but they were keeping their distance from the other mages, and each seemed to be protecting themselves in their own way. As she evaluated the situation out of the corner of her eye, Ruri breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="TX">Then she noticed something.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki and Kuroe were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki…,” she gasped, turning her gaze downward.</p>
<p class="TX">If he had managed to escape unharmed, that would be for the best. But her brother was an amateur, a newcomer fresh to the Garden. If he had been exposed to that sea of flames…</p>
<p class="TX">The most horrendous vision imaginable flashed before her eyes.</p>
<p class="TX">It only lasted for a brief moment, but in the heat of the battlefield, that was time enough to offer her foes a fatal opening.</p>
<p class="TX">“Gwah…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">By the time she saw it coming, the massive Fafnir-type annihilation factor had emerged from a long spatial fissure, the tall palisades of its fang-lined jaw opening wide.</p>
<p class="TX">She wouldn’t be able to escape it. She clenched her teeth as she <span aria-label=" Page 117. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_117" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>readied herself for the impact. She would have to manage, somehow, to withstand the blow so she could launch her own counterattack.</p>
<p class="TX">However—</p>
<p class="TX">“…Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, she found her eyes opening wide in shock.</p>
<p class="TX">The shot of pain she had been anticipating never came.</p>
<p class="TX">In its place, a tremendous sense of discomfort enveloped her entire body.</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed. Until just a short moment ago, her surroundings had been the training hall, the Garden, and a city reduced to a sea of flames.</p>
<p class="TX">Though what she saw laid out in front of her now…</p>
<p class="TX">…was a realm of frigid ice, with a powerful blizzard blowing all around.</p>
<p class="TX">“What…? This can’t be…”</p>
<p class="TX">It was no joke or metaphor.</p>
<p class="TX">It was as if she had been transported in the blink of an eye, moved instantaneously from one place to another. If she were anyone else, she might have considered it a dream or an illusion.</p>
<p class="TX">However, Ruri was familiar with this phenomenon, this eerie sensation.</p>
<p class="TX">The supreme <i>domain</i> that transcends <i>phenomena</i>, that ultimately comprised <i>matter</i> through <i>assimilation</i>.</p>
<p class="TX">A fourth substantiation.</p>
<p class="TX">The ultimate form of magic, capable of forging a whole miniature world.</p>
<p class="TX">There was only one person who could pull off a feat of this magnitude…</p>
<p class="TX">“What a rude guest to attempt to wreak havoc in my Garden while I’m away.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…!”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri glanced up at the sound of that voice, calling out as though in response to her unspoken thoughts.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, as she took in the sight of the girl floating before her, her voice trembled. “Madam Witch…”</p>
<p class="TX">Indeed.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 118. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_118" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>There, floating calmly before her with four whole crests activated above her head was the Witch of Resplendent Color, Saika Kuozaki.</p>
<p class="TX">For some reason, she was dressed in what looked like gym clothes—but Ruri was too shaken by emotion to think on it anymore.</p>
<p class="TX">Saika, aglow with the light of her crests, was staring down at the annihilation factors as they swarmed below.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kiss my feet… I will make all of you my brides,” she said, slowly raising one hand into the air.</p>
<p class="TX">As she did, the storm raging around her began to pick up strength, a whirlwind building with her at its center.</p>
<p class="TX">“I-is that…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“A tornado…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">The students were crying out in alarm below.</p>
<p class="TX">As though in response to their voices, a massive tornado swirling with piercing shards of ice struck the dragons all at once, centering around the Fafnir-type annihilation factor.</p>
<p class="TX">The hulking monsters were crushed beneath those icy fragments or else frozen by the subzero temperatures of the storm. Endless cries echoed through the sky but were soon drowned out by the blast of the icy tempest.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-whoooaaa?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Kyaaarrrggghhh!”</p>
<p class="TX">Of course, it wasn’t only the annihilation factors crying out, but the students, too.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless—</p>
<p class="TX">“…!”</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, Ruri blinked her eyes once more.</p>
<p class="TX">Just when she thought that the icy storm had engulfed her vision, the scenery around her changed all over again.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes, it was the same training ground where she and the others had been fighting just a moment earlier.</p>
<p class="TX">But now there wasn’t a single dragon left to be seen—not even one.</p>
<p class="TX">The students were all safe and sound, though some were lying on their backs, their eyes unseeing, probably having fainted. Others crouched low, trembling in shock.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 119. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_119" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The whole incident couldn’t have lasted more than a minute.</p>
<p class="TX">It truly was a miraculous outcome.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm… Sorry for causing a scene,” Saika said playfully as she alighted on the ground.</p>
<p class="TX">No sooner did everyone realize what had happened than they erupted in cheers.</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Touching her lips with her fingertips, Kuroe was wandering slowly across the training ground.</p>
<p class="TX">There was no longer any sign of the annihilation factors.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, transformed into Lady Saika, had wiped them out with her fourth substantiation.</p>
<p class="TX">While it looked like he still couldn’t exert proper control over his magic, it did seem that he was fully capable of wielding her powers without a problem. He was an unusual type of mage, that was certain.</p>
<p class="TX">Even so, from what Kuroe could tell, the students seemed to be unharmed. She couldn’t find fault in the outcome.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hmm.”</p>
<p class="TX">Still…</p>
<p class="TX">She glanced overhead, her expression pained.</p>
<p class="TX">“Was that really a natural occurrence, so many annihilation factors emerging all at once…?”</p>
<p class="TX">Her doubtful murmur was soon drowned out by the cheers of the students behind her.</p>
