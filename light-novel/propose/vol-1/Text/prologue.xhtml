<p class="COTX">Mushiki Kuga’s first love was a corpse.</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">He stood there, his heart throbbing, a deep sigh escaping his lips, unable to comprehend the maelstrom of emotions swirling within his chest.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki was neither a grotesque murderer nor a necromaniac.</p>
<p class="TX">At the very least, he had never killed anyone before, nor had he ever collected pictures of dead bodies. If anything, he was just as averse to such sights as anyone else.</p>
<p class="TX">But now he found himself unable to look away from the scene in front of him.</p>
<p class="TX">The girl was lying on her back, covered in blood.</p>
<p class="TX">She must have been around sixteen or seventeen years old.</p>
<p class="TX">Her face still showed traces of a lingering innocence and gave a glimpse of a certain allure on the verge of coming into flower.</p>
<p class="TX">In the glow of the streetlights, her long hair shimmered in a hue that wasn’t gold or silver.</p>
<p class="TX">Her eyes were tightly closed, so Mushiki couldn’t discern the color of her irises, but her expression only served to reinforce her well-defined nose and lips, emphasizing her somewhat inhuman beauty—almost as though he was staring at a porcelain doll.</p>
