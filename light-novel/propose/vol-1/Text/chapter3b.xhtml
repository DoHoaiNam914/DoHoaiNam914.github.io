<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 92. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_92" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“O-ooohhh…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm.” Seeing his reaction, Kuroe let out a small growl. “Mushiki. We may have a problem here.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-what problem…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“You look just like Lady Saika, but you’re too talkative, and your reactions are too innocent. I have to admit: I’m having a little too much fun here.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What…?!” Mushiki cried out, but Kuroe’s hands didn’t stop what they were doing.</p>
<p class="TX">She continued to rub the sponge across his skin in every possible direction. “Now then, raise your arms. I’ll leave your whole body shining.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hold on a min— K-kyaaarrrggghhh?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s wailing voice echoed throughout the expansive bathing area.</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">“…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">All of a sudden, Ruri, lying on her bed in Room 314 of the first girls’ dormitory building at Void’s Garden, opened her eyes and sat up.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, you’re awake. Are you okay…? Wh-what’s wrong, Ruri?” asked Hizumi, who had been reading a book in her chair, her expression serious.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Did you hear something just now?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="TX">“It was…almost like Madam Witch’s voice, like she had just discovered a sensation she’s never felt before…something halfway between shame and pleasure…I guess?”</p>
<p class="TX">As Ruri attempted to translate the vague information she had heard into meaning, Hizumi gave her a confused look. “Huh? I didn’t hear anything… Are you sure it wasn’t a dream?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yeah. It was faint, but I definitely…” She cut off there before raising her face, as though having heard it again. “…?! Hold on. Did you hear it…?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 93. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_93" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Eh…? Madam Witch’s voice?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I don’t think so… It was lower this time… I can’t believe it… It’s like it’s being violated by incessant pleasure… But that’s not all… There’s something almost nostalgic about it… It reminds me of my brother…” She forced her eyes shut as she attempted to convey those vague sensations.</p>
<p class="TX">Hizumi covered her mouth with her hand. “Ruri, do you miss your brother so much that you’re hallucinating about him…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-what? No way…!”</p>
<p class="TX">“But didn’t you say after our practical class that you thought you heard his voice somewhere…? But how could he even be in the Garden in the first place? It’s a little strange, don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="TX">“W-well, that’s…” Ruri drew her brow together in a frown. “It <i>is</i> strange… There’s no way I could mistake my own brother’s voice…”</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">“Good morning, Mushiki.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Good morning, Kuroe,” he responded when he awoke the following morning, his mind in a haze. “Um, I have a question.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Why are you lying on top of me?”</p>
<p class="TX">“So you don’t escape,” Kuroe answered flatly.</p>
<p class="TX">“Is there some reason why I would <i>want</i> to escape?” he asked apprehensively.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes, Mushiki was currently in his room in the girls’ dormitory at Void’s Garden. Lying in bed, in Saika’s body.</p>
<p class="TX">The events of the previous day must have left him exhausted, as he had fallen asleep almost immediately, and yet…</p>
<p class="TX">When he woke up, there in front of him was Kuroe, even though she ought to have been in her room next to his.</p>
<p class="TX">She was lying directly on top of him, straddling his abdomen with her thighs as she stared down at Mushiki’s face. If he wasn’t mistaken, this position was known as the <i>mount</i>. If this had happened to him while in a fight, he would have been left helpless.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 94. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_94" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Calm down, please,” he cried out. “I don’t know what ongoing feud you have with Saika, but violence isn’t the answer.”</p>
<p class="TX">“You seem to have misunderstood something.”</p>
<p class="TX">“No matter how gorgeous Saika’s looks, envy never did anyone any favors!”</p>
<p class="TX">“I suddenly feel like capitalizing on this position,” Kuroe growled as she rolled her shoulders.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki let out a choked squeal. “I’m kidding. Now, let’s get down to business, please?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<i>Get down to business</i>?” Kuroe repeated before giving him a small nod and lifting her hands.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, in one continuous movement, she began to untie the ribbon that she wore around her neck.</p>
<p class="TX">“…? Kuroe?” Mushiki asked uncertainly.</p>
<p class="TX">Without answering him, she undid the buttons on her clothes one by one.</p>
<p class="TX">She was practically undressing while sitting directly on top of him.</p>
<p class="TX">“What…what are you doing, Kuroe?!” he demanded, panicked.</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t look away,” she answered, sounding indifferent as she continued to undo the fastenings. “Look closely.”</p>
<p class="TX">It wasn’t long before all those buttons were undone, and her clothes, until then fitting her perfectly, had become rather sloppy in appearance.</p>
<p class="TX">Next, she brought her hand to her neckline, exposing her left shoulder—and the gorgeous, fair skin that lay beneath her blouse.</p>
<p class="TX">“…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Mushiki found himself squeezing his eyes tightly shut.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh. That isn’t fair, Mushiki. Look at me.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Get dressed, then!”</p>
<p class="TX">She tried to get him to look at her by pulling at his eyelids and tickling his neck, but when those attempts had little effect, she let out a small sigh. “I suppose you leave me with no choice. Let’s switch to Plan B.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…?! Kuroe?!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 95. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_95" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Having forced his eyes shut, he couldn’t actually see her, but it was clear that she was now leaning directly over him. His nose filled with the faint aroma of her scented shampoo.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki stiffened. What on earth was he supposed to do in this situation?! But before an answer could reveal itself, Kuroe caught him unawares, whispering softly into his ears. “Cupcakes are Lady Saika’s favorite food.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe’s sweet breath. A whisper that tickled his eardrums. Then the shocking revelation.</p>
<p class="TX">The moment that his mind processed everything, Mushiki’s heart contracted.</p>
<p class="TX">Her onslaught didn’t end there. Stroking his ears with her fingers, she continued. “When she washes herself, she always begins with her butt cheeks.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…!”</p>
<p class="TX">To top it all off, Kuroe then delivered the final blow. “Lady’s Saika’s bust-waist-hip measurements…are eighty-eight, fifty-nine, and eighty-six.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">A sudden heat was building up inside him, his breathing becoming ragged. He felt a slight dizziness coming on, his eyes losing focus. Then his whole body began to emanate a light glow, and—</p>
<p class="TX">“…Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">The exclamation came from the voice of a man.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes, at that moment, Mushiki’s body had just transformed from Saika’s back to his own.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm. It looks like my attempt to prompt a state conversion was successful,” Kuroe said coolly as she pulled herself back up.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki scratched at his cheek in consternation. “Um, Kuroe, was that…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. I was trying to excite you to trigger a transformation… Although, I didn’t expect it to happen so quickly,” she said, still staring at her exposed left shoulder.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 96. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_96" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…”</p>
<p class="TX">For some reason, Mushiki felt strangely embarrassed and self-conscious. But why? It wasn’t like he had done it on purpose or that he had had any ulterior motives.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, he didn’t fail to notice it. Kuroe, now fixing her clothes, let out a small sigh.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Is it me, or do you look relieved, Kuroe?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Do I?” she answered sternly.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki watched on doubtfully.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe cleared her throat as she stood up from the bed and changed the topic. “But that isn’t important. We don’t have much time. You’ll have to get ready before the other students wake up.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Get ready…? For what?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Isn’t it obvious?” she replied quizzically, as though the answer ought to have been a matter of course.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">“And so, beginning today, we have two new additions to our class—Mushiki Kuga and Kuroe Karasuma.”</p>
<p class="TX">A few hours after waking up in his dormitory room, Mushiki, now dressed in a boy’s Garden uniform, found himself standing in the exact same place in the exact same classroom as the day before.</p>
<p class="TX">Though, not everything was the same as yesterday.</p>
<p class="TX">In appearance, he was no longer Saika Kuozaki but rather had returned to his own body. For that reason, his introduction was delivered with a different sense of urgency than the day before. The class gave curious stares, attempting to size him up.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">No, that change wasn’t the problem here.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki turned to the girl beside him (similarly dressed in a school uniform of her own) and whispered, “Kuroe?”</p>
<p class="TX">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Um… Why did I have to transfer in as <i>me</i> this time? And you’re joining the class, too?”</p>
<p class="TX">Still facing the room and standing with her back straight, Kuroe <span aria-label=" Page 97. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_97" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>answered, “Considering what happened yesterday, there’s no telling what might trigger another state conversion—or when.”</p>
<p class="TX">“So I’m like a ticking time bomb or something?”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s an apt expression,” Kuroe answered coolly. “If by chance someone was to spot you in your own body, Mushiki, it would pose a significant problem for us. This Garden is supposed to be hidden from the outside world. Any outsider who managed to slip in would be subjected to a thorough inquisition.” She stopped briefly before continuing. “This way, if you are enrolled in the school as Mushiki Kuga, even if only nominally, we can reduce the severity of such a situation. You won’t be an unidentified intruder who has somehow managed to infiltrate the campus, but rather a delinquent student skipping class… As for <i>my</i> being here, this will allow me to trigger another state conversion on short notice should it prove necessary.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Right.” Mushiki nodded before realizing a fatal flaw in her plan. “But if something was to happen in the girls’ locker room, like it almost did yesterday, everyone would think <i>I</i> did that.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Well…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Well?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Try not to let that happen.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Can you stop acting so nonchalant, please?” Mushiki whispered, worried that the two of them had been talking at the front of the room for too long.</p>
<p class="TX">The homeroom teacher, Tomoe Kurieda, looked toward them in apparent exasperation. “Mushiki? Karasuma? What are you both talking about? I’m not at all impressed. The two of you whispering in class on your very first day…,” she said, crossing her arms.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, sor—” But before he could finish that apology, he stopped himself. “…? Ms. Kurieda, right?”</p>
<p class="TX">Tomoe’s appearance should have been exactly the same as it had been the day before, but there was something different about her face, gestures, and voice.</p>
<p class="TX">Yesterday, she had worn a frightened expression, hunching over and curling up like a quivering Chihuahua.</p>
<p class="TX">Now, however, her bearing was one of confidence, her posture serving to emphasize her incredible proportions. Her graceful and leisurely demeanor called to mind the supple image of a female panther.</p>
