<p class="COTX">Greetings. Or if we’re meeting again, it’s an absolute pleasure. Koushi Tachibana here.</p>
<p class="TX">Thank you for reading my latest work, <i>King’s Proposal: The Witch of Resplendent Color</i>. A new series is always an exciting thing, don’t you think? I do hope you enjoyed it.</p>
<p class="TX">You might have read my previous series, <i>Date A Live</i>. So what comes next after a date? What else but a proposal! That was the train of thought that helped me arrive at this title. Maybe I’ll have to call my next series <i>How to Greet Your In-Laws</i>?</p>
<p class="TX">I started working on this new series roughly two years ago, and from the very beginning, I’ve been discussing with my editor on how to include a certain unusual element in it, even if the main plot follows a common pattern.</p>
<p class="TX">As a result, we combined the hero and the heroine into one.</p>
<p class="TX">Also, as I wrote it, the protagonist ended up becoming a little bit <i>different</i>.</p>
<p class="TX">His sister, too, might come across as a little <i>strange</i>.</p>
<p class="TX">Hold on, did I say <i>one</i> unusual element?!</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">Now then, it’s time for me to express my thanks to everyone involved in getting this new volume out there.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 202. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_202" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Continuing on from <i>Date A Live</i>, Tsunako has once again provided us with some wonderful illustrations. Saika truly is beautiful in the drawings.</p>
<p class="TX">Not only that, the cover was again handled by Tsuyoshi Kusano. His bold and stylish design sense shines through once more.</p>
<p class="TX">Of course, I have the same editor again as last time, so this really is a reunion of the team behind the last series. Well, that’s the overall vibe—you could say that we haven’t disbanded just yet.</p>
<p class="TX">I would also like to express my heartfelt thanks to all of the editorial staff; everyone involved in sales, publishing, and distribution; and of course, to you, the reader, for having picked up this book.</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">If you take a quick look at the cover, the number <i>1</i> is front and center, so we’re definitely going to need a second volume to follow suit. I remember discussing it with my editor, a little worried that if there was no follow-up, it would just become a mysterious line running down the middle of the page…</p>
<p class="TX">And so with that, I look forward to seeing you again in Volume 2 of <i>King’s Proposal</i>!</p>

<p class="CA"><i>August 2021, Koushi Tachibana</i></p>
