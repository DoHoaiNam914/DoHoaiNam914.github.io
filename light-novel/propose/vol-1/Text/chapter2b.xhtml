<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 59. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_59" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Amid them all, only Ruri by Mushiki’s side sat with her arms folded, nodding in admiration. “Raw magical energy. I’d have expected no less from our Madam Witch. A sound reminder not to get overly fixated on any particular spell or technique, no matter how complicated it might be. I’ll engrave this lesson into my heart.”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri’s voice was filled with unshakable confidence, but the other students, aghast, kept glancing between her and Mushiki, their expressions all but saying <i>Wh-what’s that supposed to mean…?</i></p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Of course, he hadn’t meant anything of the sort. It was an accident; that was all.</p>
<p class="TX">However, he couldn’t let people think the most powerful mage in the whole world would make such an elementary mistake.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hmm. Keep working at it, everyone, you hear?”</p>
<p class="TX">Fighting to calm his racing heart, feigning composure, Mushiki came out with his best imitation of the Witch of Resplendent Color.</p>
<p class="TX">…This mission of his, he realized, would be considerably harder than he had imagined.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">After lunch break, it was time for fifth period.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki was on his way with his classmates to the training hall, a huge structure on the western side of the Garden.</p>
<p class="TX">It was a vast field in an unfamiliar design, surrounded by an array of machines and tiered grandstands below a retractable ceiling. It looked more like a sports stadium than a gymnasium, similar in a way to the Colosseum of ancient Rome.</p>
<p class="TX">It was a magnificent and grandiose facility, and under any other circumstances, Mushiki would have stood in awe at its center, marveling as he took in his surroundings.</p>
<p class="TX">He did not, however, do that. He had two reasons.</p>
<p class="TX">First, it would have been out of character for Saika.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 60. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_60" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Second, he was preoccupied with something else.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ooh… I see… What do we have here…?” he murmured, staring down at himself.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes. Fifth and sixth period were practical lessons, so he had changed into his sports uniform for ease of movement.</p>
<p class="TX">A short-sleeved top, sports leggings, and shorts. While light in weight, they seemed to be made from the same material as the Garden’s school uniforms and, consequently, were quite tough.</p>
<p class="TX">At first glance, this sports outfit wouldn’t have seemed a good fit for Saika’s mysterious demeanor. Even so, the mismatch between clothes and personality seemed to bring out a hidden charm in her that Mushiki had never even imagined. If he was being honest, he already rued the fact that there wasn’t a mirror in the immediate vicinity.</p>
<p class="TX">As these thoughts swam around in his head, he heard a choking sound coming from behind him.</p>
<p class="TX">“…! Madam Witch in gym clothes…?! C-can this really be happening…?! This is like a one-of-a-kind, limited-edition piece of merch! I-I’ve gotta snap pictures while I still can…!”</p>
<p class="TX">This, of course, was Ruri. She was wearing the same type of gym clothes, and her eyes were swirling in delirium.</p>
<p class="TX">She gestured as though to take yet more photographs, but her hands were empty. Her face awash with regret, she slammed her foot down hard on the floor of the training hall. “Ugh… Where’s my camera when I need it?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Didn’t you leave it in the locker room…?” responded Hizumi, standing behind her, scratching at her cheek.</p>
<p class="TX">“Why would I have done that?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Because we’re doing a practical class, right…?”</p>
<p class="TX">As Ruri and Hizumi continued to debate the whereabouts of the camera, a man, his gait languid, came from the back of the hall.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh…? Get your asses in line, kids,” he said with a sleepy yawn.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki looked at the newcomer, and his brow rose in surprise.</p>
<p class="TX">It was Anviet Svarner, the same knight who had confronted him yesterday. During times of peace, he apparently worked as a teacher.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 61. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_61" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Mushiki had no idea how, but it looked like his injuries were completely healed. At the very least, there was no sign of the bandages that had covered him from head to toe the day before.</p>
<p class="TX">Instead of yesterday’s slacks and vest, he was now garbed in a sports tracksuit, black in color and decorated with gold lines. That said, he was wearing more accessories around his neck and wrists than Mushiki could count, so he didn’t exactly look to be dressed for exercise.</p>
<p class="TX">“Let’s get crackin’. We’ll start with some warm-up exercises, then move on to practicin’ some basic substantiation techniques…” Anviet’s voice trailed off as he glared at Mushiki. “Eh? What the hell are <i>you</i> doin’ here, Kuozaki? And dressed like a student? What’re you playin’ at this time?”</p>
<p class="TX">Before Mushiki could reply, Ruri stepped forward with her hands on her hips. “Oh, have you forgotten our meeting yesterday? It <i>was</i> brought up. Starting today, Lady Saika will be attending school as a student.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hah? She was <i>serious</i> about that? What the hell? <i>Why?</i>” Anviet asked with one eyebrow raised.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, maintaining his composure, fixed him with a complacent smile. “Ah… I’ve been feeling a little sluggish lately. I thought I might try doing a little training to regain my bearings. This way, I can get a firsthand look at how the students are doing. And also…” He paused for a second, flashing Anviet a wry grin, before continuing in a dramatic tone: “And also, it will give me an opportunity to inspect the teaching staff. We have to make sure they’re all up to par, don’t we now?”</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“…Huh?!”</i></p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki could clearly see a vein throbbing on Anviet’s forehead.</p>
<p class="TX">Well, that was understandable. After all, he had just implied that Anviet wasn’t quite up to snuff as an instructor.</p>
<p class="TX">The result of this declaration, however, was as he expected.</p>
<p class="TX">According to Kuroe, Ruri had no objection whatsoever to Saika’s course of action. Erulka had likewise shown her understanding. Anviet <span aria-label=" Page 62. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_62" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>might have been somewhat affronted, but it was nothing that couldn’t be brushed over with a little delicate manipulation.</p>
<p class="TX">“Fine, then. But you had better make sure there’s no misunderstandin’ about your position now, you hear me? Whatever your reasons, you’re a student at the Garden, right? We don’t tolerate students mouthin’ off at teachers, do we?”</p>
<p class="TX">“What…?! Anviet, you don’t mean to…?!” Ruri broke into a frown at this provocative assertion.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki raised a hand to restrain her and said with a soft smile, “Hmm, I see. I apologize. Mr. Svarner?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">This condescending yet fearless tone only served to make Anviet’s face flood with even greater anger. To be honest, Mushiki <i>was</i> somewhat on edge facing off against Anviet’s intimidating personality.</p>
<p class="TX">Saika, however, wouldn’t have been—and so he did his best to conceal just how nervous he actually was.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Good. If you’re gonna do this properly, I’ll play ball,” Anviet finally responded, before following up with a backward glance over his shoulder as he left for the other side of the hall. “Don’t blame me if you can’t keep up, though!”</p>
<p class="TX">Then, at the other students who had been watching nervously, he shouted, “What the hell do you think you’re lookin’ at, punks?! Get on with those exercises!”</p>
<p class="TX">“<i>Y-yes!</i>” the students answered in unison, quickly lining up and beginning their warm-ups.</p>
<p class="TX">It looked like there was a fixed routine. Mushiki did his best to imitate the others’ movements.</p>
<p class="TX">It wasn’t long before Anviet’s infuriated voice rounded on him again: “Put some effort into it, Kuozaki! Stretch out those tendons! It’s sloppiness that gets you hurt out there in the field!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Ah… Sorry.” Mushiki did as instructed, stretching the tendons in his legs.</p>
<p class="TX">Then Anviet howled further instructions: “Three laps around the track when you’re done! And don’t slack off, you hear me?!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 63. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_63" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Ah…? <i>Three</i> laps?”</p>
<p class="TX">He had expected something more unreasonable, given that this was supposed to be a thorough workout. He was almost disappointed.</p>
<p class="TX">Yet Anviet strolled right up to him before barking in an almost cartoonish manner: “Are you a dumbass, Kuozaki? These’re just warm-ups. I thought it was common sense that pushing yourself too hard puts a greater strain on your body. You <i>are</i> a teacher, aren’t you? We’re tryin’ to improve the <i>quality</i> of your exercises, not the <i>quantity</i>. So pay attention to your stride and the swing of your arms, dammit!”</p>
<p class="TX">“A-ah…”</p>
<p class="TX">Strange though all this felt, Mushiki still ran around the track with the other students.</p>
<p class="TX">Perhaps sensing his mood, Hizumi appeared beside him with a forced smile. “Ah-ha… Mr. Anviet might look scary, and he does have a rude way of speaking, but he knows what he’s talking about…”</p>
<p class="TX">Then, her expression placid, Ruri said, “He’s actually pretty serious. He might not like you, Madam Witch, but he won’t single out any of his students for punishment. So he isn’t all that bad.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Those comments did change Mushiki’s impression of Anviet, albeit only a little.</p>
<p class="TX">In the meantime, the students had reached the end of their jog and were gathered together in the center of the training hall.</p>
<p class="TX">Anviet stood in front of them. “Should be all warmed up now, I’ll bet. Let’s get started, then.” So saying, he let go of a small, metal ball-like object.</p>
<p class="TX">A dim light spilled out from it, seemingly solidifying into a pair of legs springing up and down on the ground. It looked like a mobile target. Was this also some kind of magic? It was a mysterious technology, that was for sure.</p>
<p class="TX">“<i>You</i> first, Fuyajoh.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri stepped forward. Perhaps she was following Mushiki’s lead, or <span aria-label=" Page 64. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_64" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>maybe she was usually more disciplined, but her tone was now slightly politer than it had been earlier.</p>
<p class="TX">“After you, Madam Witch.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah. I’ll see how you do it first,” Mushiki answered.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri’s cheeks turned slightly red, and she pumped her arms, raring to go. “All right, then!”</p>
<p class="TX">She narrowed her eyes, holding her arm outstretched as though to concentrate.</p>
<p class="TX">“Senjitsu Fuyajoh, Second Substantiation: Luminous Blade.”</p>
<p class="TX">The very next moment—</p>
<p class="TX">Two glowing patterns unfurled above Ruri’s head.</p>
<p class="TX">Her <i>world crest</i>. Similar patterns of light appeared whenever someone was using a magical substantiation technique.</p>
<p class="TX">It was the same phenomenon as the halo that had shone over Saika’s head or the one on Anviet’s back. Ruri’s, however, was more like a valiant helmet—or the face of an angry demon.</p>
<p class="TX">Her hand, still outstretched, began to glow—and then a long weapon-like object appeared in her grip, forming a <i>naginata</i> comprised of shimmering light.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri swung it around, adopting a defensive stance.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki was momentarily stunned by this fantastic sight.</p>
<p class="TX">Yesterday, he had witnessed for himself Anviet’s second substantiation and Saika’s fourth one.</p>
<p class="TX">This, however, was his first time calmly observing the process as a third party.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m ready,” Ruri whispered softly.</p>
<p class="TX">In response, Anviet snapped his fingers, and the ball waiting in front of them began to run at high speed, its luminous legs stretching and contracting.</p>
<p class="TX">As fast as it was, it would be difficult to catch in a photograph, let alone hit with an attack.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri remained unfazed, her gaze sharpened, until—</p>
<p class="TX">“…Ah…”</p>
<p class="TX">Letting out a short exhale, she drew her <i>naginata</i>.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 65. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_65" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The blade’s trajectory carved a long crescent moon.</p>
<p class="TX">A second later, the ball, sliced clean in half, fell to the ground behind her with a heavy thud.</p>
<p class="TX">It was a perfectly honed, impeccably precise strike.</p>
<p class="TX">“<i>Wow…</i>,” murmured the remaining students after a moment’s pause.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm. I guess that earns a passing grade,” Anviet said, folding his arms as he let out a small sniff.</p>
<p class="TX">“Thank you,” Ruri responded, letting her <i>naginata</i> dissipate into thin air. “Knowing you, I was a little worried you might only appreciate an unnecessarily flashy attack.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hah?” Anviet knit his brows.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Hizumi quickly gave her a nudge in the ribs, and Ruri, taking the hint, fell back.</p>
<p class="TX">“Tch… Fine. You’re up next, Kuozaki. I don’t know what you’re playin’ at, but think of this as a chance to show these kids what our vaunted headmistress can pull off,” Anviet said, releasing another of those small metal balls.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh, no, I’m…”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki had to come up with some quick excuse to sit this one out.</p>
<p class="TX">What other choice did he have? Earlier in the day, he had practically destroyed the classroom just by gathering a small amount of magical energy. There was no telling what might happen if he, unable to properly wield Saika’s vast reservoir of magical powers, was to try training for real here.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“…”</i></p>
<p class="TX">The students continued to stare at him silently. He shook his head slightly… He was a little worried he wouldn’t be able to pull it off, but it wouldn’t be like Saika to shrink from a situation like this.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah… Right. I’ll give it a shot, then.”</p>
<p class="TX">He feigned confidence as he took a step forward.</p>
<p class="TX">He kept his gaze lowered, trying to conjure up in his mind something based on what he had learned from Kuroe last night, similar to whatever technique he had pulled off against Anviet the other day, or the trick he had just seen Ruri perform.</p>
<p class="TX">A new technique—a substantiation magic. The art of giving form <span aria-label=" Page 66. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_66" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>to the intangible. At its most basic, substantiation magic…was like forging an image by molding a clay of magical energy.</p>
<p class="TX">He wondered how he knew that. This was supposed to be his first time attempting it, yet the actions felt surprisingly familiar to his hand.</p>
<p class="TX">Regardless, he would have to be careful. If he overdid it, he could end up with a repeat of what had happened earlier in the classroom.</p>
<p class="TX">He focused on keeping the output only at the bare minimum, quiet, small, and safe. As he visualized that image at the tip of his little finger—</p>
<p class="TX">“—?!” Mushiki’s eyes shot open, and he stared up into the air.</p>
<p class="TX">Only then did he realize that both Anviet and Ruri had circled around to position themselves in front of him.</p>
<p class="TX">Both were breathing heavily, their faces slick with perspiration.</p>
<p class="TX">…Almost as though confronting a powerful opponent.</p>
<p class="TX">That wasn’t all. Anviet’s double halo hovered behind his back, while a pattern resembling a demonic mask had fallen over Ruri’s face. In one hand she clutched a <i>naginata</i>, in the other, a trident.</p>
<p class="TX">Their second substantiations. Whatever it was, these two knights, supposedly among the strongest in the entire Garden, were ready for battle.</p>
<p class="TX">“Um…”</p>
<p class="TX">Not knowing what was about to take place, Mushiki stood there motionless, watching as a bead of sweat coursed down Anviet’s chin.</p>
<p class="TX">“…K-Kuozaki, you… What’re you about to do there…? You’re not gonna blow up the whole training hall—heck, the whole Garden—are you…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh…?”</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, Ruri fell to the ground quickly and knelt in front of him. “I-I’m so sorry, Madam Witch…! I never should have pointed my blade at you…! M-my body acted on its own…!” With those words, she bowed her head in deep supplication.</p>
<p class="TX">“No, I mean…”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki didn’t know exactly what was going to happen, but he <i>had</i> been about to do something.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 67. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_67" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>But how was he supposed to respond to <i>this…</i>?</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hmm. A prompt reaction. I would have expected no less from you both…I guess?”</p>
<p class="TX">Well aware that this was nothing more than a half-baked excuse, he decided to praise the two knights for their rapid responses.</p>
<p class="TX">Well, Ruri seemed to take his remarks at face value, but Anviet continued to watch him out of the corner of his eye.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">…He could hardly believe it. Even after trying so hard to suppress his powers, had he really posed such a profound danger? As he glanced down at the slender white hands that were now his own, Mushiki was made acutely aware of the sheer magnitude of power he had now acquired.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">His fifth- and sixth-period classes both proceeded smoothly without incident.</p>
<p class="TX">That said, at Anviet’s insistence, Mushiki had been forced to observe the remainder of both classes without participating himself.</p>
<p class="TX">He had no intention of complaining. In fact, he was secretly grateful.</p>
<p class="TX">After all, he still hadn’t yet fully grasped how to use Saika’s surplus magical energy. Being able to watch how the other students used their magic was invaluable time spent.</p>
<p class="TX">For the students as well, it seemed to have been good motivation to have the headmistress observing so closely. It may ultimately have been entirely coincidental, but Anviet had ended up creating the best situation for everyone.</p>
<p class="TX">“All right. Let’s go, Madam Witch, Hizumi,” Ruri said with a stretch of her arms after the teacher had left.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, watching on from a seat in the hall, nodded in response as he rose to his feet. “Oh-ho… It isn’t often that I get a chance to see a class like this up close. It was rather stimulating.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah-ha… I was pretty nervous, actually. I can hardly even remember what I did…”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 68. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_68" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Oh? What a waste. It isn’t every day that we get to show Madam Witch our magic abilities.”</p>
<p class="TX">The three of them continued to chat as they made their way to the locker room at the side of the training hall.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment—</p>
<p class="TX">“…Ah.”</p>
<p class="TX">Upon entering the women’s locker room, Mushiki stopped dead in his tracks.</p>
<p class="TX">Several of his classmates were already inside, and more than half of them had already stripped down to their revealing underwear.</p>
<p class="TX">“…!”</p>
<p class="TX">His heart skipped a beat as he cursed himself for being so careless.</p>
<p class="TX">It was only natural when you stopped to think about it. Mushiki’s body was now that of a woman, and so he was obliged to use the women’s locker room. And locker rooms, after all, were essentially places to change clothes.</p>
<p class="TX">It was precisely because he understood this basic fact that he had only entered it during the break before fifth period after making sure everyone else had already finished.</p>
<p class="TX">Chatting with Ruri and Hizumi, however, he had completely overlooked it. Or perhaps he had let down his guard, what with the day’s classes now being over. Regardless, this bountiful rose garden of young ladies now spread out before him, leaving him momentarily at a loss.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah… I feel more tired than usual today…”</p>
<p class="TX">“I guess. But it’s an honor. To think, we’ve gotten to see Madam Witch up close like this.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t you think he was kind of cute all flustered like that? Mr. Anvi, I mean?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Tell me about it. There’s a theory, you know? They say men who act tough are the most vulnerable when others turn on them.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah. Can you lend me your deodorant when you’re done?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Mm-hmm.”</p>
<p class="TX">And so on…</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 69. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_69" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Those young maidens continued talking while half naked seemingly without a care in the world.</p>
<p class="TX">Their breasts and buttocks, normally shrouded in a realm beyond sight, were now lined up before him, covered only by the thinnest, most unreliable pieces of cloth.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">While he may have fallen in love at first sight with Saika’s wondrous form, that certainly wasn’t to say that he didn’t have feelings toward other women. Not at all.</p>
<p class="TX">Alas, such was the nature of the male animal. The soft, silky skin of young maidens, their delicate voices, their enrapturing scents were paralyzing stimulants to Mushiki’s brain.</p>
<p class="TX">“…? What’s wrong, Madam Witch?”</p>
<p class="TX">“You look awfully pale…”</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri and Hizumi, realizing that something was amiss, called out to him in concern.</p>
<p class="TX">“A-ah, no, I mean…”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki shook his head, hoping somehow to be able to brush this off.</p>
<p class="TX">But while he stood there frozen, the two other girls looked to have begun changing their clothes directly in front of him.</p>
<p class="TX">The two of them, like the others, had removed their gym clothes, essentially stripping down to their underwear.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">For a long moment, all he could do was stare.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri was his little sister. They had bathed together when they were kids. There was no way on earth she could have caught his interest, not even in her underwear—or so he had thought until just a few moments ago.</p>
<p class="TX">Here she was in the flesh, her lustrous, glamorous appearance, unseen now for many years, striking him with an unexpected vividness.</p>
<p class="TX">She was wearing a matching bra and panties, pale blue in color and simple in design. The body behind those articles of clothing had an air of sophistication, as though nothing at all was superfluous about it. <span aria-label=" Page 70. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_70" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She was a warrior, and she was a young woman. The two opposing elements coexisted in her slender body. Mushiki found himself catching his breath.</p>
<p class="TX">Hizumi’s gorgeous silhouette struck a sharp contrast. Gently wrapped in her warm-colored underwear, she was endowed with weapons of mass destruction that normally dwelled unseen beneath her uniform or gym clothes.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>Dressing slimmer</i>—that legendary term from a most ancient document—sprang to mind. Someone who looked slenderer in certain articles of clothing than they truly were. Such was Hizumi’s harmless features and her sensational, sensual form. Together, the two sent Mushiki’s brain spiraling into the depths of chaos.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>This won’t do. Nope, not at all.</i></p>
<p class="TX">He could feel himself breaking into a sweat. With his heart already racing from the unexpected shock of seeing everyone else here, this addition could prove lethal. He would never have thought that the sight of his acquaintance disrobing could affect him to this degree. He would have to find some way to regain his composure, or else—</p>
<p class="TX">“…?! H-huh…?”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, he felt his body heating up.</p>
<p class="TX">For an impossibly long second, he wondered if he was feeling dizzy from excitement—but he was wrong.</p>
<p class="TX">This sensation, as if the very blood in his veins was on fire, was—</p>
<p class="TX">“…!”</p>
<p class="TX">Driven by an unspeakable sense of urgency, he dived for the door at the back of the locker room and slammed it shut with all his might.</p>
<p class="TX">He couldn’t say precisely why, but something told him that he couldn’t afford to remain there with the others.</p>
<p class="TX">It looked like he had jumped into the shower room. There were several showers lined up in a row by the wall, separated by simple partitions and doors with wide openings at the top and bottom.</p>
<p class="TX">He wasn’t sure whether anyone used those showers after their practical lessons or after working up a sweat playing sports, but regardless, he didn’t see anyone else in the room. For the time being, he heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
