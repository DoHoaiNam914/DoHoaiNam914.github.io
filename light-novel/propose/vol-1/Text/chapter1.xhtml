<p class="COTX">“Ngh… Ugh…”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki awoke to find himself lying in a luxurious canopied bed.</p>
<p class="TX">After blinking a few times, he cast his gaze around the room.</p>
<p class="TX">It was large, the walls covered with antique shelves and closets. Beside his pillow was a stylish little lamp. A plush carpet covered the floor, shining magnificently with the light glimmering in through the gaps between the drawn curtains.</p>
<p class="TX">It was a dazzling awakening in this beautiful bedroom, and the elegance of it all was rather striking.</p>
<p class="TX">The only problem was that it was all utterly foreign to him.</p>
<p class="TX">“What the…?”</p>
<p class="TX">A murmur escaped his lips. Maybe it was because he had just woken up, but his ears were ringing, and he could hardly make out his own voice.</p>
<p class="TX">Baffled, he tried to recall his memories to figure out what might have brought him here.</p>
<p class="TX">His name was Mushiki Kuga. He was seventeen years old, a high school student, and lived in the city of Ohjoh in Tokyo. He remembered that much.</p>
<p class="TX">His last memory before falling asleep…had him walking the familiar road home.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 8. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_8" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Right. He had been on his way back from school. Clearly, <i>something</i> must have happened for him to be waking up here.</p>
<p class="TX">…Had he been abducted? Was he the victim of a hit-and-run, sending him off to heaven? Or had he spent the night with a woman who had gotten horribly drunk somewhere…? But none of those possibilities seemed particularly likely.</p>
<p class="TX">All that being the case, then maybe he was still dreaming?</p>
<p class="TX">His senses still dull, he tried pinching his cheek. It didn’t hurt all that much, but he couldn’t tell if that was because he really was dreaming or if his fingers were simply sapped of strength.</p>
<p class="TX">In any case, there was no point staying in bed.</p>
<p class="TX">Stepping down onto the floor, he slid his feet into the slippers laid out for him, crossed the room unsteadily, and opened the door, when—</p>
<p class="TX">“…Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">His eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p class="TX">As soon as he walked through the doorway, it was as though he had been instantly transported to some unknown destination. The scenery was completely unknown to him.</p>
<p class="TX">The sun lit up the deep-blue sky, and a straight paved road stretched along the ground outside, with fountains and trees dotting its length as though to punctuate it with nature. At the end of the thoroughfare, a magnificent building towered above it all like a king perched atop his throne.</p>
<p class="TX">This sight was completely at odds with his everyday life, and yet something about it reminded him of the buildings and facilities at school.</p>
<p class="TX">Glancing over his shoulder, he was even more taken aback.</p>
<p class="TX">There was no sign of the bedroom where he had been until just a moment ago.</p>
<p class="TX">Unable to grasp what was going on, he rested a shaky hand on his forehead.</p>
<p class="TX">“…I guess I <i>am</i> still dreaming?”</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, it looked like he wouldn’t have time to continue fretting over this situation.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 9. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_9" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The reason for that was simple. Unlike the room he had just stepped out of, there were people here walking to and fro.</p>
<p class="TX">Maybe they were students? Boys and girls in matching uniforms were proceeding in groups toward the huge building up ahead.</p>
<p class="TX">A few of them, perhaps startled by his sudden appearance, stopped in their tracks, glancing his way wide-eyed.</p>
<p class="TX">“Um…”</p>
<p class="TX">Who <i>wouldn’t</i> be surprised to see someone pop up out of thin air like this…? Though, in truth, no one was more taken aback than Mushiki himself.</p>
<p class="TX">Anyway, for now, he would have to find a way to explain that he wasn’t a suspicious person—and at the same time try to figure out where he was.</p>
<p class="TX">He turned to the girl closest to him. “Um…”</p>
<p class="TX">Before he could even finish his thought—</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">“Good morning, Madam Witch!”</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">The girl gave a reverent curtsy as she called out in greeting.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">His eyes widened in surprise at this unexpected response.</p>
<p class="TX">Before he knew it, the other students standing around him likewise began to offer salutations.</p>
<p class="TX">“Morning.”</p>
<p class="TX">“How are you today, Madam Witch?”</p>
<p class="TX">“You look radiant this morning!”</p>
<p class="TX">All the while, Mushiki stood there petrified, like a deer in headlights.</p>
<p class="TX">“…?”</p>
<p class="TX">That wasn’t all. The next moment, an older man, probably a teacher, appeared behind him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Good morning, Headmistress,” the man greeted him politely.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>Madam Witch.</i></p>
<p class="TX"><i>Headmistress.</i></p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki could only tilt his head to one side in even greater <span aria-label=" Page 10. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_10" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>consternation as person after person continued to address him with those unfamiliar titles.</p>
<p class="TX">At the very least, he didn’t remember anyone ever having spoken to him like that before.</p>
<p class="TX">Moreover, neither title seemed particularly apt for a male high school student like himself.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hmm?”</p>
<p class="TX">Confused, he found himself glancing down at his own body—and only then did he finally notice it.</p>
<p class="TX">He couldn’t see his own feet.</p>
<p class="TX">Or strictly speaking, there was something blocking his line of vision.</p>
<p class="TX">“What…are these?”</p>
<p class="TX">Two large, unfamiliar masses hung from his chest.</p>
<p class="TX">Recovering slightly from his shock, Mushiki reached out to touch them with his hands.</p>
<p class="TX">“…What?!”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, his fingers dug into something soft—and he instantly felt a faint, sweet stimulation course through his chest.</p>
<p class="TX">“I-it can’t be…”</p>
<p class="TX">They clearly weren’t fake.</p>
<p class="TX">Those soft masses were part of his own body.</p>
<p class="TX">And now that he stopped to think about it, the fingers and hands exploring them were slenderer and paler in color than he remembered them being.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Having put two and two together, he took off running, until finally he reached a fountain by the roadside and peered into the water.</p>
<p class="TX">Seeing the reflection of the face staring back at him, he was rendered speechless.</p>
<p class="TX">That was only natural. What he saw wasn’t his own familiar countenance, the face of a high school boy, but rather that of a beautiful woman endowed with long, gorgeous hair and bright, iridescent eyes.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Yep. There could be no doubt about it.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 11. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_11" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>He had somehow <i>become</i> a girl. To put it mildly, it made no sense. Everything had been one inexplicable sight after another since he had woken up, but it all paled in comparison to <i>this</i>. It was too preposterous to be a dream.</p>
<p class="TX">Though to be fair, Mushiki’s speechlessness wasn’t only due to the fact that he had somehow been turned into a girl.</p>
<p class="TX">No, there was a much simpler, more romantic, more absurd reason for his loss of words.</p>
<p class="TX">In short, just like Narcissus in the ancient Greek myth, he had fallen utterly in love with the reflection staring back at him in the water.</p>
<p class="TX">Only half aware of his own actions, he reached out to touch her cheek.</p>
<p class="TX">He could feel his heart thumping, the sound growing louder and louder.</p>
<p class="TX">His brain felt like it was about to be overloaded by the unending stream of information that his eyes were feeding to it.</p>
<p class="TX">It was unbelievable, terrifying even—and a wonderfully sweet sensation.</p>
<p class="TX">Of course, the girl in the reflection was beautiful to behold. Her almond-shaped eyes. The well-defined bridge of her nose. Her luscious lips. It was no exaggeration to say that her features were perfectly balanced—a miraculous, sublime work of art.</p>
<p class="TX">But that wasn’t all.</p>
<p class="TX">No, that wasn’t enough to explain the intensity of emotion welling up inside him.</p>
<p class="TX">Ah, <i>now</i> he understood, an eerie conviction taking root.</p>
<p class="TX">There could be no doubt about it. The word that those wise minds from the past had coined in order to express this inexplicable rush of feelings could be none other than <i>love</i>.</p>
<p class="TX">“Am I…in love with her…? No, with <i>myself…</i>?” he whispered in awe before catching his breath.</p>
<p class="TX">His memories flooded back to him as he looked upon that face, almost as if they had been waiting for this opportunity.</p>
<p class="TX">Right. He knew this girl.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 12. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_12" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>How could he have forgotten? He had met her just before he had lost consciousness.</p>
<p class="TX">She was the girl with the flower-shaped bloodstain on her chest.</p>
<p class="TX">“Here you are.”</p>
<p class="TX">A voice like a small chime ringing came from behind him, prompting Mushiki to raise his face with a start.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh…?”</p>
<p class="TX">Looking over his shoulder, he noticed a small girl standing there.</p>
<p class="TX">Her short black hair was pulled back tightly in a bun, and her clothes were similar in color. Her eyes, peering into Mushiki’s face, were likewise black obsidian.</p>
<p class="TX">“…M-me, you mean?” he said, pointing to himself.</p>
<p class="TX">Though her expression remained unchanged, the girl had just realized something.</p>
<p class="TX">“My apologies. I take it your memories have yet to be fully integrated? You must be rather confused, I take it?” She paused for a moment before continuing: “I’m Kuroe Karasuma, attendant to the person <i>you have become</i>. I’ve been fully briefed on how to proceed should this unlikely development come to pass.” With that, she gave him a polite bow.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki hurried to stand up straight. “…! Do you know something?! Tell me! Just who am I?!”</p>
<p class="TX">In response to these questions, the girl, Kuroe, gave him a brief nod. “My lady’s name is Saika Kuozaki—the most powerful mage in the world.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Wha—?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s eyes snapped open at this shocking declaration.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, still gripped by the powerful urge that had taken hold of his chest, he murmured:</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">“What…what a beautiful name…”</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">“…Excuse me?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 13. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_13" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Kuroe and Mushiki, staring at each other in wonder, both tilted their heads in puzzlement.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">Twenty minutes had passed since their encounter by the fountain. Mushiki had followed Kuroe to the huge structure towering over the end of the paved road—the central school building.</p>
<p class="TX">They were on the top floor, in a room labeled the H<small>EADMISTRESS’S</small> O<small>FFICE</small> on the sign by the door. It was a large space filled with modern equipment, but combined with the bookshelves packed with old-fashioned tomes alongside ancient-looking tools scattered around the walls, it served to give the room a strangely eclectic look.</p>
<p class="TX">Standing in the middle of the room, Mushiki was at pains trying to explain how he had ended up in this situation.</p>
<p class="TX">All the while, Kuroe, for some reason, after sitting him down in front of a mirror, was busy carefully combing his hair.</p>
<p class="TX">Apparently, she couldn’t let him be seen with hair in such disarray after just getting out of bed.</p>
<p class="TX">“I see. On your way back from school, you found yourself wandering into a mysterious space, where you stumbled on Lady Saika covered in blood. After that, someone attacked you from behind, you lost consciousness, and then you woke up here. Yes?” Kuroe asked after repeating his story back to him.</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s right,” Mushiki answered.</p>
<p class="TX">“When you say a <i>mysterious space</i>, what specifically do you mean?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Um… Well, how do I put it? There were all these tall buildings lined up in rows, and it was kinda like a maze or a labyrinth…,” Mushiki explained, gesturing with his hands.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe slightly frowned. “A fourth substantiation… So it really was a mage… But who could be capable of forging a space like that…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, it’s nothing,” Kuroe said with a shake of her head before placing the comb back on the table and tying his hair with a frilly ribbon. “Thank you. I believe I now have a solid grasp of the situation.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 14. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_14" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The beauty staring back at him in the mirror had soared to yet greater heights. Utterly captivated, Mushiki sighed.</p>
<p class="TX">“She’s incredible… It’s like it isn’t really me…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Strictly speaking, that’s exactly right.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, I guess it is…”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki spun around on his chair to get a better look at the other girl.</p>
<p class="TX">“So, um… Ms. Kuroe?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Just Kuroe will do. I’m afraid it feels rather unnatural to be addressed so politely by that face.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…” Though slightly uneasy about the master-servant relationship that he had found himself in, Mushiki decided to play along. “Um, Kuroe, then. There are some things I want to ask you, too…”</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m sure there are. It’s quite expected for you to be confused right now. Please, ask me anything. If I can answer your questions, I will,” she said with a nod.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki took her up on that offer. “So this girl… You said her name is Saika, right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Indeed.”</p>
<p class="TX">“So, um, what kind of guys is she into…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Excuse me?” Kuroe, her expression blank, tilted her head in response to Mushiki’s bashful inquiry.</p>
<p class="TX">“Er, maybe that was a bit too personal. Okay. Um, what sort of foods does she like, then…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“No, that wasn’t the issue.” Kuroe stood up straight, and keeping her eyes fixed on Mushiki, she asked, “Is that really the first thing you want to ask? I’m sure you must have other, more pressing questions, no?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I guess so… But, um, still. <i>Is</i> it okay for me to ask about that kind of thing? It’s probably, like, secret, right…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Why are you beating around the bush at a time like this? Please don’t hold back. First things first, I want you to understand the situation in which you find yourself.”</p>
<p class="TX">“A-ah, well, in that case…” Mushiki cleared his throat, and his <span aria-label=" Page 15. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_15" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>cheeks having turned slightly red, he asked, “Um, so about her <i>body measurements…</i>”</p>
<p class="TX">“That isn’t what I meant,” Kuroe interrupted him. “Are you a simpleton? Or is that you in there, Lady Saika, and you’re just playing games with me? Surely you have more urgent questions in need of answers. <i>Where am I?</i> for example. <i>Why have I become Lady Saika?</i> That sort of thing.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, now that you mention it… What’s happening to me?! What the hell is going on here?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“…” Now that he had started asking what seemed like earnest questions, Kuroe’s mouth tightened into a thin line. “Allow me to start at the beginning. As I said earlier, you’re currently inhabiting the body of Lady Saika Kuozaki, the world’s strongest mage and the head of this mage training school, Void’s Garden.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. Ah, no matter how many times I hear it, it’s such a lovely name…”</p>
<p class="TX">“…I would have expected the word <i>mage</i> to have been the part to catch your interest.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, sorry.”</p>
<p class="TX">As Kuroe said, that was indeed an intriguing word. Mushiki’s apology was wholehearted. “So by <i>mage</i>…you mean someone who can cast spells? Like hurling fire or healing allies or something?”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s a rather abstract impression, and dare I say it, a few generations out of date, but yes.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Seriously? You’re saying mages really exist?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Can you explain what has happened to your body through other, more conventional means?” Kuroe countered.</p>
<p class="TX">“…I suppose not,” he found himself answering. As the saying went, the facts speak for themselves.</p>
<p class="TX">He could certainly think of no other way to explain how he, Mushiki Kuga, had somehow been transformed into a girl named Saika Kuozaki.</p>
<p class="TX">“I know you must have your doubts, but for the time being, let’s proceed under the assumption that magic <i>does</i> exist.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 16. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_16" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“All right… So what’s going on with my body?” Mushiki asked in a meek voice.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe lifted a finger into the air, placed it firmly against his chest, and said, “I’ll start with the conclusion. You and Lady Saika have <i>coalesced</i> into a single body.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Wha—?! B-but that’s…!”</p>
<p class="TX">“I understand it must be difficult to remain calm right now, but I must ask you to please refrain from—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Aren’t you supposed to get married before doing that…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe closed her eyes for a moment. When she finally opened them, her expression seemed to suggest that she was taking in some repulsive sight. “You may have Lady Saika’s body,” she said, “but perhaps I’ll have to knock some sense into you?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m sorry. That word, it was just so, so <i>stimulating…</i>” Mushiki shrank back.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe, regaining her composure, continued: “Mushiki, wasn’t it? According to your story just now, Lady Saika was fatally injured when you found her last night, yes? It’s only natural, then, to infer that someone must have attacked her, wouldn’t you say?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Right… Any idea who it could have been?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m afraid not.”</p>
<p class="TX">“So there wasn’t anyone who had a bone to pick with her, then?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I would say she had as many enemies as there are stars in the sky.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…” Hearing her put that so bluntly, Mushiki felt a cold sweat building on his forehead.</p>
<p class="TX">“Nonetheless,” Kuroe continued, “there shouldn’t be anyone capable of killing the strongest mage in the world, the Witch of Resplendent Color, Saika Kuozaki.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Those calmly spoken yet resolute words forced Mushiki to catch his breath.</p>
<p class="TX">“My apologies. Let’s continue.” Kuroe must have noticed his reaction, as she stopped to clear her throat. “I suspect that, in all likelihood, your assailant and Lady Saika’s are one and the same.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 17. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_17" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Right… I thought so, too.”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s thoughts took him back to those final moments.</p>
<p class="TX">That ruthless blow that had felled him as he had tried to save the blood-soaked Saika.</p>
<p class="TX">He might not have been able to see his attacker’s face, but the wound left on his body had been all but identical to that on Saika’s.</p>
<p class="TX">“You were both on the verge of death and would in all certainty have truly died had not Lady Saika, drawing on the last of her strength, made use of her final magic technique.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Her final magic technique… What’s <i>that</i> supposed to mean?” Mushiki asked.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe raised her right and left index fingers, slowly bringing them together until they touched. “A fusion spell. It’s simple addition. Left alone, you would have both died. So it was better that at least one of you survive. <i>0.5</i> <span class="symbol_ITAL">+</span> <i>0.5</i> <span class="symbol_ITAL">=</span> <i>1.</i> Lady Saika, on the brink of death, found you, also about to breathe your last, and merged the two of you into a single being in order to extend your life span.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<i>Merged</i>,” Mushiki repeated softly, his voice filled with shock as he raised a hand to his cheek—although all things considered, he wasn’t even sure if it really was <i>his</i> cheek anymore.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. Hence the word <i>coalescence</i>.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…So you’re saying there’s nothing left of <i>me</i>, then…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Perhaps the injuries dealt to Lady Saika’s body were less severe, or it may have had something to do with the amount of magical energy latent in the two bodies. I can’t say… It would appear, however, that Lady Saika’s body is serving as the base. Having said that, please don’t be alarmed. This doesn’t mean your body has been lost forever, simply that the parts of you that have been fused are now hidden. I suspect that, in all likelihood, your body is supplementing Lady Saika’s injured one.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? But—”</p>
<p class="TX">“I understand you’re in shock, but please, wait till I finish explaining—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Am I really worthy of this honor…?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 18. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_18" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…Could you please, just for a moment, stop trying to make me feel like an idiot for attempting to help you here?” Kuroe said, her stare piercing Mushiki.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki did realize he was being somewhat unreasonable, and he did his best to apologize.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Now then, from what I can see, that body is entirely Lady Saika’s. However, the mind, I take it, is wholly yours, Mushiki?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah…” His breath caught in his throat.</p>
<p class="TX">It did seem to be that way.</p>
<p class="TX">If his consciousness had merely been swapped with hers, that would mean that his own body must be somewhere out in the world with Saika’s mind.</p>
<p class="TX">Otherwise, if his body had simply been transformed into a copy of hers, that, too, would suggest that the real Saika must likewise be out there somewhere.</p>
<p class="TX">If what Kuroe said was true, if the two of them, both on the verge of death, had fused into one so as not to perish, then there could only be the one of them.</p>
<p class="TX">“So Saika’s mind…her soul… Where did it go…?” Mushiki asked, his voice shaking.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe, after a short pause, slowly shook her head. “I don’t know. She may be dormant inside your body. She may have become a wandering spirit, drifting somewhere far afield. Or maybe…” She didn’t finish that thought.</p>
<p class="TX">It was just a possibility, but even so, it was no doubt too awful to put into words. Mushiki didn’t press further.</p>
<p class="TX">“…In any event, we need to discuss what to do from here. We’re in a state of emergency. It’s no exaggeration to say that this is the greatest crisis the world is facing at this present moment,” Kuroe said, her expression grim.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki couldn’t help but feel doubtful. “The world…? I mean, sure, losing a beauty like that <i>is</i> a huge deal, but even so… Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">As he spoke, an alarm began to sound throughout the school building.</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, a girl’s voice blared out from a PA system: “<i>This</i> <span aria-label=" Page 19. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_19" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i>is Erulka Flaera. We have confirmed the deployment of an annihilation factor, estimated yield between calamity- and war-grades. Time for reversible annihilation is two to four hours. Knight Anviet Svarner has been assigned to respond. Everyone, maintain a state of heightened vigilance.</i>”</p>
<p class="TX">“…? What’s all that supposed to mean?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm.” Kuroe held her chin in one hand for a moment before glancing back at him. “This is a good opportunity. Let’s go outside. It’s time you saw the other side of our world for yourself.”</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">After exiting the headmistress’s office, Kuroe led Mushiki to the rooftop of the central school building.</p>
<p class="TX">Before stepping out, she had made him leave behind the slippers he was still wearing and change into proper shoes. The heels might have been relatively short, but being unaccustomed to them, his gait was a little wobbly.</p>
<p class="TX">“Come along, this way. There are some steps here, so please do be careful,” Kuroe said, holding out her hand.</p>
<p class="TX">“Sorry,” Mushiki replied, accepting her support as he took a somewhat long stride. “Is this…?”</p>
<p class="TX">Arriving at the rooftop, Mushiki made his way to the tall fence at its edge, raised a hand to keep his hair from being buffeted by the wind, and turned his gaze to the scene unfolding below.</p>
<p class="TX">He could see far into the distance, with a much wider field of view than he had had on the ground.</p>
<p class="TX">Centered around the school building was a vast site containing several additional facilities, all surrounded by a high wall. Beyond those fortifications was an expansive cityscape.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah… So it’s just a regular city, huh.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. Perhaps you’re wondering where we are?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Well… When you mentioned magic, I kinda assumed I had been whisked off to another world or something.”</p>
<p class="TX">“You’ve been unaware of our presence, but we’ve long been operating in the shadows. This Garden is located in the eastern part of Ohjoh City.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 20. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_20" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“It’s closer than I thought… But I don’t remember ever seeing anything like—”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s because we’ve erected a field around it, which serves to keep us under the radar of outsiders… Now, I would like you to please stop staring at the ground below and pay attention to the sky above us.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?” As instructed, Mushiki looked upward.</p>
<p class="TX">At that very moment, the tranquil clouds floating above broke apart, and <i>it</i> appeared.</p>
<p class="TX">“…? What is…<i>that</i>?”</p>
<p class="TX"><i>That</i> was a claw—an enormous claw tearing through an empty sky.</p>
<p class="TX">No, <i>empty</i> wasn’t quite the right word—rather, a fissure seemed to have torn through space itself, a great crack ripping through the firmament.</p>
<p class="TX">That wasn’t all—that fissure was growing increasingly larger…</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, as though cleaving the heavens in two, a gigantic shadow reared its head.</p>
<p class="TX">“What…?” Mushiki’s eyes opened wide in alarm.</p>
<p class="TX">Its massive body was covered in what looked like a tough hide, its arms and feet each equipped with talon-like claws, while long horns sprouted out of its head and a pair of wings emerged from its back.</p>
<p class="TX">It almost reminded him of an ancient dinosaur—or maybe a giant monster from a sci-fi film.</p>
<p class="TX">“Annihilation Factor No. 206: Dragon,” Kuroe said practically in response to his thoughts. “With its tough and unyielding body and its tenacious spirit, it won’t fall to anything but the strongest of attacks. Its fiery breath could turn all of Japan into a sea of fire in a matter of days. It’s a relatively common form of an annihilation factor,” she continued, her tone of voice indifferent.</p>
<p class="TX">As though in perfect sync with that explanation, the dragon let out a tremendous roar before spewing out a violent torrent of smoldering flames.</p>
<p class="TX">“What…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">The sky above burned with scorching heat, and though those flames <span aria-label=" Page 21. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_21" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>remained a long distance away, they were powerful enough to make his skin feel like it, too, was on fire. He could barely even keep his eyes open.</p>
<p class="TX">With that ferocious fiery breath, it was like a scene from some ancient myth.</p>
<p class="TX">What on earth would become of the people, the fields, the cities lying in its path?</p>
<p class="TX">The answer to that question flashed in front of him.</p>
<p class="TX">“…!”</p>
<p class="TX">In the blink of an eye, the landscape before him was engulfed in flames, the familiar cityscape, his home until just yesterday, transformed into a blazing inferno.</p>
<p class="TX">Flames swept across the ground, along the streets, painting everything before him in shades of black and red.</p>
<p class="TX">There were screams. Alarms blaring. Sounds of destruction. All of it mixed together, all of it sweeping through the whole area.</p>
<p class="TX">For a moment, his mind was unable to process the sheer scale of the destruction, and he could do nothing but watch in quiet dismay.</p>
<p class="TX">“What…? Um…”</p>
<p class="TX">After a few seconds, his brain finally freed itself from its stupor and began to take in the situation, passing orders to his arms and legs.</p>
<p class="TX">Desperately, he grabbed the shoulder of the young woman by his side. “Kuroe! The city!”</p>
<p class="TX">“I can see. Please calm down, Mushiki.”</p>
<p class="TX">“You expect me to <i>calm down</i> at a time like this?! How are <i>you</i> able to watch with such indifference?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Because panicking will not improve the situation. Besides…” With Mushiki still shaking her shoulders violently, she pointed at the sky. “If you don’t pay attention, you’ll miss it.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki followed her finger, his gaze turning upward once more.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment—</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX"><i>“Yeeeaaahhh! Yahoooooo!”</i></p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 22. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_22" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>A loud cry rang out, and a small shadow took off from the ground like a bullet being blasted up into the air.</p>
<p class="TX">They soared in a straight line, struck the dragon like a bolt of fierce thunder, and sent its huge body tumbling across the sky.</p>
<p class="TX">“What…?”</p>
<p class="TX">The dragon’s deafening howl was powerful enough to send shock waves through the air.</p>
<p class="TX">That wasn’t an attempt to make its presence known, nor to intimidate its enemies—rather, it was a cry of tremendous pain and grief.</p>
<p class="TX">“You’re a pain in the ass, you oversize lizard!” With those words, the figure who had sent the dragon flying spread their arms wide.</p>
<p class="TX">Then something like a small satellite circling through the air exploded with light.</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment—</p>
<p class="TX">With an incredible detonation like a nearby thunderstrike, the sky was engulfed in a dazzling glow.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki had to cover his eyes in the face of that blinding flash.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Ugh!”</p>
<p class="TX">When he could finally open them again, the humongous dragon had vanished, gone without so much as a trace.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-what was that…?” Mushiki stammered.</p>
<p class="TX">“Knight Anviet Svarner. He’s a cornerstone of Lady Saika’s chevaliers and an S-class mage at the top of the Garden’s ranks. I had little doubt he would be able to handle an annihilation factor of that level by himself,” Kuroe answered, still staring at the sky.</p>
<p class="TX">“Lady Saika’s chevaliers…? You mean, she’s even stronger than him?”</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s ridiculous to even compare them,” Kuroe answered coolly.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Whoa…”</p>
<p class="TX">Dumbfounded for a moment, he breathed a sigh of relief before lowering his gaze.</p>
<p class="TX">“Right, the city—”</p>
<p class="TX">He cast his gaze back to the sea of flames that had engulfed the cityscape—but found himself at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 23. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_23" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Eh…?”</p>
<p class="TX">The source of his surprise was simple. Until just a moment ago, the city had been enveloped in bright-red flames, screams erupting all around—but now it had returned to normal as though nothing at all had been amiss.</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh…? But the whole city was on fire just now…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Indeed. That was no illusion. The city had certainly been devastated by the dragon’s flames. Had Anviet not defeated the monster, what you just saw would have been the <i>result</i> laid down in the history of the world.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…So you’re saying that since the dragon was defeated, it never actually happened?”</p>
<p class="TX">“To put it simply, yes. Those who dwell outside the Garden won’t remember it all,” Kuroe said matter-of-factly.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki could only stare out at the city in shock, hardly able to believe what he was hearing.</p>
<p class="TX">Slowly, the dribs and drabs of information that Kuroe had offered him began to fall into place.</p>
<p class="TX">“Are you saying this kind of thing happens often…?”</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe gave him an exaggerated nod, her gaze unflinching. “This was the fifteen thousandth one hundred and sixty-fifth occurrence.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“That is the total number of times that mages, starting with Lady Saika, have saved the world.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…! B-but that’s…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes… The world faces an annihilation event roughly every three hundred hours, on average.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…” Mushiki could only stare back at her, his incredulity plain to see.</p>
<p class="TX">“It isn’t only dragons. There is the fruit of wisdom with the power to create star- or planet-destroying weapons, psychic anomalies that bring about endless natural cataclysms, swarms of golden locusts that devour everything in their path, deadly pandemics with massive fatality rates, emissaries from the future hoping to change the course of history, and <span aria-label=" Page 24. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_24" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>a gigantic conflagration that would encompass the entire planet with its mere existence… These entities, each of them with the power to destroy the earth as we know it, we call <i>annihilation factors</i>.”</p>
<p class="TX">She paused for a moment before adding: “The work of mages like us is to use our skills to eliminate those annihilation factors. In the past, there have even been one or two such events that only Lady Saika herself was capable of resolving. Do you understand what I’m saying? If not for her, this world would have surely been destroyed. <i>That</i> is how vital the person with whom you have merged is.” She spoke quietly as she told him this, but there was an unmistakable zeal to her voice.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s hands were trembling as he took in this shocking revelation. “I-it’s unbelievable…,” he whispered under his breath.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe forced her eyes shut. “Indeed. Your apprehension is understandable, but I assure you, it’s all true.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hold on. You said there’s one of these <i>annihilation events</i> every three hundred hours, and there’s been more than fifteen thousand of them now…? So counting back, that means she’s been doing this for more than five hundred years, right…? And she’s still got such beautiful, silky skin… Yep, it’s unbelievable, all right…”</p>
<p class="TX">“…” Wordlessly, Kuroe unleashed her pent-up fury.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ow, that hurts! Stop!” Mushiki was forced to lift his hands over his head in an attempt to shield himself from her repeated strikes.</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment—</p>
<p class="TX">“…! Eh?”</p>
<p class="TX">Like a meteor hitting the ground, a flash of light touched down before them as a man appeared.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yo, Kuozaki. So you were watchin’ from up here, huh? Must be nice livin’ it up.”</p>
<p class="TX">The man was young and, though slim, had a well-toned, muscular body adorned in a well-tailored shirt complete with a vest and slacks.</p>
<p class="TX">He had tan skin, and his black hair was tied back in a braid. He had the sharp eyes of a predator, and a wild smile stretched across his face. Altogether, his appearance reminded Mushiki nothing short of a ferocious animal.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 25. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_25" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“You’re…”</p>
<p class="TX">There could be no doubt about it. He was the mage responsible for crushing the dragon just now.</p>
<p class="TX">As proof of that, two vajras—golden weapons shaped like claws—floated in the air beside him, crackling with electricity.</p>
<p class="TX">Moreover, there were two huge wings at his back, shining like halos. That divine aura was an odd match with his otherwise wild appearance.</p>
<p class="TX">With Mushiki staring back in stunned silence, the man’s lips puckered as he flashed them a bold grin. “Somethin’ up? You look like a pigeon shot dead by a peashooter. Ah, maybe you’ve been wowed by my awesome magic techniques, eh?” the man said with a flippant shrug.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki found himself nodding along. “It <i>was</i> awesome. That was <i>you</i>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hah?” The man’s mouth dropped open, his confusion obvious.</p>
<p class="TX">“It was amazing… Such a huge dragon. You must be an incredibly strong mage… Right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hah…? Wh-what’re you blabberin’ about…? Did your breakfast disagree with you or somethin’…? And there’s somethin’ up with your voice, too…” The man pulled back, almost flinching.</p>
<p class="TX">Despite his words, however, his cheeks had turned a light pink.</p>
<p class="TX">“No. I said it was amazing because it <i>was</i> amazing. I mean, how did you <i>do</i> that?”</p>
<p class="TX">“<i>H-how…?</i> I mean, it wasn’t all that hard, just my second substantiation, you know…? I—I guess I <i>did</i> tweak the formula a little, though.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I see! Your spell… I don’t really understand it. What was it exactly?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Like I’m gonna tell! Why do I gotta share my secrets?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t say that. Come on. I just want to know how you pulled off that awesome move. Tell me.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…F-fine… I guess I can show you a little…,” the man mumbled, his lips slowly curling into a grin.</p>
<p class="TX">As scary as he might look, he didn’t seem all that complicated.</p>
<p class="TX">“You’ll do it?! Thank you! Um…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 26. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_26" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Did you mention your name just now?” Mushiki asked lightheartedly.</p>
<p class="TX">At this, Kuroe let out a small sigh that all but said <i>This is bad</i>.</p>
<p class="TX">The man had seemed somewhat relaxed up till now, but with this question, veins began to throb on his forehead. “H-hmm…? So that’s it…? Basically, I’m just a small fry, not even worth rememberin’…?</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? N-no, not at all. I just had a bit of a mental block for a moment—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Fine! I’ll just have to drill it in you till you never forget the name Anviet Svarner again! Arggghhh!”</p>
<p class="TX">Anviet (right, that was his name) flared with anger and stomped his leg heavily on the building rooftop.</p>
<p class="TX">As his boot made impact, a burst of terrible lightning exploded in all directions.</p>
<p class="TX">“…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">A net of light crisscrossed the rooftop like a spider’s web—and before he knew it, Mushiki found himself petrified.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hold on…! Stop!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Shuddup! If you’re gonna beg for your life—”</p>
<p class="TX">“What if Lady Saika’s beautiful face ends up getting scratched?!” Mushiki cried out.</p>
<p class="TX">“…” Anviet’s cheeks twitched. “I guess there’s no need to hold back, huh…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">With that, he lowered his hands—and the two vajras floating around him began to rotate at incredible speed, glowing as they charged with electricity.</p>
<p class="TX">“Take this! Vajdola!” As he cried out, Anviet thrust his hands forward and unleashed his ultimate attack.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s vision was flooded with blinding white light.</p>
<p class="TX">“…What?!”</p>
<p class="TX">He swallowed his breath, his stiffening body practically pinning him down.</p>
<p class="TX">“Mushiki!” Kuroe cried out, followed by a deafening roar.</p>
<p class="TX">He was perfectly aware that he had to try to dodge this attack, and yet his body refused to move.</p>
