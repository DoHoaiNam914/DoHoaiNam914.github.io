<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 182. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_182" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>With that, she leaped into action, flying into the sky as if gravity had somehow reversed.</p>
<p class="TX">“…! Wait!”</p>
<p class="TX">He had no idea what she was trying to achieve, but he knew that inaction would be disastrous and so, likewise, flew up into the air to meet her.</p>
<p class="TX">He slid up by the side of one of the towering structures surrounding them, its end far out of sight, continuing higher and higher.</p>
<p class="TX">Finally, Mushiki broke through the thick layer of clouds and reached the vastness of the deep-blue sky.</p>
<p class="TX">“This…”</p>
<p class="TX">As he looked out at the scene before him, his eyes widened in realization.</p>
<p class="TX">Towering mountains like razor-sharp swords stretched out before him.</p>
<p class="TX">In the distance above—the same scene, turned upside down, expanded in all directions.</p>
<p class="TX">He remembered this sight—he had seen it once before, after merging with Saika. It was the fourth substantiation he had used against Anviet.</p>
<p class="TX">Amid that landscape like the fangs of a huge beast closing in, Future Saika danced calmly through the sky as she turned her staff toward him.</p>
<p class="TX">“…It’s over.”</p>
<p class="TX">In response to those words, the two metropolises, above and below, began to close in to crush him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ngh…!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki in turn raised his own staff, channeled his magical energy, and commanded the world.</p>
<p class="TX">…But this place, half of which was supposed to have been generated by his own fourth substantiation, failed to react in any discernible way.</p>
<p class="TX">Future Saika gave a victorious smirk. “I told you, <i>Mushiki</i>. It’s over.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 183. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_183" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She emphasized his name as she spoke, as though claiming that of Saika Kuozaki exclusively for herself.</p>
<p class="TX">“You’ve imitated me well. Whatever your reasons, your talent is commendable… But looked at from another perspective, that’s all it is. To think that an imitation could ever defeat the real thing.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ugh…”</p>
<p class="TX">As Future Saika’s beautiful voice penetrated his ears, his whole consciousness was submerged in darkness.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">“…Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">When he came to, Mushiki was sitting at a desk in what looked like a classroom.</p>
<p class="TX">It wasn’t his room in the central school building at the Garden, but instead, it looked like a normal classroom at an ordinary school.</p>
<p class="TX">But was <i>ordinary</i> really the right word? There was nothing outside the window, just a pure-white void. As though this classroom existed in a dimension entirely by itself.</p>
<p class="TX">“This place… No, more importantly…”</p>
<p class="TX">A moment later, he remembered what had happened just before losing consciousness and glanced down at his hands.</p>
<p class="TX">“Right, Future Saika killed me…,” he murmured before falling silent.</p>
<p class="TX">The reason was simple—those weren’t Saika’s hands, but his own.</p>
<p class="TX">It wasn’t just his hands that had reverted in form. His entire body, so far as he could feel with his fingertips, had changed back to its original form. Had something prompted another state conversion?</p>
<p class="TX">No, maybe this was supposed to be a world beyond death? If he had breathed his last, it stood to reason that he would have regained his own body.</p>
<p class="TX">“Am I…dead…?” he uttered.</p>
<p class="TX">Strangely, he felt neither sorrow nor regret. It was like he was listening to his own voice with the composure of someone else.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Ugh.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 184. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_184" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Then another possibility took hold in the back of his mind, his heart tightening in alarm.</p>
<p class="TX">If <i>he</i> had died, that also meant Saika’s body had died—and that Future Saika had chosen the worst possible outcome.</p>
<p class="TX">“I… I…”</p>
<p class="TX">He clenched his fists and slammed them down on his desk, ruing his inability to do anything about it all.</p>
<p class="TX">When—</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">“It isn’t time yet for mourning. There is still more for you to do.”</p>
<div class="LI_SB"></div>
<p class="TX">“…!”</p>
<p class="TX">A voice resounded through the air, and Mushiki looked up with a start.</p>
<p class="TX">His heart skipped a beat—not because of the sudden sound of the voice calling out to him nor even because of what exactly it had said.</p>
<p class="TX">Rather, what had startled him was that it had sounded so familiar.</p>
<p class="TX">“Um…”</p>
<p class="TX">Taken by surprise, he cast his gaze to the front of the room.</p>
<p class="TX">Before him was the blackboard, the teacher’s lectern, and a table—and atop that table sat a girl, cool and unfazed.</p>
<p class="TX">“You…” He stared at her face, his words failing him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Even I couldn’t beat her. No one in this world as it is now can. And yet…” She rose slowly to her feet. “I’ll say it again. I’m glad it was you who found me.”</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Saika Kuozaki from the future let out a shallow breath, then deactivated her fourth substantiation.</p>
<p class="TX">Just as the fourth component of her crest faded away above her head, the fangs of the city that had just engulfed Mushiki dissipated, the nighttime scenery of the forecourt in the Garden reappearing in their place.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 185. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_185" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The other three layers of her crest remained activated. There may have been a clear difference between her overall strength and that of her opponent, but she was, after all, facing her former self. Until she could confirm her death, she couldn’t afford to let down her guard.</p>
<p class="TX">Still, that was ultimately just a precaution.</p>
<p class="TX">She had felt a solid response upon making impact. There could be little doubt that her past self, and Mushiki Kuga along with her, had perished.</p>
<p class="TX">Left alone, the realm created by the former World King would begin to collapse. She had to take her former self’s place before that could happen.</p>
<p class="TX">“…So he <i>was</i> all talk after all,” she murmured with a touch of disappointment.</p>
<p class="TX">She didn’t waste a second before rescinding that thought. Disappointment was an emotion that arose from having <i>expectations</i>. It was hardly appropriate for her to use such an expression now.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, she would have been lying if she had said that no pain pricked her heart. Mushiki had also been a part of Saika’s beloved world. He was one of the people whom she had hoped to save.</p>
<p class="TX">The same was true for Ruri. She adored Saika and had always been by her side back then—so while she had no choice but to eliminate her, she had kept the damage to a level that could be addressed with adequate medical treatment. If she hadn’t gone that far, Ruri would no doubt have fought to the end.</p>
<p class="TX">…It was all meaningless now. With a sneer of self-derision, Future Saika shook her head.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Now, then…”</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, as she glanced around for the corpse of her past self, which should now have been freed from her fourth substantiation…</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">In the forecourt in front of the mansion, a solitary figure appeared, a gust of wind coursing around it.</p>
<p class="TX">For a moment, she thought she had seen her past self—but she was wrong.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 186. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_186" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Standing there before her was a young man, his powerless face turned downward.</p>
<p class="TX">His hair was light in color, his arms and legs too thin to describe as muscular. There were no distinguishing features about his silhouette.</p>
<p class="TX">“What…?”</p>
<p class="TX">As she took in his figure, her brow furrowed.</p>
<p class="TX">Naturally, the only individuals here were her, her past self, and the attendant who had passed out at the edge of the Garden.</p>
<p class="TX">“…No, it can’t be…”</p>
<p class="TX">The moment she realized the possibility, she watched him on high alert.</p>
<p class="TX">“A state conversion. So the <i>death</i> of the outside body caused the original hidden form to manifest?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Had the boy—Mushiki—reacted to those words, or was it just coincidence? In any event, he was now staring back at her.</p>
<p class="TX">His eyes were somewhat vacant as they scanned her face, causing her to wonder whether he was truly aware.</p>
<p class="TX">Future Saika, however, remained nonplussed, focusing her strength into the staff in her hand.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes. If Mushiki was still alive, that meant her past self wasn’t entirely dead, either. She could perhaps have been in a state of suspended animation from the damage she had sustained, but so long as Mushiki, with whom her life force was intertwined, remained breathing, she would slowly heal behind the scenes.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m sorry. I bear you no enmity, but I can’t allow my past self to live.” So saying, she raised her staff into the air once more—the crest of her fourth substantiation unfolding above her head. “I’ll offer you a tribute—by giving you the same death as my past self.”</p>
<p class="TX">All at once, the world changed form with Future Saika at its center.</p>
<p class="TX">A cerulean sky unfurled, towering fang-like pinnacles appearing above and below.</p>
<p class="TX">Among the endless landscapes made possible by her fourth substantiation, this was the closest to her original home—the distorted modern cityscape.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 187. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_187" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>However, this ability, this realm, was ultimately just a by-product—the true essence of her magic lay in measuring possibilities and selecting them.</p>
<p class="TX">The power to manipulate fate and draw forth a desired future.</p>
<p class="TX">In this domain, she had no peers.</p>
<p class="TX">“Fourth Substantiation: Void’s Garden.”</p>
<p class="TX">As she spoke, a cluster of towering structures closed in on Mushiki like the jaw of a mighty beast.</p>
<p class="TX">He didn’t move. Or was it more correct to say he <i>couldn’t</i> move? He simply stood there in quiet acceptance of the oncoming death.</p>
<p class="TX">Soon, fangs touched fangs, overlapping each other as they fell to crush Mushiki between them.</p>
<p class="TX">Only—</p>
<p class="TX">“…Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, Future Saika’s eyebrows quivered in surprise.</p>
<p class="TX">Those twin rows of monoliths were entwined together—when a small crack ruptured through the middle, that solid outer wall collapsing like a sandcastle.</p>
<p class="TX">“What…?”</p>
<p class="TX">She had never before witnessed such a phenomenon and, for a long moment, doubted her own eyes.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, from amid that collapsing rubble…</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">…Mushiki emerged without a scratch.</p>
<p class="TX">“No…” Words failed Future Saika as she watched from a distance.</p>
<p class="TX">This was to be expected.</p>
<p class="TX">After all, above Mushiki’s head now hovered a transparent crest forged from what could have been horns or barbs.</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Thinner, thinner again.</p>
<p class="TX">He felt like his essence was being honed, polished.</p>
<p class="TX">Broader, much broader.</p>
<p class="TX">A sense as of melting into the wider world.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 188. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_188" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Mushiki, having reverted from Saika’s form back to his own, was staring straight ahead at Future Saika through the crumbling debris.</p>
<p class="TX">It was a strange feeling.</p>
<p class="TX">An eerie sense of omnipotence, just as when he had first wielded magic in the guise of Saika’s body.</p>
<p class="TX">However, now he was himself. There was no way he could be wielding Saika’s magic here.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes, the only abilities available to him as he was now…</p>
<p class="TX">…were his own.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah…”</p>
<p class="TX">Of course, he had never used these powers before, not even once.</p>
<p class="TX">What form did they take? What were their abilities? How was he supposed to train them, develop them? He didn’t have the faintest clue.</p>
<p class="TX">But even so.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes, even so.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki, a novice mage, had accumulated experiences that by all means should have been impossible.</p>
<p class="TX">Now feelings that should not have existed did.</p>
<p class="TX">The strongest mage. Saika Kuozaki.</p>
<p class="TX">These hands now knew what it felt like to have wielded the powers of the World King, the pride of Saika Kuozaki.</p>
<p class="TX">All that remained was to carefully re-create them.</p>
<p class="TX">If he could do that…</p>
<p class="TX">If he could do that, Mushiki Kuga’s own innate magic, powers that shouldn’t have existed anywhere in the world, would come to life.</p>
<p class="TX">“So you’re a mage, too? That’s an odd technique you’re weaving,” Future Saika, floating in the air before him, said with narrowed eyes. “But so what? What can you possibly hope to achieve with a fragile first substantiation like that?”</p>
<p class="TX">That was exactly what Mushiki himself wanted to know. His own new techniques had just come into being. Not even he had a clear grasp on them.</p>
<p class="TX">Yet be that as it may, he had already decided on his response to Future Saika’s jeer. “I’ll save you.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 189. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_189" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…Tch.” Future Saika looked furious at this direct remark. “Did I mishear you just now? <i>You</i> mean to save <i>me</i>?”</p>
<p class="TX">She stared down at him, her eyes burning with contempt, indignation, and agitation.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki slowly looked up. “Saika, your goal isn’t to take the place of your present-day self but to save the world from destruction… Right?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…What of it?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki pointed to his chest with his thumb. “If we can prevent that future, that would mean you don’t have to kill our Saika.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Enough with these games. How can <i>you</i> possibly overturn a wave of destruction that <i>I</i> couldn’t even escape?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Yeah, I know it won’t be easy. But at the very least…there’s one crucial difference between you and the present-day Saika.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…And what would that be?”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki stared straight into her eyes as he answered her. “Me. I’ll save you… It’s thanks to you that I got to meet my Saika… It’s thanks to you that my destiny was changed… So I’ll never let you choose a course of action that will ruin you like this…!”</p>
<p class="TX">“…!”</p>
<p class="TX">Future Saika’s breath caught in her throat for a moment—but her countenance soon twisted in anger. “Don’t get carried away. You’re just an ordinary person who happened to stumble on my deathbed… You know nothing of the end of the world, of the heavens cracking and the earth splitting open… You know nothing of despair, of the screams of countless innocents… You haven’t watched as your world and everyone you love dies before your very eyes…!”</p>
<p class="TX">Then, looking as if she might burst into tears, she screamed. “I won’t say that what I’m doing is <i>right</i>. I don’t care if you denounce me as a villain. But I…I <i>will</i> kill you to save this world…!” she cried, giving him a murderous glare.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki met her gaze head-on. “In that case, to save you, I will defeat you.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What utter nonsense…!” Future Saika shouted—and as her voice echoed, fresh spires manifested behind her.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 190. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_190" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>All at once, their tips turned toward Mushiki and unleashed a tremendous blast of magical energy.</p>
<p class="TX">Each one of those barrages was a lethal blow, brilliant bursts of light in every color imaginable.</p>
<p class="TX">They coursed toward him, too many to possibly count.</p>
<p class="TX">Yet Mushiki, even faced with this desperate situation, was filled with a strange sense of calm.</p>
<p class="TX">“I couldn’t use my Saika’s magic to beat you. That’s only natural. After all, you’re the real thing. But,” he said, still staring at her through the blinding light, “there’s one part of me that could never lose to you.”</p>
<p class="TX">As his vision flooded with rainbow-colored light, his thoughts grew sharper, more finely honed.</p>
<p class="TX">If he died here, Future Saika would, as she had already declared, take whatever measures she thought necessary to save the world.</p>
<p class="TX">Even knowing that so many lives would be lost by her doing so.</p>
<p class="TX">To save a greater number, she would discard those whom she loved more than anything else.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki couldn’t allow her to do that.</p>
<p class="TX">“Second Substantiation…”</p>
<p class="TX">From deep in the emptiness of his consciousness, a soft voice emitted—and above his head, his crest unfolded with a second layer.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hollow Edge.”</p>
<p class="TX">As though answering his call, magical energy converged around his arm to forge a sword, a transparent blade like glass.</p>
<p class="TX">A fleeting weapon, so ephemeral that light itself might break it.</p>
<p class="TX">“The one thing that you will never defeat…” Mushiki spoke with deep conviction as he brought the only thing capable of stopping the strongest witch in the world swooping down. “…is my love for Saika!”</p>
<p class="TX">He directed the tip of his narrow blade her way—toward the oncoming, raging, murderous force coursing toward him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Descend, my illusion…!” Future Saika cried out, wielding the staff of her second substantiation.</p>
