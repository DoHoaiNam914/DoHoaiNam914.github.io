<p class="COTX">At Void’s Garden, the mage training institute located in Ohjoh City in Tokyo, the room for class 2-A was filled with a strange tension.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“…”</i></p>
<p class="TX">The students lined up in orderly rows, along with the homeroom teacher standing by the table at the front, all holding their breaths, their expressions fraught, as though utterly convinced that letting out so much as a sigh might lead to the gravest of consequences.</p>
<p class="TX">It called to mind a herd of weak herbivores desperately hiding from a larger predator. Desperately trying to blend into the surrounding landscape so as not to attract the notice of their natural enemies or any transcendental beings. As future mages whose mission would be to save the world from destruction, they looked rather unreliable.</p>
<p class="TX">That said, no one could accuse them of cowardice.</p>
<p class="TX">Above all—</p>
<p class="TX">“Y-yes… Introductions… We have a new transfer student coming to join us today, Lady Saika Kuozaki—er, uh, just S-Saika, I suppose…”</p>
<p class="TX">The head of the entire school, and the most powerful mage in the world, the Witch of Resplendent Color, Saika Kuozaki, had unexpectedly joined this class as a transfer student.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, right. Nice to meet you, everyone.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 42. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_42" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>In appearance, she didn’t look much older than the other students. She was a beauty, complete with mesmerizing, lustrous hair. She couldn’t possibly be used to wearing her school uniform, but it did look nice on her. If those present in the classroom hadn’t known just how significant a figure she really was, they would have no doubt been utterly captivated by her appearance.</p>
<p class="TX">However, her incredible, overwhelming depths of magic, the legends of her prowess, were already engraved in their minds, and her shockingly beautiful multicolored eyes didn’t allow them to feel at ease.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>…Why is the headmistress transferring in as a student…? Wh-what’s her goal…?</i></p>
<p class="TX"><i>No way; is she looking for promising students or something…? I’d better find a way to stand out…!</i></p>
<p class="TX"><i>But what if I do something to upset her…?</i></p>
<p class="TX">The unvoiced cries of the other students all but flooded the classroom.</p>
<p class="TX">The homeroom teacher in charge of introducing Saika to the class was likewise shaking in trepidation. If anything, <i>she</i> was probably the most stressed individual in the entire room.</p>
<p class="TX">That was when it happened.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Argh, I can’t take this anymore!”</p>
<p class="TX">Having seemingly lost her patience, a serious-looking girl rose to her feet.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“Wha—?!”</i></p>
<p class="TX">Watching on, the other students, and the homeroom teacher, too, caught their collective breath.</p>
<p class="TX">“…! D-don’t do it, Fuyajoh! Restrain yourself!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t make a scene! That’s Madam Witch we’re talking about!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Are you willing to throw away your entire career?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Like a dam breaking, voices rose out from everywhere, urging the girl to hold back.</p>
<p class="TX">In spite of that, her face awash with resolve and determination, the girl stepped toward Saika.</p>
<p class="TX">“Madam Witch,” she called out.</p>
<p class="TX">“Wh-what?” Saika stuttered.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 43. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_43" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>With a devil-may-care expression, the student pulled out her smartphone. “Can I take a picture…?” she asked, sweat beading on her forehead and cheeks.</p>
<p class="TX">At those words, the entire class held their heads in relief, shock, and exasperation.</p>
<p class="TX">That girl was none other than Ruri Fuyajoh of class 2-A and the Knights of the Garden, a well-mannered student with excellent grades—and a huge, huge fan of Saika Kuozaki.</p>
<p class="TX">“…F-Fuyajoh! Don’t be rude! Return to your seat!” Finally, the homeroom teacher, Tomoe Kurieda, rushed in to stop her.</p>
<p class="TX">Tomoe was in her midtwenties, around a head taller than Saika in height—but perhaps due to her cowering expression, or her trembling voice, she came across as the younger of the two.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Sorry, Ms. Kurieda. I know I’m being disrespectful, but there are times when a woman has to fight, even when she knows she shouldn’t…!”</p>
<p class="TX">“What’s that supposed to mean?! You’re making a scene in front of the headmistress here, don’t you realize?! Wh-what if it becomes <i>my</i> responsibility?!” the homeroom teacher screamed.</p>
<p class="TX">The other students looked on, aghast as she let her true colors show, but Tomoe seemed like she didn’t notice.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Just so I’m clear, what’s the worst possible punishment you can give me for ignoring your instructions?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Th-that would be…suspension…I suppose?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah! I know that look! You’re thinking you might be suspended, but this could also be a rare opportunity to be chosen as a witch!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t stop me! It isn’t every day you get to see Madam Witch dressed in a school uniform! How will I be able to look myself in the mirror tomorrow if I let this pass?! I need to save this moment for all posterity…!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Nooo! I know it sounds nice, but you’ll ruin my reputation if you do that!” Tomoe cried, shaking Ruri by the shoulders with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p class="TX">Ruri, however, didn’t budge an inch. She truly was indomitable.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 44. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_44" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Watching from the sidelines, Saika gave them both a soft smile. “Ah…it’s okay. I don’t mind. Take as many as you want,” she said with a grandiose nod.</p>
<p class="TX">“M-Madam Witch…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Are you sure?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yep. Saika doesn’t often—I mean, <i>I</i> don’t often wear school uniforms, so I understand how you feel. We must have similar tastes. I would have taken some selfies this morning myself if Kuroe hadn’t stopped me.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“It’s nothing. Photos, right? I don’t mind… Can you send me a copy later?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…! O-of course!” Ruri’s face lit up, and she quickly held her phone in front of her like a professional photographer, taking picture after picture of Saika from various angles.</p>
<p class="TX">“Madam Witch! Please look over there!” she called out in excitement.</p>
<p class="TX">Saika was more than happy to oblige, striking an enthusiastic pose. “H-how about this?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes, I can’t get enough of it! Gorgeous! Absolutely beautiful!”</p>
<p class="TX">“What about this pose, then?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m dying! You’re killing me, Madam Witch! Incredible! You’re a natural!”</p>
<p class="TX">“What about one of Saika Kuozaki leaning against the windowsill with a melancholy look?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Eeep?! Oh my god…! H-how do you know what I want and dream of…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">So in a corner of the room, a full-on photo session had begun.</p>
<p class="TX">The most powerful mage in the world, the school headmistress Kuozaki, was posing happily in front of many onlookers—while Ruri, usually so serious and levelheaded, was positively gushing with glee as she snapped one picture after the next.</p>
<p class="TX">Utterly bewildered, the other students could only watch as this scene continued to unfold before their very eyes.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“What the hell is going on here…?”</i></p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 45. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_45" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i>“Is she testing us or something…?”</i></p>
<p class="TX"><i>“The strength of a mage lies in their strength of spirit… Don’t let yourself get carried away…”</i></p>
<p class="TX">No, there was no letup at all to their confusion.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1">Earlier…</p>
<p class="TX">“…Er, so can you explain this to me, Kuroe?” Mushiki asked upon their return to the headmistress’s office. “Why do I—I mean, why does Saika have to attend the school as a student? Isn’t she supposed to be the boss around here?”</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe responded with a nod. “As I mentioned earlier, your present status is that you have merged with Lady Saika.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Right.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I would like to separate you both as soon as possible—but that won’t be so straightforward. First, we must find a way of dealing with the other facets of this situation.”</p>
<p class="TX">“You mean the attacker…right?” Mushiki asked.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe bobbed her head. “From what I understand, the assailant must have caught Lady Saika unawares. If you had been attacked before she had regained consciousness…”</p>
<p class="TX">“…” Mushiki felt a cold sweat running down his back.</p>
<p class="TX">Needless to say, in that case, he would have died.</p>
<p class="TX">If the attacker was to try again now, he would almost certainly be killed.</p>
<p class="TX">That would mean the complete and total death of Saika Kuozaki.</p>
<p class="TX">“So first of all, you need to be able to control magic yourself, at will. When the assailant shows themselves once more, you <i>must</i> be capable of countering them.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Magic… You can’t expect me to pull off what I did to Anviet again. I don’t even know <i>how</i> I did it.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t worry. This Garden is an institution dedicated to the training of mages well versed in all forms of magic. There is no better place to learn than here.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 46. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_46" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Yeah, but this is still so sudden. No matter how much I learn, there’s no way I’ll be able to pull off what Saika could…”</p>
<p class="TX">“By the way,” Kuroe interrupted, ignoring the hesitation in his voice, “all students at the Garden must wear the appropriate uniform. They’re made from a special fiber, physically and magically toughened by what we call <i>spirit thread</i>. At the end of the shoulder straps is something that we refer to as a <i>realizing device</i>. Think of it as a wand used by modern-day mages. You should have already seen some of the other students here using theirs.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…? This is all happening too quickly. It does sound amazing, but still—”</p>
<p class="TX">“The uniform will look very good on Lady Saika, I’m sure.”</p>
<p class="TX">“I’ll do it.” Mushiki’s answer was so fast that he took himself by surprise.</p>
<p class="TX">Without even realizing it, he had found himself going along with Kuroe’s plan to make him attend this school of magic as a student.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">“What’s wrong, Kuroe?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…I know I was the one who suggested it, but I do have mixed feelings when these things proceed <i>exactly</i> the way I hoped.”</p>
<p class="TX">“<i>…Well, it’s the results that matter</i>,” she followed up under her breath. “You will be attending the Garden starting tomorrow, Mushiki. Rest assured, we will deal with your family and your previous school outside the Garden.”</p>
<p class="TX">“You’ll <i>deal</i> with them…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Don’t concern yourself over them,” she said in a commanding tone.</p>
<p class="TX">…Well, he would have been lying if he had said he wasn’t worried, but he could hardly go back to his old life in his current body. He would just have to leave it all to Kuroe to handle.</p>
<p class="TX">“As for your class… Yes, 2-A should be a good fit.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Based on what?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Among the students is a knight, Ruri Fuyajoh. She may be a student, but she is exceptionally skilled—she’s one of our leading knights, in fact. You never know when there might be another attack, so it won’t hurt to have a powerful mage by your side.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 47. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_47" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Ah… So that’s Ruri’s class? Heh, she was amazing, all right.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hmm?” With him agreeing so easily, Kuroe looked his way quizzically. “Speaking of which, Mushiki, you seem to already know her. Have you met?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, right. She’s my sister.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hah?”</p>
<p class="TX">What followed was a long, drawn-out silence.</p>
<p class="TX">Finally, Kuroe let out an uncharacteristically timorous voice. “Your <i>sister</i>? Ruri Fuyajoh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yeah. Well, my parents got divorced a long time ago, and I haven’t seen her in years. We pretty much lost all contact.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…So after seeing your long-lost sister at a mage training institute, that paltry reaction was all you felt…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“No. I mean, I’m in Saika’s body right now, right? I can’t exactly act all surprised and happy to see her again, can I?”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s true… Although, I can’t quite say whether you were being thoughtful or just <i>messed up</i>.” Kuroe looked vaguely uncomfortable, but she quickly regained her composure. “In any event, you will join class 2-A as Lady Saika, Mushiki. But first, there are a few things you should be aware of.”</p>
<p class="TX">“What?” Mushiki wondered.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe raised a finger into the air. “First of all—you must never let on that you are not, in fact, Lady Saika.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah… Yeah, that makes sense. I don’t want to ruin her image or anything.”</p>
<p class="TX">“That’s true enough, but there’s another reason, too.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Which is?”</p>
<p class="TX">“There is every possibility that your assailant is already aware of your survival.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…I see.” Mushiki nodded.</p>
<p class="TX">The fact that their target, touted as the strongest mage in the world, had escaped through some unknown means and was still alive would be no small matter to the attacker. If they were to attempt to strike again, they would undoubtedly proceed with considerable caution. However long that lasted, it would offer him at least some reprieve.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 48. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_48" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>However, if Mushiki’s current situation was to become known, the enemy would strike again without hesitation. After all, he was just an interloper in the guise of Saika Kuozaki. He had no idea where the aggressors might be lurking, so he would have to be immensely careful of what he said and did.</p>
<p class="TX">Though, there was one major problem that would have to be overcome.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’ll make an effort, of course… But I don’t really know a whole lot about Saika, do I?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m aware of that,” Kuroe replied, sensing his concern. “I will prepare a collection of videos of her. Be sure to study her speech patterns and mannerisms as much as possible.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh, is that really okay?!” Mushiki leaned forward in excitement.</p>
<p class="TX">Kuroe’s expression soured slightly. “I don’t exactly feel comfortable showing them to <i>you…</i> But necessity knows no law. It isn’t enough to look like her. You must earnestly <i>become</i> Lady Saika.”</p>
<p class="TX">“You want me to <i>be</i> her…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I know it’s a lot to ask, and it may be an affront to your own personal dignity. But right now—”</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m kinda nervous, y’know?” Mushiki exclaimed, his cheeks turning slightly red.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah yes. I suppose I need to learn, too…,” Kuroe said with a stern look. “I know this won’t be easy, but we are grateful for your efforts. Now, I’ll say this once more—under no circumstances are you to reveal that you are not the real Lady Saika. Understand?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yep, leave it to me. This is all for her.” Mushiki nodded strongly.</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Sitting in his seat after morning homeroom, Mushiki silently propped his elbows on his desk and wrapped his fingers around his forehead.</p>
<p class="TX">The reason was simple. Even though Kuroe had reminded him just yesterday not to do anything stupid, he had already gotten wrapped up in a photo shoot before class had even begun.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 49. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_49" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Of course, he <i>was</i> trying to be careful. From the minute he had arrived at school this morning, he had been doing his utmost to imitate Saika Kuozaki’s mannerisms.</p>
<p class="TX">But the moment Ruri asked to snap some photos, he had thought: <i>I want those photos, too!</i> Thus, he had let himself get carried away, striking one pose after another. To be honest, even now while reflecting on his actions, he was still looking forward to receiving the finished pictures.</p>
<p class="TX">…Hold on. Wasn’t Ruri working directly under Saika as her subordinate? In that case, wouldn’t Saika herself have found it difficult to turn down her request? If so, maybe he <i>had</i> made the right choice? Then again, the amount of effort he had put into getting that final special shot, an image he had already titled <i>Saika Kuozaki Playing with Her Hair in a Cool Breeze</i>, had probably been overkill…</p>
<p class="TX">“…Or not,” he murmured under his breath, stopping himself there.</p>
<p class="TX">If left unchecked, the small voice inside his head might start a full-blown analysis of Saika’s behavior to justify his actions.</p>
<p class="TX">He had a few things to reflect on, but it was also very much unlike Saika to dwell on the past. What mattered to her was the future. Keeping that in mind, he decided to fix his sights on what was ahead of him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Madam Witch!”</p>
<p class="TX">A familiar voice caught his attention.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, Ruri,” he answered, turning toward her as she placed something down on his desk. “What’s this?”</p>
<p class="TX">“The photos I took a short while ago! You said you wanted them, so I had them printed as fast as I could!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah. That <i>was</i> quick.” Mushiki feigned calm as he picked them up.</p>
<p class="TX">Inwardly, he wanted to jump to his feet in joy, but he had to hold it in.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yep! The portable wireless photo printer is one of the seven indispensable tools of a modern maiden! I printed them under my desk while the teacher was talking!” Ruri puffed out her chest in pride, her eyes twinkling.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri…,” called out a new figure suppressing a smile as she appeared <span aria-label=" Page 50. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_50" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>behind her. “Homeroom is an essential part of the Garden curriculum, you realize? Besides, you shouldn’t bully the teacher so much.”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki turned his gaze to a kind-looking student dressed in a Garden uniform, her carefully braided hair reaching down to her shoulders. Her brow was creased in a frown, as though expecting trouble.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yeah, of course. I know,” Ruri responded nonchalantly.</p>
<p class="TX">The girl remained at a visible loss. “Ah… I know, and that’s just the thing… How many times have I warned you? But getting Madam Witch involved, that’s, well…”</p>
<p class="TX">“But she’s in a school uniform, you know? I’ll say that again—she’s in a <i>school uniform</i>. This could be a once-in-a-lifetime miracle, you know? Did you hear me? Do you need me to repeat myself?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I—I heard you… I can see how enthusiastic you are about it…” Faced with Ruri’s impassioned remarks, the girl took a step back.</p>
<p class="TX">Watching on, Mushiki found himself letting out a small laugh. “I’m sorry. It looks like I’ve caused you a little trouble. Um…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah…! M-my apologies! I’m Hizumi Nagekawa. I’m in the same dorm room as Ruri here,” the girl introduced herself, hurriedly bowing her head.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki gave her a light nod. “You don’t need to stand on ceremony. I’m not the headmistress here, just a fellow student. Rather, I’d be grateful if you could teach <i>me</i> while I’m here.”</p>
<p class="TX">“O-of course…” Hizumi shrank back in reverent fear.</p>
<p class="TX">Observing from the side, Ruri puffed out her cheeks.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ruri?” Hizumi asked.</p>
<p class="TX">“<i>I</i> can help her.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Sure, you’re a good teacher, but you know? I can help Madam Witch, too! If you want, I’ll stick by your side and support you for your entire academic life!” With a huff, she turned her face away, sulking.</p>
<p class="TX">“Come on, don’t pout. I’m counting on you as well, Ruri,” Mushiki said with an awkward chuckle.</p>
<p class="TX">Something about her behavior reminded him of the past.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 51. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_51" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Thinking back, how many years had it been since he had last seen her? In his memories, she was still a small child. Her hair, too, had been much shorter than it was now.</p>
<p class="TX">He never could have imagined he would meet her again in a place like this—and he in a different body no less…</p>
<p class="TX">“…Madam Witch? Is there something on my face?” Ruri asked, staring back at him strangely.</p>
<p class="TX">His emotions getting the better of him, he must have been staring at her for an uncomfortably long time.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki shook his head. “No, no. It’s your hair. I just thought it looks wonderful. It was nice short, but long hair suits you, too.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh…” Ruri fell silent, her cheeks flushing. “You’re a smooth talker, Madam Witch. Yes, I used to wear it shorter, but my brother told me once that he likes girls with longer hair, so I grew it out…” She stopped there, as if just realizing something. “Huh? Madam Witch, did I show you a picture of when I had shorter hair or something?”</p>
<p class="TX">“A-ah,” he stuttered.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>Now I’ve done it.</i></p>
<p class="TX">Apparently, that was something Saika shouldn’t have known.</p>
<p class="TX">Though it would be even more out of character for Saika to rush to make things right after a mistake like that, so ignoring his pounding heart, he gave Ruri an elegant wink.</p>
<p class="TX">“Heh. I know everything about you, Ruri, you know?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oooh!” Ruri clutched her hands to her chest, as though the wind had just been knocked out of her.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, staggering, she propped herself upright with one hand on the desk and struggled to breathe. “M-Madam Witch… You almost had me swooning there…” She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.</p>
<p class="TX">Hizumi, visibly anxious, feigned a chuckle.</p>
<p class="TX">Thanks in part to Ruri’s own response, it looked like he had managed to cover his mistake. Mushiki breathed a sigh of relief, glad the two girls hadn’t seen through him.</p>
<p class="SBORN"><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/orn-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="TX1"><span aria-label=" Page 52. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_52" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“The second point to note is the proper handling of magical energy.”</p>
<p class="TX">Earlier, back in the headmistress’s office, Kuroe had continued her second round of explanations.</p>
<p class="TX">“The proper handling…of magical energy? I don’t even know what that means…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Think of it as the latent energy that resides in all living things. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into two rough categories—the external energy that fills the world and the internal energy that exists within each individual. The former is known as mana, the latter as od.” Accentuating each point with hand gestures, Kuroe carried on: “I won’t go into the details now, but Lady Saika’s internal life force energy far surpasses that of most average people. That is to say, using her power, she can activate techniques of a scale that would be beyond ordinary mages, unless of course they drew on external energy, too.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Wow. Saika sounds incredible, wouldn’t you agree?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. She <i>is</i> incredible. But right now, that enormous reservoir of magical energy is like a waterfall spilling out of control… Can you see anything around your body?”</p>
<p class="TX">“…?” Mushiki glanced down at his hands.</p>
<p class="TX">As he strained his eyes, he couldn’t help but feel as if his surroundings were somehow vaguely aglow.</p>
<p class="TX">“Whoa… What’s going on?”</p>
<p class="TX">“That is Lady Saika’s magical energy. You must have only become aware of it after I mentioned it to you.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Is it that easy to see?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hardly. It usually takes a student close to a full year to develop an awareness of someone’s magic. Don’t forget that you are looking through Lady Saika’s eyes right now.” After a short pause, Kuroe cautioned, “Remember that a powerful mage has already detected your innate magical energy. Lady Saika’s assailant may believe her dead, so they may not be keeping an eye out for her…but the situation won’t remain this way forever.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Right… So it won’t be good if she keeps on leaking it all over the place, huh?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 53. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_53" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Indeed, though I’m a little concerned about how you phrased that… First, you must learn to feel—no, to <i>remember</i>—how to hold your magical energy inside your body.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Remember, huh?” Mushiki crossed his arms at this odd usage of words.</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. Just as you have now remembered how to sense magic, that ability likewise lies latent within Lady Saika’s body. However, because you don’t know how to activate it, it isn’t working. What you need is awareness and recognition… You should also know that magical energy is a powerful force in and of itself. Even without casting spells or techniques, simply gathering it in your hand and throwing it at a target can be particularly destructive. Especially when we’re talking about Lady Saika’s magic, the most powerful on earth…”</p>
<p class="TX">With an almost threatening tone, Kuroe concluded: “Please do be careful.”</p>
<p class="LI_SB_2">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="TX1">Unsurprisingly, the atmosphere in the classroom remained unchanged when it came time for their first-period lecture.</p>
<p class="TX">Though, strictly speaking, it seemed to have become even more strained than during homeroom.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“…”</i></p>
<p class="TX">The other students didn’t look at Mushiki unkindly, but he could sense that they were all paying keen attention to his every move. If he was to so much as sneeze, he suspected, some of them might even be thrown from their chairs in shock.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Feeling ill at ease, he let out a short sigh.</p>
<p class="TX">Then Ruri, in the seat beside him, spoke in a voice just loud enough that only he could hear. “Don’t let them get to you. They’re all just nervous.” Her words were accompanied by a soft smile.</p>
<p class="TX">Incidentally, Ruri’s seat had been a good distance away earlier in the day, but for some reason, she seemed to have moved right next to him by the time class began.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 54. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_54" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The student who had originally been at the table next to Mushiki’s was now sitting in Ruri’s old seat, her body visibly quivering. Just what kind of <i>negotiation</i> had Ruri imposed on her?</p>
<p class="TX">“…Ah. I know. It just feels so strange. Like their gazes are reaching out and stroking my body all over.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Well, there’s nothing we can do about it. I mean, you’re so dear to us all, Madam Witch. How could we <i>not</i> be intrigued by you?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Right… I suppose <i>reaching out and stroking my body all over</i> might not be the best way to put it, either? But it makes your heart race a little, don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Did you read my mind just now?” Ruri’s cheeks turned red, her eyes widening.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki suspected that he knew why everyone seemed to regard her as a genius.</p>
<p class="TX">“Well, er… We should probably all get a grip and move on to today’s class,” said their homeroom teacher, Tomoe Kurieda, at the front of the room, her tone suggesting she was still in fact far from doing that herself. It looked like she would be responsible for first period.</p>
<p class="TX">As her trembling fingers reached out to the wall, a dim light appeared. It seemed to be some kind of electronic blackboard.</p>
<p class="TX">Each desk was equipped with a modern, even futuristic-looking tablet-style terminal—a far cry from what Mushiki would have imagined he might find at a so-called magical academy.</p>
<p class="TX">Speaking of which, he had asked Kuroe about that, but her response had been one of utter confusion. “Why would you use magic when electricity will suffice?” That simple reply had left him at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="TX">“So let’s continue where we left off yesterday, on the topic of the Five Great Discoveries and Transformations in the history of magic…” So Tomoe began the lesson, her fingers shaking slightly as she manipulated the digital blackboard.</p>
<p class="TX">For their part, the students turned down to their tablets to take notes while still stealing furtive glances Mushiki’s way.</p>
<p class="TX">“…As you all know, the history of magic can be roughly divided into <span aria-label=" Page 55. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_55" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>five distinct generations,” Tomoe said. “These are the discovery of magic, the application of spells and techniques, the use of magic circles and diagrams and their application to matter—”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hmm.” As he listened to the lesson, Mushiki stroked his chin.</p>
<p class="TX">Not surprisingly, he couldn’t understand a word she was saying.</p>
<p class="TX">Nevertheless, he couldn’t afford to let it go to waste. After all, not only his life, but Saika’s, too, was at stake here.</p>
<p class="TX">So while he felt a little guilty about interrupting the lesson, he raised his hand. “Um, can I…?”</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“…!”</i></p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, every set of eyes in the classroom locked onto him.</p>
<p class="TX">The situation was already nerve-racking, but this only further added to the oppressive tension. The students’ expressions seized up.</p>
<p class="TX">What on earth could the headmistress have to add here? That was the question on everyone’s minds as they stared his way with bated breath, unable to move so much as a muscle.</p>
<p class="TX">“Kyargh! D-d-did I overlook something…?!” Tomoe stammered, her shoulders heaving as though she was about to break down in tears.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki felt sorry about having to ask this, seeing how she looked like an abandoned dog left shivering out in the rain, but he could see no other way.</p>
<p class="TX">“Um, no, I just have a question, that’s all.”</p>
<p class="TX">“A-ah… Wh-what is it…?” Tomoe asked in unfeigned terror.</p>
<p class="TX">No doubt everyone would laugh when they heard it, but he asked anyway. “Sorry for asking something so basic, but…can you start by explaining briefly what magic is?”</p>
<p class="TX"><i>“…?!”</i></p>
<p class="TX">The class was in shocked silence at Mushiki’s question before quickly being gripped by an uproar.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Wh-what magic<i>…is…</i>?”</p>
<p class="TX">“She can’t mean that… It might sound simple, but it’s a terrifyingly deep question…!”</p>
<p class="TX">“A philosophical proposition seeking to understand the very basis of magic… You might as well ask <i>What is a human being?</i>…!”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 56. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_56" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“That’s the kind of curveball you expect at an academic conference or something! This isn’t beginner’s territory!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Watch out, Ms. Kurieda…! If you slip up before Madam Witch…”</p>
<p class="TX">The murmurs of the other students, having read far too much into Mushiki’s question, buzzed throughout the room. They all meant to keep their voices down, but he could make out everything they were saying.</p>
<p class="TX">He couldn’t tell for sure whether Tomoe, too, had heard them, but regardless, her face turned an almost sickly purple.</p>
<p class="TX">She seemed to fall to pondering before answering, but eventually, sweating buckets, she pressed her head down against the lectern.</p>
<p class="TX">“…I—I— I’m s-s-sorry, Madam Witch…! I’m just a shallow instructor, without the training to answer your profound question…! P-p-please spare me…!”</p>
<p class="TX">“I just want a normal answer,” Mushiki responded, scratching at his cheek.</p>
<p class="TX">She stole a few furtive glances his way before finally raising her face, awash in fear. “J-just a normal answer…? Really…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Yes. Like I’m a beginner.”</p>
<p class="TX">“A-all right…” Still seemingly at a loss, she launched into an explanation. “<i>M-magic</i> is a general term for techniques that rely on using magical energy to cause various phenomena… There are several different types of magic, but here at the Garden, we focus on the most common ones used to bring about physical substantiations… Th-that’s right, isn’t it…?” Tomoe asked aloud, glancing anxiously toward the students.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>You’ve got this</i>, their expressions seemed to say as they nodded back at her. <i>Good luck!</i></p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki continued to stroke his chin. To be honest, he still didn’t understand.</p>
<p class="TX">“Can you explain how it’s done, though? Just a really basic answer will be fine.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh…? W-well…” Tomoe slowly lifted a hand into the air and raised <span aria-label=" Page 57. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_57" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>her index finger. “The first thing I learned a long time ago now was to move your finger and try channeling your magical energy through it… It’s easier if you think of it like collecting cotton candy around your finger…,” she said, still twirling her finger in the air.</p>
<p class="TX">Looking carefully, Mushiki could see that a small layer of light did indeed seem to be gathering around it.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm.”</p>
<p class="TX">Right. He, too, should be able to pull off that much, at least. Kuroe had also told him that he ought to be able to so long as he knew the process.</p>
<p class="TX">Following Tomoe’s example, Mushiki extended his own finger and spun it through the air, envisioning a ball of cotton candy.</p>
<p class="TX">A split second later—</p>
<p class="TX"><i>Poof!</i> A huge mass of cotton candy came into being right then and there!</p>
<p class="TX">It continued to grow—until it soon grazed Tomoe’s hair and shot through the digital blackboard, blasting away the walls, the floor, and the ceiling.</p>
<p class="TX">“Heh?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Just like that, a gaping hole opened up at the front of the classroom. The electrical wiring running through the walls and ceiling must have been damaged by the explosion, as electricity was pouring out in sparks. At the same time, a breeze blew in from outside, catching a piece of Tomoe’s hair that had been cut off by the explosion and sending it fluttering through the room.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Wow…”</p>
<p class="TX">Startled, she was unable to let out so much as a scream. Her eyes rolled back into her head, and she fell to the ground like a puppet whose strings had been cut.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ms. Kuriedaaa?!”</p>
<p class="TX">“You <i>did</i> ask her to start with the basics…!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Please contain your anger, Madam Witch…! Ms. Kurieda never meant to insult your intelligence…!”</p>
<p class="TX">With the teacher having collapsed, the other students, initially watching in shocked silence at the sheer suddenness of the situation, started crying out at the top of their lungs.</p>
