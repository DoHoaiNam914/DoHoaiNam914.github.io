<p class="COTX">Following the mysterious mass outbreak of annihilation factors, Mushiki, as Saika, paid a visit to the medical facilities in the Garden’s eastern precinct.</p>
<p class="TX">The Garden’s medical building was a large five-storied building, though in truth, it wasn’t much different than a major hospital. The students who had been in the training hall during the attack were now gathered on the first floor.</p>
<p class="TX">That said, at first glance, none seemed to be badly injured. Even the worst among them had sustained nothing more than scratches or bruises. Rather than urgent medical treatment, the most prudent course of action was to give them all checkups as a precaution.</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh, Saika. That was a total disaster, no?”</p>
<p class="TX">Interrupting Mushiki’s thoughts, a young girl clothed in a large white coat with a light underwear-like outfit underneath approached him from the back of the building.</p>
<p class="TX">It was Erulka Flaera, a mainstay of the Garden’s knights. Incidentally, Mushiki remembered hearing that her usual role was overseeing the Garden’s medical department.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, Erulka.”</p>
<p class="TX">As Mushiki turned around, the students watching stood up straight in awe. Erulka, no doubt noticing their heightened attention, waved, <span aria-label=" Page 122. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_122" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>the sleeves of her lab coat flapping delicately. “All right, all right,” she said. “Don’t overdo it if you’re injured.”</p>
<p class="TX">She glanced around, stroking her chin. “Hmm. Looks like we have a lot of patients. Which of you should we start with, I wonder…?”</p>
<p class="TX">With that, she brought her fingers together to make a special sign—and two red tattoo-like patterns appeared on her skin.</p>
<p class="TX">“Second Substantiation: Horkew.”</p>
<p class="TX">No sooner did Erulka murmur those words than several creatures appeared around her—wolves complete with glowing fur and emblazoned with patterns similar to Erulka’s crest.</p>
<p class="TX">There must have been more than a dozen of them in total, and they wasted no time responding to their summoner’s gestured instructions and approaching the students gathered in the center of the room.</p>
<p class="TX">Sniffing their targets over, they began to lick the scratches and grazes that covered the students’ bodies.</p>
<p class="TX">“Eh? Wh-what?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Bah! Ha-ha…!”</p>
<p class="TX">More than a few of the students contorted themselves in laughter at this tickling form of treatment.</p>
<p class="TX">“Keep quiet for a moment,” Erulka cautioned the wolves, and with that, their tongues took on a faint glow, the wounds that they were seeing to slowly fading away.</p>
<p class="TX">“…”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki stared wide-eyed. He had heard about this technique from Kuroe, but even with that knowledge, he couldn’t contain his amazement witnessing it with his own eyes.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm. I think we can leave this to my wolves here. This way, Saika. I know you wouldn’t let an annihilation factor of that level harm you in any way, but just in case…”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“The students are one thing, but we can’t leave a mage of your caliber to my wolves, now, can we?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah. Oh.” With that exclamation, Mushiki let Erulka lead him to an examination room at the end of the floor.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 123. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_123" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>It was a small room, equipped with a desk, a cot, and two chairs. Erulka sat Mushiki down on the chair, then took a seat in the one across from him.</p>
<p class="TX">“Now, then.” With a practiced motion, she grabbed the hem of Mushiki’s gym top and pulled it up, exposing his abdomen and more to the open air.</p>
<p class="TX">“…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">He was doing his best to act as Saika would, but he couldn’t stop his eyes from opening wide in surprise at her sudden action.</p>
<p class="TX">Erulka broke into a puzzled frown.</p>
<p class="TX">For a moment, Mushiki was gripped by a fear that he had failed to properly maintain character, but he soon realized he was mistaken. Rather, Erulka’s gaze was fixed on his—or strictly speaking, Saika’s—voluptuous breasts, poking out now that she had lifted his gym top.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm? Why aren’t you wearing a bra?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah.” Mushiki let out a soft gasp.</p>
<p class="TX">He was wearing proper women’s sportswear, but that wasn’t because he had changed clothes after transforming into Saika. As much as he would have liked to keep his true identity hidden, he simply hadn’t had time to change.</p>
<p class="TX">According to Kuroe, clothes made from spirit thread, such as the school’s uniforms and gym outfits, were enchanted to change shape to match the contours of their wearer—in this case, they had adjusted themselves when he had morphed from boy to girl.</p>
<p class="TX">However, this only meant that a men’s shirt would become a women’s one, that a pair of shirts and gym shorts would become more fitting. It didn’t mean that new articles of clothing would appear where they hadn’t been before.</p>
<p class="TX">Yes. In short, Mushiki, having transformed into Saika without having had time to prepare, was presently in a state of being braless.</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, no, about that…” His eyes swam around in circles as he tried to conjure up some explanation that might be fitting of Saika’s personality.</p>
<p class="TX">Though no matter how hard he thought, all he could come up with <span aria-label=" Page 124. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_124" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>were sloppy excuses, careless reasons, or perverse oversights. Not one of them seemed plausible coming from Saika.</p>
<p class="TX">He was at a complete loss when Erulka’s lips twisted in a grin.</p>
<p class="TX">“Well, they <i>are</i> a hassle, aren’t they? I understand. If not for that Ruri, <i>I</i> wouldn’t be wearing anything under my lab coat, either.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Ah-ha…”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki felt as if he had just been the subject of an uncomfortable misunderstanding, but he couldn’t afford to protest now, so he offered only a vague smile.</p>
<p class="TX">It wasn’t long before that smile gave way to startlement all over again.</p>
<p class="TX">Reason being—Erulka…was licking his belly.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hyargh…?!”</p>
<p class="TX">Before he knew it, he had let out a high-pitched squeal, pulling away.</p>
<p class="TX">Erulka stared up at him in wonder. “What was with that strange voice just now?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ah, um… Erulka, what are you…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Odd. A medical examination, of course. Sweat tells me a lot more than just words,” Erulka said, fixing him with a strange look. “Saika… Are you feeling well…?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Wh-why do you ask?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm. You just taste a little different than usual.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…!”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki’s heart seemed to skip a beat</p>
<p class="TX">Had Erulka realized he wasn’t, in fact, entirely Saika…?</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm…? Let me try again…”</p>
<p class="TX">“H-hold on a—”</p>
<p class="TX">With a smack of her lips, Erulka tried once more to stick her head beneath Mushiki’s top, leaving him to push her head away in a panic.</p>
<p class="TX">He had no desire to continue this <i>medical examination</i>, as she put it, and have his true identity be revealed—and more importantly, his heart was still racing from when she had last licked him. If he wasn’t careful, he could end up turning back into his own body directly in front of her.</p>
<p class="TX">“What are you doing? Do behave yourself, now.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 125. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_125" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“No, I’m okay, really, so…”</p>
<p class="TX">As the two of them engaged in a quiet game of cat and mouse inside the cramped examination room, there came an unexpected knock at the door.</p>
<p class="TX">“I’m sorry to disturb you, Ms. Erulka, but can I have a moment of your time?”</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, a woman—a nurse, judging by her appearance—opened the door slightly.</p>
<p class="TX">Glancing up, Erulka arched an eyebrow in suspicion before quickly rising to her feet.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm. I’ll be back in a moment. Stay right here,” she said, pointing toward Mushiki as she left the room.</p>
<p class="TX">After watching her step outside, Mushiki breathed a sigh of relief. “That was…a close one…?”</p>
<p class="TX">The next moment, his body let out a faint glow, and he underwent another state conversion, shifting from his Saika mode back to his Mushiki mode.</p>
<p class="TX">Erulka really had been called outside in the nick of time. If not for that nurse’s intervention, he may very well have transformed just as Erulka’s tongue roved across his skin.</p>
<p class="TX">Nonetheless, he still couldn’t let down his guard. As much as he hated leaving her high and dry, he would have to make a run for it before she came back.</p>
<p class="TX">Just as he reached out to open the door—</p>
<p class="TX">“Sorry to keep you waiting, Saika.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ugh.”</p>
<p class="TX">After what seemed like only the briefest of interruptions, the door swung open, and Erulka stepped back inside.</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki leaped backward in shock.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm?” Erulka glanced curiously around for a moment before stepping outside again to double-check the room number.</p>
<p class="TX">Finally, she directed her gaze to Mushiki. “Who are <i>you</i>? Where did Saika go?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Oh, um, well, she said something about having some urgent business <span aria-label=" Page 126. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_126" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>to see to, so she left early. I was just walking by, so she asked me to let you know…”</p>
<p class="TX">Erulka let out a sigh, almost as though suspecting he was trying to pull one over on her. “I told her to <i>wait</i>. It’s always the same with that one…”</p>
<p class="TX">Mushiki had thought it a rather pitiful excuse, but it looked like Erulka had bought it. He let out a relieved exhale and dipped his head. “In that case, I’ll—”</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm? Ah…”</p>
<p class="TX">Just as he was about to slip past her, Erulka’s eyebrows twitched.</p>
<p class="TX">“Hold on a second.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…! W-was there anything else?” Mushiki stammered, his legs weighing him down as they stopped moving.</p>
<p class="TX">Suspicious, Erulka sniffed the air. “Have we met before?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I—I don’t think so. Why do you ask?”</p>
<p class="TX">“There’s something familiar about your scent…” She fell silent, pondering for a moment, before pointing back to the chair. “Sit.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="TX">“I said <i>sit</i>. You’re one of the students from the training hall, no? I’m free right now. I’ll give you a special examination.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? M-me?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Just sit down already. Quickly now.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Right.”</p>
<p class="TX">He would only serve to draw further attention to himself by refusing her any more than he already had, so resigning himself to his fate, Mushiki sat down in the chair.</p>
<p class="TX">Then, with a slight warmth rising in his cheeks, he began to roll up his gym shirt… He would have been lying if he had said he wasn’t embarrassed, but at least he was unlikely to undergo another state conversion from his Mushiki mode back to his Saika one, so he would probably be okay.</p>
<p class="TX">Having affirmed his resolve, he waited—when Erulka stared back at him blankly.</p>
<p class="TX">“What are you doing?”</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 127. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_127" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“…Huh? I thought you licked your patient’s stomach when you examined them?”</p>
<p class="TX">Erulka’s eyes opened wide at this remark, and she guffawed. “Ha-ha-ha, don’t tell me you heard that from Saika? That’s just for her.”</p>
<p class="TX">“…Ah. Right…”</p>
<p class="TX">He had acted too hastily. Feeling even more embarrassed, he reluctantly lowered his rolled-up gym shirt.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Erulka grabbed him by the hand. “And yet…even if Saika did tell you, it takes a certain amount of courage to roll up your shirt like that and expose yourself to a stranger. I wouldn’t have expected such confidence from one with a face like yours… Very well. Perhaps this is fate, of a sort? Just for you, I’ll give you a special lick.”</p>
<p class="TX">“Huh? Uh… Eh?!” Mushiki cried out.</p>
<p class="TX">In a manner that didn’t at all suit her petite frame and youthful appearance, Erulka gave him a lewd smile. “Now, then… Where should we begin?”</p>
<p class="TX">“Ugh, um, hold on a—”</p>
<p class="TX"><i>Resistance is futile</i>, she all but declared as she licked his abdomen. Mushiki let out a startled shriek.</p>
<p class="TX">At that moment, Erulka’s eyebrows shot up in suspicion.</p>
<p class="TX">“…Hmm? This taste…”</p>
<p class="TX">“…!” Mushiki caught his breath.</p>
<p class="TX">Erulka, having licked his sweat while he was in Mushiki mode, seemed ill at ease. Could she have realized something?</p>
<p class="TX">“Hmm…? Perhaps it’s just my imagination. Let me take another—”</p>
<p class="TX">“S-sorry, I really have to go…!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Stop! Wait!”</p>
<p class="TX">As Mushiki rushed to leave the examination room, Erulka reached out to grab him by his gym clothes.</p>
<p class="TX">“I-I’m fine! I’m completely uninjured!”</p>
<p class="TX">“I don’t care! Just let me lick you! Come on, take off your clothes!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Aaahhh! Nooo!”</p>
<p class="TX">“Come on, it will all be over soon! Just lie down and count the stains on the ceiling!”</p>
