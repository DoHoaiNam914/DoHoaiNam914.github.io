      <h1>Afterword</h1>

      <p>Hello everyone, it’s Yuri Kitayama. Thank you for reading volume 22 of <em>Spirit Chronicles: Seirei Gensouki, The Immaculate Equation</em>.</p>

      <p>How did you all find volume 22? Volume 20 holds the record for the number of pages in a volume, but volume 22 is greater in character count. It was quite the jam-packed volume, so it was terribly difficult to write. If the result of those efforts is having the readers think, “I want to read more quickly!” then as an author, I couldn’t be happier.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, the special edition of volume 22 comes with a drama CD, the script of which was written by me as well. The wonderful anime cast gathered together to record a noisy and fun story, so I hope you can enjoy it along with volume 22.</p>

      <p>That’s all for now. Let’s meet again in volume 23!</p>
