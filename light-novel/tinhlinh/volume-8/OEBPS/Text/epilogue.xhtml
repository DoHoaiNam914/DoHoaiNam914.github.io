      <h1>Epilogue: Satsuki Afterwards</h1>

      <p>Meanwhile, in Galtuuk, the capital of the Galarc Kingdom...</p>

      <p>On the highest balcony of a tower in the royal castle, Sumeragi Satsuki was idly watching the night sky, unable to fall asleep.</p>

      <p>“The night sky is beautiful today too, huh,” Satsuki murmured sadly to herself.</p>

      <p><em>I wonder if this place and Earth share the same sky?</em></p>

      <p>It was a question she had asked herself many times since coming to this world. Though it wasn’t a question that could be answered by anyone here, that didn’t mean she would give up without a fight.</p>

      <p>Satsuki took a deep breath. “I have to change the way I feel,” she muttered resolutely. She would no longer look to the past pessimistically. In order to do that, she decided to act her role as a hero for now.</p>

      <p>The night of the banquet drew near.</p>
