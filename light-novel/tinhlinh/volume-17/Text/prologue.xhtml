      <h1>Prologue: Vow</h1>

      <p>I hate it.</p>

      <p>This world.</p>

      <p>Everything in it.</p>

      <p>I hate it all.</p>

      <p>That’s why I decided...why I made a vow.</p>

      <p>On that day, I realized that kindness was just an ideal.</p>

      <p>It was the moment I lost everything without any reason.</p>

      <p>I was betrayed and had everything snatched away from me.</p>

      <p>So, I made a vow to end this world, riddled with foolish humans.</p>

      <p>To take vengeance.</p>

      <p>That was something I was capable of.</p>

      <p>I had the right to do it.</p>

      <p>I had the vexing power to make it possible.</p>

      <p>That’s why I’ll destroy it all.</p>

      <p>There’s no worth in a world like this.</p>

      <p>The die has already been cast by none other than my own hand.</p>

      <p>That’s why I couldn’t turn back anymore.</p>

      <p>I had no intention of turning back anyway.</p>

      <p>I cannot forgive this world. These humans.</p>

      <p>And more than anything, I couldn’t forgive myself.</p>

      <p>That’s why I desperately...</p>

      <p>Charged towards ruin.</p>

      <p>That was my punishment.</p>

      <p>For not being able to save someone...</p>
