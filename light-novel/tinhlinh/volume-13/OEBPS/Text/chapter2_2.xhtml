      <p>“What about you, then?” Celia pouted her lips and probed into her old friend’s love affairs.</p>

      <p>“Unfortunately, my job is too busy and leaves me no time for love.”</p>

      <p>“But your job gives you plenty of opportunities to meet men, right?”</p>

      <p>“I won’t deny that, but good matches are practically nonexistent. In any case, I’m not working in order to meet men in the first place.”</p>

      <p>In reality, she had received many offers from men, but Aria’s resolve was strong, and she turned aside all kinds of invitations in the name of social politeness.</p>

      <p>“You haven’t changed at all. Don’t be so focused on your work that you miss your chance to marry,” Celia said tiredly.</p>

      <p>“That goes for the both of us.”</p>

      <p>“Ugh...” She had brought that upon herself. The retort was sharper than the enchanted sword Aria wielded.</p>

      <p>“At any rate, we’re both getting on in years. Let’s take care not to have any regrets.”</p>

      <p>“R-Right...” Celia mumbled, nodding in agreement.</p>
