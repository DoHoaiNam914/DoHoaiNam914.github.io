      <p>Far above the skies where Erica lay...</p>

      <p><em>What in the world is that boy, really? He has far more strength than can be explained by a contract with a humanoid spirit. He was able to contend with an awakened hero, no matter how imperfect she may have been.</em></p>

      <p>Reiss stared in the direction that Aishia had flown off to for a while, having seen everything from start to finish.</p>

      <p><em>That aside, this Saint... Just what was she thinking...?</em></p>

      <p>This time, he gazed at Erica lying on the ground, puzzled.</p>

      <p><em>Humans are hard to understand...but whatever. With the Black Knight returning alive, it was a good thing I had Arein and the others on standby.</em></p>
