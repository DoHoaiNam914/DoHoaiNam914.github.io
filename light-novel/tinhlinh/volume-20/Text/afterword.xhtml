      <h1>Afterword</h1>

      <p>Hello everyone—this is Yuri Kitayama. Thank you for picking up <em>Seirei Gensouki: Spirit Chronicles volume 20 - Her Crusade</em>.</p>

      <p>It was over seven and a half years ago that I first planned the overview of this series, and as of volume 20, I’m finally able to write one of the scenes I thought of at that time. I am blessed as an author to have readers that follow my series with bated breath. The story will get even more exciting from here, so I hope you’ll look forward to it.</p>

      <p>The anime for this series is also on air right now! Seeing Rio and all the characters move about is so thrilling. The Blu-ray and DVD are also on sale right now, featuring a short story from me and an illustration card from Riv, so please check it out!</p>
