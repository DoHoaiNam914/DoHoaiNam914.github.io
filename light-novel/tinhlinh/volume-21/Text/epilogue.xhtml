      <h1>Epilogue: Reunion</h1>

      <p>Back at the Galarc Castle...</p>

      <p>While the Beltrum Kingdom’s fleet was advancing towards Rodania, an enchanted airship from the Centostella Kingdom arrived at the Galarc Castle. It had arrived to take custody of Masato, who had been involved in a new hero summoning, and Lilianna, who had been dragged into the summoning with him.</p>

      <p>Discussions over which kingdom the new hero Masato would belong to were about to be held. There was nothing to suggest the discussions wouldn’t go peacefully, but the representatives of both kingdoms were tense, fearing the possible complications that could arise.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, unrelated to the two kingdom’s discussions were two people meeting again after a long time apart. One with hope in their heart, and one with shock...</p>

      <p>“Hey...”</p>

      <p>They were reunited once more.</p>

      <p>“It’s nice to see you again, Miharu.”</p>

      <p>Ayase Miharu and Sendo Takahisa.</p>
