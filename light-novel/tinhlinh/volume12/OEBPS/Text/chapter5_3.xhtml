      <p>An army of five thousand had been driven away by a single boy.</p>

      <p>On this day, the events that unfolded proved a single truth:</p>

      <p>That the overwhelming power of a single individual could sometimes overthrow a violent force of great numbers and tactics and decide the outcome of a battlefield.</p>

      <p>At the same time, something else was made known—that there existed someone who possessed enough power to do exactly that. That person’s name was Haruto Amakawa—an honorary knight whose name was still on the rise.</p>

      <p>Whether that was a good thing or a bad thing, it would create a great ripple in the nations of the Strahl region.</p>

      <p>Ten days later, Rio and the others arrived in Rodania.</p>
