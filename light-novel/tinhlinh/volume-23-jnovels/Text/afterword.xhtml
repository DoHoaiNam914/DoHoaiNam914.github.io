      <p>And so, here is the first volume of 2023! Thanks to the support of all the readers and everyone involved in the series, volume 23 was safely released. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart. I managed to write everything I wanted to write in this volume, so I hope you’ll look forward to the next volume! If you have other opinions like, “You’ve done it this time,” or, “Who even is this?” please send them in too!</p>

      <p>Finally, as you may have seen from the end-of-book preview, a fifth volume of the drama CD will be released! The CD will be included in the special edition of volume 24, so check it out! That’s all this time. See you again in volume 24!</p>
