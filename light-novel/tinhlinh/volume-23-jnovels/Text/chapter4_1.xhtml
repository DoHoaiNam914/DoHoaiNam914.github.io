      <p>“Thank you, Sora. I know. It’s wrong to look at a single side of humans and decide that the rest of humanity is hopeless. Humans aren’t just their bad side. That’s why...”</p>

      <p>Rio took a small breath. “That’s why we’ll put this behind us and continue our journey,” he said firmly, looking towards the future.</p>

      <p>“Okay!” Sora nodded eagerly.</p>

      <p><em>I will come again someday.</em></p>

      <p>Now that the world had forgotten Erica, only an extreme few people could pay respects to her grave. Rio glanced at the gravestone one more time and bowed before turning his back on the grave in preparation to take off into the sky. But just before he activated his spirit arts...</p>

      <p>“Thank you.”</p>

      <p>In order to accomplish the original goal of their journey, Rio and Sora took off towards the skies stretching west of the Strahl region.</p>
