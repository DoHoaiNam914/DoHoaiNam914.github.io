      <h1>Afterword</h1>

      <p>Hello everyone, this is Yuri Kitayama. Thank you for reading <em>Seirei Gensouki: Spirit Chronicles, volume 15, Hero’s Rhapsody</em>.</p>

      <p>The afterword this time will be shorter than usual due to the page limit, but there’s one thing I have to mention before anything else: the results of the copywriting contest have been announced, so you can find the winning text printed on the obi strip of this volume! The runner-up text should be on the page before or after this afterword, so please check it out. Thank you for all your submissions—we received nearly 350 of them!</p>

      <p>Furthermore, thanks to everyone’s support, we’ve reached one million total sales! With vengeance achieved, there’ll be a short intermission before we take a different turn from the web novel, so please look forward to volume 16 as well! That’s all for now!</p>
