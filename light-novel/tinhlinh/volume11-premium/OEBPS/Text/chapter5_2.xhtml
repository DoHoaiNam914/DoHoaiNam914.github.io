      <p>“It seems Count Claire has descended the stairs.” Vanessa immediately moved to open the dining room door.</p>

      <p>“Oh, so you were in the dining room. And Princess Christina is here, too, perfect. I don’t have much time, so I shall give my report quickly—Hmm? Who’s that over there...?”</p>

      <p>The voice of a dandy middle-aged man came from the other side of the door. Count Claire spotted Vanessa inside the room and briskly shuffled inside, coming to a sudden stop when he spotted Rio and Celia seated across from Christina.</p>

      <p>Celia greeted her father a little awkwardly. “Ahaha. Long time no see, Father. Oh, right...”</p>

      <p>She realized her hair color had been altered and removed the artifact, changing her hair back to normal. Celia’s father, Roland Claire, gazed upon her in a daze.</p>

      <p>“C...Celia?! Why are you here?!” he shouted hysterically.</p>
