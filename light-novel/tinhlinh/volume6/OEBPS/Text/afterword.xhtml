      <h1>Afterword</h1>

      <p>Everyone, I have been in your care. This is Yuri Kitayama — Thank you for picking up <em>Seirei Gensouki: Spirit Chronicles, Volume 6, Twilight Overture.</em></p>

      <p>So, Volume 6 is now on sale... It feels like time has really flown by since Volume 1 first went on sale one year and three months ago. This is all thanks to everyone who has shown their support from the beginning. I am most grateful to you all, from the bottom of my heart! Now that the story is moving towards the main plotline, the plot from here onwards has already been created. As the volumes increase, I have been discussing with Editor N how to make the events unfold in the most exciting way. Please look forward to the next volume, too.</p>

      <p>That is all from me this time.</p>

      <p>Finally, the <em>Seirei Gensouki: Spirit Chronicles</em> manga drawn by tenkla is currently being serialized for free on HJ Bunko’s official homepage. Please check it out if you have the time!</p>

      <p class="signature">— October 2016, Yuri Kitayama.</p>
