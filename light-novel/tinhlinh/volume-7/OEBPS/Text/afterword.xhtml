      <h1>Afterword</h1>

      <p>Everyone, I am most grateful to you all. This is Yuri Kitayama. Thank you for picking up <em>Seirei Gensouki: Spirit Chronicles, Vol. 7 — Daybreak Rondo.</em></p>

      <p>Now, for some unfortunate news that I have already reported on the web novel. The manga version of <em>Seirei Gensouki</em> that began serialization in September last year has ended at chapter 3 due to the illustrator tenkla falling ill. I pray for tenkla’s recovery as soon as possible. Thank you very much for the wonderful manga adaptation.</p>

      <p>Note that the manga version of <em>Seirei Gensouki</em> is not ending forever, but will be resuming at some point in time. Please wait for updates regarding this.</p>

      <p>Finally, running alongside the release of this volume is the Twitter character popularity poll and campaign to read a limited novel of <em>Seirei Gensouki.</em> I hope you will all participate.</p>

      <p>That will be all for now.</p>

      <p>Until next time.</p>

      <p class="signature">End of February 2017, Yuri Kitayama</p>
