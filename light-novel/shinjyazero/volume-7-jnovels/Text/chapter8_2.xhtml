      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">Sasa had said that we needed a reunion to celebrate Kawakita’s freedom. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.2">Fujiyan and I had no objections, of course.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">“Thank you all,” Kawakita said with an embarrassed giggle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">“You helped me so much.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“Good for you, Keiko!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">Sasa cheered, glomming onto her.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">The girls chatted for a while before Kawakita turned to me suddenly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">“You negotiated with one of the higher-ups for me, didn’t you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">Thanks.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">“You’d already been freed when I did that,” I deflected, scratching my cheek. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">“Thank Fujiyan and Sasa.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">“We never talked in class though,” she pointed out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">“I’ve known Michio for years, and Aya’s a friend. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">You’re a good guy.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">She offered me a cute smile.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Kawakita had been a bit of a diva in school—she’d always spoken rather harshly, so I’d been a bit wary of her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">But now that we were talking, I realized that she was a surprisingly nice girl.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">“I could not have done it alone,” Fujiyan said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">“It was due to Lady Sasaki’s breaking of the sword that I was able to indebt Great Keith.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“I think arranging to get the sword fixed was harder,” Sasa said.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">He guffawed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">“An acquaintance’s acquaintance happens to know a suitable smith. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">It was luck, really.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">I knew better. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">This was how he always talked his way around the crazy stuff he did. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">He had way too many connections!</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">After that, we spent some time just chatting about the struggles we’d faced in this world as well as reminiscing about back home. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">Kawakita and Sasa were both unhappy at the lack of sweet treats in this world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.3">That reminded me of how tasty the Häagen-Dazs had been.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">On the whole, Great Keith’s cooking was really spicy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">This pub had kebabs as a specialty, along with pepper soups. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">I was pretty fond of it all.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">By now, we’d all enjoyed the food and drink and were getting fairly tipsy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">Kawakita took the opportunity to ask a question.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">“Hey, Michio. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">Do you have a partner?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">She was leaning drunkenly—or more accurately, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">temptingly</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">—against him.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">Oh?</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Sasa and I exchanged glances before checking that Nina wasn’t around.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“Well...how to put it?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Fujiyan replied.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">He didn’t have a girlfriend. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">But he </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1"> have two wives.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">For how well he usually spoke, Fujiyan was fumbling over his words now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">Kawakita didn’t seem to notice; she just stared at him heatedly.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“You know...I acted tough, but I was so scared that some noble I didn’t know was going to buy me...” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">admitted Kawakita. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">“I’m really grateful...and you’re a noble in Roses now, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.4">I don’t have anywhere to go, so...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">“Y-You are welcome for as long as you wish, Lady Kawakita!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">blurted Fujiyan. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">“I will happily have you as a guest!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“Come on... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">Call me Kei like you used to.”</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">Oooh.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">This was bad. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">Fujiyan was getting the moves put on him, despite being a married man.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">His eyes roamed across the room. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">I had to help my friend!</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">“Keiko, Keiko,” Sasa said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">She got to her first and leaned in close to her friend’s ear.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">I used </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Listen</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">...not that it really mattered if I heard.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“Fujiwara already has two wives,” Sasa whispered.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">There was a long pause as Kawakita froze.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“What?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">Yeah... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">Her reaction was about what I’d expect. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3">It must’ve been shocking to find out that the guy you were interested in was already taken.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">I was honestly surprised that Fujiyan hadn’t already told her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">When I glanced over at him, he looked really awkward.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Yup, figures.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">“O-Oh...! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">Right! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">I see!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.4">Kawakita’s face was cherry red. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.5">She looked almost like she was about to cry.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">How sad...</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“What’s that look for?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">she demanded, snapping her gaze toward me.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“Nothing!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">Scary! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.3">That was just like the </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">old</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1"> Kawakita!</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“Aya!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">she cried out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">“We’re drinking the night away!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“Huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">R-Right! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">Sure!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Kawakita drained her ale to hide her embarrassment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Sasa did the same with her wine.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">Sasa...you know that wine and ale have really different amounts of alcohol, right?</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">The girls proceeded to go on a bender, draining glass after glass. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">Fujiyan and I just slowly made our way through our own glasses in the corner. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">Kawakita’s declaration that she would “drink the night away” ended up proving true—we stayed at the pub until it started getting light outside.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">I didn’t really remember the end of the night...but it felt like I was back in school, and I had a really good time.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">And thus, our adventures in Great Keith came to an end.</span></p>
