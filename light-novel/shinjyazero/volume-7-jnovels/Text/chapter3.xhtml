      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">This was the first time I had visited Great Keith, and I walked around the city feeling relaxed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">The sun was harsh and a hot breeze caressed my cheeks. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">My clothes clung to me with sweat, but despite the uncomfortable feeling of being out of place, I was having fun. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.4">People wore bright smiles, and the streets were filled with noise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.5">It was a different atmosphere than either Roses or Springrogue.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Everyone’s...so carefree.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Once, back in the underground ruins of Laphroaig, I’d been told about what the </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">other</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1"> countries were like. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">How they weren’t shrouded in perpetual darkness like our home—how they were bright and constantly covered with brilliant sunshine.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">I couldn’t help but compare this place to the memories of my own experiences in Laphroaig.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">Back then, we’d sat in the gloom, eating whatever we could scrounge together. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">I recalled fleeing the Temple Knights over and over, time after time.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">The world isn’t fair.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">I knew that all too well.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">It doesn’t matter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">I’ll live on alone...</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">I brushed the dark feelings aside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">This was the first time I’d been in Great Keith, so I figured I should enjoy my visit more. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">The people around me certainly were.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">“H-Hey, look.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">“Man, she’s hot.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“Maybe she’s a foreign noble?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“She’s only got one guard though.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">“Maybe he’s stupid-strong?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“He...doesn’t seem like it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">Looks as if a stiff breeze’d do him in.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Those were the conversations I could hear around me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">I was used to the men’s gazes, so I turned to look behind me instead.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">My knight was peering with interest at the various wares on offer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Though he was supposed to be a hero, normal people thought he looked weak. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">He didn’t even seem bothered after getting beaten to a pulp by that other hero out of nowhere.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">Doesn’t he care?</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">That brought back memories of Springrogue and the high-rank demon who’d attacked us—Sciulli. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">Makoto Takatsuki had commanded angels to eat her just as one might squash a bug...with no care at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">Just remembering it made me shudder.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">It’s difficult to tell what he’s thinking...</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Even now, he seemed to be training practically without sleep, so maybe his loss </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1"> bother him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Although, according to him, there weren’t any water elementals in the country. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">Would he be okay?</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">I was drawn from my pondering when I realized that my stomach was empty.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“Let’s go there,” I suggested. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">We entered the fairly empty establishment and had a meal together. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">In the beginning, I was slightly taken aback by the taste of the food, but it </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1"> good. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">Once I’d finished the sweet dessert, I let out a soft sigh.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">What were the mage and warrior doing now? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">I was glad Aya had managed to evolve. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">Hunting those lizards every day had been a chore. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.4">Maybe the daily attempts had worn on me because before I knew it, I found myself asleep.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Dreaming.</span><br/><br/></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">People were screaming. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">The tang of blood caught in my nose. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">Dust hung in the air, darkening the area. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.4">Vexingly enough, this felt almost nostalgic—it was just like Laphroaig.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">I realized I was standing amidst rubble.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">Gamelan, the city I’d just been walking through, was utterly destroyed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">Arms and legs poked from the rubble, all of them twisted unnaturally, crushed, and stained red. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">They were all dead...corpses as far as I could see.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">The place I’d been shopping and eating was a charnel ground.</span><br/><br/></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“Guh!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">I gasped, waking up.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">Damn it.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">My </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Future Sight</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1"> had activated again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">The vision I’d just received was a premonition of the near future. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">Plus, being a necromancer, I could see death. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.4">I lifted my head off the table and scanned my surroundings, from the seat on the terrace to the people walking by.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">Ugh...I feel sick...</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">They’d been enjoying themselves moments ago, but now...all I could see was pain and resentment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">One person’s arm was bent unnaturally, another had lost a leg, and worse still was the one missing their head entirely. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">I just couldn’t enjoy the town anymore.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">It was all an illusion.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“Argh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">This is the worst!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">I complained. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.4">I couldn’t discern whether the people walking the town were alive or dead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.5">The mixture of </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">Future Sight</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1"> and </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">Necromancy</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1"> meant that all I could see was corpse after corpse.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“Princess?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">called out a nearby voice.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">I hadn’t even dared to look his way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">After all, I worried I might see my knight’s cadaver, and I didn’t want to see an acquaintance dead.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">Slowly, ever so slowly, I peeked.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">He’s the same as ever...</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">My knight, Makoto Takatsuki, was completely unchanged. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">He was just staring at me worriedly from amidst the death, his face as dull as ever.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">“My knight, we need to get out of the country!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">“What?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">“Just do it! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">Back to the inn—we can take the mage and warrior and get out of here.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">“Wh-Whoa, hold up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">What’s going on?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">Furiae had lost her cool out of nowhere. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">She wanted to leave Great Keith. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">As I calmed her down, she told me the context.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">It boiled down to four things:</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">She’d seen the people of Great Keith dying in the near future.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">The cause was unknown.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">Whether I’d get caught up in it was also unknown.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">Staying in Great Keith was still dangerous.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">“Princess, let’s talk it through with Sophia first.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">There was a long pause.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">“Fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">But we need to leave soon.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">“Okay.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">After that, we headed back to the inn where Princess Sophia was waiting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">Fortunately, the fire priestess had already left, so Furiae was able to explain what she’d seen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">After hearing about the vision, Sophia’s expression was conflicted, but she soon seemed to come to a decision.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">“There are people in Great Keith who possess </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Future Sight</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">, so I find it hard to believe that they have made no preparations... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">Still, I shall inform them, just to be sure.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">“Through the priestess?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">I asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">If that was the case, we couldn’t go after her.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">“No, I believe the military would be a better avenue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">You should come with me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.3">I will introduce you to the general.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">“Got it.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">All this time, Sasa still hadn’t woken up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">I could hear her breathing softly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">Lucy was supposed to be looking after her, but she was sharing the bed and also sleeping. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.4">They sure were getting along.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">I noticed that Twi was with them too, curled up in a ball. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">She was the same as ever, huh?</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">With a course of action decided, I followed the princess to the castle.</span><br/><br/></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">It was the first time I’d seen a palace quite like this—unlike the grand beauty of Highland’s castle, and the reserved elegance of Roses’s, it was, in a word, a stronghold. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">The walls towered above us and were made out of a thick material similar to concrete. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.3">As we entered, everyone around us was clad in armor. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.4">They were all tall and walking in formation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.5">When they looked at us—or more accurately, at Princess Sophia—they’d always salute.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">I can’t settle down here...</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">The two of us, plus Princess Sophia’s guards, were guided farther inside to a big room—not the audience chamber that we’d been initially greeted in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">Right in the middle of the room was a bearded man. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.3">As we approached and he saw the princess, the man rose from his chair.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">“Princess Sophia. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">It is an honor you would come all this way.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">“General Talisker. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">Thank you for accommodating us on such short notice.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">This man—General Talisker—was the one responsible for the country’s army as a whole.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">“It is good to meet you, Hero of Roses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">I am Talisker, and I command the army of Great Keith.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">“Likewise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">I am Makoto Takatsuki,” I replied, giving a bow like Princess Sophia had taught me.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">I’d heard several things about this man before. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">Notably, he was the father of the Hero of Incandescence, Olga Sól Talisker. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">He was also the person most likely to have spurred her on.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">“What is your business here today?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">he asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.3">“Urgent information, I presume?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">“Indeed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">One of our group reported an instance of </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">Future Sight</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1"> warning of a risk to the country.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">“Hmm...” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">The only change to his expression was a slight movement of his eyebrows. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.3">It was impossible to tell what he was thinking.</span></p>
