      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">“We’re back!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">I called.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“Ugh, I wanna take a bath...” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">griped Sasa.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">It was dawn by the time the two of us hauled our ragged selves back to the inn. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">We were both exhausted, though for different reasons: I’d been frantically using </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Dodge</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1"> to dodge the sand dragons while Sasa had been tearing through the swarm and tossing them all over the place. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">By the time she’d finished, there’d been practically an entire mountain made of their corpses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">The dragons </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">were</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1"> a danger to the adventurers and merchants that traveled through the wilderness and desert, so it wasn’t a bad thing in that respect...but I did kind of worry about our impact on the ecosystem.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">I set those worries aside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">I was bone-tired and wanted to get some rest ASAP. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">Princess Sophia, Lucy, Furiae, and Twi had probably finished their breakfast and were likely enjoying some tea, but Sasa and I just staggered toward our beds.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“Good morning, Hero Makoto, Aya Sasaki,” greeted Princess Sophia, her voice slightly cold.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">“You two vanished last night... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">Where’d you go?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">Lucy asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.4">Her voice was different as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.5">I didn’t think I’d heard her sound like that before.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">“Mornin’. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">Sophie, Lu...I’m so sleepy...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">Sasa didn’t seem to notice any difference in their demeanors, and I was really tired as well, so I figured we’d talk it out later.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Furiae stroked Twi and said, “The two of you seem like you enjoyed yourselves.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">There was a slight sharpness in her voice.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">“Hm?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“Wha?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Yeah, Sasa and I couldn’t just let that one pass. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">Both of us turned around. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">Princess Sophia and Lucy both held icy looks in their eyes.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">“H-Hey, guys,” I said, going for a cheery greeting.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“My, how carefree for someone getting back at </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1"> time in the morning,” Princess Sophia said.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“We were waiting for you alllll night,” Lucy added.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Ah, we’d had a miscommunication... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">Their gazes were getting sharper and sharper.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">While I was in the middle of figuring out how I’d reply, Fujiyan and Nina burst in.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">“Sir Tackie!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“Everyone’h! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">It’s awful’h!”</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Nice timing!</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“What happened?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">I asked, wanting to change the subject anyway.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“A ridiculously strong monster has appeared in the plains!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">Fujiyan exclaimed.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">“Oh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">Tell me more,” I pressed.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">Princess Sophia and Lucy reluctantly looked his way as well.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">“Lady Nina, if you would.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">“Right’h! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">There was a rumor in the adventurer’s guild this morning’h! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">All of the sand dragons on the plains were wiped out’h!”</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Huh?</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Sand dragons?</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“What?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">Princess Sophia cried.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“All of them?!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">Lucy and Sophia were both in shock. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">I glanced toward Furiae, but she didn’t seem to care and was scratching Twi’s chin now.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">A bunch of sand dragons had been wiped out... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">That was huge news, apparently. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3">Though, really...sand dragons?</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“Unbelievable...” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">Princess Sophia murmured. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">“The adventurers and army have been unable to even make a dent in that swarm of calamities...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“Right’h... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">They are the rulers of the plains’h. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">It’s unthinkable that they would be wiped out in a single night’h,” Nina said excitedly.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">“Even the elves talked about that nest when I was young...” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">Lucy murmured.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">“I was certainly told to stay away from the plains in Great Keith,” Furiae said.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">So these dragons were famous enough that Lucy and Furiae had heard about them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">R-Right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">What exactly did we do now? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.4">I glanced over at Sasa.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">She’s sleeping on her feet?!</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">Yeah...we’d definitely been the cause of this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">Should I explain? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">But...Sasa had actually done it all, and I’d just spent the time running around! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.4">Explaining that would be way too embarrassing.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“My esteemed Tackie...” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">Fujiyan’s </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Mind Reading</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1"> had apparently done the job for me.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“This cannot be left alone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Clearly, something is afoot,” stated Princess Sophia. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">“I shall gather information from the castle.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“I’ll go ask around the guilds’h.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">“I’ll help!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">Lucy cheered.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">They were all ready to go investigate... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">N-No, I had to explain!</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">As I was faltering, Fujiyan stepped in to support me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">“Please, wait, if you would. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">It seems our Sir Tackie here knows about the occurrence.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">“What?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">everyone uttered in unison, looking my way.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Sasa was just breathing softly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">Damn her... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">I’d have to explain it all.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">“Well, you see...” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">I then launched into the whole explanation.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">“So...Aya wiped them out alone?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">Princess Sophia asked.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">“N-No way’h...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">Both Sophia and Nina seemed completely taken aback.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">“Aya! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">Aya, wake up! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">Is Makoto telling the truth?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.4">Lucy demanded, shaking her back and forth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.5">Sasa just kept dozing, though. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.6">She </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">must</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1"> have been tired.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">“Even if we tell the truth, will the government believe it?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">Fujiyan mused, scratching his head.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">It was apparently such a big deal that we couldn’t just say, “Yeah, Sasa took them all out on her own,” and expect to be believed.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">“Still, we cannot say</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1"> nothing</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">The country is in the midst of a huge investigation into what happened. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.3">Not revealing the truth will only worry the populace,” Princess Sophia reasoned decisively. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.4">She then began preparations to leave.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">“Shall I come too?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">I asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.3">I’d been there after all, so maybe having a witness would be useful.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">“No. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">You being there may complicate matters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.3">I will go alone first.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">“I see.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">I felt kinda bad. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">Sneaking a glance at the other witness, I found her mumbling and giggling in her sleep.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">“Not there, Takatsuki... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">Man, you’re such a perv.”</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Sasa...you’re doing that on purpose, aren’t you?</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">The room lapsed into silence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">Lucy and Princess Sophia were giving me painful looks.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">“Aya! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">Wake up already!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">Lucy demanded, squishing and pulling Sasa’s cheeks.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">“M-Mmmm?”</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Oh, guess she’s awake now.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">“Uuuh...? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">What’s up?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">Sasa asked, squirming in embarrassment as everyone stared.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">She didn’t reply.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">She suddenly pulled me by the hand to a sofa and then sat next to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.2">Our shoulders were just on the verge of touching. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.3">There was a pleasant scent drifting up from her hair.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">“Hero Makoto,” she said, calling my name just like she had when we’d first come into the room.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">“Y-Yes?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">This time, though, she was less than twenty centimeters from me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.2">Her dark-blue eyes stared into mine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.3">She was silent for a while, but then her lips parted.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">“You were out late with Aya last night, were you not?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">“And you were enjoying yourself with Lucy a while ago.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">I let the silence hang for a while. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.2">“Right...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">I’d let my guard down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">It wasn’t just work she wanted to talk about. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.3">I was really in for it now...</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">“I really should be closer for this.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.2">Her voice wasn’t angry. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.3">She moved in toward me, resting her head on my shoulder.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">“Sophia?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">“Janet Ballantine was making passes at you in Springrogue.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">“Eir.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">“She also said ‘Mako—Makoto Takatsuki is weak to assertiveness, so push him down and have your way.’”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">“There’s a lot wrong with that,” I mumbled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.2">What the hell was that goddess telling her priestess?</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">Suddenly, I was flipped onto my back...and the princess hovered over me.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">“You’re leaving me all alone,” she murmured, eyes watering. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.2">That was so damn cute... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.3">I almost felt dizzy.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">I...</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">I didn’t think, just wrapped my arms around her shoulders, then—</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">I blinked, and Princess Sophia’s eyes turned from blue to gold. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.2">Her tone of voice also changed.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">“Uh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.2">S-Sophia?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">The mood was gone.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">She looked just the same as usual—other than her eyes—but her mana was different. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.2">It was almost prickling at my skin as it overflowed her body.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">“Eir?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">As a goddess, she was overwhelming...even compared to the demon lord and Grandsage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.3">Also, Eir was the only one who ever called me “Mako.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">“Oh?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.2">Her eyes went wide. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.3">Then, she seemed to notice that I was reclining...and the princess was on top of me.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">“Am I interrupting something?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">I paused for a second. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.2">“A...bit.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">“Damn it!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">she exclaimed with a look of chagrin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.3">“Just as she got her courage up too.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">“You shouldn’t be telling her those things.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">“She’s a late bloomer, though. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">She needs a push.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">Yeah, but telling her to push me down was too much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">It was really risky actually. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.3">Eir was way too precise with it!</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">“What’s so important?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.2">I asked, getting us back on topic.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">“Right! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.2">Well, Great Keith is in danger!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">“Is that the thing Furiae was talking about?”</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">Looks like he already knows from the moon priestess, doesn’t it?</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1"> Noah interjected.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">“We’re looking into it,” I said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.2">“Do you know anything?”</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">The Sacred Deities probably haven’t heard anything, </span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">explained Noah. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">That’s why they’re asking my elementals for help. </span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">“Did you find out anything?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.2">I asked.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">Well, you know how it is... </span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">Noah muttered.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">Damn. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.2">They’d been my last hope.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">Eir then hummed and put her hand to her chin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.2">The gesture didn’t really suit her.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">“The underground is looking fishy,” she suddenly said.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">Ack, caught. </span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">I couldn’t move from where I was supporting her soft form. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.2">Just as I was thinking about what to do, there came a knock at the door.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">We quickly separated.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">“It is me, Lady Sophia. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.2">I bring news.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">“Enter,” she replied once she’d adjusted her clothes and hair. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.2">Her voice was the same as always. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.3">It was a pretty impressive transformation.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1">Her guardian knight was the one to enter the room. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.2">“My apologies for disturbing the two of you,” he said.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">“Think nothing of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.2">What news do you have?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">The knight’s serious expression didn’t falter as he began to speak. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.2">“General Talisker wishes to speak with the State-Authorized Hero of Roses.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">Sophia’s eyes immediately sharpened. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.2">She’d been spot-on when she’d mentioned it earlier.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">The geezer guardian knight led me as we arrived at a huge estate. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.2">This place was close to the castle and a cut above the other high-class houses in the area. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.3">There was a huge gate surrounding the estate and massive gardens just past it.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">There are water elementals too,</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1"> I thought. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1">If the worst comes, I should be able to protect myself.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">“Farewell then, Sir Hero.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">“Thanks, geezer,” I replied, entering the estate alone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.2">Apparently, the general wanted to talk to me on my own. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">That’s the worst...</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">Usually when I was around the big shots, I had Fujiyan, Sasa, and Lucy with me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">That way, I never needed to speak much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.3">That hadn’t been the case with Princess Noelle, but Sakurai had been there that time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.4">I cranked </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">Calm Mind</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1"> up to the maximum and nervously followed the butler.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">The place was decorated with all kinds of statues and paintings. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.2">I didn’t know how much they were worth, but they definitely demonstrated the wealth of the mansion’s owner. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.3">The butler didn’t lead me inside, but to a place in the garden.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">In the garden, there was a small stage—a woman wearing thin clothes was dancing along to some music. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.2">Torches were flickering around the stage, making the scene look even odder.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">“Please, that way.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.2">The butler pointed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.3">In that direction was the general, wearing much more casual clothing than the last time we’d met. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.4">He was sitting on a platform three steps higher than the rest of the area...and he was looking down at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.5">A lavish array of fruits was spread out before him, and he was being served by two beautiful women—one on each side.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">He’s </span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">THE</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1"> Big Shot.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">It was almost like a scene out of a painting: Gerhardt Talisker, the father of the Hero of Incandescence, Olga Sól Talisker, and the leader of Great Keith’s army. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.2">He was the most influential person in the country after the king. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.3">Apparently, he was also pretty close to said king. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.4">This was one of the people I couldn’t defy while in Great Keith.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">“My thanks for your invitation,” I said, kneeling on the platform like Sophia had told me.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">“No, Hero.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.2">Suddenly, the general stood and pulled me up onto the platform. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.3">He bade me sit at his side. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.4">“You are our guest of honor tonight, Hero Makoto. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.5">We have been waiting for you.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">He sounded much friendlier than before. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.2">Yet, the smile didn’t reach his eyes, and he was watching me like a hawk.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">“Thank you,” I said nervously, sinking down into the seat he offered.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">“Bring the hero some victuals,” he ordered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.2">“Let the dancing and music begin!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.3">The music sped up and the dancer began moving almost lasciviously. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.4">Several women suddenly appeared at my side—they poured me a drink and brought food to my lips.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">H-How am I supposed to be calm here?!</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">I had to tell them I’d eat by myself—I also took some of the fairly weak fruit wine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.2">For a while, I listened to them talk about the food and dance, and I acted out the correct surprise and praise when needed.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">Once the party had been going for a while, the general brought up the sand dragons. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.2">“Hero Makoto. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.3">You have my thanks for dealing with the sand dragons.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">This was probably the main thing I was here for.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">“Well, we were just lucky...” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.2">After all, I’d just stood there watching as Sasa took care of them.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">“I have to admit, I heard you were a mage...but the sand dragons were all slain by physical attacks, not magic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.2">You seem to be a skilled fighter as well.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">I stayed silent. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">It wasn’t like I could tell him that Sasa had taken the dragons out barehanded...</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">“You are usually seen with only a dagger—do you perhaps usually use another weapon?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.2">he asked firmly.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">“Well...I can’t really say.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">I couldn’t tell him that my stats were too low for anything heavier...so I chose to just not answer anything. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.2">He didn’t seem to actually need my reply and didn’t appear bothered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.3">However, I’m sure he thought I was hiding something.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">It’d be so much easier to just say Sasa did it all.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">One of the women suddenly spoke up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.2">“How heartening it is to have you here, Hero... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.3">You defeated such awful monsters.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">“I’ve always been scared of them, ever since I was a child,” another added. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.2">She paused for a moment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.3">“Would you...allow me to show my thanks?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1">Suddenly, the women were draping themselves over me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.2">They weren’t wearing much, so it ended up with their skin against mine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.3">Though I wanted to pull away, I was boxed in.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">“Oh, those two seem to have taken a liking to you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.2">If you wish, you could spend the night.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.3">The general said this to me casually, like he was just recommending a dessert.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.1">“I’d do anything the hero asked,” the first woman said.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">“My, so would I. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.2">Tell us, Sir Makoto—what are your tastes?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">Can these women just say </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">anything</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.2">Wait, that’s not the point!</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">You don’t need to tell me, Noah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.2">I know.</span><br/><br/></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">“General, while I appreciate the offer, I need to head back tonight,” I said, offering a polite refusal.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">That’ll work, right?</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">“So the fancy didn’t take you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.2">Those two are some of the most beautiful in the capital, but I suppose if you prefer a different type...how about the dancer over there?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1">Even as I was mentally saying, “No way,” I looked at the dancer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.2">She was beaming a charming smile at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.3">She’d definitely been ordered to try and tempt me as well.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">I looked at the first two again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.2">They </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1">were</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1"> pretty good-looking.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.1">“So, your plan?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.2">the general pressed.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.1">“Three days hence, there will be a gathering in an underground cemetery on the city outskirts. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.2">Ordinarily, that place is rarely used, but the sect will be gathering there on that day. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.3">And while they are all there...we take them out.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">“Very well,” agreed the general, his tone hard. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.2">“Let us keep this completely secret. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.3">I will make sure we have sufficient forces.”</span></p>
