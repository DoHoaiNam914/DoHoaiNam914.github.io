      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">I couldn’t understand what I was seeing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">Gamelan had been surrounded by a barrier.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Cheers rose up around me.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">“We’re saved!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">“What happened?!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">“The Hero of Roses did it!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“Is he the savior?!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">The military had been on the verge of despair, but the mood had instantly pivoted into excitement. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">This comet was so large that it should have been on the level of </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">divinity</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1"> in terms of destruction. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">That’s what the mages had said.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">But it had been blocked.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Like it was nothing.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">By the Hero of Roses, Makoto Takatsuki.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">The same State-Authorized Hero of Roses I’d called “nothing much” just days ago.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">He must not have been fighting seriously...</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">That was the only thing I could come up with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">There was just no way he’d learned how to do something so ridiculous and powerful in just ten or so days. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">Makoto Takatsuki was controlling more mana than I had, even when I released my holy sword and went all out...and he was doing it with a serene look on his face.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">I shuddered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">The mass of ice rolled slowly to the side and fell gently outside of the town. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">I just couldn’t understand it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.4">How could he move something so massive with magic? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.5">Just how much mana did a spell like that even need?</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Was he really human?</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1"> The question made its way through my mind as the ground shook from the comet’s impact.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">Suddenly, he collapsed.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">“Makoto!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“Takatsuki!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">“Hero!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">His comrades and one of my father’s men rushed toward him.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">“Hurry! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Get someone who can heal!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“We cannot let him die!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">The locals were all panicking as they carried him away on a stretcher.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">I could only watch it happen.</span><br/><br/></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">For the next few days, I shut myself away in my room.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">The tournament and the ensuing chaos were all the city could talk about. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">One of the topics was the new State-Authorized Hero of Great Keith, Aya Sasaki. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">She had blitzed her way through the entire tournament and brushed the goddess’s hero—me—aside as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.4">She was...incredibly strong. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.5">And now, she’d been appointed Great Keith’s State-Authorized Hero.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Even when I’d attacked at full strength, she’d been completely unharmed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">She’d bent my sword with a single hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">She’d sent me flying.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">She was the country’s new darling...and I couldn’t even muster up the motivation to challenge her again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">The citizens loved her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">A strong new fighter was a boon to the country.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Incidentally, Makoto Takatsuki’s role in saving the city was not particularly well-known. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">The accepted story was that our armed forces and mages had managed to defend against the massive meteorite. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">As a matter of record, it made sense—a single person shouldn’t have been able to do anything against that utterly absurd attack. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.4">A whole organization’s worth of power should’ve been needed to stop it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.5">The evacuating citizens hadn’t seen him act either.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">The military was another matter, though. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">They had evacuated the citizens and done what they could in the short time they’d had. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">Then, they’d despaired. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.4">There had been no defense against that massive rock.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Makoto Takatsuki had done it alone.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">Every single soldier who’d been in the capital now adored him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">There was also a </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">line</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1"> of mages hoping to talk with him, and I could understand why they’d want to find out about the spell he’d used.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">However, he had lost consciousness...and hadn’t yet woken up.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Apparently, he wasn’t likely to die. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">I would need to apologize when he awoke.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">My father—the general—was checking on him daily. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">Father had wanted to bring the vanquisher of the demon lord in Springrogue into our ranks to begin with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">Now, he was utterly devoted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.4">Even </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">he</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1"> had been charmed by Makoto Takatsuki’s spell.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">What a terrifying man.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">Abel the Savior had once gone to fight the Great Demon Lord’s army—hundreds of thousands of foes—with only four people. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">I’d always thought of that story as an exaggeration. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">Despite that, there were people in our army calling the Hero of Roses another savior.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">It was, of course, due to the impossibility of his accomplishments. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">People revered miracles.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">Yet, there was something about it all that still bothered me...</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">That light...that figure...</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">Just before the comet fell, I and the other soldiers had been gathering our mana to deflect the impact. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">I’d suddenly felt a huge surge of mana. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.3">When I’d leaped to the top of the Colosseum, I had seen a holy figure standing at Hero Makoto’s side.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">It Was Not Meant To Be Seen.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">My brain had rejected the vision before my eyes saw. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Looking at </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">it</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1"> would’ve surely sapped my sanity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">Fortunately, it had only been there for an instant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">Not even a second. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.4">Gone between one blink and the next.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">The figure’s lips had twisted into a grin as it vanished.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">I’d prickled with goosebumps. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">My body had stiffened and I hadn’t been able to make a sound.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">I had seen something not meant to be seen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">And now, that was all I could think about. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">I wanted to forget...but I couldn’t.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">Seeing the Hero of Roses stand impassively next to that existence made him all the more terrifying.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">What...was it...?</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">I didn’t know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">I was just scared. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">Even remembering it gave me the shakes.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">Suddenly, my door clicked open.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">“At least knock,” I protested.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">It was my childhood friend, Dahlia. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">She was Great Keith’s priestess, and I was her guardian knight.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">“His Majesty really raked me over the coals for messing with the Hero of Roses.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">She sighed, sitting on my bed and then falling back to lie there.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">“I’m not surprised. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">Father thoroughly chewed me out as well,” I replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.3">I’d earned it, but that didn’t make it any more pleasant.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">It was embarrassing as well. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">I want to go back and punch myself in the face,</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1"> I mused, looking up at the ceiling.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">“He...Makoto Takatsuki, I mean, is a wicked deity’s disciple,” Dahlia murmured.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">“What?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">I said, turning toward her before I even realized I’d moved. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">“Wicked?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">“Right—the old gods that lost Titanomachia. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">He follows one of them.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">The figure from </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">that time</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1"> shimmered in my mind’s eye once again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">The </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">thing</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1"> I couldn’t accept as a Sacred Deity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">The inhuman existence...</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">The old gods.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Wicked deities.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">Titania.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">There were many names for them, but they were anathema to the current religion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">And...their disciples were treated the same way.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">“Did you...tell His Majesty?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">I asked.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">“Yes... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">But I also heard from Sól before I did. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">She said the disciple is useful this time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.4">And also, that Eir was watching him...so it’s fine.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">“Th-That’s okay?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">I asked in confusion.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Even now, knowing who he follows... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">I couldn’t go against him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">Not with all the people praising him and Aya Sasaki. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.4">That certainly wouldn’t go well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.5">If Sól was saying not to interfere, we wouldn’t interfere.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">“We...picked a fight with the wrong person,” I lamented.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">“We certainly did.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">The two of us exchanged glances again and sighed.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">I woke up to an unfamiliar ceiling, a hard bed, thin sheets, and a white room.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">It was a hospital room, similar to the one in the Water Temple.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">“Hm?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">My right arm felt odd... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">More accurately, it didn’t feel at all.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">I can’t...feel my arm?</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">I looked and saw that it was wrapped in bandages. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">I tried to move it...but nothing happened.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">No way, seriously?</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">Lucy came rushing over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">I could see Furiae behind her.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">“The princess and warrior were waiting before now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">We have switched every half day,” Furiae explained.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">I’d need to thank Sasa and Princess Sophia for that later.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">“How long have I been out?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">I asked.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">“Four days,” replied Lucy.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">“Four?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">I’d been out cold for that long? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.3">Yeah... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.4">Using </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">Transform</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1"> to turn into an elemental hadn’t been the best idea.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">I looked at my unmoving arm again, and Furiae came over as I did.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">I looked at the bandage-covered appendage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">It glowed faintly, and I could tell it was full of mana...enough mana that it made me doubt it was my arm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.3">I’d transformed part of my body into an elemental, and now...</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">Hmm, maybe I can move it like that?</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">I tried using magic rather than my muscles to move my arm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">There </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1"> still mana in it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">Maybe using </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">Water Manipulation</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1"> would work.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">“You have done well...my knight,” Furiae said, looking at me with a pitying expression as she moved closer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">“It behaves like a curse...but it’s something beyond even my abilities... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.3">Therefore—”</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">Squish</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">It was resting on Furiae’s chest.</span></p>
