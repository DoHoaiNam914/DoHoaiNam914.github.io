      <h1><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">Chapter 5: Makoto Takatsuki Searches for the Snake Sect</span></h1>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">“It’s the moment you’ve all been waiting for! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">The Great Keith Martial Tournament has now begun!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">The commentator’s voice echoed, amplified by wind magic, and the Colosseum was filled with the roar of the crowd. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">The ring below was filled with fighters.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">“Wow,” I murmured.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">“There’re so many people!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">Sasa exclaimed.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">We were both slightly taken aback and looked agape at them all.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">“Aya, they all look pretty strong,” Lucy said in concern, pulling at Sasa’s sleeve.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">“It’ll be fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">You’re such a worrywart.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">Sasa seemed unbothered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4">Lucy was right though—all the warriors in the ring looked really tough and well-built.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">This tournament was unclassified—in other words, it was open to anyone regardless of race or gender. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">Whoever won would be Great Keith’s State-Authorized Hero for the next year. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">Therefore, they gave a chance to everyone who wanted one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.4">The participants weren’t just locals either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.5">People had come from all kinds of countries seeking fame and honor.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">The commentators were now reading out each participant’s name one after another. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">Sometimes, a name would be accompanied by a cheer from the audience, and I figured that these were the more famous fighters.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">“It seems rather odd that there are only thirty-two participants for a tournament of such renown,” Fujiyan commented.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">“It’s not quite like that, dear’h. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">The preliminaries have already been held. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.3">There were over ten thousand applicants’h.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">“Ah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">I was unaware.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">“Wait, really?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">I asked in surprise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.3">“Sasa, did you have to take part?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">“Nope. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">I just put my name on the entry sheet.”</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">Hm, what’s this about?</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Princess Sophia then spoke up, wearing a hard look. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">“Hero Makoto, it seems that since she is one of your companions, she was chosen through an exceptions process.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">“So what you’re saying is...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“That </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1"> is likely all part of their plan,” Princess Sophia finished. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">“If Aya had not volunteered, I believe they would have probably found some reason to prompt </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">your</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1"> participation...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“Defeating Roses’s hero would show how strong their own warriors are.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">I sighed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">All of my companions’ eyes were on me.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">“And representing Roses—Aya Sasaki!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">boomed the commentator.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">I tried to call out to wish her luck but noticed the sudden change in the atmosphere.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">“Go home!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“You cheat!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“Boooo!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">“Hurry up and lose already!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“Think of the people that actually earned their place!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">“Know some shame!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">The arena was filled with booing.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“What?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Lucy demanded.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“The fact that she did not fight in the preliminary matches leaked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">I would wager it was the organizers,” Princess Sophia said, biting her lip.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“The finals are said to be the highest honor for a warrior’h,” Nina—who had once been a warrior here—explained. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">“An average fighter cannot even get through the preliminaries’h... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">It’s probably jealousy’h.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">That worried me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">“Hey...Sasa?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">I asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.4">“Maybe you should withdraw...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">But her gaze was locked on the VIP box where the king and various nobles were seated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">It looked like some bigwigs from Highland were present too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">Gerald...wasn’t there. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">That’s kind of a relief.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">The exact point of Sasa’s focus was Olga Sól Talisker, who was yawning uninterestedly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">“Don’t worry, Takatsuki,” Sasa said, looking back at me with a smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">“I’m aiming for her.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Yeah...Sasa wasn’t going to give in.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">“Got it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">Don’t push yourself too hard, though.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">“Right!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">I’d just have to support her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">After that exchange, I went back over to Princess Sophia and Lucy.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“Sophia, Lucy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">Cheer her on, please.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“You can count on me!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">exclaimed Lucy.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">If she is injured, then I will provide healers from Roses,” offered Sophia. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">“The tournament officials have healers as well, but they are supported by Great Keith, so ours will be available just in case.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">I appreciated her thoughtfulness.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">Sasa turned back to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">“You’re going to be fighting the Snake Sect, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">I’m more worried about you.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Indeed, the underground gathering of the Snake Sect was on the same day as the tournament. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Was it a coincidence?</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">No, it’s probably on purpose.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">It was just like how they’d planned things in Highland. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">Back then, they’d chosen the day when the Hero of Light was to be installed as a leader of the country. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">It was the same now—they were moving in the shadows and taking advantage of everyone’s focus being elsewhere. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.4">Was that archbishop Isaac going to be involved again?</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">“Well, I’ll see you later!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Sasa cheered before trotting off to the ring.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">I glanced at Fujiyan, then Nina, Princess Sophia, Lucy, and...at Furiae, who was unhappily sucking at a straw.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">“Cheer her on too, Princess,” I encouraged Furiae. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">“Are you doing all right, by the way? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">You could have evacuated back to Roses.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Since she’d had the vision about Gamelan’s fall, Furiae hadn’t been outside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">She’d seemed out of sorts, so I’d suggested she head back to Macallan...but she hadn’t.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">“No. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">I’m not running away alone,” she replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.3">“Besides, you and the others are staying, so you need to change the future.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">“Got you,” I answered, taking the encouragement for what it was.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">“Let us go, Hero Makoto,” the guardian knight called. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">Princess Sophia had decided that she couldn’t allow me to confront the Snake Sect alone, so the geezer and several other high-ranking knights were helping out.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">Good luck, Sasa.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">The crowd was still jeering at her as we left the Colosseum and headed for the meeting place.</span><br/><br/></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">When we arrived at our rendezvous, a knight from Great Keith greeted us.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">“We’ve been waiting,” said one of the men. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">“You’re the hero’s squad, right?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">“Indeed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">And you must be the men General Talisker told us of,” the guardian knight answered.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">Neither of them was wearing grand armor, and they both carried the bare minimum of equipment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">I was always pretty lightly equipped to begin with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.3">At a glance, our two groups looked like adventurers or mercenaries. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.4">This was intentional—we couldn’t afford for the Snake Sect to notice us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.5">That was also why we were in squads roughly ten men strong and why we’d planned to join up at the destination.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">The young knight leading Great Keith’s forces guided us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">We followed him for a while, and I eventually noticed that the city was getting emptier.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">“This is the slums,” our guide explained. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">“It’s the area with the worst public order in the city.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">I just nodded along. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">The people milling around here had pretty shabby clothes, and a lot of the kids were barefoot. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.3">People had been drinking and gambling before the sun had even risen.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">The word “slum” was certainly appropriate.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">But...everyone seems oddly bright.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">Compared to the same type of area in Highland, there was more life in people’s faces here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">There were all kinds of races around—humans, beastmen, dwarves, and even elves. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">Maybe there are even cambions?</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">We didn’t have any real issues on the way.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">A few kids and beggars came up to us, but our guide showed them some symbol and they all raced off with pale faces.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">“What’s going on there?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">I asked.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">“Hero, this mark is the crest of the Herald Knight,” explained our guide. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">The crest in his hand depicted a goddess holding both a sword and a book.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">“Oh, that is most impressive for your age,” remarked the geezer guardian knight.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">“Not at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">Our family has been doing the same since my grandfather’s generation,” he replied with an awkward smile.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">A Herald Knight in Japan would be a mixture of a police officer and a judge. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">Apparently, they made on-the-spot judgments of criminals. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.3">Knowing that, I thought the kids were right to run away. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.4">It also made this young knight a good choice for a guide since he’d know the whole city.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">After a while, we stopped walking. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">“We have arrived at the entrance,” our guide informed us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.3">We’d ended up in some back alley that looked like an abandoned dumping ground. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.4">He pointed toward a stone gate that led underground. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.5">“This is the entrance to Great Keith’s underground,” the guardian knight explained.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">“Because of the heat on the surface, it’s customary in Great Keith to allow our dead to rest somewhere cooler,” the guide added.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">Even after we’d been walking for a while, there seemed to be no end to this tomb. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">“How far do the graves go?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">I found myself asking.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">Yeeep. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">Never coming here on my own.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">Was that dark humor? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">Those of us from Roses exchanged glances.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">The knight wouldn’t meet my eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">“See those graves? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.3">They’re new knights. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.4">At least one per year can’t find the way back... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.5">Mourning for them is one of the new recruits’ roles. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.6">I remember well the depression I felt back in the day.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">We all reared back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">Great Keith’s military was way too hardcore!</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">The young knight saw our ghastly expressions and shrugged. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">“Just kidding.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">“What?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">we chorused.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">The rest of the trip progressed in silence.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">As we progressed further in, the place became more and more dungeon-like. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">We saw fewer graves, but the passageways still branched off in all directions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.3">There were so many forks and crossroads that I’d have </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">definitely</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1"> gotten lost on my first time here.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">“Someone’s there,” our leader whispered, gesturing for us to stop. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">We were next to a corner and a long straight path.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">The Herald Knight had pretty good eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">He looked like he had a touch of beastman in his ancestry, and they had good night vision. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.3">Great Keith was mostly a meritocracy, so if someone was strong, it didn’t really matter what race they were.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">The guardian knight folded his arms. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">But then, our guide pulled out a magic tool that looked like an hourglass.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">“We expected there to be someone posted,” our guide said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">“The structure of the maze makes eliminating any of them difficult, so we planned for a coordinated attack once the sand has all fallen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.3">That way, it doesn’t matter if we’re spotted.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">“I see,” the guardian knight nodded.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">“Do you want me to take that one out?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">I offered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.3">So far, I’d been pretty useless.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">The Herald Knight looked at me doubtfully. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">“I don’t imagine you can do so without being noticed.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">“There are more than a hundred meters between us,” the geezer pointed out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">“You will definitely be seen.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">They were about as against it as I’d thought they’d be.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">“Then I just need to make sure he can’t see me,” I answered calmly.</span><br/><br/></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">The guardian knight was just impressed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">“An interesting technique. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.3">I’ll keep that in mind.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.4">His gaze was sharp, though that sharpness vanished almost immediately as he addressed our group. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.5">“Thanks to Sir Makoto, we can progress. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.6">Restrain the Snake Sect members. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.7">One of us will remain here—the rest will advance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.8">We are close to our goal.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">We nodded quietly and proceeded through the darkness in silence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">Our guide’s face was tense. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.3">We were probably very close.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">“We are currently organizing a search party to locate the Snake Sect. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.2">We have captured and interrogated all known members but have yet to find any pertinent information.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">“Perhaps we set their plans back?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.2">suggested the geezer.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">“I certainly hope so, but...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">I listened to their conversation with half an ear, but I also reflected on my day under the influence of </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">Calm Mind</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">Then, a voice in my head spoke up.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">Makoto, they were used for sacrificial magic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.2">Though, I don’t know </span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">what</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1"> that magic was used for... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.2">Eir and Sól probably don’t either.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">None of you know?</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">The people behind this are protected by Typhon’s blessings. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.2">The daemon’s influence hides the future, so we can’t tell what’s happening. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.3">Be careful.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">I will. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.2">Thank you, Noah.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">“Maybe if we knew what the magic had been used for,” I interjected.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">The other two looked at me.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">“Did it not fail?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.2">asked the guardian knight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.3">“Nothing happened in the end. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.4">Is </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">Suicide Magic</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1"> not the practice of sacrificing your lifespan to cast magic?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">“No, it’s just using your lifespan to make up for a mana deficit,” I clarified. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.2">“If their lifespans were used, it was probably to cast something.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">“Hero Makoto.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.2">The Herald Knight offered a deep bow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.3">“I know nothing of </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1">Suicide Magic</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.2">If you noticed anything, anything at all, please tell me.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">The guy was really earnest and forthright. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.2">I wanted to help him, so I thought carefully and then started speaking.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">“Like I just said, it’s fundamentally making up for a deficit... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.2">This is only a guess, but let’s assume the Snake Sect used it for something.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.3">If Noah was right, then that was undoubtedly the case. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.4">The other two nodded along. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.5">“The sect doesn’t attack without backup. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.6">In Roses, they conjured blight giants. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.7">In Highland, they used a swarm of wyverns and a stampede. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.8">Even in Macallan, they summoned another stampede and an ancient dragon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.9">Springrogue was Zagan’s army and resurrecting a demon lord... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.10">So, they must be trying to dilute Great Keith’s strength somehow.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">“By buying slaves?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.2">the Herald Knight asked.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">“They let those slaves go, though, Hero.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">“You’re right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.2">But the slaves aren’t fighters—just fuel for magic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.3">Past history shows us that the sect uses monsters frequently.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">“So...they’re going to cause a stampede here?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.2">the guardian knight shouted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.3">The Great Keith knights all looked our way in shock.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">Quickly, the Herald Knight pulled out his communicator. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.2">“Alert the city watch! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.3">Check for nearby monsters immediately!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1">He’d acted fast. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.2">It was good to see.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1">“Thank you, Hero,” he said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.2">“We have put our forces into making sure the Snake Sect members do not escape, but the possibility of external attack is still there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.3">I have informed them to be on guard for such a thing.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">“We can simply watch for monsters!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">“W-Well...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">All the knights from Roses wore satisfied expressions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.2">It felt like they were all a bit optimistic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.3">In some ways, this was a good thing, but it made me uneasy when I considered them fighting against Iblis.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">“Thank you for everything. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">I will continue our search. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.3">Why not go back to the tournament? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.4">One of your comrades is participating, correct? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.5">If she advanced, I believe they are currently holding the semifinals.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">With that parting suggestion, the Herald Knight took his leave. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.2">He’d been pretty agreeable the whole time.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">“Let us return to Lady Sophia.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">“Let’s.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">We hurried back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.2">It had been morning when we’d left, and a lot of the day was already gone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.3">Was Sasa still in the fight? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.4">As we jogged, I asked the guardian knight about the tournament.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">“Have you ever competed?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">“Once... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.2">Unfortunately, I never made it through the preliminaries.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">“O-Oh.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">Maybe I shouldn’t have asked.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">“It is rare for our fighters to make it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.2">I believe Lady Aya should offer us a good showing though!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">“Yeah, she should still be in the game,” I replied with a nod.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">The tournament only lasted for a single day because of how impatient the citizens were. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.2">I’d have thought splitting it up over a few days would make for a better show. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.3">Any injuries sustained were healed right away by the best healers the country had to offer, so that part wasn’t an issue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.4">The geezer and I were discussing that when the Colosseum came into sight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.5">Once we’d shown ID, we headed in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.6">It was just as loud—maybe even louder—as it had been this morning.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">The crowd was pretty into it.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">I was looking for the seats where Lucy and Furiae were when I heard the amplified commentator’s voice.</span></p>
