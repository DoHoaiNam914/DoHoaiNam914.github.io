      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">“You’ll regret that...otherworlder,” she muttered.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Maybe she had a bit of a bias against otherworlders? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">I mean, we did sort of just show up out of nowhere and throw the world’s power balance out of whack.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“H-Hero Makoto! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">Aya is—”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Princess Sophia was yelling even as Furiae held her back.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">“Sasa’ll be fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">Don’t worry.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">“What?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">Princess Sophia looked at us doubtfully. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">“How can you be so calm?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">“Well, Sophia—” I started. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">But then, Lucy cut me off, pointing at the ring.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">“They’re starting!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“Referee! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">Once you give the signal, move away!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">advised the commentator. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.4">“Otherwise, you will be caught up in it.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">There was a pause.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">“Are you sure about this?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">the referee asked Sasa.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">“Yup, it’s fine,” she replied, cool as a cucumber.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">“Then, on my mark... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">Begin!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">The referee gave the starting signal and simultaneously leaped from the ring. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">Olga and Sasa were the only people in the arena now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.3">The spectators were holding their breath, and not even the commentator had anything to say.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">A beat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">Then, Olga vanished. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">A second later, the ring exploded.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">I couldn’t see her attack, or Sasa taking the attack, so everything that happened was explained to me later by Lucy.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Olga had sprung up into the air and then fired all of her sword’s mana down at the ground. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">The attack was like a meteor strike, and Sasa had taken it head-on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">The arena was splintered like a bomb had gone off—a blast of wind buffeted us as a massive cross of red light formed in the air.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">After that, I could see what was going on again...somewhat. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">That’s...like Sakurai’s sword technique and Rosalie’s saint rank magic... </span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Apparently, attacks of that caliber formed crosses like that.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">The ring was now covered in dust, so we couldn’t see anything.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“Aya?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">screamed Princess Sophia.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">All around us, spectators were trembling at just how powerful Olga’s attack had been.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“Wh-What in the world?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">the commentator said eventually. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">“Is Aya Sasaki safe?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">That was pretty much what everyone wanted to know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">The dust cleared gradually, revealing a pulverized ring. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">No one said a word. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.4">I could’ve sworn I didn’t even hear anyone in the audience breathe.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“Uh...what? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">L-Lady...Olga?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">The commentator’s voice was shaking.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">The first thing we could see was Olga, slumped against the inner wall of the Colosseum. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">Maybe she’d been slammed into it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">Her armor was cracked and broken...</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">Like something massive had crashed into it.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">She’s not dead, right? </span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">Olga looked like she’d been in a car crash.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">“Ugh,” she groaned.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Well, she was still conscious at least. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">She soon staggered to her feet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">I was glad she was still alive. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.4">Her face was flooded with disbelief. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.5">She glanced between her broken armor and the ring. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.6">There was nothing in her hands—Balamung was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“A-Aya Sasaki is fine! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">She’s standing in the ring!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">echoed the commentator’s voice.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">In the middle of the dust cloud, where Olga’s attack had been at its strongest, Sasa was standing like nothing had happened.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">She was shining with light that shimmered in the hues of the rainbow.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“Aww, she let everyone see her skill,” Lucy whined.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“Well, at least she’s safe,” I said, sighing in relief. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">I’d been pretty sure she would be, but the scale of Olga’s attack had still made me worry.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“What in the world was that?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">Princess Sophia demanded, grabbing hold of me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3">She’d been too busy with all the official business, so we hadn’t gotten time to explain Sasa’s new power yet.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“It’s a skill she got from </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Action Game Player</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1"> when she evolved,” I explained.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">“A new skill...those seven colors of light? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">Oh, it’s fading now.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">Indeed, the kaleidoscope around Sasa was fading away.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“Takatsuki! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">I won!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.3">Sasa cheered, posing with her fingers up in a “V” shape.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">However, my eyes were more focused on the bent and battered sword at her feet. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">This is bad, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">I mean...Balamung is a national treasure...and we broke it... </span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">I’d heard that it was priceless—practically beyond value. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">This wasn’t going to cause an international incident, was it?</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“C-Congrats, Sasa,” I said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">She’d won, so she was entitled to some celebration.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“Yup! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Go ahead and praise me more!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">She nodded, then jumped at me and wrapped her arms around my neck.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“Ah...Aya? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">What does your skill do?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.3">Princess Sophia asked dazedly.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Sasa giggled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">“It’s </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">Super Star</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">“What did you say?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">I remembered how lost for words I’d been upon seeing the skill for the first time. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">Super Star</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">It was as terrifying as it was simple. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">While the skill was active, she was invincible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.4">It protected the player from all attacks and nullified all defenses against the player’s attacks.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">Princess Sophia froze as she heard the ridiculousness. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">Lucy and Furiae’s expressions of disbelief and exasperation were the only real responses.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">Sasa giggled shyly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">It was cute, so I found myself stroking her head...even as I complained mentally about her skills being bugged to hell and back.</span></p>
