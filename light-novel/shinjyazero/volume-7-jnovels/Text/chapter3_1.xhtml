      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">“Am I to presume that this warning comes from the moon priestess in the Hero of Roses’s party?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">The princess’s breath caught slightly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">She’d been found out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.3">Well, he was in charge of the army—he’d surely have intel operatives.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“Is there a need to answer that?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">the princess asked after a pause.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">“Not at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">Your response is sufficient.”</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Sophia, that was essentially a “yes.”</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">The other men in the room didn’t say a word; they probably wouldn’t until the general told them to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">Still, the moment Furiae’s title left the general’s lips, some of them began looking slightly hostile.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">We...might not be very welcome here.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">“My thanks for your report, Princess Sophia. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">The upcoming tournament means we have more people in the capital than is normal. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">The alert level will be raised.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">The princess paused again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">“I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">Then we shall take our leave,” she said, cutting the conversation short. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.4">She didn’t seem to want to stick around.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">I went to follow as she left, only to be stopped by a voice behind me.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">“Hero Makoto. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">I should apologize for my daughter.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">“Not at all,” I replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">“She was as strong as I’d expect from Great Keith’s hero.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">“Truly, she never listens or rests.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Should I disagree? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">Was he trying to imply that the attack hadn’t been his idea?</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">I can’t tell.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">There was no point worrying about it, so the princess and I left the castle.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Once we were back and had eaten, I spent the night training in my room. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">Furiae had said she wasn’t feeling well—she’d shut herself away. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">I’d gone to check on her, but she’d told me to leave. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.4">I also hadn’t seen Sasa or Lucy since I’d returned.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">So, I conjured a little mouse with water magic and spent the time playing with Twi.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">Suddenly, there was a knock at my door, and Sasa called out, “Takatsuki.”</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">What the...?</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">As she stepped into my room, it felt like I’d been blasted by a gust of wind.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“Are you free?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">she asked.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">“Y-Yeah...sure,” I answered, awed by her presence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">She hadn’t changed at all in looks and still seemed to be the same human girl. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">According to Fujiyan, she was back at level one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.4">Despite that, being near her felt like standing in front of a demon lord or ancient dragon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.5">It was weird...like she was just...more. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.6">Was this the result of her evolution?</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“What’s with that look, Takatsuki?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">“Doesn’t matter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">Where’s Lucy?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">I asked, changing the subject.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“Well, Fuu seems down, so she went to go check on her.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">“Right... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Furiae has been a bit off since lunch.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">She’d said that </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Future Sight</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1"> used a lot of mental strength, so she was tired. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">I’d notice how pale she was, so I felt pretty worried.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">Sasa then grabbed my hand, and I felt a chill.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“Hey, let’s go out,” she said with a teasing grin.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">All of a sudden, she yanked on my arm...and pulled me out of the window.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Hey! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">This is the third floor!!!</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">The two of us whistled through the air.</span><br/><br/></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“Wooow,” Sasa gushed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">“So this is what it looks like from up here.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“There are a lot of buildings,” I commented. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">“Well, it </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">is</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1"> like the continent’s second most important city.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">The two of us were currently flying through the air above Gamelan, and Sasa...had transformed into a </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">harpy</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">“I thought you hated harpies?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">I asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">The lamiae and harpies had been bitter enemies in Labyrinthos, so it felt odd to see her in that form.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">“Yeah...but I fought them so much that it’s easy to transform into one,” she replied with a bitter grin.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">Maybe the memories had faded a little... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">That could only be a good thing.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“So, where are we going?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">I asked.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“What? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">On a date, obviously. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">You went on one with Fuu earlier, so let’s take a walk.”</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">A date...</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">I looked at my old school friend’s face—her expression was serious. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">It looked like she was searching for something...and aiming for a goal.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“What’s that big building?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">Sasa asked, the question pulling me back to earth.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“Um, the Colosseum. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">It’s where they’re holding the tournament.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“Hmm, so it’s like a big stadium...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">“Want to go look?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">I asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">Sasa was entering the tournament, so it wouldn’t hurt to check the place out first.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">“Nah, not today,” she replied.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">So that wasn’t her goal. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">In which case...</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">“Is </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1"> what you’re looking for?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">I pointed, and she looked in that direction.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">“What’s with all the tents?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">she asked.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">The area was a big empty space containing several large tents. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">They were about the same size as the circus tent we’d seen in Roses, but there were dozens of them, making for a rather strange sight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.3">Fujiyan had once told me what was within them.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">“That’s the slave market, Sasa. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">The biggest place for trading in slaves in the country.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">“The slave market...” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">Her eyes took on a dangerous glint.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">So...she </span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">is </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">after Kawakita.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">According to Fujiyan, he had not managed to find out anything useful about Kawakita’s would-be buyer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">And now, there were only a few days left until the auction.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">Sasa turned to me with a serious expression. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">“Say, Takatsuki. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.3">Shall we make a detour?”</span><br/><br/></p>

      <p class="noindent"><code><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Will you head for the slave market?</span></code></p>

      <p class="noindent"><code><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">No</span></code><br/><br/></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">So here comes the choice.</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">There was something here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">We might’ve been stepping into a lion’s den, but </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">Sasa</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1"> was the person asking.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">“Let’s go say hi to Kawakita,” I decided.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">“Thanks!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">Sasa was suddenly overjoyed.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">“We should do it cleverly though,” I added.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">She looked puzzled for a moment, and I explained my idea.</span></p>

      <p class="centerp section-marking"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">◇</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">“Hey, does this work?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">Sasa asked, shifting her large frame uncomfortably. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.3">“I kinda don’t like it.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">“Well, you’ll fit right in at the slave market,” I told her.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">“Then let’s go!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">We exchanged nods and passed through the entrance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">We were stopped before heading into the market, but handing over a pile of chips got us in.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">Fujiyan had already explained the way things worked here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">Inside, the area was unexpectedly clean and lively. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.3">The main product was, obviously, slaves, but there were also places to gamble and such. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.4">The most popular kind of slave in the country were the fighters.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">With Great Keith being a military country, it was sometimes called the “martial country,” so strong individuals garnered respect. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">A skilled warrior—even if they were a slave—was treated fairly well here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.3">There were people without any skills besides fighting who would find themselves a master that would pay well, and then sell themselves off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.4">It meant that strong slaves were both prized and expensive.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">As for how to tell which slaves were strong... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">Well, the Soul Book listed their skills and stats, but the quickest way to find out was to get them to fight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.3">There were several simple rings around the market where the slaves could battle one another.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">Taking wagers on the fights was just capitalism at its finest.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">There </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">were</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1"> clerics on hand for healing, so some safety procedures had been implemented...despite the general lack of civility that this concept had in the first place. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">And though the phrase “slave market” brought something dark to mind, this area was actually full of excitement.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">“Wow, Takatsuki. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">Those slave girls are fighting.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">“It looks like there’re different divisions depending on gender and build.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">Was it to make sure things were fair? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">These fights seemed more like a sport at this point. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.3">At the same time, only the warriors were fighting, not the mages. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.4">Apparently, mages were judged solely by their Soul Books. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.5">That was for a simple reason—mages fighting in town could cause far too much damage.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">“Who do you think will win?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">Sasa wondered.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">“Hmm, an amazoness and a beastgirl. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">They’re both pretty strong.”</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">I guess while we’re here, we’re spectating...</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1"> The first fighter was a tanned, lean woman, and the other looked like she had tiger ears. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">They seemed pretty evenly matched, so I couldn’t discern anything except for the fact that they were strong.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">Maybe as strong as Nina...?</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">“I wonder if I could join in...” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">Sasa murmured ominously. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.3">“If they’re that strong...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">Whoa there, Sasa. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">We can’t stand out like that.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">I turned to say just that, but there was a sudden ringing in the air. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">A moment later, I realized it was coming from Sasa. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.3">The two fighters suddenly stopped and looked at us—Sasa specifically—in shock.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">And it wasn’t just those two—all of the fighters had looked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">Fortunately, the spectators hadn’t noticed.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">“Sasa, we need to get out of here,” I hissed.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">“Whuh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">Uh, right.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">We hurried away and ended up at a spring in the middle of the area. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">It was almost like an oasis. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.3">Trader carts were lined up, and their horses were drinking from the water. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.4">I caught some glimpses of water elementals as well.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">“Ugh, that was bad...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">“S-Sorry, Takatsuki,” Sasa apologized as we caught our breath. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">She was in her normal human form now.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">“Be more careful next time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">Did you accidentally use your </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">Menace</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1"> skill?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">The shock on those fighters’ faces had definitely been weird. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.3">They’d looked like deer frozen in the headlights.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">She grumbled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">“I didn’t mean to...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">Maybe it was because she wasn’t yet used to the evolution. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.2">She’d just have to take it steady.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">So, with that crisis averted, I decided to cheer her up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">“Sasa, look over there! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.3">Our goal’s in sight.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">“What?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">There was a much bigger tent on the other side of the spring. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.2">Many people were standing guard at the entrance.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">“I used </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">Listen </span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">to check it out,” I said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">“That’s where the big earners are being sold.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">“So that’s where Keiko is...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">“Hold up, Sasa,” I panicked as she started to emit even more waves of hostility than earlier. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.2">“Right...why don’t we just head back...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">“What?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">After we came this far?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.3">she demanded, whirling to look at me.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">We could ask Furiae to help as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.2">There was a lot to do.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">Sasa stared back at me, her expression perplexed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">“You seem like you’re having fun.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">“Hey, Sasa, look me in the eye. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.2">I’m dead serious.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">“Whatever.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">She laughed.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">Why?</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">“I want to nap in your room then,” she added.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">That prompted Kawakita to look my way.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">They both apologized in unison and fell quiet.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">Kawakita’s reaction wasn’t particularly enthused. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.2">“Ah, right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.3">Michio came and said the same...”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">“Honestly, it’s my own fault I ended up as a slave.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.2">Her tone seemed indifferent. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.3">“Plus, the guy who’s going to buy me is pretty influential...so you don’t need to push yourselves too hard.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">“Well, I never would have considered it in Japan. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.2">But we were all treated pretty well once we got to this world, so we got carried away. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.3">Then, before I knew it, I fell into gambling and racked up a huge debt. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.4">That’s how I ended up like this.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.5">She gave a small derisive snort.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">Kawakita frowned in puzzlement at our reactions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.2">“No way... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.3">Takatsuki, you’re only dating Aya, right?”</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">Why would you tell her?!</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">Kawakita looked utterly disbelieving. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.2">“You’re just like them?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.3">I was wrong about you! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.4">I thought you were a stand-up guy!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">“And that means he can have lots of girls?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">Yup, that’s the right reaction. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.2">Sakurai and the others had gone overboard.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">“Actually, weren’t his stats and skills so trash he stayed behind?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.2">Kawakita sneered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.3">“He’s seriously a hero?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">“Well, a lot’s happened,” Sasa said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.2">She then launched into a simple explanation of recent events.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">After Sasa finished, Kawakita gave an impressed sigh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.2">“Takatsuki, you went through all that...?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">“See? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.2">He’s had it rough.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">Apparently, finding out how I’d gotten covered in burns, used suicide magic, and been petrified had changed how Kawakita viewed me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.2">Sasa had been all too happy to explain.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">“Well, he’s a diligent guy,” I said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.2">Her disbelief made sense—after all, just showing up in a new world didn’t mean you’d save it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.3">However, our classmates who’d gone with Sakurai had changed as well.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">However, Sasa wasn’t happy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.2">I also didn’t want to leave empty-handed.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">“Yeah,” replied Sasa. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.2">“Still, all the girls around him are so cute.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">I trailed off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.2">There might be a better way.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">“We’ll look into it later,” I said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">“We can’t stay here though, so we need to move.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.3">We’d actually been talking for about an hour.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">“Yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.2">We’ll be back, Keiko,” Sasa said, regretfully holding onto Kawakita’s hand.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">Just as we moved to leave, Kawakita spoke up once more. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.2">“Oh, right! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.3">I don’t know if it’s related...but the slavers were talking about something weird. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.4">There’ve been a lot of people buying up cheap slaves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.5">Well, they might be cheap for slaves, but it’s still a lot of money to toss around—noble buyers who try to hide their names get found out sooner or later...but these people haven’t. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.6">Some think the buyers are rich people from another continent, but I saw—” Her voice started shaking. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.7">“—there have been cambions mixed in with them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.8">Daemon believers at that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.9">Since I’m a mage, I can read a person’s mana and tell whether they believe in the goddesses or the Daemons.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">“What you mentioned earlier made me think about it,” said Kawakita. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.2">“The Snake Sect is always behind the scenes, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.3">They believe in the daemons, and they also have a lot of cambions in their ranks. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.4">Was that helpful?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">“Thanks, Kawakita. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.2">It really was,” I said.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">In the end, I had to tug Sasa along to get her to leave.</span><br/><br/></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">It wasn’t quite dawn yet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.2">Sasa (in harpy form) was holding onto me as we flew through the air.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">“What Keiko said... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.2">Well, what did you think of it?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.3">Sasa asked.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">“Snake Sect members are buying up a load of slaves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.2">I guess they’re going to use them for a rebellion.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">“Like they did in Highland?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.2">Sasa asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.3">They’d used the class divide in Highland to incite a rebellion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.4">Would they use slaves here? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.5">“But fighters are expensive, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.6">Even if they’re slaves.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">“Plus, it looks like they’re treated well here,” I added.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">The time we’d spent in Gamelan had helped us understand how the country worked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.2">The strong were respected. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.3">Even a slave was treated more like a live-in employee if they could fight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.4">Well...that is, with a few more restrictions on their freedom.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">A lot of slaves were musclebrains who thought more along the lines of “I can eat until I’m full and just fight,” so it was a bit of a win-win situation for them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.2">The nobles also earned money by using their slaves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.3">For example, they could send their forces off to places with lots of monsters or bandits to restore order.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">Roses was apparently a big customer on that front. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.2">Our soldiers weren’t strong enough... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.3">Including our hero...</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">“I don’t think the Snake Sect benefits from buying a bunch of weak slaves,” Sasa concluded.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">“Yeah.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.2">Still, it was bothering me, so I’d make sure we told Princess Sophia and Fujiyan just in case. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.3">“Shall we head back?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.4">I asked.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">“Hmm, maybe we can stay out a bit longer?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">She headed away from the inn, toward the city walls in the opposite direction. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.3">We soared above the wilderness for a while before Sasa found somewhere she liked and landed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.4">The sky was starting to lighten.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">“Sasa?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.2">I asked as she turned back to human form.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">“We’re finishing our date.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.2">She looped her arms around my neck, sending my heart racing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.3">“See, we’re alone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.4">As far as the eye can see.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">“Right, it does kinda feel like we’re the only people in the world here—”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">I was cut off by a blaring alarm in my head.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1">Sasa’s eyes sharpened immediately, and we both turned around.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">There were about a hundred massive gray lizards with lolling tongues staring at us.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">“S-Sand Dragons!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">Their scales allowed them to camouflage with the sand, so they were hard to spot from a distance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.2">Despite the way they hid, they were unusually strong. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.3">They were one of many carnivorous dragons that called Great Keith home.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">Are we in a nest of them?!</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">Suddenly, the closest leaped at us with a hiss.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">“You keep getting in the way!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.2">Sasa shouted angrily, launching her fist forward.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">“Sasa!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.2">That was a dragon! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.3">All of them were calamities, so she was in danger...</span></p>
