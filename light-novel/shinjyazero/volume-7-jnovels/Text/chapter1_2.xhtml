      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">“I’m melting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.2">Let’s hurry up,” Furiae griped, wiping the sweat from her brow and loosening her clothes to waft some air around her chest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.3">The fanning led to an indescribable eroticism as it teased glances at her chest.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">The men moving down the street stopped as one to stare at her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">She...really stood out.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“Lu, you good?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">Sasa asked.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">“I’m too hot. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">Your skin’s so nice and cool, though.”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Lucy never dealt well with the heat and was currently draped over Sasa. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">We needed to get moving already, so we headed for our lodging.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">As we did, Princess Sophia told us more about Great Keith. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">It was a military-led country that dispatched its army at other countries’ requests. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">The land here wasn’t particularly fertile, but they had good hunting and fishing industries and focused a lot on trade. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">Currently, there was a swarm of people in the capital because of the upcoming tournament, which was the largest of its type on the continent. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.5">The winner of this contest would be treated as Great Keith’s State-Authorized Hero and be given privileges as a state guest for a year. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.6">The country as a whole definitely focused on combat.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">As I listened to her explanations, I used </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">RPG Player</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1"> to look at as much of the city as I could. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">After a while, we ended up taking a bit of a break. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">The girls were drinking chilled fruit juices they’d gotten from a nearby store. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.4">I was a little farther out, looking for water elementals. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.5">Not that I was having any luck...</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Suddenly, the keening wail of </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">Sense Danger</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1"> sounded in my head.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">What? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">But we’re in a town?</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">There shouldn’t have been any monsters around, and my </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">Scout </span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">skill—which I’d started up as soon as I heard the alert—wasn’t showing me any enemy.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“Takatsuki! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">Watch out!”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Sasa had grabbed me as she yelled, dashing away from the spot where I’d been standing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">A moment later, there was a massive crash—the recently vacated spot was covered in a dust cloud.</span></p>

      <p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">W-Was that a bomb?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">Do they have terrorists?!</span></em></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Yet, as the dust cleared, it revealed a figure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">Had they fallen from the sky?</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“Aw, you dodged. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Well, you </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">are</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1"> the hero who’s defeated a demon lord.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">The person who spoke was a woman, and her tone sounded slightly languid. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">She had dark skin and glossy black hair cut short. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.4">Her narrowed eyes made her look like a panther or something similar. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.5">She wore light armor, but her legs and shoulders were bare.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">However, she had masses of aura covering her body... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">She was obviously anything but defenseless.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">“Nice to meet you...” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">she remarked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">“I’m the Hero of Incandescence, Olga Sól Talisker.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.4">I couldn’t tell where she was looking. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.5">“So...Hero of Roses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.6">How about a fight to the death?”</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Her lips quirked into a crescent... </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">A fierce smile.</span></p>

      <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">This wasn’t good!</span></p>
