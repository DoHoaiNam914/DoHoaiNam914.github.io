      <p>“Come on, come on,” she chanted, pulling me along by force.</p>

      <p>“Wait!”</p>

      <p>I couldn’t resist her strength with my own. Gradually, she managed to pull me inside.<br/><br/></p>

      <p>“And now you’ve just gone to sleep!”</p>

      <p>A soft snore was my only answer.</p>

      <p>No sooner had we paid and stepped into the room than she’d cheered at the sight of the bed, jumped into it, and then promptly passed out.</p>

      <p>I might’ve been able to wake her up, but there was one problem: “Why’d she have to strip?”</p>

      <p>Lucy was currently in bed without a stitch of clothing on her. Sasa had said that she tossed and turned a lot and soon ended up undressed... But now that it’d happened, I couldn’t look.</p>

      <p><em>Of course you can, hell, you can make a move as well,</em> Noah insisted wickedly.</p>

      <p>That’s enough of that<em>, </em>goddess<em>.</em> <em>Calm Mind</em>.</p>

      <p>It seemed like the final trial of my busy day was going to be lustful temptation coming from my teammate.</p>

      <p>In the end, I spent the night on the sofa in the room.<br/><br/></p>

      <p>“We’re back,” I called.</p>

      <p>“Gah, my head.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, Takatsuki, Lu, you’re both back bright and early,” Sasa remarked from where she’d come to greet us. Her voice was cheerful, but I didn’t like that look in her eye. Also, the hammer in her hand wasn’t easing my mind much either.</p>

      <p>“It seems like you had fun, Hero Makoto,” came the cold voice of Princess Sophia.</p>

      <p>“Fun’s not the word...” Lucy had a hangover, so I’d needed to carry her back.</p>

      <p>Suddenly, Fujiyan and Chris came rushing in.</p>

      <p>“This is urgent!” Fujiyan exclaimed.</p>

      <p>“Look at this!” Chris followed up, handing me a letter.</p>

      <p>It was an invitation from the Castor family of the ninth district...from one of their capo, Peter Castor, to be precise. The Castors were a famous mafia family, known as one of the three main families of Highland.</p>

      <p><em>Though I only just found that out...</em> I thought.</p>

      <p>Peter’s family was a big player in the undercity. I’d imagined him as part of a more minor family since he hadn’t seemed all that strong in the tunnels.</p>

      <p>“The Castor, Shaula, and Denebola families run the underworld in the city,” Fujiyan explained, along with telling me about their subordinate organizations that were spread across the continent.</p>

      <p>“The Castor family are the mafia that runs gambling rings...right’h?” Nina looked like she’d bitten into a lemon. What was wrong?</p>

      <p>“Nina owed her debt to the mafia in Great Keith. I bought her out of it after she’d become a slave.”</p>

      <p>“Ahhhh’h! Don’t bring it up again’h!” Nina cried. “It’s bringing the memories all back’h!” Nina was flapping her long ears, and the motion was kinda cute. So Nina had owed a debt because of gambling?</p>

      <p>“Out of interest, how much was she?” I asked Fujiyan.</p>

      <p>“I believe it was a million on the nose. I bought her on the spot!”</p>

      <p>“Oh, a reasonable price?” I said that, but I had no idea what the slave market was like.</p>

      <p>“Husband’h! Mister Takatsuki’h! Don’t talk like that’h!”</p>

      <p>“Nina... You’re never gambling again.”</p>

      <p>While Fujiyan and I got carried away, Chris was looking aghast at Nina.</p>

      <p>Sasa had taken Lucy up to her room, so neither of them was here presently.</p>

      <p>“Hero Makoto, will you be accepting the mafia’s invitation?” Princess Sophia asked.</p>

      <p>“Hmm, well, what’s it say, Fujiyan?”</p>

      <p>“I shall read it aloud,” he announced, before doing exactly that.<br/><br/></p>

      <p><em>Dearest Brother,</em></p>

      <p><em>We have prepared a party and banquet to celebrate our friendship. We would like nothing more than to demonstrate our thanks. Naturally, the strong young lady with you is also welcome.</em></p>

      <p><em>It will be held in the VIP penthouse on the top floor of the Grand Highland Casino.</em></p>

      <p><em>P.S. If you show the badge I gave you, then the casino will let you in for free. You can have your fill of the casino too, and if you mention my name, you’ll get some on the house.</em></p>

      <p class="signature"><em>—Peter Castor</em><br/><br/></p>

      <p>Silence reigned for a while once Fujiyan was finished reading.</p>

      <p>Uh...</p>

      <p>“What’ll happen if I go...?” I asked</p>

      <p>“You’ll probably get the wining and dining of a lifetime’h,” Nina answered after a moment.</p>

      <p>“And you’ll likely be dragged in past the point of no return,” Chris added.</p>

      <p>Looking at their expressions, they probably didn’t want me to go.</p>

      <p>“My esteemed Tackie, what is this badge the invitation mentioned?”</p>

      <p>“Probably...this?”</p>

      <p>“May I see?” Fujiyan asked, and I passed it to him. He looked steadily at it, probably using <em>Appraisal</em> on it.</p>

      <p>“A twin crest. This is definitely the Castor family’s,” he judged.</p>

      <p>“Peter is the fifth son of Don Genoa, an important person...”</p>

      <p>Fujiyan and the princess both sighed.</p>

      <p>“Actually, the letter didn’t say when to show up,” I realized. The invitation had only mentioned the location. Did they forget the date?</p>

      <p>“This is the mafia’s way of saying you may come when you please,” Fujiyan explained. “It means that their own preparations are in place and you should make your own.”</p>

      <p>Uh, preparations? I didn’t have <em>any</em> intention of joining the mafia.</p>

      <p>“My biggest concern is the nobles backing them,” Chris said.</p>

      <p>“The mafia has connections with nobility?” I asked in shock.</p>

      <p>“This is part of how Highland functions...unfortunately’h.”</p>

      <p>“The three main mafia families each have a noble family supporting them from the shadows. The Castors...have connections to the Ballantines.”</p>

      <p>“Geh!” <em>For real?! </em>That was Gerald’s family, right? No way.</p>

      <p>“They’re not going to kidnap me if I turn up, are they...?”</p>

      <p>“The relationship between the mafia and nobility is fundamentally all business—the Ballantines should just act as influential backup and a source of money...so I doubt they are attempting to get revenge for Lord Gerald’s defeat,” Chris thought aloud.</p>

      <p>“You <em>did</em> save one of their son’s lives...” Fujiyan added.</p>

      <p>Both of them made reassuring points.</p>

      <p>“Hero Makoto, you are a representative of Roses, so you need not worry.”</p>

      <p>“Princess Sophia...” Her strong voice had managed to reassure me a bit.</p>

      <p>“Well, I don’t want to keep them waiting too long, so I guess I’ll go now.”</p>

      <p>“Where are you going, Takatsuki?” Sasa asked, returning from tucking Lucy into bed. I grabbed her hand.</p>

      <p>“Come with, Sasa,” I said to her.</p>

      <p>“What? S-Sure. Where to?”</p>

      <p>Sasa hadn’t heard the conversation, but I pulled her in anyway.</p>

      <p><em>Ha ha, you agreed now, so you can’t get out of it! Sorry, you’re amazing when it comes to a fight, and I’m not letting you go.</em></p>

      <p>“I shall also accompany you,” proclaimed Fujiyan. “You will need someone that can negotiate if an argument breaks out.”</p>

      <p>“Thanks, Fujiyan.” And sorry, as well.</p>

      <p>“I-If you’re going, then I’ll come too’h,” Nina added.</p>

      <p>I was so glad to hear it.</p>

      <p>“Then I shall provide several knights from Roses an—”</p>

      <p>“No, Lady Sophia, they’ll be important if trouble breaks out. I think we should leave the diplomacy to Sir Fujiwara. Look after them, Nina,” Chris added.</p>

      <p>“Right, leave it to me’h!”</p>

      <p>Things had been decided. Sasa, Fujiyan, Nina, and I were headed to a mafia’s HQ.</p>

      <p>I was so nervous...</p>

      <p>The Grand Highland Casino was the largest of its kind in Symphonia. The building emanated a bizarre presence—it looked around ten stories in height, which probably counted as tall in this world, but was far shorter than skyscrapers back in Japan. It even seemed fairly restrained compared to the castle and cathedral. So what stood out about it, you ask?</p>

      <p>The whole building shone in gold.</p>

      <p>Sasa and I stared up in shock.</p>

      <p>“This is one of the places in Symphonia where the most money changes hands,” Fujiyan offered.</p>

      <p>“You can gamble with anything and everything’h,” Nina added, her ears bouncing. <em>Was that what she was here for?</em></p>

      <p>“It’s built in an odd place though, isn’t it?” I asked. The golden building was built into the wall between the sixth and seventh districts, almost punching through it.</p>

      <p>“The interior is considered extraterritorial,” Fujiyan explained. “While there are different entrances for humans and demi-humans, all races mingle inside. Discriminatory remarks are likewise forbidden. In a certain light, one could see it as the most egalitarian place within the city.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, that’s good.” Apparently, enjoying yourself while gambling was unconnected to race.</p>

      <p>“Hey, let’s head inside, Takatsuki, Fujiwara,” Sasa chirped as she ran off. Suddenly, she came to a halt when a bulky black-clad guy caught and stopped her. “Wait, what? No kids? Rude!”</p>

      <p>We approached, and I said, “Umm?” before pulling out and showing him the badge I’d been given.</p>

      <p>“You what?” the burly guy asked. “Oh, is this kid with you gentlemen?”</p>

      <p>“I’m Takatsuki. Peter invited me. Can we go inside?”</p>

      <p>“S-Sir Takatsuki! My apologies! Go right on through!” His behavior visibly changed as he opened the heavy doors and showed us in.</p>

      <p>“Wow!” we exclaimed in unison.</p>

      <p>The carpet was scarlet. There were rows upon rows of slot machines, and I could hear the constant jangle of coins. Dealers were standing in crisp suits at roulette and blackjack tables, and wandering the rest of the floor were...bunny girls...? They were wearing clothes that looked like swimsuits along with garters and fishnet stockings. They were hot! Were their ears real or fake? I glanced at Nina to compare.</p>

      <p>“Mister Takatsuki’h?” she asked.</p>

      <p>“Ah!” She met my eyes and I hurriedly looked away.</p>

      <p><em>Honestly, Makoto. You can’t look at your friend’s wife like that!</em></p>

      <p>Goddess?! You’re misunderstanding!</p>

      <p><em>Reeeaally?</em></p>

      <p>No, I was...at least a little.</p>

      <p>“The bunny girls here are all rabbit beastears,” Fujiyan informed me with a rueful grin.</p>

      <p>“Oh, they look like Nina!” Sasa exclaimed.</p>

      <p>“Lady Nina was in such an outfit when we first met,” he reminisced.</p>

      <p>“What?” Sasa and I exclaimed in unison. Nina had been a bunny girl... He’d <em>bought</em> a bunny girl? <em>You pig! I’m...so jealous.</em></p>

      <p>“M-My, I had not mentioned as much before?”</p>

      <p>“Not to me,” I told him.</p>

      <p>“You perv,” Sasa added to the teasing between us classmates.</p>

      <p>Nina was looking at the games on display with sparkling eyes. If we let her roam, she’d probably end up at one of the tables. Sasa grabbed hold of her before she could wander and tugged her along with us.</p>

      <p>Another suit-wearing member of staff had approached while we’d been chattering. “This way, Sir Takatsuki. I shall guide you to the VIP room.”</p>

      <p>I’d expected him to lead us up a grand staircase or something, but contrary to those expectations, we instead walked into an atrium. There was a place in the room that was surrounded by an iron fence, and a mage was standing there.</p>

      <p>We stepped into the fenced area. “Going up,” the mage announced as the floor started to rise.</p>

      <p><em>I-It’s an elevator?! They’ve used </em>Float<em> to lift us!</em></p>

      <p>That’s just what I’d expect from a world of swords and magic... It was kinda slow, though.</p>

      <p>“Hey, Fujiyan?” I asked quietly.</p>

      <p>“What is it?”</p>

      <p>“Who’s important in the Castor family?” It’d be a good idea to know who to look out for.</p>

      <p>“Well, of course, there is the head of the family, Sir Genoa Castor,” explained Fujiyan. “However, he is likely to be absent today. Due to his influence in the underworld, he very rarely appears publicly. He is also known as ‘Scarface’ due to, well, the scar on his face.”</p>

      <p>“Right, right, who else?” I pressed.</p>

      <p>“The next person would be the eldest son, Sir Jack Castor. I would say he is the most likely to be here today. He is a handsome man with blond hair and a large build. Other than him...”</p>

      <p>While Fujiyan was explaining more about the power dynamics of the Castor family, we arrived at the top floor. The main casino hall on the first floor had felt pretty luxurious, but this...was on another level. It was decorated in refined blacks, and a huge chandelier glittered above us. There was a group of people wearing black suits underneath it, and one of the men, who seemed a bit more playful than the rest, nimbly came over.</p>

      <p>“Hey, Brother!” the man exclaimed. “It’s been too long!”</p>

      <p>“Y-Yeah. Thanks for the invitation, Peter.”</p>

      <p>He’d come over to us with open arms and his attitude was cheery in the same way that Americans were.</p>

      <p>“I’ll introduce you. This is my wonderful family.” He gestured to a lineup of strong-looking guys.</p>

      <p><em>Whoa...it’s a mafia. A real-life mafia...</em></p>

      <p>There were women behind them wearing fancy dresses. Were they like hostesses? The person that drew the most attention was a middle-aged man in the center of the group. He was wearing black clothes alongside expensive-looking accessories. There was a long line of rough skin stretching across his face.</p>

      <p><em>Scarface...? That’s the family’s don.</em> <em>You said he wouldn’t be here, Fujiyan. </em>I glanced at my friend and saw that his expression was frozen.</p>

      <p>He hadn’t expected it either, then.</p>

      <p>With a smile, Peter showed Sasa and me to our seats. Apparently, the “family” that Peter was talking about didn’t mean his blood-related family, but rather the mafia as a whole. I’d heard that mafias formed strong bonds among their followers and that members wouldn’t allow anyone to insult their comrades.</p>

      <p>I’d need to watch my words.</p>

      <p>“So, who are those two, Brother?” Peter asked.</p>

      <p>“They’re my friends, Fujiyan and Nina.”</p>

      <p>“My name is Fujiwara, it is a pleasure to meet you,” Fujiyan greeted.</p>

      <p>“G-Good to meet you. I’m Nina, yes’h.”</p>

      <p>“Nice to meet you. I’m Peter Castor. Come on, take a seat over here.”</p>

      <p>The chairs were just as comfortable as the ones in Highland palace. A friendly blond man who was with the burly mafia guys offered us drinks. Was he the eldest son? To be honest, he just seemed like an amiable person.</p>

      <p>After a moment, the don spoke. “I’m Genoa Castor. Hero, I hear you aided my idiot son.” His voice was low, but it carried well. A man of culture.</p>

      <p>“I-It was nothing much,” I answered. He already knew I was a hero, plus Peter’s dad was super intimidating.</p>

      <p>“Pooooops... I said sorry,” Peter complained, scratching at the back of his head.</p>

      <p>“Today, we’ve tasked our chefs with crafting dinner from the finest ingredients the capital has to offer,” said the blond from earlier. “We have also gathered the best women, so please enjoy yourselves.” He paused for a moment, then seemed to realize something. “Ah, right, I haven’t introduced myself. I’m Jack Castor.”</p>

      <p>So he <em>was</em> the eldest son. The rest of the men started giving their own easy introductions.</p>

      <p>“I’m the best knife guy in the family.”</p>

      <p>“I’m the strongest.”</p>

      <p>“If you want to spot a cheat, leave it to me.”</p>

      <p>“I’ve had more than a hundred women.”</p>

      <p>Their boasts came thick and fast, but I didn’t really mind any of it.</p>

      <p>“I’ve killed a dozen men in fights.”</p>

      <p>“I can crush a guy’s skull in my bare hands...”</p>

      <p>These men were seriously scary. They were definitely the real deal! I hadn’t been great with the “bros” back in high school, so how was I supposed to deal with <em>these</em> guys?! I looked over at Fujiyan and Nina to see they’d stopped eating as well.</p>

      <p>I felt the need to apologize mentally.<em> Sorry, Sasa, I didn’t think I was bringing you somewhere like this...</em></p>

      <p>I used my<em> RPG Player </em>skill to switch perspectives and look her way—</p>

      <p>“Wooow, what’s this? Oh! It’s great!”</p>

      <p>—and she was just enjoying the food like there was no tomorrow. Seriously...she had a stomach of iron, huh?</p>

      <p>Jack had seemed to notice that none of us (apart from Sasa) were eating, so he quickly turned to his family. “You lot! You’re scaring our guests! Enough!” he yelled at his subordinates.</p>

      <p>“Our apologies!” they all cried in unison.</p>

      <p><em>I guess he’s not as friendly as he looks...</em></p>

      <p>“Sorry,” he said, switching back to his genial expression. “Our men are just excited to meet the rumored hero.”</p>

      <p>He sure could change tracks at a moment’s notice...</p>

      <p>“R-Right...” I nodded quietly, stretching my fork out toward the feast before us.</p>

      <p>“Takatsuki, look, look, it’s foie gras!”</p>

      <p>“Sasa, don’t talk with your mouth full,” I scolded.</p>

      <p>The table was loaded with delicacies like caviar along with drinks that you’d never find in the bars we usually visited. Also, every time I emptied my glass, one of the pretty women would instantly refill it.</p>

      <p>I glanced at the girls and got some grins in return. Wow, they showed off even more than Lucy. I just couldn’t settle down.</p>

      <p>“You look all fidgety,” Sasa murmured questioningly.</p>

      <p>“If anything, you’re too calm,” I whispered.</p>

      <p>“Still, I didn’t know you were a hero, Brother!” said Peter, picking up on the trail of conversation. “In the tunnels, you just called yourself an adventurer. You tricked me!”</p>

      <p>“Sorry for hiding it,” I apologized awkwardly, but Peter didn’t seem to mind.</p>

      <p>“That’s a hero?” asked one of the men.</p>

      <p>“I can’t see it,” remarked another.</p>

      <p>“Apparently, he beat the Hero of Lightning, though.”</p>

      <p>“Sir Gerald the Wicked Wolf?”</p>

      <p>“He’s definitely an otherworlder...”</p>

      <p>Judging by the whispers I could hear, heroes were a rare sight, even to the mafia.</p>

      <p>“You beat that Gerald kid, then?” the don asked in his deep voice.</p>

      <p><em>Whoops, I need to pay attention,</em> I thought. This situation required a careful touch—if I remembered right, Gerald’s family, the Ballantines, and the Castor mafia were on good terms.</p>

      <p>“I-It was just luck,” I sputtered.</p>

      <p>“Come on, Brother, you ain’t beating Gerry by chance. Right, Jack?”</p>

      <p>“Indeed, he was the country’s strongest warrior until the Hero of Light came around,” Jack confirmed.</p>

      <p>That’d just been me losing control of my elemental magic! I wanted to explain what’d actually gone down, but would it be taken poorly?! Plus, Jack and Peter seemed close to him... Almost like family. Were nobles and the mafia just two sides of the same coin?</p>

      <p>“We are often consulted when there are those that defy the Ballantine family,” Don Genoa offered quietly.</p>

      <p>There was silence as I tensed up. <em>W-We shouldn’t have come, should we?!</em></p>

      <p>“But Lord Bartolomeo has not said anything on this occasion,” he continued.</p>

      <p>“I-I see.”</p>

      <p>Archduke Bartolomeo Ballantine was the father of the Hero of Lightning—Gerald—in addition to being one of the five Sacred Nobles. He’d been glaring at me during the entire meeting yesterday, so I was pretty sure he hated me...</p>

      <p>“Pops, the Ballantines are a proud family of knights. I heard that Gerald fought the Hero of Roses in a one-on-one bout. They wouldn’t try and get revenge in the shadows like that,” Jack said mildly.</p>

      <p>“I suppose so,” the don answered almost disinterestedly. I just couldn’t relax. His scar was intimidating. Couldn’t magic have healed it?</p>

      <p>As I considered that idea, I felt a tap on my shoulder.</p>

      <p>“My esteemed Tackie,” Fujiyan murmured to me. “Sir Genoa’s scar was something he received in a defeat when he was younger, so it is a taboo topic.”</p>

      <p>“R-Right, I’ll be careful. Thanks, Fujiyan.” I might have ended up slipping otherwise. That’d been seriously close.</p>

      <p>“Hey, that’s some scar you’ve got,” Sasa commented.</p>

      <p><em>Wai—?! Sasa! Why?!</em></p>

      <p>The air seemed to freeze.</p>

      <p>The beautiful women, the black-suited men, and the two Castor sons all clearly twitched. Fujiyan and Nina had both stiffened, and I could only assume I had as well.</p>

      <p>“O-Our apologies’h! Miss Sasaki, apologi—”</p>

      <p>“Say, little miss,” the don said, interrupting Nina.</p>

      <p>Sasa hummed, tilting her head at him.</p>

      <p>“What did you say about my scar?”</p>

      <p>“It’s cool.”</p>

      <p>“Oh?”</p>

      <p>“It’s got real ‘big boss’ vibes!” Sasa grinned among the rest of the stricken faces. Then, as if prompted by that smile, the don grinned as well. It looked terrifying.</p>

      <p>“Oh... And what about you, Hero? What do you think?”</p>

      <p><em>He was asking me now! Should I praise it like Sasa? No...I should go for honesty.</em></p>

      <p>“Uh... Personally, I think it’s kinda scary.”</p>

      <p>The don’s gaze was intense, made all the more so by the scar in question. “I see... Scary?” Inexplicably, he then burst into laughter. The people around us just watched blankly.</p>

      <p>“Did you lot hear that?” the don asked. “The little lady thinks my scar’s cool, and the hero thinks it’s scary. I got this scar when I lost in a fight with another organization,” he explained. “I could’ve had it healed with magic, but I left the wound alone to make sure I never forgot the regret of failure. Since then, I’ve wiped out every person that’s mocked it, and before I knew it, I was the boss of a huge amount of territory...”</p>

      <p>“O-Oh... Th-That’s incredible,” Sasa said with a chagrined expression.</p>

      <p><em>Too laaate!</em></p>

      <p>“But recently, no one’s mentioned it... Subordinates, or my children.”</p>

      <p>Well, yeah, it’d be terrifying to talk about.</p>

      <p>“Hero, why did you call it scary? You could have flattered me the same as the little miss.”</p>

      <p>“Because I’m a coward...” I replied honestly. I didn’t know why, but that prompted a happy look from the don.</p>

      <p>“A coward despite being a hero... Wonderful. In the end, even we survive due to craven cowardice.”</p>

      <p>His actual wording felt like mockery, but that wasn’t at all the impression I got.</p>

      <p>“You’re just the sort of people I like to get along with,” he continued, pouring alcohol into my glass. Considering it was the don filling my glass...I couldn’t refuse, could I?</p>

      <p>“Please wait, Sir Genoa!” Fujiyan interrupted in a fluster.</p>

      <p>“You are the otherworlder Fujiwara, are you not? I have heard of you as well. Apparently, you’re a capable sort.” The don didn’t really seem bothered at the sudden interruption. His sons and the various subordinates all looked nervously at us though.</p>

      <p>“It is an honor to hear,” Fujiyan said after a moment. “Pardon my impertinence, but would partaking of the alcohol you offered mean that my friend would be treated as ‘one of the family’?”</p>

      <p>“You need not worry about that, Fujiwara. The Castor family requires an oath of blood. Exchanging spirits is not our style,” Jack explained.</p>

      <p>“Pardon my rudene—”</p>

      <p>“Though it is sometimes used as an excuse to compel such,” said the don with a grin.</p>

      <p><em>Hey!</em></p>

      <p>“Pops, come on!”</p>

      <p>“Don’t worry, Brother, this ain’t that kinda place.”</p>

      <p>Both Jack and Peter were hurrying to try and reassure me.</p>

      <p>“It’s a joke, just some harmless fun,” the don said before downing his glass of straight spirits. He seemed to be in a good mood.</p>

      <p>“Here, here, Boss!” Sasa exclaimed, refilling his glass. I’m not sure whether it was her being quick-witted or just brave.</p>

      <p>“The Hero of Roses has been the talk of the town as of late,” noted the don. “It is an honor that you would be afraid of me.”</p>

      <p><em>Wait, I’m being talked about that much?</em></p>

      <p>“What kind of talk, by the way?” I asked.</p>

      <p>“The chaos in Horn, of course. While the public story is that Prince Leonardo, the Hero of Ice and Snow, defeated the blight giant, many rumors say that a new otherworld hero was essential to the victory.”</p>

      <p><em>You’ve got an info leak, Princess Sophia.</em></p>

      <p>“I heard that Roses’s heroes get the water goddess Eir’s protection. That’s gotta earn you some special skills, right?” Jack asked interestedly.</p>

      <p>“U-Uh, well...”</p>

      <p>All I had was <em>Water Magic (Low Rank)</em>. Plus, I wasn’t a believer in the water goddess. They sure seemed to think I was, though. It’d be a bother to deny it, so I didn’t.</p>

      <p>“Don’t ask too much,” the don instructed his son. “You’ll put him off.”</p>

      <p>So he was a nice guy after all. All right, time to ask about it. “We were actually in the tunnels looking for the Snake Sect. Do you know anything about them?”</p>

      <p>“Oh?”</p>

      <p>“You were, Brother?”</p>

      <p>All of their faces sharpened slightly.</p>

      <p>“Allow me to explain,” Fujiyan offered, before launching into an explanation of the events in Roses.</p>

      <p>“I see, so Symphonia is their next target,” the don mused with his hand to his chin.</p>

      <p>“I haven’t seen them...” Jack began, “but there has been more weed circulating around lately.”</p>

      <p>“It’s not just in the ninth district either,” Peter added. “The seventh and eighth are the same. In fact, weed’s going for half the normal price. Maybe there’s a link.”</p>

      <p>So there <em>was</em> more weed being traded—considering that it was a source of revenue for the Snake Sect, they were likely pulling the strings somewhere.</p>

      <p>“Are they selling it to raise extra funds for the war’h?” Nina asked.</p>

      <p>“There’s no sign that the Snake Sect is buying weapons though, Lady Nina,” Fujiyan answered. “Currently the most predominant buyers of weapons are beastmen.”</p>

      <p>“Tying into the rumors of rebellion,” the don murmured.</p>

      <p>“You’ve heard them?” I asked.</p>

      <p>“We know all the influentials in the seventh and eighth districts,” Jack said with a conflicted look. “We can investigate.”</p>

      <p>“We’ll let you know if we find anything. Though, not for free,” Peter grinned at me.</p>

      <p>“The Fujiwara Firm will buy any such information, Sir Peter,” Fujiyan declared.</p>

      <p>“Oh! Then I look forward to your patronage.”</p>

      <p>After that heavy topic of conversation, there was a period of general chatting, and then the event came to a close.<br/><br/></p>

      <p>We all stretched broadly as we left the VIP room and began to head back to the inn.</p>

      <p>“That was nerve-racking,” I said, sighing out.</p>

      <p>“A little, yes,” Fujiyan replied.</p>

      <p>“I’ve got the shakes’h,” Nina added.</p>

      <p>Then, Sasa let out a sigh of her own. “The food was great.”</p>

      <p>The rest of us exchanged glances. Only Sasa seemed to have a different perspective on that dinner...</p>

      <p>“So, what are we doing now?” I asked Fujiyan.</p>

      <p>“Personally, I will be investigating matters in the capital. The apparent increase in sales of weed is concerning.”</p>

      <p>Nina would probably aid him. I felt bad about foisting that task off on just the two of them, but Sasa and I were rank amateurs at information gathering, so she and I just headed back to the inn.</p>

      <p>The next morning, I checked in with both Princess Sophia and Fujiyan, getting updates on all the latest info.</p>

      <p>On Princess Sophia’s end, the Temple Knights had eradicated all of the undead from underground, and the apparent ringleaders of the beastman rebellion had been apprehended. There <em>were</em> monsters around the city that the Snake Sect could probably control, but the capital had formidable defenses, so they likely wouldn’t be an issue.</p>

      <p>The next few days passed peacefully...but then, Sakurai turned up to see us.</p>
