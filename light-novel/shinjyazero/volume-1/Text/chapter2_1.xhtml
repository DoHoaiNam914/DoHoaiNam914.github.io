      <p>“You needn’t be so formal, Hero of Roses. You’re both older and more highly stationed than I.”</p>

      <p>I couldn’t help but let out a slight sigh. Being all buddy-buddy with her felt a bit awkward since she was so intense.</p>

      <p>“To answer your question, it will likely take around two days.”</p>

      <p><em>Two days? That feels really quick for traveling to a completely different country. </em>Well, I suppose we could go “as the pegasus flies” so it was quicker. But still...</p>

      <p>“It’s Lucy’s home, so would it be worth asking her to guide us?” I asked.</p>

      <p>“There is no need. The village is home to the country’s strongest fighter, Rosalie J. Walker, so we know where it is.”</p>

      <p>Well, that must be how things were. It wasn’t that surprising, but apparently, Lucy’s mom was a real big shot. Especially if she was the strongest fighter in the country. Although, according to Lucy, she apparently spent a lot of her time traveling—Lucy hadn’t seen her in years. It was fairly unlikely she’d be in Canaan.</p>

      <p>Our official goal—if Rosalie wasn’t there—was to give our greetings to the Hero of Springrogue and their priestess. And also...to investigate the disturbance in the Forest of Fiends.</p>

      <p>The Snake Sect was apparently up to no good—we had to reveal their plans and ruin them if they planned to harm Roses or Springrogue. That meant...we had a lot to do. Still, until we arrived in Canaan, we were free.</p>

      <p><em>What to do... </em>I was idly considering how to occupy my time when Janet yelled, “All units, change course!” This was about the tenth time it’d happened.</p>

      <p>“Monsters again?” I asked.</p>

      <p>“Indeed. There is a dragon ahead, so we are avoiding it.”</p>

      <p>I couldn’t see it at all, and not even my <em>Scout</em> skill was reacting. Apparently, Janet’s version of the skill could scout several kilometers ahead. It made sense—she’d have to be fairly impressive to lead the knights at her age.</p>

      <p>After that, the journey continued the same way for another half a day, and we managed to avoid all monsters as we flew into Springrogue.<br/><br/></p>

      <p>“Let’s make camp here,” Janet instructed, trying to get everyone settled before it grew too dark. A mage put up a barrier to ward off monsters while the others got supplies and food ready for cooking. Sasa set about helping with that.</p>

      <p><em>What should I do?</em></p>

      <p>“Is there anything I can help with?” I asked.</p>

      <p>“There is not. You can rest over there.”</p>

      <p>“R-Right...” I was just in the way! I crouched over in a corner and waited for the food to be ready.</p>

      <p>“Makoto, well done on the journey.” Prince Leonardo smiled and came to sit next to me. “You looked rather relaxed, especially since it was your first time traveling on a pegasus.”</p>

      <p>“I was just sitting in the back, so it was a pretty easy trip.” Honestly, I’d just spent my time either looking at the back of Janet’s head or the forest below.</p>

      <p>“That’s incredible! Usually, people get tired when they ride pegasi or wyverns because of the fear. I was terrified the first time. Lucy and Fuuri both seem tired as well.”</p>

      <p>I looked over at them.</p>

      <p>“The ground’s so calming...” Lucy muttered. “The sky is scary.”</p>

      <p>“How unsightly. I can’t even move from tiredness...after riding a pegasus of all things...”</p>

      <p>The pair were slumped over. Like me, neither of them had ever traveled on a pegasus before.</p>

      <p>Sasa, on the other hand...</p>

      <p>“The plates are ready. I got the firewood prepared as well.”</p>

      <p>“M-Miss Sasaki?! You don’t even have an axe?!”</p>

      <p>The knights were shocked. At least Sasa was energetic. Twi was on her shoulder, waiting for food.</p>

      <p>“Otherworlders are incredible,” the prince said, watching with sparkling eyes.</p>

      <p><em>It’s probably a different reason for her than for me, though. </em>Sasa was both an otherworlder <em>and</em> a lamia, so she had ridiculous stamina. Half a day on a pegasus would be nothing for her.</p>

      <p>What about me, then? I guess I was faring well in part because of <em>Calm Mind</em>. The rest was probably due to the perspective shift from <em>RPG Player</em>.</p>

      <p>Being so high up without a lifeline for so long would normally make you more scared. However, the only feedback <em>I </em>had was that the scenery’d been pretty.</p>

      <p><em>I think I might be losing my sense of danger...</em></p>

      <p>Not feeling excessive fear was useful, but like Noah had said, I needed to not deliberately jump into danger. I was going to the Forest of Fiends because of a revelation from Eir, so I should be careful.</p>

      <p>“Makoto Takatsuki,” Janet called. Her eyes were sharp and her hair still shone. It was probably due to commanding the Pegasus Knights, but she didn’t look tired at all.</p>

      <p>“Thanks for your work today,” I told her.</p>

      <p>“You seem accustomed to riding pegasi,” she said.</p>

      <p>“What? This was the first time. It was fun, though.” It’d actually gotten boring for the second half.</p>

      <p>She paused for a moment, then said, “I see...” Her expression showed that she wanted to say something else as she looked down at me.</p>

      <p>“Is...something wrong?” I asked.</p>

      <p>“I heard you defeated the ancient dragon with a single strike, all after defending Macallan from the monster stampede.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, that?” Had she heard about it from Princess Sophia? Or maybe someone from the guild? “Thanks to everyone from the guild, we managed to protect the town.”</p>

      <p>“Your accomplishments were reported to Highland. I suppose that will raise your worth.” Her tone was biting.</p>

      <p>I sighed. Was she unhappy that I’d gotten kudos because she liked her brother so much?</p>

      <p>Apparently, though, that wasn’t the case.</p>

      <p>“My father and brother asked if I was willing to join our family with yours.”</p>

      <p>Prince Leonardo and I couldn’t help but exchange looks. <em>Join families as in...get married?</em></p>

      <p>“No! Makoto is my sister’s fiancé!” the prince exclaimed. He stood in between us like he was protecting me.</p>

      <p>Janet snorted at that. “Princess Sophia said the same thing. Well, I don’t have any intention of becoming your wi—”</p>

      <p>“Takatsuki! I got these fruits in the forest! Here you go☆” Sasa hugged me from behind and pushed an apple-looking fruit to my mouth. The taste was a mix of sweet and sour. Apparently, even the <em>fruits</em> from the Great Forest were full of mana.</p>

      <p>“Tasty?” she asked.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, it is.”</p>

      <p>“Then I’ll have some too!”</p>

      <p>“Hey!” <em>What am I, a poison tester?</em></p>

      <p>She looked teasingly at me as she crunched through the same place I’d bitten... She didn’t <em>need</em> to do that. I couldn’t help but be slightly embarrassed.</p>

      <p>“Makotooooo.”</p>

      <p>“C-Come on, Lucy.” She’d been lying down because of the air sickness but had pushed herself over to me. I’d already told her to take it easy.</p>

      <p>“I want some water,” she said, looking up at me pitifully.</p>

      <p>“Right, right.”</p>

      <p>Ah well. As I spoke, I pulled out my canteen and poured some into a cup.</p>

      <p>“Mouth-to-mouth would have been nice,” she complained.</p>

      <p>“What?” Seriously, what was she thinking?</p>

      <p>“Lu, that sounded like something silly to me,” Sasa said.</p>

      <p>“Makoto, Hero of Roses,” came a cold voice. Janet was looking at me like I was something on the bottom of her shoe. “You have a fiancée but are playing around with other women like this...quite daring, I must say.”</p>

      <p>“Ah, well, you see...”</p>

      <p>“Who in the world would marry someone like you...?” She didn’t listen to anything I had to say and quickly stalked off.</p>

      <p>“That was close,” Lucy said. “He almost got another fiancée.”</p>

      <p>“Sophie was right. Takatsuki does stuff like that super quick.”</p>

      <p>“What’s with you two?” I asked. What exactly were they going on about?</p>

      <p>The two high-fived and gave a cheer, though even Prince Leonardo looked unhappy.</p>

      <p><em>Is it because I didn’t properly turn her down since I’m marrying his sister? </em>Was <em>I</em> in the wrong? No, I wasn’t trying to get more fiancées...</p>

      <p>After all that, we ate dinner and retired to our tents. The prince and I were sharing one, and I couldn’t really sleep since he was holding on to me.</p>

      <p>We continued flying through the sky the next day, and eventually, we arrived at a small settlement. At a glance, it just looked like more of the same thickly growing trees that made up the rest of the forest. However, I could see thatched roofing peeking through the canopy every so often.</p>

      <p>This was one of hundreds and hundreds of villages where elves and beastmen lived, and those many villages were collectively referred to as Springrogue—this meant that there was no central town that could be referred to as a capital. Instead, the people of Springrogue formed small communities, living alongside the forest. It also seemed like there was a barrier around the settlement itself that repelled attention, making it hard to actually notice until you were nearby.</p>

      <p>The pegasi landed close to our destination and we headed toward the village’s entrance.</p>

      <p>“It’s been so long!” Lucy exclaimed, rushing toward the settlement.</p>

      <p>There was a simple gate blocking the entrance, and someone was on guard duty. That elf looked at Lucy in shock.</p>

      <p>“I’m back!” she cheered.</p>

      <p>“Lucy?!” the guard replied. “Welcome home! You doing good?”</p>

      <p><em>Those two must know each other.</em> After exchanging greetings with Lucy, the guard looked toward the rest of us. “So, who are these people?” he asked.</p>

      <p>“They’re my party members—I teamed up with them in Roses. Oh, and also some knights from Highland. We came to see mama.”</p>

      <p>“Actually...mom hasn’t been back for a year,” the other elf explained with a slightly awkward look.</p>

      <p>Hang on... <em>Mom?</em></p>

      <p>But the guy continued talking before I could start unpacking that. “You made friends abroad though! Lucy, you haven’t been too pushy, have you?”</p>

      <p>“Hey!” Lucy griped. “Just because you’re the older brother doesn’t mean you can treat me like a kid!”</p>

      <p><em>Say what?! I thought they just knew each other, but they’re actually siblings?!</em></p>

      <p>He laughed. “We were worried about you, though. At least you look like you’re doing well.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah.” Lucy nodded. “Anyway, see you later.”</p>

      <p>“Make sure you go see grandpa first!” he called out.</p>

      <p>“I know already!” Lucy yelled as she passed him.</p>

      <p>“H-Hey, Lucy?” I stammered. “Shouldn’t I say hi as well?” If they were family, shouldn’t I be properly introducing myself? I hadn’t even given my name.</p>

      <p>“Hmmm...later. Grandpa’s the village chief, so we should talk to him first. Prince Leonardo, Janet, is that okay with you?”</p>

      <p>“I do not mind,” the prince answered.</p>

      <p>“I have no objections,” Janet replied. “After all, he is Johnnie Walker’s son, a hero of Springrogue.”</p>

      <p>“Then I’ll show you the way.” With that, Lucy picked up the pace a bit. Since it was an elf village, the people we came across were all elves. I did find something a bit odd, though...</p>

      <p>“Oh, you’re back, Lucy,” said an elf as we passed. She looked like a more grown-up version of Lucy.</p>

      <p>“Sure am, sis. Is grandpa in?”</p>

      <p>“He is, yes. We were all worried about you! You could at least have written.”</p>

      <p>“Whatever.”</p>

      <p>“Yo, Lucy,” gruffed a burly elf who was swinging a sword. “You brought guests?”</p>

      <p>“Yup.”</p>

      <p>At one point, a dandy-looking elf came up to Janet. “Oh, you’re a beauty, miss knight. Want me to show you around the village?” In response, Janet leveled him with a glare.</p>

      <p>“Hey!” Lucy said in a chastising tone. “You’re supposed to be my big brother, so act like it! She’s a noble from Highland—no hitting on her!”</p>

      <p>The next target was Prince Leonardo. An elf wearing even more revealing clothes than Lucy came up to him and said, “What a cutie. Want to come and play with big sister over here?”</p>

      <p>“That’s the prince of Roses!” exclaimed Lucy. “No seducing him!”</p>

      <p>“Oh! Are you Lucy’s friend?” another elf, who was about Lucy’s age, asked Sasa. “You have an impressive aura.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I’m Lu’s best friend, Aya Sasaki.”</p>

      <p>“Oh my! An otherworlder as well, perhaps? I’m her big sister, nice to meet you.”</p>

      <p>“Nice to meet you too,” Sasa replied.</p>

      <p>A few moments later, another elf struck up a conversation, this time, with Furiae. “What beauty I behold. What would your name be, my lovely princess?”</p>

      <p>“And who are you supposed to be?” Furiae asked.</p>

      <p>“Oooh, that cold tone is just as wonderful! Would you like to eat dinner with me tonight?”</p>

      <p>“What?”</p>

      <p>“No!” Lucy squawked in protest.</p>

      <p><em>Just how many flirts did this village have?!</em></p>

      <p>On another note...</p>

      <p>“Say, Sasa?” I asked.</p>

      <p>“She already told me,” Sasa replied, cutting me off.</p>

      <p><em>Time to switch targets. </em>“Hey, Lucy?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah...I know what you want to say...”</p>

      <p><em>Guess I’ll ask anyway.</em></p>

      <p>“You have quite a few siblings, don’t you?” Pretty much everyone we’d passed had been an older sibling of hers, and we’d already seen about a dozen people. “How many do you have?”</p>

      <p>There was a <em>long</em> pause.</p>

      <p>“I’m the fiftieth,” she replied, looking away.</p>

      <p>“Uh? Wha?”</p>

      <p>“My mother’s got a big case of wanderlust, so she ends up getting married on her journeys, along with getting divorced and having kids. Then she brings her children back to the village... Though I guess I’m one of them anyway,” she said with a slight laugh.</p>

      <p>“I’d heard that the Crimson Witch had many children, but...” Janet murmured.</p>

      <p>“Th-That’s amazing...” Prince Leonardo sputtered.</p>

      <p>Both of them were seriously surprised, so it must have been something that only Lucy’s immediate family knew.</p>

      <p>“And I thought four brothers was a lot back in my old world,” Sasa remarked.</p>

      <p>“I was an only child,” I added, exchanging a glance with her. Lucy’s family was just...on another level.</p>

      <p>“Also...” Sasa continued, her expression darkening. “All my siblings in this world died...”</p>

      <p>“Sasa...” I didn’t know what else to say to her. Talking about family had obviously brought back some painful memories.</p>

      <p>“Aya!” Lucy cried, hugging her. “Makoto and I are with you! We’re your family!”</p>

      <p>“Lu... You’re right! We need to make sure it’s a nice family as well!” Sasa replied, returning the hug before turning to look at me. “Takatsuki, I want five children.”</p>

      <p>“What?! You want that many?” Lucy asked. “Then I want six!”</p>

      <p><em>Aren’t we getting a bit ahead of ourselves here?</em></p>

      <p>“Everyone...let’s carry on,” the prince said, lightly scolding us.</p>

      <p>We all chorused an agreement. This honestly wasn’t the kind of conversation to be having in front of a nine-year-old anyway.</p>

      <p>“The big roots you can see over there make up the village chief’s house,” Lucy said, pointing. My eyes followed her finger and I soon spotted a huge wooden mansion.</p>

      <p>As I looked on, an elf woman stepped out of the house.</p>

      <p>“It’s been a while, Lucy,” she remarked.</p>

      <p>“Florna! Yes, it’s been <em>too</em> long!”</p>

      <p>This must have been another of her sisters. Florna had beautiful silver hair and green eyes, along with a gentle smile.</p>

      <p>“I’ll introduce you, Makoto,” Lucy said. “This is our priestess.”</p>

      <p><em>Whoa... Springrogue’s priestess just walked out right in front of us.</em></p>
