      <h1>Chapter 8: Makoto Takatsuki Awakens</h1>

      <p>I stirred awake in my goddess’s space.</p>

      <p>“Hiii☆ Good job, Mako.”</p>

      <p>Eir was waving at me with a completely open smile.</p>

      <p>“Thanks...Eir.”</p>

      <p>Why was she speaking to me before my own goddess? She had a conflicted look on her face, and she stood with her arms crossed.</p>

      <p>“Makoto...”</p>

      <p>Kneeling on the ground before her, I said, “I stopped the revival without getting hurt. Thank you for the armor spell.”</p>

      <p>However, her expression didn’t clear.</p>

      <p>“I’m sorry,” she replied. “You were forced into fighting against a threat to Springrogue...and you even had to use your lifespan. You shouldn’t have needed to go that far.”</p>

      <p>Maybe it was weighing on her mind.</p>

      <p>“Well, it all turned out okay in the end,” I assured her. “My friends are safe, and Lucy’s home didn’t take any losses. Although, I did get petrified... Am I gonna be okay?”</p>

      <p>Surely it meant I was dead...right?</p>

      <p>“It won’t be a problem,” she told me. “Furiae’s lifting the curse from each of the fighters. The priests are helping, but as the Priestess of the Moon, she’s on another level. In fact, she’s already freed several dozen people.”</p>

      <p>Huh. It’d definitely been the right call to leave her behind. Seriously, though, Setekh. Don’t you know the meaning of the word restraint?</p>

      <p>My goddess, who was also in the room, spoke next. “On another note... <em>Eir</em>.” Noah’s neck pivoted so she could glare at the other deity.</p>

      <p>“Oh, little old me?”</p>

      <p>“Use your own hero already,” Noah complained, advancing on Eir. “You just keep pushing everything onto Makoto!”</p>

      <p>“W-Weeeelll. I mean, I feel bad, but there <em>are</em> reasons...”</p>

      <p>I quickly butted into the conversation before it could devolve further than Eir guiltily avoiding Noah’s gaze. “I had fun, so I don’t really mind.”</p>

      <p>Both of them uttered noises of confusion and turned to me.</p>

      <p>“F-Fun, Mako?”</p>

      <p>“You’re incorrigible...”</p>

      <p>I’d gotten to meet Springrogue’s hero and see Lucy’s mother absolutely wrecking shit up close. On top of that, I’d even spoken to the demon lord. Definitely a worthwhile adventure.</p>

      <p>“Noah,” Eir said after a moment. “Mako’s a bit weird, isn’t he?”</p>

      <p>“He’s got no sense of danger. What kind of deviant’s <em>happy</em> about meeting a demon lord?”</p>

      <p>Hey, I didn’t put in all that work just to be called a deviant!</p>

      <p>I decided to ignore her comment, and instead, I recalled the conversation with Bifrons. “Eir, you reincarnated that soul I offered you, right?” I asked. Creatures sacrificed to the gods through that “offering” technique were reincarnated by the Sacred Deities.</p>

      <p>“Right!” Eir cheered cutely. “A strong demon makes a strong warrior☆ You can’t go wasting that. Sciulli’s now a wonderful hero.”</p>

      <p>I sighed. “Well, I can appreciate Roses getting stronger out of the deal...”</p>

      <p>Frankly, <em>me</em> being their strongest fighter put Roses in a pretty bad position. Did that mean Sciulli would end up as a colleague of mine in the future?</p>

      <p>“Anyway, can a soul actually be purified so quickly between two extreme alignments?” Noah wondered.</p>

      <p>Soul purification? How did that work?</p>

      <p>“What do you mean, Noah?” I asked.</p>

      <p>“Well, demon souls are stained with ‘unholy’ protection. Converting that into a hero’s soul with <em>holy</em> protection would probably lead to some instability.”</p>

      <p>That’s my goddess, all right. She knows everything.</p>

      <p>“Usually, souls are purified gradually...” she continued. “Making the change so quickly means the resulting hero will probably go mad fairly quickly.”</p>

      <p>“What?” <em>That</em> hadn’t been what I’d expected to hear.</p>

      <p>I looked at Eir in shock. She was smiling happily. “Hmm, well...” she remarked casually. “It is pretty likely.”</p>

      <p>“That’s in poor taste,” said Noah.</p>

      <p>“It’s not like there’s much of a choice. We don’t have a ton of fighting power... We’ve only got like a fifty percent chance of winning against the demons.”</p>

      <p><em>Wha?</em></p>

      <p>“Don’t be an idiot. You can’t leak the future in front of Makoto.”</p>

      <p>“Don’t worry about it. Your barrier means the Sacred Deities can’t peep down here.” Eir let out a giggle. “It’s perfect for secret conversations.”</p>

      <p>The revelations just hadn’t stopped coming. But, there was one thing that stuck out in my mind more than anything else.</p>

      <p>“Eir, the other races are pretty likely to lose against the demons?” I asked.</p>

      <p>“Yup. At least, according to Ira. The future isn’t fixed, though, so who knows what’ll happen.”</p>

      <p>“That’s why you’re getting fighters ready...in case the war’s lost,” Noah concluded. “But, making powerful heroes now... There still isn’t enough time.”</p>

      <p>“So, Mako, make sure you keep offering up strong demons☆ That way we can at least launch a counterattack if we lose. I can probably manage five or so usable heroes in time, but the rest’ll go mad and die.”</p>

      <p>I was lost for words. Eir was blackhearted! Hell, <em>she</em> was closer to being the wicked deity than Noah.</p>

      <p>“Sh-Should you really be treating lives so lightly?” It probably counted as disrespectful, but I felt my voice taking on an almost censuring tone.</p>

      <p>Eir’s expression didn’t change. She wore an easygoing smile as she answered quietly, “It’s fine. After all, we rule this world.”</p>

      <p>Her eyes were affectionate as she spoke—affectionate chips of ice. Her smile was how you might watch ants marching across the ground. That was the difference between humans and gods—it was a vast, impassable gulf between us.</p>

      <p>“Tch...” Noah tutted, crossing her arms and scowling. “Makoto, you should wash your hands of Roses. After all, you’re only a State-Authorized Hero, so you can just run off.”</p>

      <p>“Well, it’s not like I have anywhere else to go.” Strictly speaking, I could head for Highland and Sakurai, but the class divide was a bit much for me.</p>

      <p>“Where’d you get that idea?” Noah demanded. “You just saved Springrogue. Freya, Maximilian, and Rosalie are all going to be on your side. You and the others should move there. You can break it off with Eir’s priestess at the same time.”</p>

      <p>Noah was flitting from topic to topic... But besides that, wasn’t she the one that had told me to get close to Sophia in the first place?</p>

      <p>“H-Hey, you can’t do that! Sophie’ll be beside herself!” Eir exclaimed, flustered and suddenly panicking.</p>

      <p>“Hah! That’s what you get for using my Makoto!”</p>

      <p>“M-Mako! I’ll work in good faith with you from now on, so at least don’t drop the betrothal...if that would be acceptable...”</p>

      <p>She’d gone <em>that</em> far<em> </em>in the other direction...?! I scratched at my cheek and thought it over. <em>The betrothal’s only a verbal agreement so far. Don’t I need to sign something...?</em></p>

      <p>“I’ll keep working as a hero...and as for Princess Sophia—” I was about to say that the relationship wouldn’t change, but I suddenly stopped.</p>

      <p><em>Eir seemed kind at first, but she has this wicked side too... Could her priestess be the same way?</em></p>

      <p>“Wait, Mako! You’ve got it all wrong! Sophie’s <em>actually</em> pure, unlike me!”</p>

      <p>Ah, she was reading my mind again. Also, she’d definitely said, “unlike me.”</p>

      <p>“She’s not <em>my</em> disciple, so I can’t say for sure...but she’s probably fine,” Noah said. “Disciples don’t necessarily follow their goddesses in terms of poor personality. Eir’s facade is so perfect that even her followers are taken in.”</p>

      <p>Eir gave a pout. “That’s mean. Makoto, you know she prays to me every night about you, right? She’s super cute, so you look after her, you hear?”</p>

      <p>“Should you really be telling me that...?” I didn’t know how I’d look Sophia in the eyes the next time we met.</p>

      <p>“I’ll keep supporting you behind the scenes. ’Kay?! I’m the goddess of water after all! We fit perfectly together.”</p>

      <p>“Just don’t lie so much,” I told her. Not that I’d be able to really trust Eir again. Though, I suppose Noah had hidden her status as a wicked deity at first...so she’s just the same!</p>

      <p>“Makoto?!” I ignored Noah’s searching look.</p>

      <p>Suddenly, my vision began to blur, and I heard Eir say, “Oh. Furiae’s broken the curse on you. You should be waking up pretty soon.”</p>

      <p>“Oh. I wanted to talk for a bit longer.” Particularly about the war. The heroes would be fighting no matter what, and I...wasn’t entirely happy battling in a war we’d probably lose.</p>

      <p>My sight of the two goddesses got hazier as I considered that. I was almost awake.</p>

      <p>“Oh! Freya’s message!” Eir exclaimed, though I only faintly heard it. “She said thanks and that she’s grateful!”</p>

      <p>My vision then went black, and I passed out.</p>

      <p class="centerp section-marking">◇</p>

      <p>Something was scraping my face. I cracked my eyes open and saw Twi licking me. After a moment of orienting myself, I murmured, “Morning, Twi.”</p>

      <p><em>I must’ve worried her.</em></p>

      <p>“Oh, Mr. Statue Hero, you’re awake?”</p>

      <p>No sooner had I opened my eyes than I was greeted by a gorgeous voice regaling me with decidedly less gorgeous sentiments. It belonged to a woman with glossy black hair, almost silken white skin, and the looks of a refined noble. Furiae.</p>

      <p>“Princess... Good morning.”</p>

      <p>“It took minutes to fix the elves and knights, but a whole week for you,” she complained, giving me a light slap. “Do you not understand what <em>zero</em> resistance means?”</p>

      <p>“I can’t help it. My level goes up, but my stats don’t at all.” I tried to sit up and noticed that my body felt like lead. It was similar to when I’d had a cold and a 39-degree fever.</p>

      <p><em>Wh-Wha?</em></p>

      <p>“Just lie back. You’re not fully healed yet.” She pushed me down onto something soft.</p>

      <p><em>Um? Actually, considering that she’s looking at me from above and to the side... The position we’re in...</em></p>

      <p>I used <em>RPG Player</em>’s altered perspective to check and saw...that my head was in her lap.</p>

      <p><em>Th-This is kinda embarrassing...</em></p>

      <p>“Nah, I feel fine,” I insisted, heaving myself up.</p>

      <p>“Oh, are you feeling shy, my knight? Well, I suppose anyone would be, seeing the most beautiful face in the world. Hurry up and fall for the charm,” she teased.</p>

      <p><em>Most beautiful in the world, huh...</em></p>

      <p>I cast my thoughts back to the two goddesses I’d just dreamed of. They were visions of beauty beyond humanity. <em>Hmm, if you set them side by side with humans... </em>Honestly, even Furiae seemed plain in comparison.</p>

      <p>“What’s with that face?” she asked suspiciously.</p>

      <p>“Just thinking that you always look beautiful,” I replied flatly.</p>

      <p>“Hey! I don’t like your tone there!” She smacked me again, and Twi raced off somewhere as she raised her voice. “That sympathetic look is annoying me!”</p>

      <p>“Ow! Hold on! Ouch! That hurts!” Considering my stats and the fact that she was a priestess (the pinnacle of humanity), those punches were painful!</p>

      <p>She didn’t stop, though. “You’re not getting away with it! You took the mage and warrior but left me—and <em>only</em> me—behind. And <em>then</em> you had the gall to come back as a statue!”</p>

      <p>“Well, you were worried, right? Thanks, Princess.”</p>

      <p>“Shut up! Quiet! I’m coming with you next time!”</p>

      <p>“Nah, that ain’t happening.” I could hardly take a priestess onto the battlefield.</p>

      <p><em>I </em>do<em> feel bad for worrying her, though.</em></p>

      <p>She kept hitting me, and I did my best to calm her down. At that moment, I made a promise to myself that I’d be less reckless from now on.</p>

      <p>I’d also just woken up, so my mind wasn’t totally sharp yet. That was<em> </em>why I didn’t notice another person approaching.</p>

      <p>“You seem to be enjoying yourself, Hero Makoto,” Princess Sophia stated, looking coldly down at me.</p>
