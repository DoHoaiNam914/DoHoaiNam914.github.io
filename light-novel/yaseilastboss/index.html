Now, Lufas, Dina, and Aries are headed towards…Lufas’ grave?! Lufas’ next target, the Grave of the Black-Winged King, is guarded by Libra of the Scales, one of Lufas’ faithful subjects. But regaining this member of the Twelve Heavenly Stars won’t be simple. Though many adventurers have tried to raid Lufas’ grave in the last two hundred years, none have ever returned alive… But there are still many of the Twelve Heavenly Stars to welcome back into the fold. Who else waits for our deposed King? Maybe another one of the Seven Heroes…?!</p>

When word reaches Lufas of the beastfolk’s hunting festival, she and her Twelve Heavenly Stars set out for beastfolk territory. This seems to be just the opportunity Lufas was looking for. Once there, Virgo—newest member of the Twelve Heavenly Stars, second-generation “Maiden”, and in desperate need of a confidence boost—is entered into the festival. But there’s another group participating as well... The existence of a mysterious elixir is also revealed, and someone’s put out a request to retrieve it from a sacred mountain. By whose hand was this legendary remedy which can heal all wounds and illnesses created? Will the other former members of the Twelve Heavenly Stars come back peacefully? Or are there more unexpected events in store for Lufas?!</p>

Will Lufas’ true power finally awaken during this long-awaited battle to the death? Meanwhile, Leon—one of the Twelve Heavenly Stars who hasn’t yet returned to the fold—is up to something, and the demihumans seem to be on his side of the brewing war against the rest of humanity. But Leon is the strongest of the Twelve Heavenly Stars. Without Lufas, will the other Stars be enough to stop him on their own? The hero’s party, along with Virgo and Castor, head to Sagittarius’ homeland, the centaurs’ village, in an attempt to discover why the normally even-tempered former Star is acting so out of character.

Terra, Prince of the Devilfolk, has made moves of his own, asking Pollux for help in creating avatars for he and Luna’s inhuman selves to inhabit. Before anything comes of that though, the Goddess steps in, possessing Pollux. Meanwhile, Lufas and the hero’s party arrive in Laegjarn, a town in Laevateinn. Things aren’t as innocent as they seem, however, and Lufas soons finds herself on a new, unexpected adventure. What will happen when the Goddess summons one of Lufas’s former companions? Will Pollux be able to free herself from the Goddess’s control?</p>

Things are never easy when trying to get another of the Twelve Stars back into the fold though, and from now on, the ouroboroses are in play. Meanwhile, Dina’s nowhere to be found! After getting a little advice from the Devil King, our deposed king finally realizes Dina isn’t in Mizgarz at all, and this might not be the first time they’ve met. She’s waiting in modern Japan!

All of the Twelve Heavenly Stars have finally been gathered, and the board is set. The final battle for the survival of Mizgarz has begun! The enemy (last boss)? The Goddess Alovenus, who created the world. Meanwhile, Dina and a very familiar golem are manipulated by the Goddess. It was clear the two would be used as enemies eventually, so instead of being surprised, Lufas is filled with determination. She isn’t going to kindly ask the Goddess for their safe return. She’ll just steal them back!</p>

When Lufas regained her memories, the Goddess Alovenus awoke the remaining ouroboroses and began the end of the world. However, the Twelve Heavenly Stars, the Seven Heroes, and the devilfolk joined forces to defeat the ouroboroses. Now, it’s only Lufas, Benetnasch, and the Devil King Orm facing down Alovenus as the universe crumbles around them. But Lufas knows something even the Goddess herself has nearly forgotten. Despite her divine abilities, something doesn’t quite add up, and Lufas has the answer. With her secret out, a battle for the universe is underway as Alovenus finally sees Lufas as a true enemy and not simply a nuisance to be dealt with. How will the battle play out? Will Lufas win? Or will Alovenus defeat her and build a brand new universe to start this entire cycle once again?</p>
