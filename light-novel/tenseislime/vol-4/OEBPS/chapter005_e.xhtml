<p>“Thanks, but I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure? If you find you’re in over your head, be sure to tell me as soon as possible, all right?”</p>
<p>I appreciated the concern, but come on—these are children we’re dealing with.</p>
<p>Such were my thoughts as I kicked off the first day of class.</p>
<p>“Hey, guys! I’m in charge of you all starting today—”</p>
<p>My friendly greeting was immediately countered with the slash of a flaming sword.</p>
<p>“Sweet! Nice one, Ken!”</p>
<p>“Is that your finisher? It’s all done now?!”</p>
<p>“Kinda weak in the end. It didn’t even land!”</p>
<p>Without a shred of concern for me, the children carried on, clearly seeing me as the enemy.</p>
<p><em>Um, I thought these kids had, like, barely any time left to live? ’Cause they’re looking crazy healthy right now! A little too healthy!</em> The blackboard behind me was now in flames, cut into two pieces. <em>Hoo boy. Kids these days—what’s gotten into them? Why, back in my day…</em></p>
<p>Already, these kids were making me sound like a crotchety old man. I thought about throwing in the towel right there. <em>We aren’t on Earth, right? Nobody’s gonna complain if I toss out a little corporal punishment, will they?</em></p>
<p>Before me were five children, the “summons” Yuuki had gathered from assorted nations. They were:</p>
<p class="ul_f">Kenya Misaki: male, age ten</p>
<p class="ul_m">Ryota Sekiguchi: male, age ten</p>
<p class="ul_m">Gail Gibson: male, age eleven</p>
<p class="ul_m">Alice Rondo: female, age nine</p>
<p class="ul_l">Chloe Aubert: female, age ten</p>
<p class="space-break">They were still grade-school age, but I guess they packed a punch. With Shizu building them up, I was liable to get hurt if I went easy on them.</p>
<p>Honestly, I wasn’t expecting this. I thought they’d be a little more obedient. Watching the children as they returned my gaze with looks of sheer hostility, I felt my first pangs of depression in a long time.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">They were all young, around ten years old. Gail was built enough to pass for middle-school age, but he was still only eleven.</p>
<p>I called each by name, looking over the files I picked up in the staff room. No reply. Um, I really needed some kind of response from these guys if I was gonna do this…</p>
<p>Ah well. Time to call upon my trusty assistant.</p>
<p>“Please give me a reply when I call your name,” I gently advised. Kenya was the first to voice his tearful complaints.</p>
<p>“Hey! What’s that dog—is that a <em>wolf</em>?! Get it out of here!”</p>
<p>“K-Ken, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“G-get away from me! This is crazy!”</p>
<p>“Ahhh! I’ll behave, I’ll behave!!”</p>
<p>“I am Ranga—neither dog nor wolf. My master demands a reply, child. Will you follow the order, or—?”</p>
<p>Whoa, Ranga’s a big hit. Look at him play around with those kids! It really warms the heart, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>“All right! Okay!” Kenya shouted, eyes tearing up at Ranga’s threat. There’s a good boy. He may not have liked it, but I needed some good behavior in here.</p>
<p>“There you go! Children must do as they’re told!”</p>
<p>I smiled and conducted my roll call.</p>
<p>Apparently, these kids had hit it off pretty well with Shizu. Apart from her, though, Yuuki was the only person they’d listen to. Given their circumstances, I should have expected that, but that didn’t mean I’d let them steamroll over me. I had agreed to be their teacher, and I had better drill <em>that</em> much into their heads real quick.</p>
<p>“My name’s Rimuru, and I’ve been appointed to be your adviser starting today. I ain’t gonna coddle you the way Shizu did, so you better be <em>sure</em> you understand that before anything else!”</p>
<p>I started things off by drilling into them the importance of polite greetings.</p>
<p class="space-break">Right, then. They were no longer in a state of outright rebellion, but they were hostile as ever. The classroom was bathed in silence; I could literally hear one of them gulp nervously. Ranga loped back up to me, tail wagging.</p>
<p>“All right,” I said with a refreshing smile. “Take your seats, everybody.” Nobody moved. That sucked. The deep hatred they obviously had for anyone outside their group would make earning their trust a trial. If I were them, my thought process would probably be along the lines of “I’ll kill that asshole,” but I wasn’t. This world was all about survival of the fittest. If they couldn’t beat Ranga, their selfishness ended now. <em>If you wanna hate someone for it, hate yourself for being so weak.</em></p>
<p>So—</p>
<p>“Okay, then! I suppose you’ve all got something you’d like to say to me. So how about we have a little test?”</p>
<p>“Hey!” Alice exclaimed first. “Why’s it gotta be <em>that</em>?!”</p>
<p>“A test?” Ryota asked the boy next to him.</p>
<p>“Blehhhh!!” replied Kenya.</p>
<p>“I <em>hate</em> tests” was the more direct assessment from Chloe.</p>
<p>“This is all too sudden,” the more intellectual-sounding Gail added. “I demand an explanation!”</p>
<p>Quite the protest. Children have such a wealth of personalities, don’t they? And no matter what world you’re in, nobody likes a test.</p>
<p>“Enough back talk. I know what you’re all thinking, but listen. What we’re about to do is something that’s necessary for each of you!”</p>
<p>“Why?! We’re all gonna die pretty soon anyway! What’s the point of studying ’n’ taking tests and stuff?!”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah… Our last teacher just brought in a bunch of toys and books ’n’ said we could do whatever we wanted…”</p>
<p>“We haven’t done any real classwork since we came here…”</p>
<p>“I wanna read more books!”</p>
<p>“And who do you think <em>you</em> are? Just because you’ve got a big dog doesn’t mean you can lord it over us!”</p>
<p><em>Ah, they’re bursting with energy. That’s great.</em> But I wasn’t lying. This <em>was</em> necessary. And sadly, I wasn’t willing to compromise.</p>
<p class="space-break">“All right, all right, just calm down. I called it a test, but really, it’s more of a fun game for you all to play. And if you don’t like it, you can complain about it as much as you want. So what you’ll do is take turns taking me on in mock combat. The rules are simple. Attack me with everything you’ve got. If you can beat me, it’s over. But if I can dodge your attacks for ten minutes, I win. Easy, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s it?”</p>
<p>“Yep. Easy, right?”</p>
<p>“Ten minutes?”</p>
<p>“Hey, I’ll spot you guys an hour each if you want.”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! If you don’t sic that dog on me, I don’t even need ten!”</p>
<p>“Great! I promise I won’t do that, okay? But it’s one at a time for you guys, too! No helping out your classmates, all right?”</p>
<p>“Okay!”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh! I’ll totally win if that dog ain’t in it!”</p>
<p>“I just want to read some books…”</p>
<p>“So where’re we doing this?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, the gymnasium ought to work, I suppose. Do you all understand the rules? You can figure out the turn order on the way there.”</p>
<p>With that, I took the kids—my students—over to the gym. A few passersby gave us looks of horror on the way, which I ignored.</p>
<p>This was a simple sparring session. I wasn’t going to lay a hand on them—I just wanted to see what abilities they had. None possessed unique skills, making them unable to expend the magicules that threatened to destroy them from the inside. Would all-out battle be enough to consume them instead? I didn’t know, but I wanted to try. I doubted Shizu and Yuuki hadn’t thought of that, but with Analyze and Assess, at least I could observe them in closer detail than either of those people.</p>
<p class="space-break">By the way, monsters were generally assigned strength ratings based on the amount of magicules within them. Adventurer ranks, on the other hand, were based on proven strength, meaning a C-ranked adventurer could bear more magical energy than a B rank. I found that kind of weird, but that testing I went through proved it to be the case.</p>
<p>Monsters, meanwhile, mostly fight based on instinct; there wasn’t much difference between individuals of a species in terms of technical level. This meant that magicule count was the handiest way to rank them. (Some individual monsters <em>did</em> have special gifts—a lot lived in Tempest—but whatever.)</p>
<p>One other thing I noticed was that, compared to adventurers, monsters often held a <em>ton</em> more magicules. That fact made it all the clearer how frail the human race was against them. A human could raise their technical skills only so far, after all. And again, that was the reason why nations were going through with these forbidden summonings. It enraged me; I couldn’t believe it was allowed to go on…but I could see the logic to it.</p>
<p>Getting back to these kids—one surprise I got from Analyze and Assess was its magic measurements. In monster terms, each of their magicule counts would rank them as A or higher. Chloe, in particular, had enough energy to put her up there with some high-level elementals.</p>
<p>This <em>was</em> weird. They’d be fearsome foes, if they only had a way to harness that force. But we’d see soon enough.</p>
<p class="space-break">They had worked out the order of taking turns. Kenya stepped up first, all but bursting to go. He was only ten, but he was the most defiant of the group—kind of the boss, maybe?</p>
<p>“Hey, is it cool if I use this sword?”</p>
<p>Impudent little brat.</p>
<p>“Don’t you remember? I said to gimme everything you got. But if you lose, you better start calling me <em>Professor</em> Rimuru!”</p>
<p>“Pfft! No grown-up can beat us. We’ve never lost to anyone except Miss Shizu!”</p>
<p>“Oh, really? Why don’t you save your bragging for after you win?”</p>
<p>And so, the test began. I let the kids decide on a signal, providing them with an hourglass I’d bought the previous day and telling them how to use it.</p>
<p><em>Shall we, then?</em></p>
<p>“Umm, begin!”</p>
<p>With Ryota’s signal, Kenya began to run. For a grade-schooler, he moved well—he’d put most grown-ups to shame, really. But it was no sweat for me.</p>
<p>“You can do it, Ken!!”</p>
<p>“Don’t let ’im beat ya!”</p>
<p>Kenya strained his body, attempting to live up to the cheers. He tried his hardest to land an attack on me, but I didn’t even need to predict his moves. He was an open book.</p>
<p>He looked about ready to cry by the time the five-minute mark passed. He began shooting fire from his sword, but… <em>Hmm. This fire’s pretty weak.</em> The way he launched it without any chanting time was impressive, but it was simple to guess where it’d land. I didn’t bother taking any shots on my body, but the heat waves from the explosions didn’t feel very toasty to me. A notch below, say, the Fireballs a B-ranked adventurer like Elen could conjure. And considering Kenya bore A-level magic energy, his energy was being wasted on a massive scale. He wasn’t going easy on me, but it was probably just a trick he picked up by watching others. He wasn’t taking advantage of his power at all.</p>
<p>“Hey! Quit worrying about shooting fire. Just focus all your energy and try to hit me like normal.”</p>
<p>My advice fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p>“Shut up! Miss Shizu’s skills were awesome! I don’t need to listen to your crap!”</p>
<p>He really <em>was</em> an impertinent little bastard. And it cost him—he didn’t take my hint for the rest of the ten minutes. I won.</p>
<p>“And it’s over! Remember, <em>Professor</em> Rimuru from now on. Next up!”</p>
<p>Kenya’s shoulders slumped as he shuffled back to the other children, dejected. Though, really, I’d be far more shocked if I lost to a grade-schooler.</p>
<p class="space-break">Chloe Aubert came out next—a ten-year-old with an uncommon hair color. Kind of black with silver mixed in—it gave her a bit of an enigmatic feel. Maybe she had some Japanese blood in her.</p>
<p>Off we go, then. If I lost to a girl as clearly mesmerizing as this, I would look <em>so</em> lame. Gotta keep my guard up.</p>
<p>“Don’t push yourself, Clo!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, don’t get hurt!”</p>
<p>The children were more focused on Chloe getting injured than winning. She didn’t <em>look</em> all that strong, no. In another moment, the hourglass was turned. What kind of attack would she spring on me? I could guess she liked books; she always had one or two in her hands. Was she gonna try to conk me in the head with one or give me a paper cut? Use them as blunt weapons? Seemed like decent grade-school logic to me. Or maybe not.</p>
<p>But as my mind wandered, I heard her chant “Flowing water, confine my enemy! <em>Water Jail!</em>” Instantly, a torrent of water pinned my legs to the floor. Sense Heat Source told me it was the real thing.</p>
<p>First Kenya, then this girl—they both had magic-controlled skills. Pretty neat. They might be natural prodigies. But now was no time to marvel.</p>
<p>The water current grew more violent, forming a large sphere that enveloped me. I tapped the outer edge with my finger, only to feel a cutting sensation. Much like my Water Blades, she circulated the water at high speed to make the ball retain its shape. Impressive—but what was she gonna do with it?</p>
<p>“I’ve transformed that magic to have it rain down constantly upon whomever it captures! Admit your defeat, and I’ll release it, but if you don’t, you’re gonna die!”</p>
<p>Damn! Scary little kid! She was all about keeping me in check, unlike Kenya—but sadly, it wouldn’t be enough.</p>
<p>“Pretty impressive, but it won’t work on me. You’re using it really well, though. I hope you keep up practicing!”</p>
<p>Stepping out of the watery dungeon, I patted Chloe on the head. Some dungeon <em>that</em> was. I could just use Control Magic to rework it any way I wanted. Seriously, even among my extra skills, it was wicked powerful. You could even get away with calling it a unique. Magic was all about controlling magicules to create phenomena. Interfere with those magicules with a stronger force, and it couldn’t be easier to break it.</p>
<p>Chloe sat on the floor, surprised. Her face reddened as tears came to her eyes. <em>Sorry, girl. This is me trying to go easy, too. I need to show just how much more powerful I am. You would never listen to me if I didn’t lay down the law.</em></p>
<p>No longer interested in fighting, Chloe ceded victory. She rubbed her head where I patted her, looking oddly content as she smiled.</p>
<p class="space-break">Let’s keep it going!</p>
<p>My next opponent was Gail Gibson, the oldest of the gang at age eleven. He was a large boy with brown hair and handsome, chiseled features. Give him a few years, and I’m sure his looks would put Hollywood actors to shame. I had no interest in crushing his spirit; I just wanted to show him that the world can be cruel sometimes.</p>
<p>“Don’t hate me if this kills you, all right?”</p>
<p>Gail immediately greeted me with an unhesitant, full-force blow. Seeing the previous two rounds must’ve changed his views about me. It was a fairly fearsome ball of magic, potentially lethal even for a B-ranked adventurer. <em>Hey, I had a lot of trouble learning that one, too…</em></p>
<p>He probably put every ounce of his energy into that blast. It was the right thing to do—but he chose the wrong adversary. Projectile-based moves didn’t work on me. I used Glutton to scarf it right down.</p>
<p>“Wh-what was that?! That’s <em>dirty</em>!”</p>
<p><em>Yeah, it sure is. I think so, too.</em></p>
<p>“Listen: Grown-ups are dirty people, all right? They’ll do anything and everything to beatcha! That’s how they work.”</p>
<p>Kind of an immature way to put it to a child, I guess, but I didn’t want to leave anything off the table. There were other tactics I could’ve taken, but I wanted to both win this <em>and</em> make it look easy. It was actually kind of hard.</p>
<p>Gail bit his lip in frustration, then focused his energy upon his fists to strike out at me. I was impressed he didn’t give up, but there was no path to victory left for him. The rest of the battle went just as it did with Kenya.</p>
<p class="space-break">Ryota seemed like a wimpy kid to me. He was always by Kenya’s side, ever cheering him on. Opposites attract, maybe. Beyond that, he seemed like just a regular child.</p>
<p>His <em>ability</em>, though…</p>
<p>“Get ’im for me, Ryota!”</p>
<p>His eyes lit up the moment Kenya started egging him on, and he attacked with… Magic? No. It was closer to Shion’s Strengthen Body skill. With zero spell casting, he instantly doubled his strength and speed—maybe even more than doubled. His magicules briskly converted themselves into fighting force as he protected himself.</p>
<p>A very impressive power-up move, though I had to take points off since he couldn’t activate it by himself. Losing your cool in combat was, nine times out of ten, a net negative. It meant tossing away your intelligence, the one advantage you could rely on over a monster.</p>
<p>Ryota’s skill wasn’t Strengthen Body so much as a Berserker-style transform. It was useless as is. <em>I’d better help him hone that.</em> He <em>did</em> move well, though. If he weren’t fighting me, he could’ve fended for himself rather well.</p>
<p>But—oops, too bad! I effortlessly dodged him for the entire ten minutes.</p>
<p class="space-break">That just left Alice Rondo. Youngest of the group at nine, she had shiny, straight blond hair that ran down her back and made her look just like a doll. Very fetching—but unlike the reserved Chloe, she had a mean tomboyish streak.</p>
<p>“About time my turn came up,” she boastfully declared. “You worthless idiots better take a lesson or two from <em>me</em>!”</p>
<p>And here I thought Kenya was the boss of the group. It might’ve been the youngest one, after all. Or maybe she was the secret boss? Whatever she was, I needed to show her who was in charge, or else this whole effort was a failure. Better brace myself for anything. Plus, I couldn’t help but notice that we’d been attracting an audience of students and teachers. As much ruckus as we were causing in this gym, it wasn’t weird that we were building interest. Well, bring ’em on! It’d be a good chance to show the school that I had this. That I was treating these kids as real students.</p>
<p><em>But what’s Alice got in store for me?</em> The girl gave me a bold smile, then tossed the assorted plush toys she carried behind her back up in the air.</p>
<p>“Okay, guys! Take that freak down!!”</p>
<p>I looked up, confused, only to find a small army of living, breathing toys closing in on me—dogs, cats, birds, even bears. They packed a surprisingly heavy punch.</p>
<p>Alice, it turns out, was a Golem Master, something she must’ve stumbled upon as she saw Shizu and her spirit skills. It was astonishingly creative, especially for a child. If fur and foam produced <em>this</em> level of attack, she’d be packing some <em>serious</em> heat if someone gave her some steel robots or something. She might be the strongest of the five, even.</p>
<p>But if all I had to do was avoid them for ten minutes, that seemed doable.</p>
<p>“Hey! Quit running away from them, you wimp!!”</p>
<p>I heard her complaint loud and clear but ignored it. I had a passing thought of incinerating them all as I danced around…</p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl">Report. Chances of the individual Alice Rondo bursting into tears…one hundred percent.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">…but resisted. Not with <em>those</em> kinds of odds. It’d be even harder to placate her after that, and I’m sure the crowd would think I was a bully. So I kept running and running until the clock ran out.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Well, at least I managed to save face. I had now shown what I could do to all five of my students.</p>
<p>“Wow, that adviser in the mask is amazing! He doesn’t look older than ten or so, and he just dominated those little hellions!”</p>
<p>“That was a B-ranked adventurer? No way. Strength like <em>that</em> has Shizu written all over it!”</p>
<p>With that kind of commentary from the crowd, I felt safe assuming my reputation around school was now secure.</p>
<p>These kids were powerful, but their skill sets had a sort of patchwork feel. If I had to guess, it wasn’t because those were skills they were aiming for—they just tripped over them as they imitated Shizu.</p>
<p>Plus, I had made a vital observation. I theorized that letting them fight all-out would sap their magicule count a bit…but all it did was skim a bit off the top. The energy at the root of their bodies didn’t drop at all. That much was clear from the generally weak performance of all their magics.</p>
<p>I guess there was no fixing the imbalance that way. Beyond that, I thought about using my Deviant unique skill to separate the energy from them, then Gluttony to either consume or isolate it. But if I had to guess…</p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl">Received. Energy fused with an entity’s soul cannot be separated from it.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">Nope, guess not. I had noticed as much as I observed them in-depth during combat. So I’d have to make them obtain a unique skill—or figure out something else.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much time left. If five years was the maximum Yuuki knew about, these children would be lucky to have twelve more months. I had to find a way—any way—to drain the magicules from them before the power destroyed them from the inside.</p>
<p>But while it didn’t exactly come by the gentlest of methods, I now had a full grasp of their situation. I weighed my options as we cleaned up the gym and returned to our classroom. Physically exercising their skills didn’t solve anything, but helping them release <em>some</em> magic would help delay the inevitable, at least a little. We’d need to hold these “treatment sessions” regularly as I worked out a way to address the main issue.</p>
<p class="space-break">Back in class, I sat the kids down and addressed them.</p>
<p>“Now. As you’ve all just experienced, I am, um, kind of strong. But I promise you: I am going to help all of you out. I swear it by my mask here.”</p>
<p>They sat quietly. I felt like they were paying much closer attention now. <em>There’s one victory for the time being, then.</em> We needed to connect this way, heart-to-heart, or else they’d just tune me out—but now, as much as I had to force it, we had that connection.</p>
<p>“Um…is that Miss Shizu’s mask?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, Alice. Shizu gave it to me…and when I accepted it, I guess I agreed to take you guys on, too.”</p>
<p>Not until I started dreaming about it recently, technically. But that didn’t matter.</p>
<p>“All right,” Alice said, nodding her satisfaction. “I believe you.”</p>
<p>“Um, m-me too…”</p>
<p>“I believed in you from the beginning, ya know!”</p>
<p>Alice, Ryota, and Chloe were willing to open their hearts to me, at least.</p>
<p>“Oh, come on, guys… In that case, I <em>guess</em>…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Kenya. I think we can trust in this guy, too.”</p>
<p>Kenya’s and Gail’s consent sealed the deal. I had their trust. They recognized me as a teacher now.</p>
<p>Speaking of that mask, though… I feel like something just jogged my memory. Shizu had tasked me with the mission…of <em>striking</em> the demon lord Leon. Not kill or defeat, but <em>strike</em>. Did she not really want revenge on him, after all? Maybe not. If she did, she would’ve attacked him back when she was at the pinnacle of her strength.</p>
<p>But…hang on. She said she came here before she was even ten years old, I think. So how did she survive? I needed to think. We didn’t talk for very long, but I felt like she might’ve hidden a hint or two in there. I always found it weird that she’d abandon these children for her own mission. Why did she suddenly see fit to take action on them now, of all times?</p>
<p class="space-break"><em>—Hurry!</em></p>
<p class="space-break">Ah, I see… She headed for Leon because she wanted to help them out. Striking Leon and saving the children—these both connected to the same goal.</p>
<p class="space-break">—<em>The demon lord Leon knows how to rescue the children. I know, because he rescued me.</em></p>
<p class="space-break">Was <em>that</em> her line of thinking? But…how?</p>
<p>I hooked myself up to the Great Sage, pondering over this with everything I had. As always, it didn’t let me down. Whether Leon deliberately saved Shizu’s life didn’t matter. The only question was how.</p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl">Received. Inferring the demon lord Leon Cromwell’s method for saving Shizue Izawa… Complete. This is an inference based on collected circumstantial evidence, but…</span></p>
<p class="space-break">The Sage’s answer rang in my head. It would be a gruelingly difficult road for these children—the long bet to end all long bets. To me, though, it was an easy ordeal to accept.</p>
<p>The only issue was…</p>
<p>“Listen. I promise I’ll save all of you, but to do that, I need you to trust me and act like good boys and girls. All right? Shizu’s entrusted me with you, and I’m not going to abandon any of you!”</p>
<p>Confidence spread within me as I spoke. I couldn’t show any anxiety in front of these kids. They rewarded me with their calm, resolute stares.</p>
<p>“““Thank you, Mr. Rimuru!!”””</p>
<p><em>Mr. Rimuru.</em> I liked the sound of that. <em>Well, you’re on.</em> I was Mr. Rimuru to them, and that meant they were as good as saved. I swore it in my heart now.</p>
