<p>“Hee-hee! How reassuring to hear,” Gazel said. “I’d expect nothing less from a fellow pupil of Hakuro like yourself, Rimuru. I hope you will be generous with this when the time comes.”</p>
<p>Hakuro doesn’t have anything to do with this, man. And I know I readily agreed to it, but the Beast Kingdom of Eurazania wasn’t exactly right next door. Maybe we could blaze a rough track, but paved-over gravel was out of the question for a while.</p>
<p>“We’ll need to build some kind of transport path first, of course.”</p>
<p>“Ah, about that… The hard work your crew has been putting in is nothing short of astonishing. They work several times faster than the best of our engineer corps, and seeing them build a road practically before my eyes sends shivers down my spine.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m pretty impressed, too.”</p>
<p>“But are you sure you are content with this? We are providing you with no support at all. I didn’t expect you to come up with such a splendid highway for us…”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t worry about it. That’s what we promised you. And actually, I have another offer for you, so if you’d be willing to give it some thought going forward…”</p>
<p>I gave him a satisfied grin.</p>
<p>Step one, put your partner in a good mood. Step two, move on to the main issue. All according to plan. It was now time for me to sell the king on our Low Potions and procure a doctor or two from them—my two biggest goals here. The result: a total success, as I extracted a promise that he would give both offers ample thought.</p>

<p class="tx1">With the night now behind us, today was the big day of our friendly bilateral relations pact.</p>
<p>I felt fine, of course, but King Gazel seemed totally unaffected by all the whiskey he drank. Dolph, on the other hand, was looking a bit green around the gills, and I heard Vaughn was still sleeping it off in his room. Wasn’t he supposed to be an admiral paladin in the Dwargon force? Could he get away with that? It wasn’t my place to criticize how they do things in foreign lands, but come on.</p>
<p>Gazel whispered at me to keep smiling, so I did. The ceremony came and went, and while I was still nervous throughout, nothing terrible happened. Not until just before the end of it, when I was expected to say a few words.</p>
<p>I pored over the speech in my brain before my turn came up. Rigurd and Kaijin had offered some feedback before I left, so after several rewrites, I had it memorized. <em>I can do this. Let’s rock!</em></p>
<p>In another few moments, King Gazel wrapped up. I was in slime form now, and Shion held me up to the skies in front of the lectern.</p>
<p>“Umm, hello, everyone. I am Rimuru Tempest, lord and overseer of the Jura-Tempest Federation, or just Tempest for short. To tell the truth, I am, as you see, a slime, and one who was actually born rather recently. Through various twists and turns of circumstance, I came to know and foster a close relationship with Yohm, the champion. When the orc lord threatened to conquer the Forest of Jura, we both worked together to fight off and defeat this menace. Here, in this wonderful land called the Armed Kingdom of Dwargon, man and monster work together to create what is truly an ideal and prosperous coexistence. It is an ideal I wish to pursue for ourselves, as we attempt to build a nation in the Forest of Jura that serves as a bridge between the human and monster races. King Gazel has given his stamp of approval to my dream, which I cannot thank him enough for. Going forward, I want to maintain the mutually beneficial relationship we have. In order to do that, we will need help from each and every one of you. There are a great number of monsters in my nation, myself included. In fact, it would be fair to call ourselves a land of monsters. However, at our core, we are no different from any of you. Instead of fearing us as monsters, I hope you will accept us as new friends. I hereby swear to you that everything I have said is the unvarnished truth, and with that, I conclude my address to you.”</p>
<p>It was short, but I still put as much firm emotion behind it as I could, hoping it would reach the hearts of Dwargon’s people. I was trying to be honest; it wasn’t like I was capable of pulling a bunch of crap out of nowhere for a speech like this. I also didn’t forget to casually note my relationship with Yohm, who was starting to become a legend in his own time.</p>
<p>To me, the speech was pretty well perfect…but King Gazel still gave me an earful about it afterward. One, it was too short; two, it was too self-effacing; three, it was too much of an emotional appeal. To him, it was a near-perfect zero, but it’s not like I would get Gazel-style feedback from the likes of Rigurd or Kaijin. <em>I’ll let it slide and tackle things in earnest next time.</em></p>
<p>A leader was someone who governed his country; it therefore wasn’t advisable for one to depreciate himself in public, it seemed. That was all the more applicable when addressing a foreign audience, since that could lead to them writing you off as a pushover.</p>
<p>Most important of all, however, was that ruling a nation under the concept of “Wouldn’t it be nice if…?” was strictly prohibited. As Gazel put it: “I won’t ask you not to expect great things from your people. But if you speak like that, could you blame them if they betray you later? A leader is treated as a leader because he <em>leads</em>. He’d be wholly unsuited for government if he can’t even believe what he’s thinking. Truly wonderful happenings won’t simply come running up to you. You need to grab them for yourself.”</p>
<p>I suppose that advice came from the heart; he’d never need to say it otherwise. I accepted it with my utmost appreciation. I had lived wholly outside the realm of politics, but now I had (somehow or other) become the head of a nation. I had to stop crying about things and start <em>doing</em> things.</p>
<p>In a way, building the kind of relationship with King Gazel where he kept looking out for me like this… Could I have asked for a better stroke of luck? I wanted to harness that luck as much as I could, no matter how much our personal interests got involved.</p>

<p class="tx1">That wrapped up all the major events at Dwargon. Beyond a few casual meetings, I’d be devoting the next few days to tourism and the like.</p>
<p>Dolph would be leading me around. He headed the Pegasus Knights, but that job was classified; officially, he led the civil servants who filled the government’s bureaucracy, which chiefly meant he was King Gazel’s assistant.</p>
<p>“So was there someplace you wanted to see? I’ll be happy to fill your requests to the best of my ability.”</p>
<p>I didn’t hold anything back. I wanted to check out every facility here in Dwargon that could teach me something to improve on back home. Dolph was accommodating to it all, thankfully, and we spent several days going through all the Dwarven Kingdom’s most famous spots. Production workshops, large-scale transport facilities, even cavern air-purification setups—the works. A lot of it would be helpful to us later, I was sure, especially the air-conditioning facilities and such. I definitely wanted to get something like that set up for Vester and the rest of the gang conducting research underground.</p>
<p>“Regular people aren’t allowed inside here, though, are they?” I asked Dolph.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! Not normally, no, but we have a technology-sharing agreement with you. You already know about things even more classified than this; there’s no point hiding anything more from you.”</p>
<p>That was a relief. It also showed exactly how much Gazel trusted me.</p>
<p class="space-break">We finished up most of the touring over the next few days. But of course, there was one place in the Dwarven Kingdom I’d never want to omit. That’s right—the Night Butterfly.</p>
<p>Ah, nightlife! I was rudely interrupted by a highly agitated Vester last time I paid a visit, but that was no worry this time.</p>
<p>“Gobta.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir!”</p>
<p>“You sure you’re fully prepared?”</p>
<p>“Of course, sir!”</p>
<p>“Well, then…in that case, shall we head over to the place I promised you?”</p>
<p>“Ooh, finally, sir! Can’t wait!”</p>
<p>We smiled and chuckled at each other.</p>
<p>Gobta and I had been discussing things in great depth to prepare. I would retire early to bed, use Replication to keep a version of myself in there, then head back out to rendezvous with Gobta so we could hit the club together. Kaijin and the others were aware of our plans and would meet us there. There was no need to worry about unwelcome visitors since we had reserved the entire place for ourselves tonight. I was covering all the expenses; I’d been saving up for it, and I still had some of the gold from last time, so I doubted I’d get cleaned out.</p>
<p>It was gonna <em>rock</em>.</p>
<p>I mean, I wasn’t anticipating much, but Gobta and the rest of the gang were so excited, I didn’t want them to be a pain on the staff or anything. I was…<em>chaperoning</em>, that’s it! A grown-up conscience for the rest of the crew. Convincing myself this was true, I waited for the night.</p>
<p>Once night finally came, I snuck out of my room, beside myself with anticipation. My body double was in bed, and I knew what Shuna and Shion were doing. They, of course, were my biggest obstacles to enjoying my night. Shion was engaging in some night training with Dolph and Vaughn, with whom she had hit it off, and luckily, the session was set to run exactly as long as our reserved time at the Butterfly. Shuna, meanwhile, was meeting with the palace cooks to organize the going-away banquet tomorrow night.</p>
<p>God had truly blessed us with perfect timing. Without this opportunity, I’d never have had a moment to myself. It was little wonder that I couldn’t wait for night to fall.</p>
<p>“Gobta, you there?” I whispered.</p>
<p>“Yes sir! Right here, sir!” he whispered back.</p>
<p>I gave him a nod of approval—a spring in our step as we walked.</p>
<p>“Sure gonna be fun, huh?” Gobta asked for the millionth time. He was really attached to this place; he’d been bugging me about coming there for ages. He probably couldn’t be happier now, as his massive smile suggested.</p>
<p>Our preparations fully complete, we followed the familiar path without fail to the club. The moment we opened the door, we were eagerly greeted.</p>
<p>“Oh! Hello! It’s the big slime himself! Hey, everybody, he’s here!”</p>
<p>“““Good evening!!”””</p>
<p>“Eeeeee! I’ve been waiting forever for you!”</p>
<p>“Wait! I get to hold him this time!”</p>
<p>“What?! Since when do we have a rule like that?”</p>
<p>“Welcome back!” the owner shouted. “Everything been good with you?”</p>
<p>“You bet, sir! How ’bout all of you?”</p>
<p>Oops. I let a little bit of Gobta slip in there.</p>
<p>“Oh, of course! The rest of your friends are already here.”</p>
<p>We had the whole place to ourselves, so my “friends” meant Kaijin and the dwarves. Led inside, we saw them in the main lounge, each with a female companion and in their own respective states of bliss.</p>
<p>“Rimuru! Hey, Boss, this place is spectacular!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, thanks for inviting me today, too, Sir Rimuru!”</p>
<p>“Why wouldn’t I, Kaido? You’ve been a lot of help to me—at least let me spot this for ya. We’re outta here in two days, and you probably won’t see Kaijin too often after that, either. So let’s kick back and chat, okay?”</p>
<p>“Sounds good to me!”</p>
<p>“Hah! What’re you, crazy? A club like this, and you wanna chat with other guys?! C’mon, we got all these fine ladies here—let’s have some fun, too!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Kaido! Kaijin’s right!”</p>
<p>“Right. Tonight I brought along some necklaces I made for you ladies as souvenirs. Take whichever ones you like!”</p>
<p>“…!!”</p>
<p>Good to see Kaijin was being Kaijin. The three brothers seemed to enjoy themselves well enough, too. But yeesh, Dold, when did you make those necklaces for these ladies? Trying to earn some brownie points? I can’t take my eye off this guy for a single moment.</p>
<p>“Hey! No fair! You’re tryin’ to get a head start on us!”</p>
<p>“What? This is a battlefield, man. Only the strong survive!”</p>
<p>It was an incredibly cool way for Dold to fend off the accusation, I thought, although other people’s mileage may vary. The women seemed to enjoy the presents well enough, though, so Dold’s tactics certainly won out tonight.</p>
<p>At the moment, I was on the knees of the owner, a familiar boinging sensation making itself known behind me. Yes. <em>This</em> is it. <em>This</em> is it! This is what men go wandering in the vast wastelands for—this oasis, this fleeting sanctuary.</p>
<p>It filled me with such deep emotion that I offered her a drink. The club had all the usual items—beer, wine, milk, assorted fruity things—but I had a sneaking suspicion it’d be offering more mature selections—say, whiskey and brandy before long.</p>
<p>“Ooh, what’s this?”</p>
<p>“Ah, a new product we’re planning to make. We’ll be providing King Gazel with a supply, but we’ll let you guys have a bit as well, so offer it to your regulars and see what they think. I’d love to hear whatever feedback you get.”</p>
<p>“My! Are you sure it’s all right?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no problem. We can’t make very much, though, so it’s not the kinda thing we can ramp up production on for money. Maybe if you could comp your regulars one glass each, then see how much they’re willing to pay after that? I’d like to do some test marketing.”</p>
<p>“Well, aren’t <em>you</em> a shrewd little rascal, Sir Slime! I can’t believe this is the same slime who gave that stiff speech in the main plaza earlier!”</p>
<p>The owner smiled warmly and laughed. Realizing she was in the audience filled me with embarrassment. And here I thought she’d be asleep during the day since she works the night shift.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, that…was kind of an act, you know? I probably looked like a total amateur, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! Yes, let’s just go with that.” She smiled at my bashfulness. “But you know, I really liked it! You sounded really sincere. That’s the kind of thing that attracts people, I think. In that respect, you were a perfect ten. I was like ‘I can <em>totally</em> trust this slime!’ And I’d just love to see a nation like that—people and monsters living in peaceful harmony.”</p>
<p>This made me happy. Now I knew there was someone out there who took my heartfelt speech seriously and didn’t just laugh it off as a delusion.</p>
<p>“Well, thanks.”</p>
<p>That was about all the reply I could muster, though.</p>
<p class="space-break">The night was an enjoyable one for everyone involved. Gobta was all nerves at first, but now they were all egging him on to perform some acrobatics for their entertainment. The ladies had him wrapped around their fingers, but he seemed to be basking in it, so I didn’t intervene.</p>
<p>Soon, our reserved time slot was almost up.</p>
<p>“Well, time to head out pretty soon.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I wouldn’t wanna bother these girls all night.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re not a bother!”</p>
<p>“Aww, you’re leaving now?”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! Sorry, ma’am! I promise we’ll be back!”</p>
<p>I was reluctant to go; still, I had to get back. My Replication double was still active, but if <em>they</em> found out about this, I’d be in deep crap.</p>
<p>Kaido had cleaned up the home Kaijin and the dwarves used to live in, so they’d be staying there for the night. It’d be ready for use whenever they came back, too. Gobta and I, meanwhile, were headed back to our staterooms in the palace.</p>
<p>“Now listen, guys, make sure nobody sees you on the way back home, all right? This whole night’s my little secret!”</p>
<p>No point hammering the point home yet again, but I did so anyway. Just to make sure we all had operational security in mind. But then, one of the hob-gobs sitting on the far end of the lounge spoke up.</p>
<p>“Oh? Um, Lady Shuna asked me where I was goin’, so I told ’er everything, sir, but…”</p>
<p><em>Wh-what?!</em></p>
<p>The rest of the group stared at him. Gobta went pale and clammy, and the rest of his team was unable to hide their agitation.</p>
<p>“Whoa, whoa, whoa, you told her <em>everything</em>?”</p>
<p>“Seriously?! Gobzo, what have you done?!”</p>
