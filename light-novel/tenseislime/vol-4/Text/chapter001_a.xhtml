<p class="cotx1">I could see a bunch of children playing around outside. Three boys and two girls. They ran up to me at first sight, overjoyed to see me.</p>
<p class="space-break">“Teacher! What’re we gonna do today?” they all asked, their eyes shining—a determined-looking boy; a timid-looking boy; a reticent-looking boy; a lively looking girl; and a wise-looking girl.</p>
<p class="space-break">They were all my students, and I doted upon them. Today, however, my emotions were a churning mix of happiness, sadness, and loneliness.</p>
<p>“Well,” I said to them, “that’s a good question. What <em>should</em> we do?”</p>
<p>This was my regular life until a bit ago. A life I myself threw away, one that would never return.</p>
<p><em>—But these are</em> her <em>memories, aren’t they? Not mine.</em></p>
<p>The lingering attachments of Shizu, back during her instructor days. I could tell, from my viewpoint, that she didn’t want these kids to be involved in her strife. But perhaps they felt abandoned. Perhaps they cried. But even if they didn’t, it was all so…</p>
<p>Hmm? All so what? What was I trying to…?</p>
<p class="space-break">And then my eyes opened.</p>
<p class="space-break"><em>—Please. Those children…</em></p>
<p>Those children? The ones in the dream?</p>
<p><em>—Please, rescue those children.</em></p>
<p>Rescue…? What on earth from?</p>
<p>There was nobody to answer. She wanted to have me do something. That much was clear. But that was it. No more words, as her voice plunged into the darkness and disappeared.</p>
<p class="space-break">The remains of the dream faded away in my mind—the plaintive request left deserted and unnoticed.</p>

<p class="tx1">This felt like the first dream I had in a while.</p>
<p>Ever since I became a slime, which by definition never slept, the only chance for dreams was during emergencies like exhausting my magical force. It didn’t feel right to me at all, so I forced myself to engage in periods of inactivity on a daily basis—working hard to laze around, in a way.</p>
<p>If it sounds like a contradiction, it isn’t. Giving oneself time to relax is never a bad thing, and there’s no pain in working hard for some goal you have. And all that effort paid off. For short periods of time, at least, I could let go of my consciousness and achieve a state of sheer serenity. The experiment worked, in other words. I forgot what the dream was <em>about</em>, but that wasn’t important. That’s kind of what dreams are anyway.</p>
<p>“Ahh, now I can live my days in sheer laziness…”</p>
<p>“What sort of nonsense are you going on about, Sir Rimuru?”</p>
<p>She was angry. Shuna’s smile never faltered when she was angry. That’s what made it so terrifying.</p>
<p class="space-break">Blithely following Shuna’s lead, I crawled out of bed, grumbling to myself. I’d be busy during the day—battle training with Hakuro was on the schedule, as was an inspection trip to see how construction was proceeding. You’d think there was no harm in kicking back a little at night. I had just wrapped up analyzing and assessing the skills I took from Charybdis, so there were no major unaddressed issues left to tackle.</p>
<p>By the way, Charybdis gave me Magic Interference and Control Gravity, both extra skills. Magic Interference, paired with Control Particles, resulted in the new extra skill Control Magic—which, when associated with Multilayer Barrier, gave a pretty hefty boost to my defenses. Magical attacks were nothing to worry about now—that, along with the Resist Magic skill I picked up from Gabil and the rest of the freshly evolved dragonewts, meant I could withstand well near any direct magical strike. Of course, I had Glutton on me, so I could already consume and neutralize any magic attack I could identify—but still, this new stuff could protect me from ambushes and surprise attacks, and that was huge.</p>
<p>As for Control Gravity—well, my research into it certainly paid off. I had always felt it a pity I couldn’t capture Gelmud’s flight magic, but Control Gravity very elegantly solved that problem. I didn’t even need to chant a spell in advance—high-speed flight was now mine, in any shape or form I wanted it.</p>
<p>This time, I didn’t rush things. I hadn’t forgotten the failures I ran into on the way to stumbling upon Water Pressure Propulsion. Trying out whatever jumped into your imagination was a surefire ticket to some seriously unfunny situations. So I took it easy, spending every evening examining my skills. I started by lifting myself into the air and practicing some low-speed flight. I could control my trajectory with my wings to some extent, which helped me pick up the knack more easily than I thought.</p>
<p>Now, I didn’t even need the wings. Multilayer Barrier even protected me against wind resistance; I bet I could break the sound barrier before long with this. But no rush. I’d just keep up the slow, steady practice.</p>
<p class="space-break">As I thought all this over, Shuna gave me an exasperated sigh.</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru, you’re being inattentive again. You will be seeing off my brother Benimaru and Sir Rigur today. I want you to focus on being the most majestic figure you can for the big farewell.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, that was today. Sure thing.”</p>
<p>Ah, yes. Benimaru and crew were heading off today.</p>

<p class="tx1">Several months had passed after Milim’s departure. Several calm, chill, and very peaceful months. I was busy as always, but still, <em>extremely</em> chill.</p>
<p>One day, though, a messenger appeared from Carillon, the Beast Master and one of the land’s demon lords. I hadn’t forged an official agreement with him on paper, but it appeared Carillon was a man true to his word. As the messenger put it: “Let us send envoys to our respective nations, so they may see for themselves whether forging trade relations would be beneficial to both sides.”</p>
<p>I gave my immediate approval, and Carillon had already given his. Which brings us to today, the historical day of departure for our envoy mission to the Beast Kingdom of Eurazania.</p>
<p class="space-break">Benimaru, a gifted warrior and my right-hand man, would lead the envoys. For his assistant, I appointed Rigur, son of Rigurd. Their mission: to travel to other nations and report what they observed, so I could figure out how to run my own country. They were accompanied by a small group of other hobgoblins, all candidates for future leadership roles in my government.</p>
<p>They would be representatives for the Jura-Tempest Federation, Tempest for short. Our nation. A brand-new one, and thus, inexperienced in almost every way. We needed to compensate for that, and toward that end, we were all working together, putting in the maximum effort on a daily basis. It’s thanks to that work ethic that I think this envoy mission to Eurazania should bear some serious fruit for us.</p>
<p>We were also fully prepared to receive the Beast Master’s own team. They’d come here, look around our nation, and (hopefully) come back with some complimentary things to say. If all goes well, we’ll stay on good terms and (again, hopefully) begin formal trade—and from there, formal diplomatic relations. It shouldn’t take long.</p>
<p>But that was still ahead. One step at a time. For now, I needed to focus on seeing everybody off.</p>
<p class="space-break">Awakening my conscious, I assumed human form. There was a ceremony scheduled, so I changed to some suitable formal wear. Looking back, I sort of miss the days when we had almost nothing to wear. Now, we’ve got almost every type of clothing you could think of. A much better selection than I ever had in my closet back in Japan.</p>
<p>And really, in terms of the conveniences we now enjoyed in life, it was just incomparable to the early days. We solved the sugar problem, for one, so we currently had a steady supply. It helped us add stews to our cooking repertoire, and there was even a selection of candy available, albeit not a big one. At this point, now that I had mastered the art of taking short naps, I figured the next question to tackle was entertainment.</p>
<p>But I still had a long road to travel. All these ideas kept storming into my mind, one after the other, and it made things tough. No matter how hard I worked, I never seemed to run out of new wishes and desires. There was no telling when I’d be able to sit back with a big bag of potato chips and veg out in front of my game console all day.</p>
<p>I wasn’t willing to give up on any of these goals, though. And that’s why I needed this envoy team to do their best and make international trade a reality.</p>
<p class="space-break">So there I was, in our city’s main square, standing in front of the crowd in my finest attire. It triggered a small, excited uproar among the monsters, in all their many species. I didn’t make a habit of addressing them in human form. The cheers and shouting seemed like they’d go on forever, but a single “Silence!” from Shion shushed them all in an instant. <em>Nice one, Shion.</em> She was so good at handling these kinds of rowdy scenes.</p>
<p>With the monsters calmed down, I decided to give my team a few encouraging words.</p>
<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will do your best for me!”</p>
<p>“…Is that it?” the perplexed Shuna asked.</p>
<p>Hmm… Was that too short, maybe? My high-school principal droned on so long that nobody listened to him, so I figured shorter is better for speeches like this…but maybe this crowd was more excited about what I had to say.</p>
<p>“Yeah, maybe that wasn’t enough? I’ll give them a little more…”</p>
<p>With that, I decided to run down the list of things I wanted my envoys to watch out for. The Beast Master Carillon was a demon lord and certainly one of the more warlike ones. I couldn’t be certain the rule of law even existed in his domain.</p>
<p>“Right, listen up. You’re about to travel to a nation of magic-born who never believed in anything besides ‘Might makes right.’ Underestimate them at your own peril. If you let up, they’ll make you do whatever they say. You might lose to them in a fight, but I want you to make damn sure you don’t lose to them in heart! Remember: Your companions and I are behind you all the way. Keep that in mind as you tell them about what we’re seeking. If you think a fight is brewing, run away and come back. One mission here is to see if we can remain on good terms with these guys going forward. I don’t need a relationship where we have to hold our noses and merely <em>tolerate</em> them. I want you to see matters with your own eyes and make sure we can maintain a kind, friendly rapport. I’m counting on you!”</p>
<p>The moment I wrapped it up, the square was filled with wild cheering. It was like being in some pop idol’s concert. <em>What I said probably didn’t matter.</em> They were just <em>really</em> keen on listening to me. I’m sure the envoys themselves were paying attention, but the rest were just treating this like a big festival. Ah well. The fact they listened at all indicated a pretty well-disciplined set of monsters. That’s a pretty big step for them.</p>
<p>Might as well take this opportunity, I suppose, to give them another important warning.</p>
<p>“Let’s see, what else…? Well, I don’t mind a mistake or two, but <em>please</em> don’t start a fight yourselves, all right? I’m looking at <em>you</em>, Benimaru. Think you’re up to that?”</p>
<p>My speech made the assumption that any hostilities would come from the Eurazanian side. If <em>my</em> team started anything, this whole expedition would be worthless. I had to hammer into them that I’d accept no mistakes along those lines.</p>
<p>“Heh! You are in good hands with us,” Benimaru barked back, supremely (almost scarily) confident. “I have learned quite a few lessons myself. After the days we spent with Lady Milim, any fool could understand that impudence leads to disaster!”</p>
<p>The comparisons to Milim set off alarm bells, too. Using her as a standard for building your own confidence didn’t give me any sense of security at all. At least it beat Shion, though. Watching her eagerly nod at Benimaru’s words made me sigh. Really, I was hoping Shion could watch the town as I joined this envoy, but that was just far too risky. Although… Thinking about it, Benimaru was a pretty thoughtful man, despite appearances. I guess it was rude of me to compare him to Milim and Shion.</p>
<p>“Good to hear. I wish I could have joined you there myself…”</p>
<p>“Not at all, my lord. I think it best you do not travel to a demon lord’s domain until we can confirm it is safe.”</p>
<p>It was clear from that denial that Benimaru wished to gauge Carillon’s trustworthiness with his own eyes. Not just Carillon, but every other magic-born who called his lands home. Would working with them benefit Tempest? Or would they cause untold harm for me? Really, I was glad to see his initiative, even though it only added to my worries.</p>
<p>Imagining Rigur and the rest alone in a magic-born nation was a bit frightening. I needed to have some strong fighters in the group, at least to serve as bodyguards. Soei was already protecting our nation from the shadows, and Hakuro was busy with military training. Geld couldn’t be wrested away from his construction work, and Gabil was working hard to extract High Potions and produce Low Potions from them. Shion, of course, was out of the question, and thinking along those lines, Benimaru was the sole remaining candidate.</p>
<p>“All right. Do your best.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord!”</p>
<p>“And you, too, Rigur, and all the rest! I’d like to see good things come to our nation.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” a starry-eyed Rigur replied. “We will spread the word far and wide!” Those eyes told me he couldn’t wait to head off; he was really leaping at the chance to try something new. <em>He’ll be fine</em>, I figured.</p>
<p>“Ranga, I want you to stay in Benimaru’s shadow and accompany him. Keep them safe, but do not let your presence be known.”</p>
<p>“I will not let you down, my master!”</p>
<p>Immediately following my orders, Ranga slipped right into Benimaru’s shadow. Benimaru’s own aura was hiding him, and hopefully that’d be enough to keep him invisible on the road.</p>
<p>“Great! Now, let’s give them all a big hand as they set off on their journey!”</p>
<p>On my cue, Shuna gave a signal with her eyes. It was picked up by our band of specially selected musicians, ready to strike up a great, lively tune. The envoy made their way through the watchful crowd, traveling toward a future full of hope—the hope that this stream of cultural exchange would help plant the seeds for future diplomatic ties. Our first government envoy set off with a flourish.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Benimaru’s team was gone, but I still had a pile of things to do. I had plans to visit human lands sooner or later, but with one job coming right after the other, there was no time for that. With anything you do, that first step you take is so incredibly essential. Cut corners at the start, and you’ll often pay dearly for it later. That applies not just to work but to life itself and <em>certainly</em> to kick-starting a new nation. Just because I wanted to hang with humans didn’t mean I could throw everything else off for now.</p>
<p>My top security and military leaders were gone for the time being, and I had to fill in those gaps. Soei could handle security, and I appointed Hakuro as the head of our military for now. <em>That’ll leave things in good hands.</em></p>
<p class="space-break">Next was making arrangements to receive the contingent from Eurazania.</p>
<p>One thing I did <em>not</em> want them seeing was our hipokute grow-setup and potion-manufacturing plant. Everything else was safe enough for public viewing, so I decided to prioritize keeping the Sealed Cave just that—sealed off. There was only the one entrance, and a heavy boulder or the like would close it just fine. Gabil and the rest still had the magical transport circles to travel to and fro with, so physically hiding the entrance seemed the best option.</p>
<p>I worried that sealing it off might affect the cave’s oxygen content, but there were so many ventilation holes lining the cave walls that it didn’t seem like an issue. Plus, Vester had a pretty handy piece of magic to contribute.</p>
<p>“There is magic to detect changes in the air…or in the environment in general, one could say. There is also magic that alerts the caster to any threats to their lives, so I see little to worry about.”</p>
<p><em>There’s one concern knocked down.</em> Vester was so incredibly talented. If he didn’t have such a demented personality, he’d still be using those talents as King Gazel’s most trusted adviser, no doubt…but, hey, if it means he’s working for <em>me</em> now, then I’ll take it—definitely.</p>
<p>So it was settled—no more Sealed Cave entrance for now. And that reminded me of something else about Vester. Besides our potion factory, I was willing to let the envoys see whatever they wanted, so I went over our assorted preparations with a fine-tooth comb. We had just constructed a guesthouse to receive special visitors with—a fancy, luxurious hotel of sorts, not the simpler lodgings Kabal’s and Yohm’s crews were assigned.</p>
<p>And we weren’t just building fancy new boxes—we were building people, too. Shuna’s apprentices were growing into talented chefs. At this point, they had gained a natural instinct for just the right amount of seasoning to add. They were fully versed in managing cooking fires and chopping up ingredients. I wouldn’t be embarrassed to have ’em handle any event at all.</p>
<p>The goblinas, for their part, had learned the fine art of hospitality through their practice with Kabal’s and Yohm’s teams. Handling nobility would still be a tall order for them, but they were more than educated enough to take care of regular people or adventurers.</p>
<p>For the finishing touch, I selected the best-performing ones out of the lot and had them personally treat me as a guest. Given the boorish crowds we usually got around town, I wasn’t too sure whether we could really provide “luxe” service if we tried. Vester, once more, helped a lot—as nobility himself, I figured he could school me on things I never would’ve thought about. His knowledge rubbed off on my selected team, who put in some of the most beautiful work you ever saw.</p>
<p>“You are doing quite well, indeed! Stay diligent, and you all will certainly grow talented enough to receive royalty from any nation without causing offense. I look forward to seeing how you advance!”</p>
<p>“““Thank you for your instruction, my lord!””” the goblina hospitality crew said as they bowed to him. <em>If they kept someone as high-strung as Vester happy</em>, I thought, <em>they must’ve been</em> good<em>.</em></p>
<p>“Sure am glad I asked you for help, Vester!”</p>
<p>“No, no,” he replied with a cheerful laugh. “This has been quite the added benefit for me! I would be happy to help anytime.”</p>
<p>I presented him with a free lodging pass in exchange. He could stay whenever he liked—both enjoying the guesthouse and observing the staff to make sure they weren’t slacking off. Two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>With that, I figured we were all set to keep our visitors happy.</p>
<p class="space-break">There was one more big event left. In fact, if anything, <em>this</em> was my favorite one of all—my official visit to the Armed Nation of Dwargon, the Dwarven Kingdom.</p>
<p>My schedule was already set in stone, thanks to a couple messenger exchanges. It would be one of the most auspicious events our nation’s enjoyed so far, a chance to prove to both Dwargon and the world at large that we, Tempest, were an officially recognized, independent country. Having agreements signed on paper was one thing, but being physically welcomed by foreign lands like this was something I wanted to leverage for our future plans.</p>
<p>Were people willing to accept a new nation founded by monsters? That was our biggest ongoing issue. But building up Yohm to be a hero—and having Fuze spread all the right kinds of rumors about it—was starting to establish us in the public eye as <em>friendly</em> monsters, willing to lend a claw to the good guys.</p>
<p>And now, we had an invite from a full-fledged superpower. This was the perfect opportunity to earn ourselves a ton more trust, and I couldn’t let it pass. No way I could let up until this visit was successful. Visiting human realms could wait until I was sure our government was on the right track.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to make this succeed!”</p>
<p>Shuna and Shion nodded.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“You are in good hands, my lord. As your secretary, I will make every effort I possibly can!”</p>
<p>Time to get to work. Summoning up all my energy, I strove to cut down every issue I could think of, waiting for the fateful day to arrive.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">We received a sign that our envoys were back. A sign, that is, in the form of Treyni. Kneeling before me, she reported our team was near the Forest of Jura the moment she spotted them.</p>
<p>“Thanks for letting me know.”</p>
<p>“Not at all.” She smiled. “It is no hardship for me.”</p>
<p>She was beautiful as always, what with that translucent, mystical air she had. It let her capture the heart of anyone she saw. If I weren’t a slime, I’d easily fall for her, too.</p>
<p>…Oops. Staring at her too long would only make Shuna and Shion all snippy. I’m a slime, totally eyeless, and they <em>still</em> seemed to know where I was looking. Was it some supernatural power or just their womanly intuition? Anyway, better not set off any needless conflict.</p>
<p>“Let me know if anything else comes up.”</p>
<p>“Certainly. I had best be off, then.”</p>
<p>With another smile, Treyni disappeared. Here one moment, gone the next—truly one of the most mysterious women I know. Regardless, I relayed the news to everyone else that we should expect the envoy team back in a few days.</p>
<p class="space-break">Just then, Yohm and his companions paid a visit to town. As I hoped, our little intrigue had established Yohm as a top-of-the-heap champion around the kingdom of Farmus. That put him in demand over there, so he was back for a chance to let his hair down for a change. He had the lofty-sounding excuse of getting a little training from Hakuro, but what he <em>really</em> wanted was some decent grub and a soak in the hot spring. I knew because I could tell—and since he was staying for several days this time, I didn’t forget to keep an eye out for any trouble he might cause.</p>
<p>“Listen, we’re gonna have a party of envoys representing the demon lord Carillon soon. Can you guys promise me you won’t pick any fights with them?”</p>
<p>“Aw, c’mon, pal, who d’you think you’re talking to? You think I’m the sort of fool who’ll get in a brawl with a demon lord’s underlings?”</p>
<p>Yohm slumped. He was right. But there was never accounting for some of the idiots running around out there. It could boggle the imagination.</p>
<p>“But why are demon lord folk coming here in the first place?” he asked before I could answer his first question.</p>
<p>One of Carillon’s top officers had been instilled into the core of Charybdis, a monster who was demon lord–class in itself. After an extended battle, I separated the guy from the core and saved his life, which led to this new thaw in Eurazanian relations…but Yohm and his crew weren’t around to see that, so they still had no idea. I hadn’t gone out of my way to tell them. I wasn’t sure it’d be the best thing.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, I’d better explain. Come to my reception room once you’re out of the bath.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing!”</p>
<p>I suggested a time, and Shion marked it down with a skillful hand. She hadn’t exactly been my first choice for the position, but she was shaping up to be a half-decent secretary, after all.</p>
<p>So how should I put it to Yohm? It seemed like a good idea to give him, and him alone, the whole story. In my mind, I reasoned that I ought to give him a few choice details—the basic tale of my origins and how I’m interacting with the demon lords. Exactly how much I should divulge, I wasn’t sure, but it didn’t seem wise to trumpet it around to the general population. Most people would never believe I was an ex-human in the first place.</p>
<p>In fact, maybe now would be a good chance to tell him <em>everything</em>. It was going to be an intense conversation, I thought, not the sort of thing you wanted to do in the middle of the street. I wanted a relaxing atmosphere for it. So that’s why I told Yohm to come—alone—to my room afterward.</p>
<p class="space-break">Now he was here—out of his traveling clothes and fresh from the bath. It was just after dinner, and he was right on time.</p>
<p>“So what’s the story, pal?”</p>
<p>“Hey, hold your horses,” I said as I offered Yohm a chair—a plush leather sofa with a back and armrests. I sloshed over near a chair that faced it.</p>
<p>“First off, I want to tell you something, but promise me you won’t be surprised?”</p>
<p>“Surprised? Why would I be…?”</p>
<p>Ignoring him, I transformed into my human shape. It takes a lot less time than any explanation would.</p>
<p><em>“Wha—?!”</em></p>
<p>Yeesh. I warned him and everything. It didn’t help much.</p>
<p>“I told you not to be surprised,” I said as I sat on the chair. As if waiting for her cue, Shuna entered the room—just as planned. She politely bowed and provided Yohm and me with some drinks—a colorless liquid in a pair of glasses, both exquisitely blown from real glass by Dold, the middle of the dwarven brothers.</p>
<p>With another bow, she took position behind me. That was my signal to raise my glass. With a sniff to ensure it was up to my standards, I addressed Yohm.</p>
<p>“So how about a drink?”</p>
<p>Shocked at my metamorphosis and swooning at Shuna’s touching manners, Yohm was frozen in his seat. The offer of something alcoholic helped him snap out of it.</p>
<p>“Uh…yeah. Sure,” he said before downing the entire glass in one go. It immediately triggered a coughing fit.</p>
<p>“…Haghh! Kaff-kaff-kaff… Uggghh, what <em>is</em> that?!”</p>
<p>Shuna hurried over with some water. Yohm drained that glass just as quickly. After a bit more sputtering, he finally regained his composure enough to ask what the hell I just gave him.</p>
<p>“Not used to drinking spirits too often? We held a feast here a bit ago with some folks from the Dwarven Kingdom, but they were kind of disappointed at the lack of booze around this city. We had some beer and wine brought over, and they could pretty much drink that stuff like water—they never get drunk off it, they said. So I figured I’d surprise ’em with a little concoction I’m familiar with. That’s our first test batch.”</p>
<p>And he was my first impartial test subject. Yohm had bragged to me about how strong a drinker he was, so I made him my guinea pig. He had just consumed brandy, a spirit produced by distilling wine, and while I knew it was cheating, I used Analyze and Assess to reproduce the best-tasting brandy I could recall in my mind.</p>
<p>The Glutton unique skill was coming in handy in all kinds of ways. There exists a fine line between fermentation, which is usually a good thing, and spoilage, which isn’t. With Glutton’s food-corrosion properties under the expert control of the Great Sage, I could “corrode” food and drink without producing any harmful materials—in other words, ferment it. This would make producing things like yeast and <em>koji</em> starter a breeze. I had already left yeast production to Shuna, so we had all the bread we wanted, not to mention a few alcoholic beverages. Making <em>koji</em> from scratch was a bigger challenge, and one we were experimenting with, but it would hopefully not be long before I could enjoy some “real” Japanese sake again. I could make soy sauce, too, if I could get my hands on some soybeans.</p>
<p><em>Such</em> a great skill. I can’t stop dreaming up new uses for it. I wasn’t sure if using these jaw-dropping powers to satisfy my personal cravings was such a great idea, but who cares? A tool’s at its best only when you use it to the hilt.</p>
<p>Once I’d advanced to the point of manufacturing fermented beverages, the rest came easy. We had brandy on hand as well as whiskey from applying distillation to the beer process. They were both high in alcohol, enough to burn the throat of someone not used to it, but an aficionado would definitely love how they tasted.</p>
<p>I explained all this to Yohm, showing him how to best enjoy it. My body no longer allowed me to get drunk, sadly, but the sensation was still nostalgic enough that I imagined I felt a tad tipsy regardless.</p>
<p>“Huh. I see. Yeah, you know, this <em>is</em> pretty good, pal!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Though, personally, I think I prefer putting ice right into the glass instead of just watering down this stuff.”</p>
<p>“You’re a man of good taste, Yohm.”</p>
<p>Now that the tension had dissipated, I moved on to the main topic.</p>
<p>“So…”</p>
<p>I gave a broad, sketchy account of my adventures so far. This included my reincarnation and a lot of other details, but it was a toss-up whether he understood much of it. Which was fine. That’s why I offered the drink first. It just wasn’t the kind of tale you could convincingly tell stone-cold sober. If I was gonna go on about how I was chummy with demon lords and such, I had to do it with a smile and a wink.</p>
<p>But Yohm surprised me. “Oh, I believe you,” he said without prompting. “I mean, monsters building an entire city? That’s unthinkable enough right there.”</p>
<p>I’m glad he adapted so easily. He was taking to the brandy like a champ, too, delicately sipping it without hacking his lungs out.</p>
<p>“You believe all that?”</p>
<p>“’Ey, I just said I did, didn’t I? Man, demon lords, though… I bet Carillon has some mean fighters working under ’im.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Hard to say, actually. They aren’t here to fight us. They’re just coming to see if we’re worth building diplomatic ties with.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but didn’t you send Benimaru over there? You wanted ’em to be prepared for anything in that domain, didn’t ya? I’ll betcha <em>they’re</em> thinkin’ the same thing. I’d expect some fairly strong magic-born if I were you.”</p>
<p>“Maybe so, but I don’t think it really matters. If we provoke ’em with a fight, it’s over anyway. Getting all hostile with Carillon won’t earn anything for us. So what I’m trying to tell you is this: Like I said this afternoon, don’t start any arguments with the envoys. And make sure your posse <em>fully</em> understands that, too. I want things to go a little more peacefully this time!”</p>
<p>“You got it, pal. And like I told you, we ain’t stupid enough to pick a fight with folks <em>that</em> dangerous!”</p>
<p>Yeah, I’ll bet.</p>
<p>He had convinced me enough that I dropped the topic. The brandy was a big success; I was sure it’d make an excellent gift on my trip to the Dwarven Kingdom. Yohm and I wound up chitchatting about far less important affairs well into the night.</p>

<p class="tx1">Several days later, right on time, the envoys from the Beast Kingdom of Eurazania arrived. I greeted them in my slime form with Shuna and Shion behind me, along with Rigurd and the other hob-gob bureaucrats. Then there was Soei, keeping tabs on things undercover. If something happened, I was sure he’d hop right out. Yohm’s group was there was well, and by their standards, they were acting downright somber.</p>
<p>The envoys made their way through our ranks in a luxuriant line of gilded wagons. They were pulled by a streak of Thunder Tigers, large magical beasts crackling with lightning that ran across their frame—a potent symbol of military force, one easily visible from long distances. In terms of armor, these tiger wagons of sorts—if you took all the fancy gold and such off them—would probably work as tanks.</p>
<p>“Yep, this is sure a demon lord envoy,” I marveled.</p>
<p>“Ah, it is nothing impressive,” Shion replied, shooting me down. “Compared to the glorious light you bring us every day, Sir Rimuru, taming these beasts is nothing but a bluff.”</p>
<p>Um, Shion? It’s gotta be more impressive than <em>that</em>, isn’t it?</p>
<p>“They’re clearly trying to demonstrate their power to us. You think all this dazzle is ‘nothing impressive’? You sure you aren’t being too pretentious for your own good? ’Cause that ain’t cool.”</p>
<p>“You think? All those needless cosmetics would be meaningless in battle.”</p>
<p>“But we’re not in battle here…”</p>
<p>There’s Shion for you. Her mind never leaves the war zone. Dismissing what was likely Carillon’s handpicked battle lineup just because they weren’t prepared for melee combat right this minute struck me as ridiculous.</p>
<p>“Of course, the artistry of all this decor could use some work. Nothing that Dold couldn’t run laps around—plus, he’s got Kaijin and Garm helping him out. We’re really blessed with good talent that way.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for sayin’ so, Boss!”</p>
<p>“Makes us proud to hear.”</p>
<p>Kaijin and the three dwarf brothers appreciated the compliment, rewarding me with smiles. But I meant it. They had fulfilled all my crazy orders this entire time, and it had really been a huge help. I figured they could use some more recognition.</p>
<p class="space-break">The procession of tiger wagons continued solemnly forward as we spoke. The lead one was the most ostentatiously decorated of all, and when it came to a halt, two women emerged from the door.</p>
<p>The first one had long, shiny white hair that was slick and straight. She was a beauty with a supple body and catlike eyes, but the aura around her was ferocious, suggesting she was a battle-hardened leader. The second woman was just as head turning—this one bewitching with her black-and-gold hair and jewellike snake eyes. She seemed graceful at first, but she practically froze the air with her coldhearted gaze, repelling most who dared to approach her.</p>
<p>They were both magic-born, and not the garden-variety sort. The sheer quantity of magicules they held rivaled that of Phobio at his last visit. If I had to guess…</p>
