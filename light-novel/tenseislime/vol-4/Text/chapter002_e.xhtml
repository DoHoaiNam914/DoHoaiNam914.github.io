<p>“That, um. Yikes.”</p>
<p>“W-well, Boss,” Kaijin said, already stone-cold sober, “we, um, we’re going home. Best of luck with today and, y’know, Shuna and things…”</p>
<p>He headed for the door with the other dwarves, leaving us to pick up the pieces.</p>
<p>“Gobtaaaaaa!! What kind of training have you been giving these idiots?!”</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry, sir!”</p>
<p>With tears in his eyes, Gobta apologized profusely. But this wasn’t the kind of problem a bit of sobbing could solve—and losing my temper would help even less.</p>
<p>Then I heard it.</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> look like you’ve been enjoying yourselves tonight.”</p>
<p>“You were so late coming back, we came to pick you up, Sir Rimuru!”</p>
<p>Shuna’s frigid voice and Shion’s resentful one.</p>
<p><em>It’s all over.</em> The dwarves sat themselves meekly on the floor, preparing for the end. They didn’t quite make it out in time.</p>
<p>Time for me to give up all resistance, I suppose.</p>
<p>“““W-we’re so sorry!!”””</p>
<p>“Hmm? There’s nothing to apologize about.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. We certainly aren’t angry that you didn’t invite us!”</p>
<p>Their hatred ran <em>deep</em> this time. And thus, like perhaps a lot of evenings here at the Night Butterfly, ours ended with us wailing and apologizing to the most fearsome women in our lives.</p>

<p class="tx1">Gobzo, one of Gobta’s Goblin Riders, had put all of us in the doghouse. I thought Gobta was enough of a lost cause, but Gobzo was even worse. Better keep an eye on him.</p>
<p>The next day, after wrapping up our final dinner banquet, I was called into King Gazel’s personal chamber.</p>
<p>“Rimuru,” he said, “I have decided to accept your offer.” He handed me a stack of documents outlining a potential transfer of medical staff to our city. “This is just a draft, so I’d like word on how much you’re willing to accept as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“All right. I’ll bring this home with me and discuss it with my team.”</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, he seemed willing to take on what I had offered him. It was a nice way to end our stay in Dwargon, not to mention begin our journey back.</p>
