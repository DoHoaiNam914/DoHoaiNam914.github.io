<p>“Wowwwwwwww!! That was <em>soooo</em> cool!”</p>
<p>“Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! That dude’s just too damn strong!!”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding me?! He ripped a Lesser Demon apart all by himself…?”</p>
<p>“Hey, take that mask off a sec! I wanna see your face!”</p>
<p>“Oh, what’s the matter?! Hey, ignore that idiot! Let’s party it up later tonight, okay?”</p>
<p>It was quite an uproar.</p>

<p class="tx1">One quickly silenced by the appearance of a single person.</p>
<p>“Enough of this, all of you!!”</p>
<p>One shout from Fuze was enough to halt the ruckus. He ignored the crowd as he walked up to me.</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru, you are…all right, I take it? If something happened to you, it would portend terrible things for us all.”</p>
<p>He looked at me for just a moment, relieved, before bottling that up and turning to Kabal.</p>
<p>“And <em>what</em> are you people doing…? I told you a million times, didn’t I, to just bring Sir Rimuru directly to me? Not to make any side trips? So why do I find him in <em>this</em> state of affairs, hmm?”</p>
<p>Blue veins appeared to pop above his forehead as he scowled at the trio. It was quite impressive, and it made the three freeze in place, giving excuses like “Um” and “Well, you know” and “I tried to stop them…” He wasn’t buying it.</p>
<p>“Silence, you fools! From this moment forward, you will hereby be referred to as the Three Fools of Blumund!!”</p>
<p>“Well, wait a second…”</p>
<p>“That’s just mean! Rimuru said he wanted to become an adventurer, so…”</p>
<p>“…Could we maybe get a better name, please?”</p>
<p>The plaintive request was turned down.</p>
<p>“You idiots! I could have used my guild master privileges to simply award Sir Rimuru a B-ranked license without going through any of this!!”</p>
<p>This was turning into a good scolding. It also told the crowd I was Fuze’s personal guest and a pretty powerful dude.</p>
<p class="space-break">It wasn’t long before I was back in Fuze’s office. The Three Fools kneeled meekly on the floor as Fuze sat there, running a hand up and down his forehead in agony. Thegis was standing right next to him, looking incredibly awkward.</p>
<p>“…I have to say, Sir Rimuru, you really could have done better than to stick out like a sore thumb immediately upon your arrival. There can’t be more than a handful of people in this world who can defeat a Lesser Demon with a single sword strike. Was that some kind of magical weapon? An enchantment or the Aura Sword art wouldn’t produce <em>that</em> much force in one blow. Ah, I imagine the rumor mill will be working overtime in the taverns tonight…”</p>
<p>“…Was it that bad an idea? Like, if you were watching, you could’ve stopped me…”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t exactly provided the <em>time</em> for that, Sir Rimuru!” Fuze sighed. “But what’s done is done. An art that applies magic itself to a weapon is a high-level ability indeed, but I understand that paladins are capable of such a feat. A few A-ranked adventurers in the Free Guild headquarters have unique skills of their own along those lines—such things are not unheard of. But being able to slay demons with it? Unless you want a crowd of people harassing you wherever you go, I would recommend being careful with that move. You may regret being known for it.”</p>
<p>It was Fuze’s opinion that this was all the result of Kabal’s trio failing to follow his orders. But as he put it, there was one silver lining: “The crowd was all a bunch of C ranks and below, so I’m sure they didn’t even realize what they were seeing.”</p>
<p>Magical swords—or in my case, Magic Aura–infused swords—were best used where there weren’t any eyewitnesses, it seemed. Good thing I found that out sooner than later.</p>
<p>“Well, thanks. I’ll watch myself with that.”</p>
<p>Kind of a pity, though. One more test, and I could’ve been in the A ranks. If Fuze was going to make me an honorary B-grade adventurer, I would’ve loved a shot at going all the way. There were also Special A and S ranks, but being an A alone made people treat you quite a bit differently.</p>
<p>“Too bad I was so close to the A rank, though,” I muttered.</p>
<p>“Ahh, that wouldn’t have been possible,” Thegis replied. “Not because you weren’t strong enough for it, Sir Rimuru, but because regulations state a guild branch can only award ranks up to B. You’ll need to take on work and achieve a rank of B-plus before you have the right to tackle that.”</p>
<p>When going from E to D to C to B, you were free to skip ranks and take on a higher one if you’re up for it. Fail that exam, though, and you’ll need to build up enough points before tackling it again. However, qualifying for the A exam required having an established portfolio of work on the field, and it was only offered at the Free Guild HQ in Englesia. Examiners up to A-minus could handle any test up to rank B, but when it came to an A-ranked test, that needed to be held by someone ranked A or higher. Which made sense. <em>I’ll just have to follow Thegis’s guidance and build up my score.</em></p>
<p>“Still,” Thegis said, head bowed, “your strength is nothing short of exemplary, Sir Rimuru. I thought this was all a trick, given it was Kabal referring you to me…but I see I was very wrong about you.”</p>
<p>“Aw, don’t be so mean, Thegis!”</p>
<p>“You really don’t trust us that much?”</p>
<p>“Cut me a break, sir!”</p>
<p>So Thegis and I came to know each other better, regardless of how much the trio over there whined about it. Hopefully, they’ll be driven to restore their good name by looking out for me a bit more during the rest of our journey.</p>
<p class="space-break">So that night, we set out to devise our future plans. It was me, my adventuring friends, Fuze, and Thegis. My main mission, of course, was to meet with Yuuki Kagurazaka, whom I believed I shared a homeland with. Fuze had already written the letter of introduction I asked for via Kabal; I gratefully accepted it and placed it in my Stomach, lest I lose it somewhere. If they could just produce some ID documentation for me, I’d be all set.</p>
<p>“I think your papers will be ready for you tomorrow morning. Tell the person at the counter that I know you, and I’m sure they’ll expedite it.”</p>
<p>“That lady at the counter was in the crowd, too, Boss, I think. I bet she’s a total fan by now!”</p>
<p>“Ooh, could be. Who wouldn’t be after <em>that</em> kind of performance?”</p>
<p>“Yep. It was a treat to watch.”</p>
<p>“It chagrins me as an examiner, but that was some masterful fighting.”</p>
<p>All this praise from Thegis and Kabal’s crew was starting to embarrass me.</p>
<p>“And <em>that</em>,” Fuze mentioned, “is why I was hoping to preemptively award you your accreditation, so you could keep your strength a secret. You’re going to stand out no matter what you do, besides.”</p>
<p>Kabal shrugged. “Yeah, uh, sorry about that.”</p>
<p>““We’re sorry!”” Elen and Gido shouted in unison.</p>
<p>But really, I should have been more considerate myself. Being in a big human town got me so excited, I must have lost my head a little.</p>
<p>“I’ll try not to be so rash next time, either, so hopefully, you’ll forgive them for all this, Fuze.”</p>
<p>For now, the guild master seemed willing to let it slide in the long run.</p>
<p>Our plan, then, was to finish up the prep work by the end of tomorrow and get moving as soon as possible…but Fuze had other ideas. “Actually,” he told us, “the king of Blumund wanted to have a confidential talk with you.”</p>
<p>My arrival must have already reached his ears. Apparently, he was interested in holding a conference in three days. I readily agreed to this. Before that, we planned to have a chat with a well-placed nobleman Fuze knew, in order to discuss the practical issues around our nations’ relationship. The royal summit would then focus on these issues—this would keep it from being “bogged down and rudderless,” as Fuze put it, since meeting the king with no itinerary at all would be a waste of our time. Royal decrees would occasionally come down directly from the king when time was of the essence, but this was rare, and we were in no hurry, so the king just wanted to discuss the more big-picture stuff.</p>
<p>I had no problem with that. If I had three days to kill before the king, I needed to fill that up with something anyway. Plus, I probably would’ve been an unprepared ball of nerves anyway, so knowing what to expect in advance helped me out a lot.</p>
<p>So that took care of tomorrow and three days from now. Our talks continued well into the night, so late we wound up staying in the guest room of Fuze’s guild branch.</p>
<p class="space-break">One more thing I should add: Despite the novelty of being in a human town and all the experiences I’d already had inside, I sadly did not explore any new frontiers with my dreams that night.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">This well-placed noble was a man named Veryard, a baron. He lived in a quiet, unassuming manor in the middle of a neighborhood lined with fancy buildings; apparently, he was too low-level of a noble to have an entire domain to rule over. He thus spent his days working within his house, or castle, or whatever.</p>
<p>“Let me tell you—and promise me you won’t go telling him this—but the man practically lives and breathes his work.”</p>
<p>That was Fuze’s assessment, and I intended to keep my promise. It would apparently be uncomfortable for the guild and nobility if people found out they had underground connections to one another.</p>
<p>So I followed Fuze to the manor. We passed through the eye-catching and well-kept front gardens before entering the foyer, where an old man who looked every bit like your stereotypical butler type greeted us. Maids stood by on each side of the chamber, their heads politely bowed. This was a <em>low-level</em> noble’s house? I worried that this meeting would be a lot more formal than I had planned.</p>
<p>I went to a maid café once in my old world, but these were <em>real</em> maids. It was deeply moving, somehow. Funny that it took me going to another world to discover this air of elegance, this graceful demeanor. The real thing sure is different. Watching them had the odd effect of calming my nerves.</p>
<p>Refreshed, I followed the butler down the hall. He took us to a room on the other end and stopped in front of an ornate-looking door. There was a moment of tension as he knocked on it. “Come in,” said someone on the other side. Kind of an annoying procedure, I thought, but as someone who successfully navigated etiquette in the Dwarven Kingdom’s palace, I was prepared for anything. Whatever I didn’t know about politeness or procedure, I could overcome with pure attitude.</p>
<p>Going in, I was greeted by a very intellectual-looking gentleman with thin, sort of Asian-style eyes. He certainly lived up to the description Fuze gave me.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much for coming,” he said before I could start. “I am the Baron of Veryard, one of the ministers of the Kingdom of Blumund.”</p>
<p>“Many thanks to you as well. My name is Rimuru Tempest, and as I imagine you’re already aware, I am a slime monster. I’m not really well versed on etiquette in this country, so I apologize in advance if I mess something up.”</p>
<p>We shook each other’s hand. Something like this reminded me a lot of my old life.</p>
<p>“Oh, there’s no need to be concerned about such stuffy affairs. Feel free to approach me as you would anyone else.”</p>
<p>The Baron must have seen just how concerned I was about it. He showed me to a seat, being very careful never to let his guard down around me. A shrewd negotiator, no doubt.</p>
<p>“Well!” he said as a maid came in with some tea. He took a sip. “We have only so much time. Let’s begin.”</p>
<p>Fuze, my fellow witness, straightened up. I followed his act, bracing myself and preparing to listen.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Our negotiations with Veryard went on into the night. The gist of it was twofold:</p>
<p class="bl_f">• A joint security agreement between Tempest and Blumund.</p>
<p class="bl_l">• Mutual permission to travel freely within each of our nations.</p>
<p class="space-break">First order of business: The Kingdom of Blumund was, frankly, not very big. It was a relatively weak nation, one that even had issues dealing with the monsters that marauded it. Their relationship with the guild shored up a lot of that, but the government just wasn’t up to the task alone.</p>
<p>Thus, after feeling around to figure out their position, the kingdom had decided to largely subcontract out monster control to the Free Guild in exchange for a boost in funding, allowing the government to focus on intelligence gathering. This let them promptly detect dangers and think of ways to deal with them, allowing them to stave off potential disasters before they happened.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this strategy had kept them from dealing with any major damage so far, but as the Baron put it, there was no such thing as having too many seawalls, so they hoped to build a cooperative relationship with my nation as well. And that was all it was: a promise that, should one nation fall into danger, the other would provide as much support as possible. This included supporting the adventurers working in the Forest of Jura, but didn’t imply anything <em>that</em> special—just an agreement that we’d provide supplies for them in our town.</p>
<p>That much—supporting Free Guild members—Fuze had already asked me for previously. Providing accommodation and materials for people working in the forest would help them cover a broader range, which naturally meant they’d be able to address more threats around the area. It also meant that these guys trusted us, which I liked.</p>
<p>So I happily agreed to this, but—</p>
<p>“Of course, I am sure they’ll be happy to pay a fair price for what you provide. You could perhaps use the inns in our city as a reference for how much to charge—”</p>
<p>“Well, hold on, Baron,” interrupted Fuze. “The accommodations in Sir Rimuru’s town are easily on the same level as the highest-quality inns in this one. Compared to what passes for the norm here, I would call it fair to even charge more.”</p>
<p>“Would you? Well…”</p>
<p>“To be honest, I would call what they offered me more akin to a health spa than an inn.”</p>
<p>“All right. We can think about that later. In terms of weapon and armor maintenance, however—”</p>
<p>“Well, again, sir, their workshops are overseen by Sir Kaijin and his close confidant, Garm, two of the most talented metalworkers in the entire dwarven race. Would you really ask them to handle such rote maintenance work?”</p>
<p>“They work <em>there</em>? Is there anything they could sell us, then, that may…?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid not, Baron. I saw a great deal of weaponry there I have not seen anywhere else. I am talking <em>very</em> high-quality goods—things I never even saw in Englesia’s best forges. I was too cowed to ask whether it was for sale, but by my estimation, one would have to be at least a B-ranked adventurer to consider them. It makes one laugh, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>Fuze was certainly doing a good job at shooting down Baron Veryard’s suggestions. He had a point. The inn we stayed at in that farming village was <em>not</em> very posh. The guild branch here in town wasn’t bad, but in little details like the toilets and baths, our town certainly offered far more comfort.</p>
<p>And those weapons Fuze mentioned weren’t for sale—they were test samples. At this point, we now had a steady supply of assorted raw materials. Gabil was killing off monsters in the caves, Gobta and his crew were doing the same in the forest, and they were transporting anything useful back to town. This occasionally included items from high-ranked monsters, allowing us to craft rarer weaponry. Some great stuff, and I was sure finding a buyer wouldn’t be hard, but we weren’t selling. We need to beef up our own war power first.</p>
<p>Which meant it was time for me to compromise a little.</p>
<p>“All right. I’ll set up a long row house for basic lodging purposes. And as for weapons, I could have our craftsmen take on some apprentices to build up. They should be able to handle basic weapon maintenance within a month or two, I think.”</p>
<p>We could provide the row house by expanding the building we lent Yohm’s men. Those new craftsmen, however, were a more complex issue. Kurobe was toiling away right now, single-handedly building weapons for everybody in the nation. Kaijin was helping craft new ones, using his Researcher unique skill to copy them, but Kurobe didn’t have any Great Sage–type skills like that, so it took time. Not as much as hand forging them all, but…</p>
<p>I couldn’t have him be the only one working that hard, so I had already employed a few enthusiastic young men to be his apprentices. They were proving to be quick learners, and it might not be long before they were full-fledged craftsmen of their own.</p>
<p>That’s why I made that offer to the Baron, and it was clearly welcomed. I agreed to discuss the details with Rigurd and the elders, so we could decide on it later.</p>
<p class="space-break">Now, travel permissions. <em>That</em> was a bit of a thorny path.</p>
<p>When I asked Fuze for his support, I promised to waive customs tariffs for any merchants belonging to the Free Guild. This meant that I <em>would</em> need to collect them from sellers affiliated with the Kingdom of Blumund itself. This was inherently unfair, but I couldn’t renege on my previous promise; at least not for a few years to come.</p>
<p>You might say “What’s the big deal? Why not waive the fees for Blumund merchants, too?” That was something I absolutely couldn’t allow to pass. I couldn’t just fritter away our rights as a sovereign nation without any compensation to show for it. It’d also impugn on any profits guild-affiliated merchants would enjoy, which would be rude to Fuze.</p>
<p>Thus, even as it grew darker outside, the talks between me, Fuze, and the Baron fell into further and further of an impasse. We were all working with certain stakes, which no doubt contributed to how heated things got. Ultimately, though, it was Veryard who blinked first.</p>
<p>“All right. To our kingdom, the most important issues relate to our security agreement. For the tariffs, let us establish a given grace period, during which our government will cover any fees incurred by our merchants.”</p>
<p>So we went with that. All merchants were allowed to enter and leave Tempest free of charge, regardless of who they worked under. Whenever we put formal customs charges in place, we would confer once more to decide on matters.</p>
<p>As I confirmed during our discussions, Veryard was fully aware of the importance of Tempest. He understood it at a more thorough level than I did, even. Traveling to the Dwarven Kingdom via Tempest, as opposed to the Kingdom of Farmus, would be both cheaper and safer to them. The highways weren’t done yet, but once they were, and we had regular traffic going back and forth, the difference would no doubt be dramatic. And once it was all in place, those highways were going to see heavy use, even if Tempest charged a bit of a premium at the borders.</p>
<p>“Hopefully,” the Baron said with a smile, “we will both be on beneficial terms with each other by that time.”</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">After confirming our stances on both issues, I spent the next day casually perusing the capital’s markets. I also stopped by the guild branch again to pick up my ID papers. The woman at the front counter was eyeing me up and down, but I had no time to ask her out on a date.</p>
<p>Kabal and his friends guided me around the whole time, allowing me to enjoy myself thoroughly without getting too lost. We had all the supplies we needed for our journey, too.</p>
<p class="space-break">Then came day three, the day of the royal summit. If we could get a treaty signed here, it would mark a second stamp of approval for our nation after Dwargon’s. A nation of monsters, receiving the formal nod from a nation of humans. The implications were huge. It meant we could interact in peace and even be friendly with regular people.</p>
<p>The security agreement really didn’t offer much benefit to Tempest. In fact, it had many downsides. But the potential revenue we stood to gain from that travel agreement was enormous—and since it was a mutual agreement, it allowed monsters to travel to human towns, which was a pretty major step. I wanted to work on amicable terms with mankind, and I was hopeful we could get something signed during my time here.</p>
<p>So I was pretty excited when we kicked off the summit. There, at the palace, I was greeted by the king, a kind-looking fellow with a round face and a slightly pudgy figure, and the queen, whose sheer beauty made for a shocking imbalance.</p>
<p>Fuze was there to serve as a third-party witness—he was already very familiar with all manners of government affairs, but having a third party in on this implied a sense of fairness to neighboring nations, and Fuze wouldn’t go blabbing about top-secret stuff regardless. He looked uncomfortable in his formal garb—and being in human form all this time was getting a little oppressive for me, too. <em>Better put up with it for now. It’s tough on both of us.</em></p>
<p>The summit proceeded without a hitch, and once assorted ministers had wrapped up their reports to the king, it was over.</p>
<p class="space-break">“I <em>do</em> look forward to working with you in the future, Sir Rimuru,” said the king in his receiving room as he shook both my hands. He was a lot more sociable than I gave him credit for; I felt a natural liking toward him. But this room was also where I learned that Baron Veryard had deceived us.</p>
<p>“Well,” as the king put it, “if some kind of force should ever come out of the forest and threaten to invade us, let us set out to work with each other at once! And we, of course, would be happy to work together with you as well.”</p>
<p>Smiling with his wife, the king left the room just as I realized what he meant by it. I was no longer in any mood to wish him farewell. <em>Some kind of force…?</em> What an odd turn of phrase. It didn’t sound like he was talking about monsters.</p>
<p>I was so focused on those guys, but that certainly wasn’t the <em>only</em> danger out there. Look at Farmus, right next door. If a new trade route was opened to the Dwarven Kingdom, they might see Tempest and Blumund in a negative light for that. And that’s not all! The Eastern Empire, too! They had eyes on being the sole superpower in the land, didn’t they?</p>
<p><em>Oh, crap, I’ve been tricked!!</em></p>
<p>It didn’t take a genius to see that an invasion by some foreign country would be a huge danger to Blumund. I just wanted to scream, right on the spot. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is, huh? Now I recalled Baron Veryard’s smile. He said it himself: “The most important issues relate to our security agreement.” Customs revenue would be chump change compared to a nation’s entire defense budget.</p>
<p>What Blumund was <em>really</em> afraid of was a foreign power invading it through the forest. The Eastern Empire probably had them on constant high alert, and they wanted a bulwark against them. They didn’t lie to me—if <em>we</em> ever got in danger, I bet they <em>would</em> come to help. It’d be our turn next, after all.</p>
<p>They got me good.</p>
<p>The Baron chose this moment to address me. “It would appear you have noticed? Your mind certainly works quicker than I gave you credit for, earlier. However, the treaty has already been signed. I <em>do</em> hope we will continue to have a fruitful relationship.”</p>
<p>He gave me the biggest cheese-eating grin I ever saw. He performed his duties flawlessly, no doubt about it. A sly old noble who found tricking me as easy as taking candy from a baby. <em>Pfft. Ah well. Not much I can do about it here…</em></p>
<p>But despite all this, I felt oddly serene about it all. It was more frustration at my shallowness and admiration for my opponent than anything. All a learning experience. <em>If the Empire makes a move, I’ll think matters over then.</em></p>
<p>It did tell me one thing, though: I couldn’t let my guard down around human beings. Monsters were so unexpectedly straightforward with everything, which created an opening large enough for humans and their cunning to drive a truck through. I swore to myself that I’d think things over more deeply and carefully when negotiating with them from now on.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><em>But it’s no fun to just sit here and be treated like a fool. I’ve got a decent opportunity here, still, to engage in some discussion that’ll be a lot more helpful for my side.</em> I took a High Potion out from my pocket and placed it on the desk.</p>
<p>“And what’s this?”</p>
<p>“With that treaty in place,” I said, “could I ask you a favor?”</p>
<p>“…Hohhh, a favor? Well, as your partner in diplomacy, I could hardly refuse to hear you out.”</p>
<p>The Baron flashed me another perfect smile. He’s definitely a pro at this.</p>
<p>“This is a healing potion that we made over in our town. I was thinking we could sell this in your marketplace…”</p>
<p>“What?! The potion that Kabal brought back, some time ago? Was this the ‘specialty’ you were proposing earlier?”</p>
<p>It was Fuze instead of Veryard who latched on to the offer.</p>
<p>“Oh, um, yeah. I <em>did</em> give him some, didn’t I?” I gave Kabal some of the medicine I had crafted myself, the equivalent of a Full Potion. “But this is different from that. Not quite as potent, but I promise you it’s a much better product than anything you’ll find on sale now. What <em>he</em> had is more of a rarity—something we can craft perhaps every two days. <em>These</em>, meanwhile, we can manufacture more readily, so I thought about putting these up on the market. The only real difference from what you saw, Fuze, is that this can’t regenerate missing limbs.”</p>
<p>I had meant that as a bombshell, making sure to lowball our production capabilities while I was at it. The effect was dramatic. “Regenerate missing limbs?” the Baron parroted back. “You mean, if you lose an arm in battle or an accident, <em>his</em> potion can grow a completely new one out of thin air?”</p>
<p>“Not really ‘grow,’ so much as…like, it gathers magicules from the air to create a replacement, you could say? But over time, once blood starts circulating through it, and your body metabolism goes back to normal, it’ll look and act just like the old limb.”</p>
<p>“What nonsense!”</p>
<p>Now the cool, collected Baron looked like he was in a panic. Looks like I scored a hit with him. This was exactly why I kept telling Kaijin to keep quiet about it.</p>
<p>“If what you say is true, that is equivalent to <em>holy</em> magic, the exclusive secret of the Western Holy Church! In fact, it is the holy spell Regeneration itself, the product of a pact with the spirits above us! A divine miracle! Only those ranked bishop or higher are capable of harnessing it!”</p>
<p>He paused a moment, regaining his composure, then looked around. His outburst had attracted some attention, but no one had overheard the conversation. The moment he sensed this, he had said “Let us discuss this elsewhere” and began walking off. Fuze and I had no issue with this, so we wound up settling down in the Baron’s study once again.</p>
<p>The moment Fuze and Veryard entered the manor, they looked at each other and sighed. “Well, well,” the Baron sighed, “what shall we do with <em>this</em>, then?”</p>
<p>“Is it all right for you if we appraise its value?” Fuze asked.</p>
<p>“Go right ahead.”</p>
<p>He chanted a spell to gauge the potion’s contents.</p>
<p>“Hmm… I really can’t tell the difference between this and what Kabal’s party was carrying.” Fuze scratched his head. “We tested out that previous potion as well, but I never dreamed it could replace entire limbs. They said it was equivalent to magical medicine or holy magic, but I was certainly <em>not</em> expecting Regeneration-class performance…”</p>
<p>By that, I doubted he meant they tested it out on someone who’d just had an arm chopped off. It wasn’t the kind of thing one would volunteer for. If I didn’t bring up the High Potion’s limits, I doubt he would have ever noticed the difference.</p>
<p>“Do you have any of those remaining?” Veryard asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, one—for safekeeping.”</p>
<p>They must have used up the rest for their experimentation.</p>
<p>“Bring it here at once.”</p>
<p>Fuze nodded. “The only way to prove this,” he muttered as he sent a magical message out into the ether, “is with Thegis.”</p>
<p class="space-break">My former test examiner was with us in a moment—a small safe under his arm.</p>
<p>“What is the meaning of this, Fuze?” he bellowed as he walked in, but he fell silent as he realized Veryard and I were there.</p>
<p>“I want you to promise,” the Baron said, “that you will keep everything you see and hear in this room a secret.”</p>
<p>He described himself as a minor bureaucrat in this kingdom, but the dignity and presence he exuded was enough to put even a prince in his place.</p>
<p>“I promise you, sir,” Thegis hurriedly replied with a confused nod as the Baron took the safe from him.</p>
<p>“So this is the item…?” He took out the contents—one of the potions I had made—and carefully observed it. “I have little knowledge of magic, but this one shines true, that much I can tell. Certainly, I feel this is no ordinary medicine. Let’s test the potion <em>you</em> have first, Fuze.”</p>
<p>To my great surprise, he intended to have Thegis remove his leg prosthesis and test the potion’s effects on that. Would it work on a wound that old? It’d be interesting to see, actually. Following his instructions, we first tried the High Potion on the stump. As expected, there was no external change.</p>
<p>Next up, my self-crafted potion. The moment we sprinkled it on, a pale, shining light covered the site, transforming itself into the shape of a leg before our eyes. It proved, once and for all, that the age of the wound didn’t matter. Maybe a Full Potion could read information from the body’s DNA or something to do its work. Whatever it did, it sure wasn’t simple—but either way, it meant I had a medicine that outclassed just about anything modern science in my world could come up with.</p>
<p>“Wha…?! My—my leg…?!”</p>
<p>“This… This is astounding…”</p>
<p>“Good heavens. Another amazing secret you bear, is it not?”</p>
<p>The three gave me looks of blank surprise.</p>
<p>I’d let this doozy slip mostly just to get back at Veryard a bit, but it only served to further damage my stance—perhaps even severely. Loose lips really <em>do</em> sink ships. I had hoped to gain a new advantage in our negotiations, but things had now grown much larger than that.</p>

<p class="tx1">In the end, we agreed to frame it so Thegis’s leg was healed by a mysterious robed bishop for a king’s ransom in money. Thegis sure wasn’t complaining—it let him get out from behind his desk at the branch office and get back to adventuring. He profusely thanked us all as he agreed to the backstory.</p>
<p>As far as my sales pitch went, Blumund agreed to purchase a set quantity of High Potions from us on regular occasions. They would also select preferred merchants of their choice to spread the word about this medicine to the Western Nations. We still weren’t making mass quantities, so hopefully, they could keep a damper on customer growth for the time being. If adventurers started hearing the stories and coming to Blumund to find out more, that’d help spread the word about Tempest right nearby, too.</p>
<p>For now, I just wanted to build a trustworthy name for ourselves. Pitching it as medicine made by monsters didn’t sound like effective ad copy to me, but once people saw for themselves what this stuff could do, I doubted it’d keep them from becoming regular customers. At the moment, getting it into their hands and letting them see how useful it was took first priority.</p>
<p>So there’s another regular purchase base, then. A good first step, I thought. I really didn’t want to be hostile with human beings; I’d have to work harder to build friendly relationships with the other human nations of the world.</p>
<p class="space-break">It was time to say good-bye to Fuze.</p>
<p>“I do hope you’ll remain careful on the trail, Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“I’m telling you, I’ll be fine. Just make sure nobody goes into that room, all right?”</p>
<p>“Nothing to worry about there. You can only access it through my office, the branch manager’s chamber.”</p>
<p>That was a relief. I had a magisteel teleportation circle installed in “that room,” about three feet across. When I showed it to him, he was agog. “Teleportation, even…?” he marveled. “But then, I suppose nothing should surprise me by now, Sir Rimuru…”</p>
<p>I set this up so people could come visit Tempest whenever they wanted. We had agreed to the outlines of the treaty, but we hadn’t designated any merchants yet, and I’d need an easier way to access the Kingdom of Englesia, besides. Thus, I asked to borrow a room from Fuze for use as a Warp Portal.</p>
<p>I should note, by the way, that once the Great Sage analyzed the Warp Portal elemental magic, it arranged things so I could manage multiple entry and exit points at once. I still needed a physical magic circle at each site, but they could now open paths to multiple exits at once, which was extremely convenient. We’d need to make sure nobody could steal those magisteel portals, though… Hopefully we could find a way to eliminate that worry sometime. Not that I’d tell <em>these</em> guys if we did.</p>
<p>As I was dreaming about future advancements in teleportation tech, Fuze was saying good-bye to Kabal as well.</p>
<p>“And you guys keep Sir Rimuru safe, all right, Kabal?”</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>“You got it!”</p>
<p>“The road to Englesia’s safe enough. It’ll be a cinch for us!”</p>
<p>“Do <em>not</em> treat this as easy,” Thegis bellowed again. “I am willing to forgive your behavior as long as you keep Sir Rimuru guarded. I will not allow you to shirk your duty!”</p>
<p>His new leg had revitalized him in many ways. He was just as strong as he used to be, and his presence loomed larger than ever. But he wouldn’t be hitting the road just yet—it sounded like he’d agreed to become the palace magician for the kingdom, although he’d still run guild testing until they found a replacement. That came at the Baron’s suggestion, no doubt—he never kept anyone who knew his secrets <em>too</em> far out of reach.</p>
<p class="space-break">So I had my guild paper, along with a new wholesale client. And not only that—I had built formal relations with one of the Western Nations, albeit a small one. It was nothing to sniff at achievement-wise as I left the Kingdom of Blumund behind me. A good start, I felt.</p>
<p>Next up was the Kingdom of Englesia, home of the Free Guild headquarters. I still had those children from my dreams in mind, and I wanted to gather some intel on Hinata Sakaguchi as well. But before that, let’s try meeting with guild master Yuuki Kagurazaka first. I had my intro papers, so it shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>Time to get back on the road.</p>
