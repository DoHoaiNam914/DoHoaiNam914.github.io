<p>The kids wound up falling asleep while I was assembling that golem, finally released from a long period of anxiety and fear. Being freed of all the stress they’d put up with must’ve made them totally at ease; they were sleeping peacefully, with Ranga serving as a pillow. I didn’t need sleep, but with kids, that’s part of the job description. <em>Sleep well and grow up strong.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s wait for them to wake up</em>, I thought as I decided to rest a bit myself.</p>
<p>The next morning, once their energy was restored, I took the kids out of the Dwelling of the Spirits. They all had elementals within them; their lives were no longer in danger. I had answered Shizu’s wish beyond her death, and all our problems were behind us. <em>Now</em>—I thought, at least—<em>I can go back to Tempest in peace.</em></p>

<p class="tx1">Upon leaving the maze, I used my new Spatial Motion extra skill to bring the kids back with me to Englesia. Connecting two fields of physical space together required several minutes of work, but it let you revisit any location you’ve been to before, making it pretty helpful. I also picked up the magic ring I dropped off outside as an escape route. I didn’t need it to execute Spatial Motion, so I stored it in my Stomach, as much as I doubted I’d ever use it again.</p>
<p>Once back at the academy, I immediately made contact with Yuuki, reporting on the results of our journey and going in-depth on the children’s futures. I had considered taking them in for good, but I also thought children like them really needed the right learning environment to thrive in. We had this academy here, filled with talented teachers. They could receive both a basic education and magic in the same place.</p>
<p>Thus, we decided they would remain here at the academy to learn. Seeing my magic for themselves must’ve convinced them how useful it was. They did cry, however, when I told them I was leaving. I promised I’d attend all their graduations, and of course, they were eager to welcome me.</p>
<p>Really, they’d be fine now. Their magical energy levels were now restricted to a little above the average, allowing them to live normal lives. Even someone with magical Assessment skills wouldn’t notice what’s going on inside them.</p>
<p>It was a topic I also discussed with Yuuki a bit. “Once a nation’s abandoned a child,” he reasoned, “I doubt they’ll try to take them back again. That’s a violation of international law, and it’d also make them enemies of the Free Guild.”</p>
<p>“You think maybe we could have them earn their adventurer’s cards and become guild members?”</p>
<p>“Hmm… Perhaps we could, yes, if they want to.”</p>
<p>“Sure. They’ll have time to think about it as students.”</p>
<p>“That they will.”</p>
<p>They were still children, but in this world, you were considered grown-up at age fifteen. It wouldn’t be long until they were all that age, qualified to join the Free Guild. They’d get to do whatever they want, living in pure, unrestricted freedom.</p>
<p>Yuuki also pressed me several times on how I solved their problems, but that was a secret. He assumed the children were just normal kids now, and I was fine with that. Their surging magicules were actually being neutralized by elementals, but I didn’t see the need to tell anyone about that. That really <em>could</em> make them the targets of rogue players worldwide, setting off wholly new problems for them.</p>
<p>The children had already been assigned new schedules and teachers. My role in their education was more or less over. They had undergone basic combat training, as well as gotten used to speaking with their pseudo-elementals. In between, we went out on picnics, with Kabal’s team stopping by for fun sometimes.</p>
<p>Potion sales, meanwhile, were going well. When I finally visited Mjöllmile in Blumund, I received a hero’s welcome. He had the profits he wanted, and I was happy with that, too. And every time I came back to Tempest, I saw more and more adventurers taking advantage of our lodging. It was turning into a lively place. I’d better get back for good soon, before some other huge problem reared its ugly head.</p>
<p>—The time had come to go home.</p>
<p class="space-break">It was the day of my departure.</p>
<p>“You… You’re leaving, Mr. Rimuru?”</p>
<p>“You can’t make him wait any longer, Clo.”</p>
<p>“No, but I… I mean…”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>Chloe was about to cry. I wasn’t feeling much better myself…but, you know, I could pop on over anytime I want with Spatial Motion. This wasn’t the end.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! You’re such a crybaby, Chloe. Here, how about something to cheer you up?”</p>
<p>I removed the mask I had on and gave it to her. The Mask of Magic Resistance, a memento of Shizu’s that was broken once before I repaired it. I wasn’t sure what drove me to give it to her; it just seemed like the natural thing to do. She accepted it without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Awwwwww! I wanted it, too…”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! It’s all mine now!”</p>
<p>It cheered Chloe up, so I was happy. For the crestfallen Alice, meanwhile, I had a school uniform Shuna prepared for her.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“Are these for us?”</p>
<p>I had outfits for Kenya and Gail—Ryota, too, of course. They looked the same as all the other uniforms in the academy, but they were sewn with sturdier custom cloth. The children all gleefully accepted them.</p>
<p>“Now listen, I want you guys to keep studying, all right? It’s hard to say good-bye like this, but it’s not like I’ll never see you again. Come over to my town once you’re on break, okay?”</p>
<p>“““Okay!”””</p>
<p>The children saw me off, their teary eyes turning into smiles. I left the Englesian capital while the smiles were still fresh on their faces.</p>

<p class="tx1">It seemed like a short trip to human lands, but it wound up extending for quite a while. It was tough going, but I’d built some bonds I could never replace, not for anything in the world. Getting to interact with children like that again, as a slime, was something I never could’ve dreamed of.</p>
<p>Everything seemed to be going great.</p>
<p class="space-break">—Or perhaps, a little <em>too</em> great.</p>
<p class="space-break">In a world like this, negative emotions like jealousy and envy can unknowingly fester in the hearts of your peers. I had intended to be careful in all my actions, lest I become the target of such feelings.</p>
<p>But as they say, garbage in, garbage out. The Great Sage had astounding predictive skills, but if I gave it the wrong questions, it’d give me the wrong answers.</p>
<p>If Tempest grew prosperous, that meant somebody was going to lose out in the backlash. I instinctively knew that, of course, but I didn’t think it would happen at a scale or speed beyond my expectations.</p>
<p>During my time as a slime here, I had my own small ambitions. To live among the humans I looked up to. To make contact with otherworlders. I had made that happen, and now, in my new homeland of Tempest, I was building the foundation for even greater developments. In a way, I had already succeeded, and in another, I had failed.</p>
<p>I was just a regular person; I didn’t understand much about government or politics. About the cold egoism and Machiavellianism that often reigns. Now, fate was making changes at an ever more rapid pace, forcing me to settle upon my future direction.</p>
<p class="space-break">The days of peace were drawing to a close; days of war were beginning.</p>
