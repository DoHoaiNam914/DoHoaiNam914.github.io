<p>“What are you talking about? I want you to be serious with me! Honestly, I’m impressed you think this is a great time to goof off!”</p>
<p>Yikes. Yuuki looked pretty pissed. I figured a little joke would help ease the tension, but maybe not…</p>
<p>“All right, all right. I’ll be serious now, so just chill out a little…”</p>
<p>“You come all the way here, and that’s the joke you go for? That’s the first time I’ve heard <em>that</em> one. Are you by any chance…?”</p>
<p>Yuuki guessed it before I could even say it. I decided to start from the beginning.</p>
<p>“So…I was attacked by this guy on the street…”</p>
<p>I spent the next while going into minute detail about what happened.</p>
<p>“Ah… So you <em>are</em> Japanese, huh, Rimuru…?”</p>
<p><em>Heh-heh. Just as planned.</em> I make a joke that only someone with my background would understand, and he was instantly on my side. It made him angry at first, but, hey, it worked! The quickest way to make him realize who I really was! (Whether he believed that was my intention is another issue, but, um, it worked!)</p>
<p>Once we got through with that, we talked about all kinds of things. What we’d been up to in this world. Our trials and tribulations. Shizu’s final moments.</p>
<p>“That’s how she decided to go…? I have to admit, she often told me about how much she didn’t like this world…”</p>
<p>Yuuki closed his eyes.</p>
<p class="space-break">No point dwelling on dreary topics. I brought up other things from our old world. He demonstrated a particularly keen interest in how his favorite manga and anime wound up ending.</p>
<p>“Aw, come on! You gotta tell me what happened after that!”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! You wanna know? Well, guess what—? Pretty much all the manga and anime you mentioned ended by the time I left! And you <em>know</em> I kept up with all of it. A true gentleman always makes sure to cover all the bases!”</p>
<p>“That’s amazing! Please, sir! Please, give me your knowledge!”</p>
<p>He was starting to sound frantic. It made the woman from before almost drop her tray of tea and snacks when she teleported back in. Maybe I took it a little too far.</p>
<p>“Well, here, I’ll show you, then. Do you have a piece of paper?”</p>
<p>“Paper?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Yuuki gave me a doubtful look as he provided me with one. I swallowed it into my stomach—</p>
<p>“There, all set.”</p>
<p>—and took out my finished work, handing it to Yuuki.</p>
<p>“Wh-whoaaaaaaa!! What kind of magic trick is this, sir?!”</p>
<p>I couldn’t blame him for his surprise. I had just handed him a neatly bound volume of manga.</p>
<p>This was the result of me wringing everything I could out of the Great Sage. I basically took the paper and copied the images I replayed from my memory upon it. Talk about a waste of a great talent. Real effective, though.</p>
<p>“Right! If you want to read more, I’ll need some more paper to work with!”</p>
<p>Without a word, Yuuki stood up and ordered another woman to bring some paper. His face was dead serious, so the woman quickly stepped up to bring a few reams down. I spent the next little bit burning all my memories upon them, making sure to keep the extra sheets for myself. Paper was still a high-end product—what I took was worth a small fortune. Never hurts to have some. I had some actual, non-stupid uses for it, too.</p>
<p>Plus, Yuuki sure wasn’t complaining. I bet not being able to catch up on his favorite series was a big disappointment for him. Getting that chance in <em>this</em> world, he had nothing to complain about.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much, sir!”</p>
<p>Of course, some of the series he requested hadn’t gone much of anywhere plot-wise, much less wrapped up publication. It sucks how <em>those</em> are often the most engaging series. <em>I</em> wanted to know how some of those turned out, too. Hopefully another Japanese otherworlder will show up in, like, ten years or so to fill me in.</p>
<p>“You know, Rimuru, I wanted to ask you…”</p>
<p>“Oh? What’s that?”</p>
<p>“When you signed on for the guild, how did you fill out the entry form? You didn’t have any time to learn the language in this world, did you?”</p>
<p>Oof. Talk about hitting you where it hurts.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! Well, about that. It’s because I studied this language, of course! After days of unbending effort, I should add!”</p>
<p>The Sage was deciphering and copying everything I needed for me, actually. But Kabal and the gang <em>did</em> teach me the basic alphabet, and the rest came quickly after that.</p>
<p>“Really? You didn’t use some magic cheat or anything…? Because learning the language was one of the toughest things I dealt with, coming here.”</p>
<p>“Oh, um, ummm, don’t be silly! No matter how old you get, studying never stops being important!”</p>
<p>I wavered a bit, but I think I managed to keep the facade going. It hurt a little, seeing Yuuki show me such respect, but I wasn’t strictly lying, so it’s all good. The Sage was what let me read and understand things, but, hey—that’s my ability. Just because I omitted that fact didn’t make it any less true.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">Over dinner, our conversation drifted back toward more serious topics—in particular, about what we’d both do next.</p>
<p>“So you risked your life to travel here, Rimuru, because Miss Shizu said we’re both from Japan? I mean, I’d love to keep helping you going forward, but was that your only motive?”</p>
<p>“How do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I just thought you might have some other reason. Like, maybe you’re trying to find a way back home or something?”</p>
<p>Back home.</p>
<p>Yes, I had thought about it. But I gave up on it. I was already dead over there; I was sure they’d cremated my body long ago. There wasn’t really anyplace for me to return to. I’d just make everyone’s lives chaotic. If they thought about me now and then, reflecting on the good old days, I was okay with that. To younger otherworlders, however, I’m sure getting back home was their number-one priority.</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s possible?” I asked. I was greeted with silence. Not that easy, I guess. He would’ve done it already if it was. That’s about what I figured.</p>
<p>“Well,” Yuuki said, “it kinda looks like a one-way street. That’s because this world is…I guess you could call it semi-physical.”</p>
<p>He went into detail on what he knew so far. Essentially, our old planet was a purely physical world—a world free of magicules. The opposite of that is a purely spiritual world—one teeming with spirits, demons, angels, and other mystic life-forms; one full of mysterious and astonishing energy. The two were polar opposites but still retained some deep, important connections.</p>
<p>Which led to this world—a world of chaos. An extremely unique entity—one that shared properties from both the physical and spiritual worlds. Its atmosphere was packed with magicules, allowing fairies, ghouls, and other spiritual life-forms to manifest themselves—something Yuuki figured out via his own experimentation.</p>
<p>Traveling from a physical world to this one meant that our own bodies had to be broken down once, then rebuilt in semi-physical form. That, he explained, was likely why we couldn’t go back to a purely physical world again.</p>
<p>“However,” he added, “I don’t think it’s a zero-chance possibility. Japan’s full of stories about demons and monsters and things, and you see the same kinds of tales and myths all over the world. So if we’re able to get the conditions just right, I’m thinking that maybe we can, you know?”</p>
<p>He sounded right to me. I had my own thoughts about it, too. It all felt like a vague fever dream at this point, but I definitely remembered hearing the World Language from pretty much the moment I was stabbed. There was definitely <em>some</em> kind of connection between Earth and this world it had to ride on.</p>
<p>“Plus… You can cast magic, can’t you, Rimuru?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I replied to the sudden topic change, “I had a spell or two taught to me.”</p>
<p>Yuuki squinted at me, jealous. “That sure is nice… I was really excited about magic, too, at first…”</p>
<p>As he put it, when he first came to this world, he both lamented his plight and fostered a deep fascination for the unknown force of magic. I was the same way. Anyone who’s a fan of manga and anime must have wished they could toss around magic at least once in their lives.</p>
<p>“I wanted to learn some, but for some reason, I just couldn’t do it. I think it’s because of the way my body changed. It felt so, like, <em>romantic</em>, too, but no…”</p>
<p>Yep. Something adventurous to it, isn’t there? If something’s right there at your fingertips, of course you’ll wanna try it out. But Yuuki just didn’t have the right characteristics for it. Reality sucks sometimes.</p>
<p>“Still, I can perform research into it. And what I found was that in this world, magic is the power to interfere with the laws of nature. There’s a mysterious set of laws to this world—people call them the World Language—and when you earn a new power, or the value of your life rises in some way, like when you evolve, then that’s how nature tells you about it. Magic runs under the same rules as this World Language; when you cast the spell, it turns that nonphysical phenomenon into real life. And if you look at it the other way…”</p>
<p>Yuuki paused. I tried to guess where this was going. Look at it the other way…</p>
<p>“Everything has a cause and an effect, and if you figure out the laws behind all that, you might even be able to find a way home…is what you’re saying?”</p>
<p>I was familiar with the World Language. My skill, the Great Sage, used the term when talking to me. It was my familiarity with it that led me to that conclusion.</p>
<p>“…Right. That’s very good, Rimuru. I’m surprised… You understood a concept that I had to spend years researching.”</p>
<p>Take the concept of “returning home,” render it into a set of laws, and translate it into the World Language. Easy for <em>me</em> to say, but trying to discover those laws would take a lifetime of research. Even with that much effort, it may not be possible at all.</p>
<p>But if you were able to interfere with the World Language on a deeper level…</p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl">……………………………………</span></p>
<p class="space-break">The Sage was silent. No, a skill like that’s just a fairy tale. Guess we’d just have to keep plugging away on that research.</p>
<p>Yuuki gave me a wry grin. “Of course, I’d never have enough time to uncover all of it, I guess. I’d have to decipher and evaluate each of the laws, one by one.”</p>
<p><em>And that’s probably his main goal. I’m sure he’ll keep up his research.</em></p>
<p>“Well, I’ll definitely help you with whatever I can, and I’ll try doing a little research on my side, too.”</p>
<p>I had to volunteer to pitch in. I just had to give a shout-out to his spirit.</p>
<p class="space-break">“But anyway, if you aren’t trying to return home, what brought you here, Rimuru?”</p>
<p>Now he was getting back on topic. I figured he deserved a full answer.</p>
<p>“Well, if I can kick back and chill out a little in this life, that’s all I really want. I’ve got a town pretty well built up, and basically, I’m just in this to have fun with my friends. But there’s something that’s been bothering me lately…”</p>
<p>My other mission. I needed to purchase magic stones and check out the cities, figuring out how advanced their civilization was—that was important. But I hadn’t forgotten the biggest one. The children I saw in my dreams.</p>
<p>“…I see. Miss Shizu must have been really worried for them. But those kids are… Well, if that’s what she wants you to do, then I trust you are up to it.”</p>
<p>He then dived into a long story, telling me about the children I saw in detail.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">After the end of our long conversation, I walked out of the guild headquarters, offering to treat my friends to dinner for making them wait so long. “Oh, don’t worry about it,” they all said, but it was already early evening—Yuuki and I had been talking practically from dawn till dusk. I wasn’t expecting the meeting to go on for so long, so I felt bad for them.</p>
<p class="space-break">We went to a restaurant with a famed reputation across the city, a far cry from our lodging. As we greedily tucked into the gourmet dishes ferried to us, I went over everything Yuuki and I had agreed to.</p>
<p>“So yeah, starting a week from now, I’ve agreed to become a schoolteacher.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Where did <em>that</em> come from?”</p>
<p>“You sure are a joker, Boss!”</p>
<p>Neither Kabal nor his cohorts were ready to believe it at first. Sheesh. Better start from the beginning.</p>
<p>“Basically, I’m gonna be living in an empty room in the school dorm starting tomorrow. I told you about the dreams I’ve been having, right? Yuuki thinks he knows them, so he’s setting me up to work as their teacher.”</p>
<p>They responded with several questions, which I answered in order. I had succeeded in convincing them by the time we finished dinner, although they still couldn’t hide their exasperation.</p>
<p>“Wow, Boss. A teacher, though, huh…?”</p>
<p>“Pretty hard to imagine…”</p>
<p>“I’m worried for those kids.”</p>
<p><em>What’re you looking at me like that for, Gido?</em></p>
<p>“Yeah, so as far as it goes for you guys, today marks the end of you guiding me around on this journey.”</p>
<p>“…Kinda sudden, Boss.”</p>
<p>“I thought we were contracted to stick with you until we were back?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’ll be fine! That’s why I set up that teleportation circle, right? Because I figured something like this might happen. This way, I can go back to Tempest or Blumund in the blink of an eye. Gonna be a bit harder for you guys, though, huh? Good luck out there!”</p>
<p>“Whoa, whoa, are you serious? I thought we’d be taking that wolf wagon back, man…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, really! Ugh, just <em>thinking</em> about the journey now makes me so depressed!”</p>
<p>“Aw, c’mon, Kabal,” chided Gido. “And you, too, Elen. You guys are getting too used to life on easy street, aren’tcha? Not that I’m lookin’ forward to getting battered and bruised on a regular wagon again, but…”</p>
<p>These guys… One moment, they’re going on about how they’ll take responsibility and keep me guarded till the bitter end; the next, they’re whining about losing their luxury travel. It was certainly in character for them all, but still.</p>
<p>So the four of us proceeded to drink away the loneliness and regret until late that night. The next morning, just outside the city gates, I said my final good-byes to the extremely hungover trio.</p>
<p>“Drop us a line if anything happens, Boss!”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you’ll be fine without us…?”</p>
<p>“We’ll miss havin’ you around, but take care! Let us know when you’re back in town!”</p>
<p>“Sure thing,” I said. “I’ll let you know if something comes up.”</p>
<p>I whipped our wagon out of my Stomach. A merchant was already approaching us, two horses in tow.</p>
<p>“Uh, Boss… Aw, man, why?”</p>
<p>“You—you aren’t…?”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?!”</p>
<p>Ignoring their pleas, I ordered the seller to hitch his horses to the wagon. “All right, thanks for delivering ’em,” I said as I signed his payment form. Kabal and company had finally accepted the bitter truth by then.</p>
<p>“Yeah, so consider this wagon a parting gift for you guys, okay? Give it back to Rigurd if you don’t need it.”</p>
<p>“Uh, I think we’re gonna need it a lot, Boss!”</p>
<p>“You’re so nice to us, Sir Rimuru!”</p>
<p>“Whew! What a man. I wish Fuze could learn to be this nice to his people.”</p>
<p>They were all touched by the gift. I’m glad the surprise was a success. One more thing—</p>
<p>“Your payment’s inside the wagon, too. Check it out later—”</p>
<p><em>—later, if you like</em>, is what I meant to say, but they were already scrambling to climb in before I could finish.</p>
<p>“Whoooaaa! Lookit this shield!!”</p>
<p>“Aaaaahhhh! This staff is incredible!!”</p>
<p>“Well, look at this! That’s one <em>damn</em> sharp-looking dagger. Wait, is this a magic weapon?!”</p>
<p><em>Man, they’re like hyenas.</em> I was hoping they’d open up the boxes while I wasn’t around, but <em>that</em> idea sure went to waste.</p>
<p>“Sheesh, you guys… Ah well. That’s your payment. One Scale Shield for Kabal, one Dryad’s Staff for Elen, and one Tempest Dagger for Gido. Take care of ’em for me, okay?”</p>
<p>“Of course, Boss!”</p>
<p>“We’d be crazy not to! How did you know I was in the market for a new staff…? Thank you so much, Sir Rimuru!”</p>
<p>“But, um…these are all Uniques, aren’t they?! I don’t think I’ve ever seen a weapon as amazing as this one. Are you <em>sure</em> about this, Boss?”</p>
<p>“Sure, I’m sure. We didn’t pay anything for the materials. The staff’s a gift that Treyni was nice enough to supply, so treat it with care, got it?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, yes!”</p>
<p>Elen lovingly rubbed the side of her face against the staff. I was sure she’d treat it just fine without me harping on it. Kabal’s and Gido’s weapons were manufactured goods, but the Dryad’s Staff really <em>was</em> one of a kind, so. If she lost or broke it, Treyni would probably have my head for it—and I told her it was for Elen, too, so I was more worried than I should be, probably.</p>
<p>Kabal’s Scale Shield was another product from the mind of Garm, crafted from scales taken from the Charybdis—the same scales forged by Kurobe to make Gido’s Tempest Dagger, which was infused with wind magic to boost the holder’s physical speed. We still retained a rather large cache of those scales from the battle—I had given several hundred to King Gazel as a thank-you gift. The ones I had personally consumed were still in practically mint condition. We had researched putting them to use in battle equipment, and these two items were the first complete test samples. As Gido said, they were Unique-caliber weapons.</p>
<p>Thanks to the three of them ripping open their presents early, this was no longer any kind of lonesome, depressing good-bye for us. They were all in high spirits as I saw them off—which is fine. Nobody likes sad farewells. Besides, all the excitement seemed to cure their hangovers. And this is Kabal’s gang we’re talking about—they’d no doubt come groveling to me for help with some other crisis soon.</p>
<p>Thus, it was with an odd sense of satisfaction that I sent them on their way.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Once they were gone, it was time to kick off my big move.</p>
<p>All it really entailed, of course, was heading to the dorm and picking up my key. Once I filled out all the paperwork, I told the manager that I’d be moving in that night. As Yuuki excitedly put it to me, I’d get to enjoy “a dedicated staff dormitory, plus three meals and ten silver coins per day!” The manager confirmed that with me, stating they’d get the place cleaned up before the day was through.</p>
<p>The average salary in the capital, by the way, was seven silver a day. Educators were treated a lot better around here than I would’ve guessed. A night at our inn cost four silver, not including meals, and while it was nice inside, it still felt pricey compared to that joint in the farming village. It’d be much more economical to move into the dorm Yuuki had for me.</p>
<p>I also took a quick peek inside while I was there. It wasn’t a major step down from last night’s inn. I was happy with it.</p>
<p>Like I told Kabal and the gang, I’d begin teaching in seven days, although I’d need to report to school in six to manage the handover. Thus, I had five days to use however I wanted, although this particular day was mostly spent purchasing assorted household goods. I had the budget to purchase most of what I wanted and have it carted back to the dorm, touring around the city a little more as I shopped the day away.</p>
<p>I occupied most of the next day unpacking and organizing all the stuff I purchased. I <em>knew</em> I shouldn’t have sent those guys off so early. I regretted that now.</p>
<p>On day three, I decided to hit the library. I still hadn’t heard anything about, like, what I’d be teaching at school. Yuuki was working that out for me right now, but in the meantime, I figured I should brush up a bit on my core knowledge.</p>
<p>That and fulfill one of my other important goals—learning magic. I wanted to take this opportunity to read through as many magic tomes as I could in there. Access to the room with said tomes was restricted, but you could get in if you showed ID proving you were a B-ranked adventurer or higher. You couldn’t take any of the books out, either, and I wanted to read ’em all while I was in the capital, so that was job one for me.</p>
<p>This was the largest library in the city, but it wasn’t affiliated with the government. The full-on Royal Library was inside the castle, available only to nobility and court-appointed magicians. A-ranked adventurers who were official guests of the state could request access, perhaps, but that didn’t apply to me right now. Certain magic was treated as classified information by particular nations, so it wasn’t just a matter of walking up and asking for a library card.</p>
<p>For now, I’d have to be happy with this regular library. Besides, there were a lot of valuable books in there, filled with tales of forbidden skills and techniques collected by adventurers worldwide. Some of the more ancient tomes discovered during Free Guild work were gathered here, too. <em>The collection is easily as valuable as anything the Royal Library might have</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>It was wonderful. I felt lucky to be blessed with such fortune, so soon after arriving. I’m sure it was karmic repayment for all my good deeds.</p>
<p class="space-break">I quickly began browsing through the magic tomes. There were so many here, you could never finish them in a lifetime if you read them any normal way. So, um, apologies to the diligent scholars out there putting in all that time in reading rooms, but I’m using the Great Sage to read these suckers.</p>
<p>If someone watched me in there, it’d probably look like I was just running a hand over a book, then meekly returning it to the shelf. But my hand was taking in the entirety of each book, recording it fully and accurately. Running the Sage and Glutton skills in parallel, I copied each magic tome into my mind at breakneck speed. I could take the time to pore over the contents later—or really, I could let the Sage do that. All I had to do here was pluck a book from the shelves, then put it back.</p>
<p>Would that be enough to let me harness the magic inside, though…?</p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl">Received. It is possible to thoroughly examine the contents with Analyze and Assess, then comprehend it with the All of Creation skill. Once comprehended and stored within memory space, the magic may be executed with Cast Cancel.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">Really? Whoa. So all I gotta do is <em>think</em> about what kinda magic I want? What a crazy set of skills. There’s just no end to the wonders the Sage brings me.</p>
<p>In that case, it’s settled. I’m not even gonna bother reading the <em>titles</em> of these books. Just in and out, shelve and unshelve, over and over. Each volume converts itself into knowledge for me. The mere thought made me want to do this more than ever.</p>
<p>So over the next two days, I read those books until I was blue in the face, successfully memorizing every one in the magic-tome stacks. That was how I rounded out my little vacation. The other librarians and visitors gave me passing stares, like I was some kind of wacko, but I had no regrets. Before my lofty goal of learning more magic, that was just a trivial detail.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">It was now my first day of work. After a few greetings, I was given a word or two of advice from the academy’s vice principal.</p>
<p>Yuuki had already warned me it would be hard work—in addition to being guild master, he was also chairman of this school’s board of directors. He called it more of an honorary title than anything, but I was still impressed. In the ten or so years he had been there, he not only built up the entire Free Guild but even set up an affiliated school for the outfit. In a way, he was the ideal all adventurers should aspire to.</p>
<p>This school was, indeed, a sort of training ground for would-be guild members. Like the guild itself, you decided on a department to specialize in—beyond the common courses shared by all students, there were also classroom-based lectures in magical and monster sciences, as well as on-the-field training in battle and survival. You were free to devise your own curriculum, not unlike the universities of my previous life.</p>
<p><em>My</em> job, however, would be running a special class that was a tad different from what most students had access to. The S-Class, as they put it, was a group of students deemed to be problematic in one way or another. Ever since their previous adviser, the notoriously hard-line Shizue Izawa, left her post due to personal issues, the class had been left teacherless and free to wreak havoc however it liked. She was a Hero, the Conqueror of Flames, and I definitely had some big shoes to fill. <em>I suppose I should get used to being compared to her all the time around here.</em></p>
<p>It seems this class was wild enough that it had already driven off several would-be teachers in the meantime, including a few B-ranked adventurers. The administrators were at their wit’s end trying to figure out what to do with them. The vice principal told me all this, much as Yuuki did before. It was composed of five students, as he put it a few days back—</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“All five of these students are otherworlders,” he began, “people just like us. Let me ask you, though, Rimuru… Do you know someone named Hinata Sakaguchi?”</p>
<p>Why’s <em>her</em> name coming up now? I mean, I wanted to ask about her, but…</p>
<p>“I know the name, at least. She’s an otherworlder and one of Shizu’s old apprentices, right? Also that she’s stronger than Shizu and has a really great memory and stuff.”</p>
<p>“Stronger than Miss Shizu at her peak, to be exact, yes. And do you have much idea of just how strong Miss Shizu was?”</p>
<p>How strong she was? Well, strong enough to summon a high-level spirit like Ifrit and become “one” with it. The sheer temperatures involved were brutal. Without Cancel Temperature, I would’ve been a goner, for sure.</p>
<p>“Well, she wielded Ifrit, a monster who goes past A level, so…”</p>
<p>“Right. At her peak, Miss Shizu could bring Ifrit fully under her control. In terms of the scale I implemented for the guild, she’d be in the upper echelon of what we’d call A-plus, even. She was something special—but Hinata, at the age of fifteen, gained strength that even went beyond that. That should give you some idea of what I’m talking about.”</p>
<p>I nodded. Hmm. I didn’t have any idea at all, but I kept listening.</p>
<p>“You might be wondering why I’m bringing this up…but first and foremost, I wanted you to know what makes us otherworlders different from the people in this world. Some of us are gifted with incredibly powerful battle skills, like Hinata, but some of us, like me, don’t have any skills at all. You can’t put all otherworlders into the same category; it really runs the gamut. My favorite café in town is run by an otherworlder, and he’s powerless, so to speak. Most otherworlders have <em>some</em> kind of special ability, usually, but that’s not an ironclad rule.”</p>
<p>I see. So most, but not all, people gain a skill or two when they make the journey.</p>
<p>“However,” Yuuki continued, “the real key here is the difference between naturally traveling over to this world and being <em>called</em> over.”</p>
<p><em>Hmm. Veldora discussed that a little, too, didn’t he? Yeah, he did…</em></p>
<p>(Many otherworlders come here bearing special powers. Powers that are chiseled into their souls in the midst of their journey. The summoned will always bear one such skill—a unique skill, one exclusive to them and them alone. Unlike the otherworlders who come here by sheer accident, these people bear a soul strong enough to withstand the stress of the summoning process. The fact that said summoning process so rarely succeeds in this world otherwise proves as such.)</p>
<p>I think that’s what it was.</p>
<p>In other words, you need a soul strong enough to handle the summon process, or else it won’t work. I relayed all this to Yuuki. “I’m impressed you know that,” he replied, eyes wide. “That’s exactly what I’ve learned in my research.” Wasn’t really research for me; I’m just parroting what Veldora said, but oh well.</p>
<p>“As you say, Rimuru, the ‘summons’ that are called over here for some purpose are always granted powers suited for this purpose—for example, so they can become a Hero to give mankind a decisive edge in battle. During this journey, your body is disassembled and put back together in semi-physical form—in other words, it’s rebuilt. Without a strong enough will, I imagine you’d get swallowed up in all that energy and disappear into the black.”</p>
<p>Even Hinata, who came here quite by accident, was granted otherworldly powers. If she had been called here for some specific goal, I couldn’t imagine how strong she’d be then. I imagine that’s what Yuuki was trying to say—but what he said next sent shivers down my spine.</p>
<p>“…Now, what do you think would happen if you are summoned while still in incomplete form?”</p>
<p>“Incomplete form?”</p>
<p>“Exactly…”</p>
<p>What he then explained to me almost made my skin crawl. Normally, performing a summon under a given set of conditions required thirty or more summoners to work as a team. The ceremony took seven whole days to complete—and even then, the success rate was less than 1 percent. Even worse, once a ceremony was complete, the same summoners would need to wait for a certain interval before performing it again—an interval that took something like thirty-three or sixty-six years. The longer you waited, the more you’d be able to narrow down the conditions you wanted.</p>
<p>So what happens if you perform a summon without stipulating any particular conditions? <em>That</em> certainly loosened things up quick—there wouldn’t be anywhere near as much of an interval required between summonings. The same summoners could try it again and again—but the success rate didn’t get any better, and even if you pulled it off, you often wound up summoning children and the like.</p>
<p>Despite these disadvantages, there were still apparently good reasons for choosing this approach. But what about the children who were summoned? Their wills were quite strong, of course, their bodies now infused with energy in the form of magicules. But they did not obtain any skills to go with that willpower—and all that energy was a severe mismatch for an immature body. So much so, in fact, that given enough time, the energy would literally burn the body away, having no other outlet to release itself with.</p>
<p>“Huh? Wait, so are those five children…?”</p>
<p>“…Yes. As I’m sure you’re imagining, they were summoned.”</p>
<p>“Whoa. Is that, like, okay, or…?”</p>
<p>Yuuki didn’t answer. But his silence provided enough of one.</p>
<p>“Those children,” he continued, “were the ones <em>not fully</em> summoned. Attempts at crafting a Hero that failed.”</p>
<p>“A Hero? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Remember what I said? A Hero can provide a decisive advantage for the human race in battle. In this world, the monsters are much stronger than us—overwhelmingly so. It’s safe to say we’re under constant threat. The power of mankind around here is pitifully weak. They’re all seeking a Hero they can pin their hopes upon.”</p>
<p>“What, so they’re summoning people willy-nilly to find Heroes to fight ’em off?”</p>
<p>“Exactly, Rimuru. What this world has decided is that it’s worth sacrificing thousands if it means the birth of a Hero for themselves.”</p>
<p>Yuuki’s voice rang cold in the underground room. It was the world’s choice. I had a hard time coming up with a response to that. Did I have a right to criticize them all for putting their own beloved family above a bunch of alien strangers? If you’re presented with two people in danger and you could only save one, what would you do? If I was friends with one, of course I’d reach out to that guy first.</p>
<p>“These children are the results of failed summonings, conducted by multiple nations under strict secrecy. They were picked up by Miss Shizu, and she wanted to do whatever she could to save them.”</p>
<p>“Multiple nations? There’re governments involved in this?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s what the world has decided to do, like I said. In their eyes, instead of gradually investing in armies to fend off the monsters, it’s more efficient to stake it all on one otherworlder who can stand far above everyone else. And if you know how strong Miss Shizu was, you can see why.”</p>
<p>I suppose I could. A force in the tens of thousands would mean nothing against something like Ifrit. If an Orc Disaster stepped into town, they could pool Kabal and all the other B-ranked adventurers in the world together, and they’d never land anything close to a serious blow. If those were the odds, then having an otherworlder like Shizu or Hinata could make all the difference, once the people knew about them.</p>
<p>“The other thing is that it’s not like a Hero is born every day in this world. How I understand it is that it involves being willing to take on the crimes and sins of all mankind, in a way. Otherwise, you won’t be able to overcome the trials placed upon you by the spirits that rule over the land. Of course, there are some Heroes out there who are anything but. They’re willing to invite divine wrath upon themselves…”</p>
<p>Huh. The idea of just leaving everything to these Heroes sounded pretty irresponsible to me, but that assumes you had some Heroes to start with. Some <em>real</em> ones, with official World Language approval. And that’s why all these nations are willing to dabble in the dark magic of summoning, damn the consequences. Any successful ones were lauded as Heroes, and as Yuuki put it, each nation had a few on hand.</p>
<p>The demon lords held so much power in this world that, if you were foolish enough to take one on, you couldn’t afford to be picky with your methods. All these human nations scrambling to procure Heroes didn’t seem strange at all to me anymore.</p>
<p>“There’s that many around, though? I haven’t seen any in the smaller towns and villages…”</p>
<p>“That’s because these summoned otherworlders are usually ordered to serve as bodyguards for the nobility or people associated with them.”</p>
<p>Oh, right. Veldora mentioned that, too.</p>
<p>“So summons that have combat potential are branded with a magical curse in their soul,” I blurted out, “preventing them from defying their summoners?”</p>
<p>“You know about that, Rimuru?!”</p>
<p>I <em>did</em> know, yes. I knew, but I just kinda forgot. Yeahhh… No wonder Shizu wasn’t so crazy about this world.</p>
<p>“So what’s gonna happen to these kids?”</p>
<p>“…As far as I know,” Yuuki grimly reported, “the longest any has survived is five years. Those are the facts, when it comes to incomplete summons. We haven’t found any magic spells that can stave off the bodily collapse. If someone is summoned under the age of ten, they’re almost certain to die, being unable to obtain any unique skills.”</p>
<p>Then he gave a self-effacing smile.</p>
<p>“But at least each nation was kind enough to hand the children over to us.”</p>
<p><em>I’ll bet. No need to take care of children who’re useless in their minds, I’m sure.</em></p>
<p>“But the Western Holy Church doesn’t have a problem with that? They’ve got those crazy strong paladins and stuff, right?”</p>
<p>“You could say the Church gives it their tacit consent. To them, the total annihilation of this planet’s monsters is the major goal.”</p>
<p>“For real? And <em>they’re</em> the ‘defenders of righteousness’ or whatever? Gimme a break. And does Hinata think that way? She really doesn’t care about all these children from her homeland dying as long as she can beat the monsters?”</p>
<p>“Hinata, I suppose, is a realist. She takes the most rational of approaches to her problems. If something seems the most effective way to her, she’ll do it, I guess you could say, but…but it makes no sense to me, no.”</p>
<p>He knew for sure, at least, that Hinata wasn’t applying pressure internationally to put an end to these summonings.</p>
<p>“All right. So would anyone mind if I did something about these kids?”</p>
<p>“What are you thinking about doing?”</p>
<p>I looked Yuuki in the eye. “If it’s what Shizu wants,” I declared, “I think I’m ready to take them on.”</p>
<p>This must’ve been the work Shizu left behind. Something she regretted so much, she infiltrated my dreams to beg me for it. I saw no reason not to answer that. Too bad I couldn’t tell her “I got this” in real life.</p>
<p>Yuuki nodded. “By all means,” he whispered as he bowed his head. “I hope you’ll save them, if you can.”</p>
<p>Yes. I always do what I can. Always have, always will.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And so, I agreed to take care of these children in the school.</p>
<p>My role was more of an adviser than a traditional teacher. Instead of just teaching coursework to my students, I’d be living with them, enlightening them. In other words, I’d be taking all the same courses they were, in all subjects. I’d be eating with them, too—good thing food was included in the deal. If I could teach them about a subject, I would; if not, I’d help other teachers—but either way, my job was to watch over these special guys.</p>
<p>“…I’d love to put my trust in you,” the vice principal commented. “It’s not every day that the chairman makes a personal recommendation like this. But those kids were too much even for B-ranked adventurers. Plus, you’re practically a child yourself, aren’t you? Nobody’s going to hold it against you if you decide to turn the offer down.”</p>
