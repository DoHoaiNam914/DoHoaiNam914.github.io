<p class="cotx1">It was a tranquil late afternoon as Shuna set to reading in her room. Just as she did, Shion came barging in, like always, begging her for help with one recipe or another. But she keenly noticed the book in Shuna’s hand and asked her a question.</p>
<p>“What’s that, Lady Shuna?”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee!” Shuna smiled. “This is a book, Shion. A book of magic that Sir Rimuru gave us.”</p>
<p>Just when they were getting used to the daily routine of running the place by themselves, Rimuru returned. It had only been last night when he came up to Shuna and dumped a massive pile of magic tomes on the ground. “Oh, are you up, Shuna?” he said casually, like nothing was unusual about this. “Perfect. You wanted to learn magic, right? Here; I got some stuff for you.”</p>
<p>One look, and she could tell these were valuable, secret tomes, the sort that humans would cherish as confidential knowledge and store under lock and key. It was a fortune, and she thanked him profusely for it. After that, Rimuru teleported away after waiting only long enough for Shuna to brief him about goings-on around town.</p>
<p>“Wha—?! He only met <em>you</em>, Lady Shuna? That’s not fair!”</p>
<p>“Oh! I forgot! He had a gift for you as well, Shion.”</p>
<p>“You’re so mean, Lady Shuna…”</p>
<p>But looking at the sweet-smelling snack presented to her, the anger immediately drained from Shion’s face. This was a new sort of sugary sweet, one Rimuru had reportedly discovered in the capital of Englesia. He had purchased a large quantity, enough for everyone in town to share.</p>
<p>Watching Shion happily take more than her fair share, Shuna couldn’t help but giggle as Benimaru walked in.</p>
<p>“Mm? Hey, Shion, what’re you doing, eating away in here? Plan to share?”</p>
<p>“Oh! Benimaru! Is your work going well?”</p>
<p>“It is. The envoys from the Beast Kingdom are the same as always; the deliveries were just as we agreed to. We provided our own goods, and they left with smiles on their faces. Geld reports in his regular briefings that construction is still going well. The tree-clearing crew has finished their work and should be home soon. But enough of that. Let <em>me</em> have one already!”</p>
<p>Before Shuna could stop him, Benimaru reached down and plucked out one of the treats—an otherworld pastry Rimuru had purchased, known as a cream puff—and scarfed it down.</p>
<p>“Ooh!” he shouted, sweets being one of his few weaknesses. “This is good!”</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru purchased it for us,” Shuna said with a grin.</p>
<p>“Did he? So he’s paid a return visit? I tell you, working in his stead, I had no idea how difficult a task he had. He made it all look so effortless when he was here…”</p>
<p>“That he did. He even had ample time to goof off and do nothing…unlike <em>you</em>, not that you let that stop you.”</p>
<p>“What? Come on… You know, normally I’d be very angry to hear that,” Benimaru countered, although the grin on his face suggested otherwise. They almost always acted like this around each other.</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru also asked us to construct some more row houses for lodging purposes.”</p>
<p>“I see. I will inform Geld at once.”</p>
<p>With that business out of the way—</p>
<p>“This is delicious. It’s almost <em>too</em> delicious! Truly, I can taste the love of Sir Rimuru cooked into each one!!”</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, Shion half shouted her approval of the cream puffs she was eagerly inhaling.</p>
<p>“…Did <em>you</em> taste that, Shuna?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so, no…”</p>
<p>Shion was too far into dreamland to hear them. They sighed. This, too, was how she always acted around them.</p>

<p class="tx1">Hmm. I had the nagging feeling Shion took my visit the wrong way. Better rescue those children and get back there quick.</p>
<p>I focused on what lay ahead of me as I shrugged off the sudden chill tickling the back of my neck. Before me were five children, sitting at their desks and concentrating on their reading and writing lessons.</p>
<p>“You need to be able to do at least that much, or else you’re gonna find it hard living in this world. You got me?”</p>
<p>“““Uh-huh!””” they all replied. Good. Nice to see some enthusiasm. And they had a reason for that, of course. I’d have liked to think it was because they adored me, but I knew that wasn’t true. I had a carrot dangling in front of them.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, I wanna read what happens next!”</p>
<p>“Boy, I sure didn’t think I’d get to catch up over here!”</p>
<p>“Well, <em>I’m</em> gonna get to it first!”</p>
<p>“I like picture books more, but manga’s good, too!”</p>
<p>“<em>I</em> think it’s more important to study, of course. But, wow, Mr. Rimuru, I didn’t know <em>you</em> were an otherworlder, too. I don’t know much about Japanese anime or manga, but that’s really fascinating.”</p>
<p>The carrot—more of that manga I copied—certainly had its effect. Said manga, however, had been translated inside my Stomach into this world’s language. You had to learn how to read it to understand anything, but it had already done wonders to improve their academic enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="space-break">I had been teaching here for a month, guiding the kids through their studies as I worked on my own preparations. I had only one thing to investigate, and until I found my answer, I couldn’t go anywhere. I wished it could’ve gone faster, but I had to be patient. I wanted to do everything I could for these children, instead of letting this time go to waste—and luckily, it turned out I was pretty good at lighting a fire in them.</p>
<p class="space-break">The days were occupied by classes; the nights by info-gathering sessions. It made me glad I didn’t require sleep with this body.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nobody had the information I wanted—the location of a high-level elemental. Not even Hakuro, the smartest person I knew. I traveled over to Treyni’s domain in search of clues and paid another visit to King Gazel. I even tried hitting up Zegion and Apito for some leads, but nothing.</p>
<p class="space-break">I was searching for elementals high-level enough that they could be imbued into these children’s bodies and tasked with controlling their magicule stores. That was the answer the Great Sage came up with for me.</p>
<p>I already had the ability to summon Ifrit, but that alone could let me save only one of them. That wasn’t good enough. Treyni and her family could summon similar spirits, but those were bonded with them as part of the summoning contract, and I couldn’t ask the dryads to sacrifice themselves for these children’s sake.</p>
<p>So I pressed Treyni for something else, and she told me about a Dwelling of the Spirits, a land ruled over by the so-called Spirit Queen. Sadly, it seemed like a dead end. “I apologize,” she told me, “but while there are several ‘entrances’ that lead to the Dwelling, the one I am aware of has already disappeared.”</p>
<p>It seems the Spirit Queen that Treyni and her family served had passed away long ago, practically in ancient times. They had no personal connections to the current queen, so not even the dryads knew where this Dwelling was any longer. A royal audience was apparently out of the question—and since the Spirit Queen could reportedly move these “entrances” around whenever she liked, they were difficult to track down. I suppose it made sense. Treyni was slippery enough at times—anyone higher up on the spirit-elemental food chain than her has to be even worse.</p>
<p>Figuring there was no need to hurry things, I decided to take a break and travel back to Tempest the previous night. Shuna caught me up with local news. Nothing too epic—the biggest highlight being a freshly minted sorcerer who had recently joined Yohm’s team. I wanted to meet her, but they were already on the trail somewhere, so I decided to pass for now.</p>
<p>That, and there was another piece of good news—a great discovery, in fact. We had been crafting Low Potions, a hundred at a time, by diluting Full Potions with magically treated water, but one day, Gabil decided to try using water directly from the underground lake instead. All the magicules inside that stuff apparently made the resulting medicine quite a bit more potent. Vester, surprised to find this, conducted some more rigorous research—and ultimately found that using this lake water would let us double our manufacturing output. Really good news. These potions were gonna be a huge revenue source before long.</p>
<p>Tempest also recently played host to a merchant from the Kingdom of Blumund, escorted by Kabal and his friends. This merchant, Gard Mjöllmile, made a purchase of one thousand High Potions for the price of two hundred and fifty gold coins—twenty-five silver per potion. That was our asking price, and he accepted it. Gard apparently had a trade route or two in Englesia that he ran as well, so I may actually run into him here sometime soon. I’d have to give my thanks if I did.</p>
<p class="space-break">So all of that sounded good to me, but I was still pretty much stumped when it came to finding the Dwelling of the Spirits. As I watched the kids fight over the manga I just tossed their way, I resolved to redouble my efforts.</p>

<p class="tx1">Today, I decided to take them all out on a picnic.</p>
<p>School wasn’t in session; it was the equivalent of a Sunday in my old world. Sitting in the same classroom for days on end would take the wind out of any student’s sails, and I still needed to work some magicules out of their system on a regular basis.</p>
<p>So we were walking down a street in the capital when I realized that a large crowd had gathered in the center of the city.</p>
<p>“Some kind of event going on?”</p>
<p>“Oh! Right, Mr. Rimuru! The Hero, Sir Masayuki, is holding a fighting demonstration at the arena today!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, they say that Hero’s a really strong guy. Who do you think would win if he fought Mr. Rimuru?”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on! It’d totally be the Hero! No <em>way</em> Sir Masayuki would lose to some weird dude with a mask on!”</p>
<p>“Um, well, <em>I’m</em> still on your side, Mr. Rimuru!”</p>
<p>“…Well,” Gail intervened, “I’d kinda like to see the Hero, but we’re probably way too late to get seats by now. Let’s head out of town for that picnic we planned.”</p>
<p>The five acted remarkably excited about this, but we stuck with our original idea, resolving to buy advance tickets for the next showing. Gail, in his own inimitable way, was great at keeping his group pointed in the same direction, which was super-helpful to me. Having someone a little older serving as the leader made my job a lot easier.</p>
<p>I seemed to remember Milim telling me that Heroes were special people; simply calling yourself a Hero without the strength to back that up would set you up for a quick and nasty death. As Yuuki put it, “There are two kinds of people who go by the name of Hero—the kind who’s willing to shoulder the sins of the entire human race and the kind of fool who never thinks about the consequences.”</p>
<p>And then there’s this guy, starring in these gladiator shows or whatever in a city like this. Which pool does <em>he</em> fall under? Something told me his aims weren’t all that lofty. But then again, Milim said simply claiming to be a Hero would invite divine wrath upon you. Maybe this Masayuki guy wasn’t an idiot, after all, but just someone unfortunate enough to have a very <em>interesting</em> life. As Japanese-sounding as that name was, he might be an otherworlder for all I knew. I kind of wanted to meet him, but for today at least, I skipped out on the chance.</p>
<p class="space-break">We stopped by a café—the owner greeting us with a hearty laugh as he provided the kids with juice.</p>
<p>“Hey, kids! You guys better sit up straight and listen to your teacher, you got it?”</p>
<p>“Thanks, mister! Can we have some cake, too?”</p>
<p>“Hmph. This juice isn’t bad, I <em>guess</em>. That cake over there looks really good, though, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>Kenya and Alice always got straight to the point like that. It annoyed me, but I took out my coin pouch anyway.</p>
<p>“All right, all right. Hey, how ’bout some slices for all of them?”</p>
<p>“Gah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Hey, I heard you made it to B-plus rank? Yuuki sure was surprised to hear that! We oughtta celebrate it! You can eat and drink on the house today, guys!”</p>
<p>He was a big, beefy-looking guy, but the owner was really nice to talk to—well-connected, too, if he already heard about that. I spotted a notice on the guild’s bulletin board about a baffledil-collecting job—those flowers that tripped Geld up before. Despite being a collecting job, I was still allowed to accept it—and since I rather fortuitously had a hundred or so blooms in my Stomach, I gave them over to the guild. This, combined with a few other tricky collection missions that I contributed to, made it surprisingly simple to get promoted to B-plus.</p>
<p>Now I had the right to try for rank A. Undertaking that examination several times, proving that you were as close to an A as it gets talent-wise, would earn you a promotion to A-minus. The wall to A itself was pretty darn high, I suppose, and while I planned to take the challenge sooner or later, being a B-plus was no big setback.</p>
<p><em>Either way, though, if there’s free cake in it for me, I ain’t gonna turn that down.</em></p>
<p>“Wow! You’re really too kind! In that case, I’ll get one of those strawberry shortcakes!”</p>
<p>The owner chuckled as he took the children’s orders. “Hah! Nothing like free food to pep you up, huh?”</p>
<p>This café was owned by the otherworlder who Yuuki mentioned. I had him mention me to the guy, and he’d been treating me real well ever since. He <em>looked</em> tough, but he was really a softy at heart, and the kids loved him (or the cake he was spotting them, at least). I was here just a few days ago, too, buying some cream puffs to give to Shuna as a souvenir. I figured I needed to placate Shion, at least, for being gone for so long—and of course, I was hopeful that they’d reverse engineer the recipe.</p>
<p>The menu had a lot of other things besides cake, so I attempted to convince the owner to open up in Tempest. He turned me down, but I didn’t mind that. <em>Everything’s a negotiation. I’ll keep up the effort.</em></p>
<p class="space-break">With the cake in our bellies, I picked up the box lunches for that day’s picnic from the owner. He had sandwiches for us all, ready for later in the afternoon. The kids were full of energy today, so I figured we could run a few mock combat rounds once we reached the countryside. <em>I’m sure that’ll make their lunches taste all the better, once they’re tired out.</em></p>
<p>Before long, we were at the city gate.</p>
<p>“Ah! Good day to you, Sir Rimuru,” said the guard sentry there, whom I had come to know fairly well. “More training today? I would love to receive some instruction from you someday.”</p>
<p>B-plus adventurers definitely enjoyed a lot of preferential treatment around this city. It was like we were champions of the people or something…although, in this world, I suppose we literally were. I was finally starting to understand why Kabal enjoyed de facto celebrity status around Englesia City. He was a man of the people, and they could all see how he protected them. Unlike some high-and-mighty noble kicking back in his castle, adventurers worked on the ground level and earned the common man’s near-infinite appreciation for it.</p>
<p>“Keep up the good work, men,” I rather haughtily replied, the flattery getting to my head. “Here, I’ve got something for you. Feel free to pass it around the guardhouse later.”</p>
<p>That something was a plate of cookies I baked with the kids. Sugar was a high-priced commodity in Englesia as well, so these things were like gold to anyone with a starved sweet tooth. Even these slightly misshapen amateur-hour cookies would be a cherished treat.</p>
<p>“Well, heavens, thank you so much! And you kids be good around your teacher, all right?”</p>
<p>“Pfft. Not you people, too?! We’re <em>always</em> good around Mr. Rimuru. Right, Ryota?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. If we weren’t, he’d punish us.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to say <em>that</em>, stupid!”</p>
<p>“Don’t lump me in with these kids, sir. If you guys keep carrying on like that, they’ll start to think <em>I’m</em> just as stupid as you, all right?”</p>
<p>Boisterous as always. We laughed as I waved good-bye to the guard.</p>
<p>So we walked for about another hour, as planned, before reaching a mostly deserted grassy plain. The perfect training ground. There wouldn’t be many people watching us, either, so we could go all-out to some extent. They had matured to the point where going easy on them would actually expose me to danger. Their moves had grown much more refined, thanks in part to the fact they were actually beginning to take my advice.</p>
<p>I fought them one by one, like always, making sure to keep my guard up.</p>
<p>“Shoot! I messed that up today, too…”</p>
<p>“Mr. Rimuru is just way too strong! It’s cheating!”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you supposed to go easier on girls?”</p>
<p>“I better learn more magic…”</p>
<p>“Agh! I was so focused on defending myself better today!”</p>
<p>Perhaps it was immature of me, but I wanted to be like an impenetrable wall to them. On this point, I was acting in stark contrast to Shizu. I had no intention of spoiling them at all.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! You kids think you could ever beat me? You’re dreaming!”</p>
<p>The kids started complaining back at me. This was a pretty common routine in my class.</p>
<p>Just then—</p>
<p><em>Hmm? I feel this weird sense of pressure…</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl">Report. Large quantity of magical energy detected. Approaching—this is from a Sky Dragon.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">According to the knowledge I had picked up at the capital library, a Sky Dragon was reminiscent of a wyvern, although pretty different in reality. Wyverns were an airborne offshoot from the Lesser Dragon family, but a Sky Dragon was part of the Arch Dragon group, maintaining a greater amount of original dragon blood. As a threat, it was ranked at Special A—a calamity-class monster.</p>
<p>It would appear our fun little picnic would have to wait.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">“My heavens…”</p>
<p>Gard Mjöllmile fell to the ground, head in his hands.</p>
<p class="space-break">It was one of the biggest deals he had made in a while, a stroke of good fortune that had come only recently. The Free Guild’s Blumund branch had reached out to him, and the guild master Fuze had discussed things with him personally.</p>
<p>“So the guild is starting to get serious about this potion deal. We’re talking about procuring three hundred per month for the guild’s reserves and two hundred for the royal knight forces. So five hundred, and we’d pay you a hundred fifty gold for them,” Fuze began, regarding Mjöllmile like a mobster shaking down a client. “Now, we got a business partner who’ll sell these to you for twenty-five silver coins each, and that’s probably gonna be the most discounted price you’ll get for the time being. Right? If you went over and bought ’em without that, they’re gonna ask for thirty each, so… What do you think? It’s not a huge deal money-wise, but this is a government job—it’s gonna be continual, for a long time to come.”</p>
<p>Mjöllmile worked out the arithmetic in his mind. By that arrangement, five hundred potions would earn him a profit of twenty-five hundred silver coins, or twenty-five in gold. Not bad, but not enough to risk one’s life over. This was Gard Mjöllmile, after all. A guy used to working back alleys and arranging loans to low-level street gangs. It would take more than a stern frown from Fuze to make him come to the negotiation table.</p>
