<p class="noindentt"><a id="page-190"/>Massive cheers. Massive applause. The crowd didn’t hold back for a moment, screaming their praise at the competitors.</p>
<p>“I call that Lion Cannonfist. You should be proud, Geld. Not only did you take the full brunt of one of my secret moves and survive—you’re still able to walk.”</p>
<p>“Heh! Heh-heh-heh… I would love for us to fight no-holds-barred sometime.”</p>
<p>“So would I. I haven’t had a scrap this fun in a while.”</p>
<p>Geld and Carillon both nodded, each treating the other with respect. I could tell they had a deep, heartfelt connection now. Neither of them thought this was the end—and it wasn’t. If they both got serious and used their full arsenal of skills, the whole match would’ve been different. But the win went to Carillon this time, and Geld was out of the tournament.</p>
<p>Still, I wanted to tell Geld that I was proud of him. These cheers right now—this was what it was all about. That’s how amazing a bout this was. I clapped as loudly as all the others as Geld left the arena.</p>

<p class="tx1">The quarterfinals were in the books, and it was time for an intermission. The semifinals would take place after the lunch hour.</p>
<p>A lot of the next round would come down to how fatigued the winners from the last one were. We had healing potions for all the competitors, so their physical injuries were healed, but you couldn’t tell how they were doing magicule-wise from the outside.</p>
<p class="space-break">With the morning’s excitement still on everyone’s mind, the fifth match of the day was about to begin.</p>
<p>In the center of the arena, Masayuki and Bovix faced each other down, ready to fight for a berth in tomorrow’s final. The big question for this bout: Were Masayuki’s powers <em>real</em>, so to speak? Because unless my mind was playing tricks on me, it looked like Masayuki’s knees were quivering a bit. Trembling with excitement for the upcoming bout, maybe? And the sweat coming down the <a id="page-191"/>back of his neck was almost like a river. Was he <em>really</em> as powerful as Hinata? I just couldn’t convince myself of that.</p>
<p>As I observed him, Bovix helped himself to Soka’s mic.</p>
<p>“So you’re the ‘Hero’ who picked a fight with Sir Rimuru? A pity, then, you so fail to realize your place.”</p>
<p>He was taunting Masayuki. But the Hero just gave him an aloof smile—or, to put it in a less complimentary way, his mouth gave an odd twitch—and let it slide. Then he extended a hand to Soka, asking for a mic.</p>
<p>“Heh. Your fighting was a marvel to see.”</p>
<p>“Um… Yes.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t taking the bait. In fact, he was praising him. <em>Masayuki’s more mature than I thought.</em></p>
<p>“…But that makes it all the more a pity.”</p>
<p>“A pity? What is a pity about it?”</p>
<p>The Hero didn’t seem in a great hurry to start this match. What was he going to say next?</p>
<p>“If you were in peak shape, it would’ve been fine for me to fight with my full strength. But you used the majority of your endurance in the previous round, didn’t you? I just find that to be such a pity.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t expecting him to announce that he’d not fight all out this round. It seemed like a sincere gesture—that, or maybe just making excuses?</p>
<p>“What are you—?”</p>
<p>“I, um, I just mean, if I fought and beat you right now, I wouldn’t get any joy out of it.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard the demon lord Rimuru appointed you one of the masters of the labyrinth he’s prepared? I guess you’re more interested in joining the Big Four, but…”</p>
<p>“Fool! The role of master of Floor 50, the midsection of the Dungeon, is a great honor for myself <em>and</em> Equix! But it will not prevent me from aiming for even loftier heights…”</p>
<p>“Oh? Well, sorry to say, but the way I see it, Geld yesterday looked far more suited to the Big Four than you strength-wise…”</p>
<p>“Nnnnnngh…”</p>
<p><a id="page-192"/>First he praised him; then he dissed him. What was Masayuki thinking?</p>
<p>“If I fight you now, I’m likely gonna win. But at your full, rested peak, I don’t know how it’d go—especially down in the labyrinth, your home turf. I just think, you know, it’d be <em>such</em> a waste if we had to settle this right now.”</p>
<p>“Nnnnnh?!”</p>
<p><em>Whoa, man. I hate to think this, but does Masayuki have no intention of fighting at all…?</em></p>
<p>“I’ll be tackling the Dungeon here, definitely, no matter how my fight with the demon lord works out. You know? So what do you think? You can get back to full strength, I can meet you down there, and you can try to fend me off.”</p>
<p>Now I was sure of it. Masayuki was acting all breezy and self-confident, but to me, it looked like Bovix was scaring the crap out of him. Was he trying to sweet-talk him into conceding right now…? I had ordered Gobta and Geld to weigh Masayuki’s talents for me, but Bovix didn’t know that. Maybe…</p>
<p>“Hngh…heh… Gaaa-ha-ha-ha! Yes, I fully understand what you mean! And it is true—just as you surmised, I have no strength to spare right now. I defeated Equix by only a razor-thin margin, you see… But very well. I will trust in you and wait down in my labyrinth!”</p>
<p>Dahhhh, I <em>knew</em> it! Bovix actually said yes to him! And even worse, he was grinning like an idiot as he shook hands with the guy! And the crowd was going wild for it, of course. You’d think someone declaring he had no interest in fighting would be greeted with boos and jeers, but for reasons I couldn’t guess, they loved every bit of this. I heard people praising Masayuki’s magnanimity, Bovix’s wisdom for admitting his disadvantage, and all kinds of other strange things, across the whole coliseum.</p>
<p>It made no sense. I really had no idea what was going on. It was so clearly a bluff, but the audience thought it was a genius stroke. I guess he just got some kind of weird charisma—</p>
<p>—Wait a second. If <em>that’s</em> what I’m thinking, maybe I’m getting hoodwinked with everyone else. Was this all just an act? If he <a id="page-193"/>wanted to avoid combat with Bovix because he knew I’d be here and wanted to hide his abilities from me, I suppose that <em>did</em> make sense. I couldn’t let my guard down yet.</p>
<p>So Masayuki was still in the running, already qualified for the final. Gobta and Carillon—I mean Lion Mask—were fighting in the second semifinal match, and I didn’t need psychic powers to know how <em>that</em> would go. How well could a teenage hero manage against a former demon lord? Thinking about it that way, maybe this wasn’t such a bad thing.</p>
<p>It helped reassure me a little, at least, as I watched Masayuki leave the arena, blanketed with applause.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Now for the final bout of the day: Gobta against Lion Mask.</p>
<p>This one was pretty much over before it began, but I still wanted to cheer on Gobta as much as possible. I <em>did</em> promise that fishing pole if he won it all, and let me tell you, I was proud of that pole. It was a new model with a reinforced reel, designed by me so I could catch up with him in our informal fishing competition. I wasn’t about to give it up <em>that</em> easily. I could make another pole with little trouble, yes, but it’s about the competition. Gobta wanted it, and that gave him the motivation he needed—which was great for me, so I had to root for him.</p>
<p>I mean… You know. Lion Mask—Carillon—was <em>so</em> gonna win. He was probably gunning for the championship; if not, he would’ve bowed out after that intense fight with Geld. That’d sure help quash my anxiety—about Masayuki, I mean. Carillon would be the perfect candidate to test him out with. I wasn’t sure I could count on Milim’s underling to pitch in for me, but right now, I felt there was nothing to worry about. He could get easily distracted, making me worry he might cut out of this tournament on a whim, but now it was clear I was too frazzled for my own good.</p>
<p>Geld and Carillon didn’t knock each other out, and now all my worries were in the past. The rest, I figured, I could leave up to him.</p>
<p>But, as if reading my mind, Gobta was here and absolutely <a id="page-194"/><em>burning</em> with passion. Why is he <em>always</em> running contrarian to my needs? He never puts in an effort when I expect him to… Whoa. Wait. I was supposed to be cheering for him. Carillon was gonna win, but I couldn’t laugh at Gobta’s efforts, either.</p>
<p>I turned my eyes to him. Gobta, who had summoned Ranga from the beginning this time, had his back turned to me. Oh man, he was just gonna rely on him again, wasn’t he? That’s why he acted so confident—he’d just have Ranga fight for him. Not only was it legal, if Gobta wanted any chance of victory, that was his only strategy.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, Ranga was stronger than Geld. Carillon in no-holds-barred mode was one thing, but this stunted version of him? I thought Ranga had a decent shot.</p>
<p>Which… Hang on. If he <em>did</em> win, what then? If, on the tiny—I’m talking microbe-size—chance Gobta won, then <em>he</em> could reveal Masayuki’s powers for me, and my original plan would finally pay off. In other words, it didn’t really matter who won here, as far as I was concerned. Leaving matters to Gobta concerned me a little, but hey, what happens, happens.</p>
<p>So I started cheering my head off for Gobta.</p>
<p class="space-break">The match began.</p>
<p>“I’m not the hobgoblin I <em>usually</em> am today!”</p>
<p>Then why were you running from your last opponent?</p>
<p>“Don’t make me laugh, kid. Listen, before anyone gets hurt, why don’t you just hurry up and forfeit—”</p>
<p>“Okay, Ranga, you’re up!”</p>
<p>“At once!!”</p>
<p>Brushing aside Carillon’s offer, Gobta made the first move. He and Ranga worked as a well-synchronized team; they must have strategized a bit over lunch. He was serious. He really wanted to win.</p>
<p>He did, but…</p>
<p><em>“Tiger Talon!”</em></p>
<p>Sharp, bladelike claws grew out from Carillon’s feet. He unleashed a tornado-like jumping roundhouse, aimed at both Gobta <a id="page-195"/>and Ranga. His long, sharpened claws offered no clue about their trajectory—and even if you dodged them, their tips emitted some kind of vorpal wave that cut through any target they faced. This skill was just something for Carillon to play with, but to Gobta, it’d probably make his life pass before his eyes.</p>
<p>“Byahhh?!”</p>
<p>Gobta fell off Ranga. I knew it. This was just asking too much. He frantically clambered away, attempting to scamper out of Carillon’s sight—but nobody had any right to laugh. I mean, yeah, the crowd was all laughing, but they could do that because they didn’t realize how fearsome Carillon was. Just facing him up and attempting a frontal attack deserved to be praised.</p>
<p>But Carillon left him alone. Or really, he had to—because Ranga, freed from the weight of Gobta, was now snarling at him. He was currently the size of a large dog, but even so, his teeth and claws were sharp enough.</p>
<p>“Tch!”</p>
<p>Carillon stopped those fangs with his left arm, letting it be sacrificed to his bite. Then he brought the arm straight down, sending Ranga crashing toward the ground. But Ranga didn’t relent. With a spin, he kicked against the stone floor and out of harm’s way.</p>
<p>“Wh-whoaaa… That’s some wolf there.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but aren’t dark direwolves ranked C at best?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you mean the monster Sir Gaiye mentioned? But is that really a direwolf?”</p>
<p>The crowd was already stirring, astonished at Ranga’s moves. Some of them were already conjecturing on what he could be. <em>He’s a Tempest Starwolf, guys. Special-A grade and not the kind of thing you’ll see raiding your garbage at night.</em></p>
<p><em>“Elephant Stampede!!”</em></p>
<p>Carillon broke out another attack. The aura kneaded into it smashed into the ground from the skies above, like random lightning strikes. There might’ve been room to escape in an open environment, but not in this arena—if a ring-out counted as a loss, your only choice was to take the blow. Or so I thought. But Ranga fled right away from it.</p>
<p><a id="page-196"/>“Huhhh?”</p>
<p>Carillon was the most surprised of all. He probably didn’t expect Ranga to just give up the match. It disappointed him a little—and for just a moment, that left him open.</p>
<p>“Yeah, right there!”</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>Was that Gobta talking? And that black shadow setting off on cue—it was Ranga. Just when I thought he’d fled outside the arena, he jumped right out of Gobta’s shadow, like nothing was amiss.</p>
<p>“Weren’t you out of the ring?!” Carillon shouted.</p>
<p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh… A resummon is not against the rules.”</p>
<p>Diablo shot the ex–demon lord down. Carillon blew it. Yes, Ranga was much stronger than Gobta. In Carillon’s eyes, Ranga needed far more attention paid to him. But his <em>opponent</em> was Gobta, and as long as he didn’t step out of the arena, he hadn’t lost. It was an underhanded move, but ever since this match began, he had been toeing the boundary—this was what he’d aimed for the whole time: playing the fool while hungrily striving for victory.</p>
<p>This was how he’d do it, and the results changed the tide of the match.</p>
<p>A fang brushed past Carillon’s head. The attack caught him off guard, and he dodged it by a hairbreadth…or maybe not. I thought he’d fully avoided it, but then Carillon brought a frenzied hand to his face. Just as he intended to, Ranga had struck a successful blow.</p>
<p class="space-break">The attack took its toll, too. Carillon was on his guard, of course, but he must’ve been confident that he could weather any blow as long as it wasn’t a direct hit. Instead of clumsily staggering back to dodge Ranga, he dodged just barely enough to segue to his next move—a simple choice for someone as dominant as Carillon. As a masterful lord of the battlefield, he had to make it look easy—that’s how he thought, and his powers made that naturally possible. That’s why he had the strength and agility to dodge the attack that came after Ranga’s surprise reappearance.</p>
<p>This time, however, Ranga wasn’t aiming for Carillon at all but the mask he had on. With his honed instincts, Carillon decided to <a id="page-197"/>do the bare minimum necessary to avoid taking damage—and that let Ranga bite right through his mask.</p>
<p>Now Gobta was all smiles. “Sweet! Right on target!” he joyfully shouted. Then he whipped out his dagger and launched a shot of Icicle Lance.</p>
<p>“Take this!”</p>
<p>“Y-you little sneak!!”</p>
<p>The bolt wasn’t meant to topple Carillon but to rip the mask off him. Likely realizing this, Carillon fought back with both hands over his face—and that gave Ranga free rein to attack. And with his hands essentially tied behind his back, fending off the starwolf was a herculean task.</p>
<p>“So dirty…”</p>
<p>“What a cowardly way to fight…”</p>
<p>“Fight for <em>real</em>, you bastard!”</p>
<p>The spectators weren’t exactly satisfied with this. But Gobta didn’t care.</p>
<p>“Shut up! In this world, might makes right! Sir Rimuru said so himself!”</p>
<p>He was playing to the audience now, shouting right at them. I <em>really</em> wished he wouldn’t drag me into this…</p>
<p>“Tch. I can see why he’s aiming for a spot in the demon lord’s Big Four. Fighting like <em>that</em>, and not being ashamed of it for a moment.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. In fact, he’s acting like this is a completely normal tactic!”</p>
<p>“He looks kinda dopey, but he’s sharp, you know? He was aiming for that from the get-go.”</p>
<p>“Ahhh, I bet the demon lord suggested it to him. I mean, check out that stupid-looking face of his. You think <em>he</em> could’ve come up with that?”</p>
<p>“Scary, isn’t it? A demon lord capable of bossing around the Big Four…”</p>
<p>Great. Now the crowd was making me out to be some trans-dimensional mastermind. <em>It’s all Gobta, okay? All his fault.</em> And I really didn’t need a Big Four who required my constant input in order to function, but the crowd would never get that. It was just sad.</p>
<p><a id="page-198"/>Now Gobta and Ranga had the initiative—and when Carillon finally took a step outside the ring, it was over.</p>
<p>“Curse him! All right. You’ve outwitted me this time.”</p>
<p>I could tell he was furious, but he still had his reason with him. Better to bow out, he thought, than to continue this farce any longer. And he was probably right—if it became known that a former demon lord lost in a tournament like <em>this</em>, it’d spark an international furor.</p>
<p>…Of course, he <em>did</em> lose only thanks to a publicly announced message from a certain anonymous benefactor. Without that, I doubted this strategy ever would’ve occurred to Gobta.</p>
<p>“Stunning! Absolutely stunning!!”</p>
<p>Soka’s shouting revved up the crowd once more. I heard cheering, shouting, even laughter. Everyone had their own takes, but either way, they truly enjoyed this fight.</p>
<p>“Did that man really need to conceal his face so badly? That seemed rather exaggerated to me…”</p>
<p>Sounded like some of them were even advocating for Gobta. He was definitely the heel of the day, but between his lovable face, his nimble moves, and everything else, nobody could find it in their hearts to hate him too much.</p>
<p>The crowd was happy, for sure. Geld and Carillon’s battle was praised for the high quality of its combat; with this one, people would be talking about Gobta’s antics for a while to come.</p>
<p>This world’s starved for entertainment. Instead of the rule-bound tournament at Englesia, the anything-goes atmosphere of this one seemed to grab people’s hearts a lot more. It was objectively a terrible bout, but in the end, I guess it kinda worked.</p>
<p class="space-break">Later:</p>
<p>“As punishment for joining a match without permission, I forbid you from lurking in my shadow until further notice!”</p>
<p>Ranga, trotting up to me with his tail wagging, must’ve assumed I would praise him for a job well done. This was a shock to him, but I honestly wondered why he thought I’d like it. But…well…those pathetic, sad eyes he gave me… They tugged at my heart, I guess.</p>
<p><a id="page-199"/>“Ranga, I know I gave you that punishment, but my final decision depends on tomorrow’s contest.”</p>
<p>“…!!”</p>
<p>“You’re <em>theoretically</em> being summoned by Gobta, so listen to what he says and try not to do anything reckless, all right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, master!”</p>
<p>Ranga and Shion were good friends, and I think Shion’s influence made him go overboard at times. I had to put my foot down here, or I couldn’t guess what kind of terrifying things he’d try next. If he remembered his role as Gobta’s summoned beast, everything should be fine—at least, he wouldn’t overdo it against Masayuki, I thought.</p>
<p>“Gobta, I want you to work with Ranga and give me a hundred percent in the final tomorrow!”</p>
<p>“You got it!”</p>
<p>Perfect. I was sure Gobta would have no problem gauging Masayuki’s true might. The worst-case scenario I pictured involved Ranga going into full “beast” mode in front of the crowd and then having Masayuki beat his ass. That meant I’d have to step into the ring, and I doubted we could talk things out then.</p>
<p>I really wished we knew more about Masayuki’s skills in battle. That worried me. Still, I hoped we could settle this without conflict. If Gobta could win, we were good—but that all depended on tomorrow.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">Thus, despite a few unexpected twists and turns, Day Two wrapped up in an orderly fashion. Today’s six matches were over, which left only the finals tomorrow—a, shall we say, <em>quite</em> unexpected matchup between Masayuki and Gobta.</p>
<p>Once the arena emptied out, the night stalls reportedly saw massive profits. The fanboys were crazy for Masayuki, so-called hard cores were devoted to Geld or Carillon, and a few dyed-in-the-wool arena-battle nerds tossed their hats in with Gobta. They were all <a id="page-200"/>smiles with one another on the streets, talking excitedly about the day’s bouts.</p>
<p>The same was true at our own dinner, spent enjoying a multicourse meal at our tables with the other VIPs. All anyone wanted to talk about was today’s tournament. Apparently, that Gaiye dude was pretty famous; Gobta’s beating him very suddenly made him the focus of attention. A lot of people had high expectations for the final tomorrow, and my own table was no exception.</p>
<p>“That was <em>sooooooo</em> great!! Just seeing Sir Masayuki stand there looked so crazily cool!!”</p>
<p>“You think so? I like Mr. Tempest more!”</p>
<p>“And Geld was so awesome. Talk about letting your fists do the talking!”</p>
<p>“Yeah! When Lion Mask did that all-out assault on him, his face didn’t even move an inch!”</p>
<p>“Exactly! And Lion Mask was <em>fierce</em>!”</p>
<p>“That barrage was something, huh? I was amazed. Just one cool move after another. I wanna learn some of them!”</p>
<p>“You too, Gail? So do I!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, me too!”</p>
<p>Alice was all Masayuki. Chloe didn’t particularly care. Kenya and the other boys thought Geld was cool under pressure, but Carillon was the more popular choice. He <em>was</em> kind of like an action hero, actually, what with the “Lion Mask” bit.</p>
<p>Watching them carry on, I eyed the food on the table with anticipation. Instead of multiple courses, we were all being treated to a fried-shrimp special, along with meatloaf steak and cream-filled croquettes. A very kid-friendly menu, in other words, although I was definitely a fan, too.</p>
<p>If we were nobility, we’d have servants carting all of this over, but tonight we cut that out. Each table was separated by noise-dampening partitions—having to worry about manners every single meal was exhausting, so I had us go with this setup on Day Two. That let us chat all we wanted as we enjoyed dinner.</p>
<p>The kids were abuzz about the battle tournament—and if they <a id="page-201"/>were that excited about it, I’m sure ticket sales were through the roof. I had my concerns about tomorrow, but no point worrying too much about that.</p>
<p>I could see Carillon grinning at me from the next table over, no doubt hearing the kids carry on. Milim was there, too, looking a bit more peeved. Guess that noise dampening didn’t work too well after all—they heard every word from us, although the opposite was also true.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh! Glad everybody saw how cool I was. Your kids there have good taste.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly! How can you be ‘<em>cool’</em> if you couldn’t even win the tournament?”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t be that way, Milim. I wanted to keep things nice and easy, all right? Nice and easy.”</p>
<p>“Pathetic! Have you forgotten your pride as a former demon lord?”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! Of course not. I got to take on a foe I’ve had my eye on for a while, and I didn’t care about winning anyway.”</p>
<p>“I’m quite jealous,” I heard Middray add.</p>
<p>“You said it! I should’ve just disguised myself and joined in instead…”</p>
<p>Dude, if <em>Milim</em> asked to join, I would’ve stopped her at all costs.</p>
<p>“Whoa there, Milim. That’s way too reckless.”</p>
<p>“He’s right, Lady Milim. A demon lord as brimming with grace as you would never be able to hide her identity.”</p>
<p>Carillon and Middray agreed with me, at least, immediately trying to dissuade Milim of the idea. I didn’t think she was “<em>brimming with grace</em>,” but oh well.</p>
<p>“Ah, whatever. Let’s all watch the final match together!”</p>
<p>“Oh? Are you done with your labyrinth work?”</p>
<p>“It’s all perfect! So I’m gonna go around with Rimuru and his gang tomorrow!”</p>
<p>“Would I be able to join you?” I heard Frey ask.</p>
<p>“I’ll pass,” said Carillon. “My staff invited me out. It’s too bad I didn’t make the final, but I want to take my time and look around town tomorrow.”</p>
<p><a id="page-202"/>So Milim would be watching, too. Carillon planned to go out with his Lycanthropeers, and I suppose Frey would be keeping an eye on Milim. Good thing there was only one round of the tournament left. Milim was excited for the labyrinth opening as well, so I figured we didn’t have to worry about her.</p>
<p>“But if it was that engaging of a tournament, perhaps I should have joined in?”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha! Actually, what <em>were</em> you doing all day?”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee… Middray was in the concert hall the whole time.”</p>
<p>So was Frey, it seemed, if she knew he was there. If they liked the music that much, I was sure the orchestra would be delighted to hear that.</p>
<p>“Huh? You mean that stuff that put me to sleep yesterday?”</p>
<p>“Carillon… A barbarian like you wouldn’t understand high art, I suppose…”</p>
<p>“Whoa, Frey, don’t talk to me like <em>that</em>!”</p>
<p>“Hey, which stuff was this?”</p>
<p>“Music, Milim. Remember that large band of musicians Clayman was so proud of, who played such beautiful music? Well, there’s a band just like that here.”</p>
<p>“I think <em>this</em> band’s better than Clayman’s, but…”</p>
<p>“Oh? So you know <em>that</em> much about music after all, Carillon?”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t sound like much of a compliment to me, Frey!”</p>
<p>“Well, no, it’s not. I didn’t mean it as one.”</p>
<p>“You people just treat me like crap…”</p>
<p>“I’ll have you know, Luminus herself spent the day at the concert hall as well, in the best seat available. I doubt someone like <em>you</em> could fully understand that music, is all I’m saying.”</p>
<p>“Really? Luminus? Wait, <em>she’s</em> here?!”</p>
<p>“Hey! I like music, too, you guys!!”</p>
<p>Certainly a lively conversation. I was glad they were having fun.</p>
<p class="space-break">As I listened in on the other guests, Hinata leaned closer to me.</p>
<p>“So? If you <em>do</em> wind up fighting that kid Masayuki, what’re you going to do?”</p>
<p>Way to drive to the core of the issue, huh?</p>
<p><a id="page-203"/>“Huhhh? You’re fighting Sir Masayuki, Mr. Tempest? I know you’re strong, but I don’t think you’re <em>that</em> strong!”</p>
<p>“Sure he is! I think he’s way stronger!”</p>
<p>The kids promptly began to argue over who’d win in our theoretical fight. Alice and Kenya sided with Masayuki, the others with me. That gave me a one-vote advantage, which I thought I could gloat about, but:</p>
<p>“Oh, whatever. To be honest, not even I have a good gauge of Masayuki’s strength. You should be wary of him, though, of that much I’m certain.”</p>
<p>That sounded like a warning. She didn’t go into great detail, since doing so would reveal several of her own skills, but apparently she had done some investigation into Masayuki. The results told her that even <em>she</em> would find him a difficult challenge.</p>
<p>“Of course,” she said with a laugh, “I still think I’d beat him, nine times out of ten…”</p>
<p>Then things got worse.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, I don’t think you could lose to anyone, Hinata!”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh. I hate to say it, but you’re amazing.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think anyone in the <em>world</em> could beat Hinata!”</p>
<p>“Me neither…”</p>
<p>“No doubt about it. Not even Lion Mask could put up a fight against her.”</p>
<p>It was unanimous. Hinata was stronger than Masayuki. Me against him was a split decision, but Hinata against him? Five to zero. I was honestly hurt for a moment.</p>
<p>“Well,” I grumbled to Hinata, “I do think Masayuki’s interested in hearing me out, unlike <em>some</em> people. I don’t think I’d have that much to worry about.”</p>
<p>“…In what way?”</p>
<p>The air suddenly froze between us. <em>That</em> was a land mine. One that was plain as day, and I’d stepped on it anyway.</p>
<p>“Oh, um, nothing. Never mind.”</p>
<p>“If you’re calling me out, I’ll fight you anytime.”</p>
<p>Man, what a temper!</p>
<p>Realizing my mistake, I managed to placate her with the flan <a id="page-204"/>I was going to enjoy for dessert. A devastating loss for me. Loose lips, etcetera.</p>
<p>“But you’re right. Masayuki seems open to reason. Yuuki said he was his guardian, so if need be, I can talk with him. But we may not need to.”</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>“Meaning, maybe he’ll lose tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I won’t deny that, but this is Gobta we’re talking about… He’s got a knack for screwing things up right when it counts…”</p>
<p>He <em>was</em> pretty strong, if he’d only take a normal approach to things. But he kept getting these crazy ideas in his mind midway, and that put everything off-kilter. That’s just who he was. And what if he tried something crazy in the final?</p>
<p class="space-break"><em>…</em></p>
<p class="space-break">Hmm?</p>
<p>For a moment, it seemed like Raphael was about to say something. Did I imagine that? Ah well. I’m sure it was nothing important.</p>
<p>But we were talking about Gobta vs. Masayuki. Gobta, with Ranga, seemed to have a clear advantage. If Masayuki could beat Ranga, that definitely made him a serious threat—but somehow, I just couldn’t see the kid like that.</p>
<p>“If you ask me, though, I think Gobta has a lot of potential.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sure,” I said. “I’ll grant you, he has a lot of good sense. But… You know. He’s <em>Gobta</em>.”</p>
<p>Gobta, with a bad habit of doing something stupid and losing a fight he could’ve won.</p>
<p>“All right. Well, I’ll be looking forward to tomorrow.”</p>
<p>With that, she ended the conversation and took the kids out to the night market. <em>Please</em>, I begged her in my heart, <em>please don’t spoil them too much…</em></p>
<p class="space-break">Hinata was concerned for me, in her own way. I appreciated that.</p>
<p>If Gobta lost, we’d work something out then. I was prepared for <a id="page-205"/>it, and I didn’t think anything too bad would happen as a result. For now, I really ought to enjoy the festival.</p>
<p>We had tons of problems and tons of things to do, but these days really seemed fulfilling to me. I felt happy. So it was time to switch gears. I promised Gazel I would meet with him, and it was time to follow through on that.</p>
