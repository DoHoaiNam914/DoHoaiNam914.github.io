<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="toc.xhtml#toc-chapter002">THE EVE OF THE FESTIVAL</a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page-21"/>This time, it was Yuuki himself giving orders to Team Lightspeed.</p>
<p>Recently, an enormous slave market had been uncovered in Ballachia, one of the smaller kingdoms that ringed Englesia. Fortunately, a runaway slave had contacted the relevant authorities for help, and now they needed to form an expedition to investigate. But while Ballachia was small, there was a chance this market was backed by the kingdom itself. The assignment was ranked a B-plus or greater in difficulty, not the sort of thing your average brawling adventurer could tackle.</p>
<p>“I wanted to turn this down,” Yuuki admitted to Masayuki, “but I can’t say no to one of my sponsors. As famous as you guys are, I’d like you to act as a lure.”</p>
<p>Sending the investigation team in without support was likely not going to be successful. So, Yuuki explained, he wanted Team Lightspeed to join them on the expedition—and while the team collected evidence about the slave market, Masayuki and company could stay active in public, ensuring the Ballachian government’s attention stayed on them. An A-ranked team like Masayuki’s couldn’t be refused entry by the kingdom, and with the investigation team doing the nitty-gritty detective work, the party would strike a nice balance between brains and brawn. It didn’t seem too tricky to the Hero’s ears.</p>
<p><a id="page-22"/>“Masayuki, let’s give these people a hand. Why, a nation that small could declare war against us and we’d <em>still</em> win!”</p>
<p>Jinrai was alight with the burning flame of vengeful justice. Ever since Masayuki had beaten him, he had become more refined, gentlemanly, a far cry from when they’d first met.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Bernie added. “There’s no way we can let slavery happen in this day and age. With Masayuki’s strength, we can put things right fast.”</p>
<p>As an otherworlder, Bernie had some kind of unique skill as well, making him resistant to Masayuki’s Chosen One. That didn’t stop the man from respecting him nonetheless. Masayuki couldn’t guess why—especially given how much he liked complaining to Bernie about the issues in his life. But despite that, Bernie trusted and helped him in innumerable ways. His impartial impression of Masayuki felt like a cherished dose of reality, one he referred to often. And if Bernie felt that way about this, the decision was clear.</p>
<p>Jiwu, meanwhile, was more curt.</p>
<p>“Right. If Sir Masayuki says yes, I will join him.”</p>
<p>She had a blind, incontrovertible faith in him, it seemed, almost never voicing a contrary opinion—and she had just made it unanimous. It wasn’t much longer before they set foot in Ballachia.</p>
<p class="space-break">They were in an ornate reception hall, the site of a ball attended by nobility not just from Ballachia but other nearby kingdoms. And Masayuki, an invitee, was being faced with a situation so terrifying, he would do just about anything to escape it. The slave market <em>did</em> exist here—and he’d just gotten to witness it for himself.</p>
<p><em>Give me a break. Isn’t that the investigators’ job?!</em> It almost made him want to cry. <em>Not again…</em></p>
<p>He was on his way back from a small journey to find a restroom when he heard a soft voice from a room he happened to pass by. He didn’t intend to peek inside, but he took a glance anyway—and Braeber, the earl serving as Masayuki’s tour guide, was there.</p>
<p>They locked eyes.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>It happened in an instant.</p>
<p><a id="page-23"/>“Um, are you—?”</p>
<p>“Well, <em>this</em> certainly isn’t helpful,” Braeber said, still smiling. “If you heard me, I suppose there is little I can do. I had a muscular soldier standing guard at the door, but I certainly didn’t expect you to defeat him. I should have expected as much from the Hero, shouldn’t I?”</p>
<p><em>Soldier? What soldier?!</em></p>
<p>“Whoa, wait a—?!”</p>
<p>He was about to lodge a complaint but got cut off.</p>
<p>“Ahhh! The Hero has gone mad! He must be stopped! Everybody, after him! We must subdue him!”</p>
<p>Much to Masayuki’s shock, the man Earl Braeber was talking to grabbed the sword he was leaning against—and slashed the earl down with it. Then the man tossed it away and began screaming, attempting to frame Masayuki for the attack. What ensued next was predictable. A dozen or so soldiers flocked to the scene, carefully eyeing Masayuki and his companion Jinrai.</p>
<p>“Well,” Jinrai said, his fiendish face twisting into a smile, “look what the cat dragged in. Masayuki doesn’t need to waste his time with you lot. Let me dispatch you all!”</p>
<p>Jinrai went on the move. And with the Chosen One support Masayuki provided, his performance in battle ventured into the realm of superhuman.</p>
<p>“Tch! Monster! But my enemy is the Hero who tamed that beast, for getting in my way!”</p>
<p>Gohsel, the marquis who had just struck down Braeber, gave Masayuki a loathsome scowl.</p>
<p>“You see the tide of this battle. Give it up and surrender—”</p>
<p>Considering how Jinrai was systematically destroying the gaggle of soldiers who poured in from the adjacent room, Masayuki figured the fighting was done. He was wrong.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… How kind of you to offer, Hero. But if anyone was witness to this scene—this travesty—all of them would side with me!”</p>
<p>Then Masayuki recalled Earl Braeber, still on the ground. He could hear footsteps; more people were coming toward the commotion.</p>
<p>“Blast! This is bad news, Masayuki…”</p>
<p><a id="page-24"/>They were in the Kingdom of Ballachia, and while the Hero’s name was known worldwide, Masayuki was still just a guest. Marquis Gohsel was a figure of power and authority here; between him and Masayuki, he would be the more trusted of the two. That’s why Gohsel was acting so confident right now—and why Jinrai was biting his nails. But Masayuki didn’t fret for a moment. Internally, he was annoyed, but already, his instincts told him things were going just like they always did. His skill, Chosen One, always had a knack for bending situations in ways that made him the hero of the day.</p>
<p>And it happened again.</p>
<p>Soon, the room was awash in curious rubberneckers, including a few Ballachian noblemen and foreign dignitaries. The marquis had been standing triumphantly in one corner—but now shock was racing across his face.</p>
<p>“…Ah…ahhhh. What, what has become of me…?”</p>
<p>With a groan, Earl Braeber regained consciousness.</p>
<p>“Sir Masayuki, this is a valuable witness, is he not? He was still alive, so I healed his wounds.”</p>
<p>Jiwu, who had slipped in at some point, had cast healing magic on Braeber—and now she was looking right at Masayuki, fishing for compliments.</p>
<p>“Hey there, old man,” Jinrai thundered, turning toward Braeber. “Lucky for you, Masayuki’s such a forgiving lad, huh? If you tell the truth to everyone right now, I’ll make sure slave trading’s the only crime you get charged with. But if you try to keep anything secret…I imagine that man over there’s just gonna slash you down again, won’t he? So what’ll it be?”</p>
<p>The vicious smile on his face told Braeber everything he needed to know. He thought for a moment, calculating, then resigned himself to his fate. Hanging his head, he began his confession.</p>
<p>“What the devil is happening in here?”</p>
<p>And the king of Ballachia chose that exact moment to step in. As the nobility fell silent, things resolved themselves quickly. It all happened exactly how Masayuki had predicted it would.</p>
<p class="space-break">Things got even more heated.</p>
<p><a id="page-25"/>Military police quickly stormed the residences of Earl Braeber and Marquis Gohsel, uncovering evidence of their slave trade. It revealed a scandal—Gohsel was one of the leaders of an organized crime ring. And not only that: Their headquarters was right here in Ballachia.</p>
<p>The news weighed heavily upon the king. Orthrus, the slave-trading group whose sphere of influence was largely in the Western Nations, was using this small nation of Ballachia as a front. It was a sad state of affairs, one the king refused to ignore.</p>
<p>Orthrus dealt in much more than just slaves, however. They ran a diverse business, handling weapons, armor, mysterious potions, drugs, monsters, magic items, even arcane Artifacts. They were too powerful for a small kingdom to topple—and so Ballachia’s king had enlisted the Free Guild for help. And if the Free Guild was involved, Team Lightspeed no doubt would be as well.</p>
<p>A person can grow used to extraordinary events all too quickly—but really, Masayuki could predict all of it. <em>Ahhh, I figured this would happen</em>, he thought as he accepted the king’s request.</p>
<p class="space-break">Before long, a large number of adventurers—including Masayuki’s A-rank party—gathered together for an operation to sweep up Orthrus. Counting the support troops from Ballachia, they numbered over two thousand in all—and once Chosen One had sunk its teeth into all of them, they exhibited astonishing force.</p>
<p>Orthrus’s base of operation had several hundred members on standby, including multiple A-grade fighting forces and a few captured magical beasts. This made them as powerful as a country themselves—but with Masayuki and the assault team he led, Orthrus was thoroughly and completely cleansed from the nation. Masayuki himself hardly had to do anything—or, to put it another way, his mere presence helped everyone shine, whether he knew it or not.</p>
<p>Thus, without a lot of work, the operation was a success, and the notorious Orthrus was smashed for good. Once again, things turned out well without Masayuki lifting a finger, and this latest feat meant he was famous not only in Englesia but all the way to the far edges of the Western Nations.</p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-26"/>As usual, things went off without a hitch. It might’ve been nice if the story ended there—but this particular mission left a certain problem behind.</p>
<p>Among the slaves released and put into Guild custody were mixed in monsters—including some ferocious magical beasts, which were killed on the spot. However, some of the slaves couldn’t be dealt with so swiftly—namely, the elves.</p>
<p>The issue of what to do with them soon arose. The elves wanted to return home to the Forest of Jura, but the Guild couldn’t just drop them off and send them on their merry way. Certain geopolitical issues were involved. Jura had only just come under the jurisdiction of the demon lord Rimuru, and if the enslaved elves sought Rimuru’s help, there was no guessing how he would respond. Perhaps he’d retaliate against Ballachia somehow. The Western Nations knew about the disastrous scene over in Farmus—and if a nation <em>that</em> big could fall, there was no way one as tiny as Ballachia could defend itself.</p>
<p>“S-Sir Masayuki, please, <em>please</em> do something!”</p>
<p>Their king, a dignified man usually, was all but pleading for help in his private chambers, away from prying eyes. Masayuki, feeling too guilty to turn him down, agreed. <em>It can’t be that big a deal</em>, he casually thought. <em>All I’m doing is taking the elves to Tempest.</em></p>
<p>That was the start of his mistake. For everyone who heard that <em>the</em> Masayuki was traveling to Tempest took that to mean the Hero was finally sallying off to slay a demon lord.</p>
<p>The rumors spread like wildfire—but Masayuki didn’t take them too seriously. His mind was used to the routine, and it told him that, like always, it’d turn out just fine in the end. Certainly, Chosen One was a unique skill to be feared when set off; there was no doubting that. But no matter how strong you are, there’s always someone stronger ahead—a fact Masayuki was too proud of himself to remember.</p>
<p class="space-break"><em>“Right,”</em> Masayuki said through his magic link. <em>“In that case, we’ll meet over there.”</em></p>
<p>He was submitting his report and discussing future plans with Yuuki. Due to the multiple layers of barriers protecting Englesia, <a id="page-27"/>completing a magical link like this required sending your thoughts encrypted through certain wavelengths. It wasn’t something you could pull off on short notice, so they had agreed to reach out to each other only at certain times.</p>
<p>So Masayuki shut it off and sighed.</p>
<p>“Yuuki worries far too much.”</p>
<p>“You said it.” Jinrai nodded. “If you wanted to beat a demon lord, Masayuki, that couldn’t possibly be a problem for you.”</p>
<p>Bernie was less optimistic. “I’ll remind you that even Hinata the Saint could only fight this Rimuru to a draw. It’d be wise not to let your guard down.”</p>
<p>Masayuki gave this a vague nod. It made him think a bit. Things had gone swimmingly up to now, but really, he hadn’t <em>done</em> much at all. He didn’t know Hinata; they had never met, but Yuuki had nothing but praise for her, and Masayuki respected him. If <em>she</em> couldn’t beat this guy, maybe he was a lot tougher than Masayuki thought at the moment. It gave him pause.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re right. Everyone says Rimuru wants to make nice with people. We probably shouldn’t go in raring for a fight.”</p>
<p>“Ha-<em>ha</em>! Sounds to me like <em>this</em> demon lord knows his days are numbered!”</p>
<p>“Demon lords are evil, plain and simple!” said Jiwu.</p>
<p>“Well,” Bernie added, “we’ll have to see how he acts and decide based on that. But if the Saint and the demon lord have reached an agreement on matters, then only you, Masayuki, are qualified to be a true ‘Hero.’ You had best act carefully along those lines.”</p>
<p>Masayuki nodded. “Yeah. With all your help, I bet I could beat him, but let’s take things slow and steady, okay?”</p>
<p>The question of whether to fight Rimuru would be left for later. For now, they would wait and see.</p>
<p>In the eyes of Masayuki, all three of his companions—Jinrai, Bernie, and Jiwu—were utter beasts. He himself was nothing to write home about, but he couldn’t imagine anyone from this trio actually losing a battle. <em>I mean</em>, he reasoned, <em>if I actually got in a fight, I guess I’d win somehow, but it’s not like I got a grudge against this Rimuru guy or anything… No point trying to start trouble.</em></p>
<p><a id="page-28"/>So as they packed up and set off for Tempest, he was pretty optimistic about how this trip would go.</p>

<p class="tx1">Even after all those royal audiences I gave, my schedule was just absolutely packed. Now I was entertaining human guests.</p>
<p>At the moment, our nation was receiving delegations from all around the world, one after the other. Some of the earlier parties arrived a good week ago, I heard. And not all of them received formal invites—there were also merchants, picking up on the rumors and bringing even more energy to town. Previous visitors were showing them and other new guys around, acting all proud of themselves, and even the nobler dignitaries and royal families stopping in looked around in wonder at the unfamiliar sights. It seemed, at first glance, that my expectations had paid off and our plan to make this a tourist hub was working.</p>
<p>Still, our town was only large enough to lodge maybe three thousand nobles at best. For commoners, that number was more around ten thousand, but in terms of higher-end accommodation, there wasn’t quite that much. The service and the dining we had to offer were completely different, and considering we had people in royal lines of succession showing up, we had to consider security as well. Thus we made sure each noble was given ample space to work with.</p>
<p>Given all the dignitaries we invited, we had banned the general public from our luxury inns, whether they could afford a suite or not. Some of the richer merchants in town could, but I was worried about offending them if we were too busy with nobility to offer good service. But apparently, I didn’t need to worry. Mjöllmile was on it, making sure all the more powerful of the merchant class were set up to their satisfaction.</p>
<p>“Great job, Mollie.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh! Ah, Sir Rimuru, this much is simple to provide. You have Sir Rigurd and everyone else in town to thank for making a habit of being so thorough with their work!”</p>
<p>Mjöllmile was a really reliable guy. It went without saying that <a id="page-29"/>Rigurd, Rigur, and everybody working under them deserved great praise, but when it came to good customer service and satisfied lodgers, Mjöllmile was my go-to man. All things considered, I figured we were off to a pretty good start.</p>
<p>“Okay. Keep it up!”</p>
<p>“That I will!”</p>
<p>Leaving the rest to Mjöllmile, I resolved to devote myself to our most important of visitors.</p>

<p class="tx1">We were in our meeting hall.</p>
<p>Shuna and Shion were busy with all sorts of prep work. Catering for such a large crowd, after all, meant careful advance preparation. And Gabil and Kurobe were just as busy, performing final checks on the exhibits they had going. Since I wasn’t dealing with monsters right now, I didn’t need to put on such an overpowering “I am stronger than you” act—thus I figured we didn’t need my entire staff on hand. And given the lack of a strict species-based hierarchy, things didn’t have to be nearly as solemn and pretentious.</p>
<p>I was, obviously, in human form, dressed to the nines in order to express my force and financial wealth. That part, frankly, I didn’t care about. Being a slime would’ve been a lot easier, but I’d given up on pushing that. On <em>that</em> note, none of my advisers was willing to budge.</p>
<p class="space-break">The nobility from the Western Nations were inoffensive enough in their greetings to me. The king of Blumund arrived in the midst of our hellos, looking like the same nice, approachable middle-aged man as ever—the kind of king you’d expect in an illustration from a book of fairy tales.</p>
<p>Next to him was his queen, beautiful and still looking young. I didn’t know her age, but apparently they had been married over twenty years. At first glance, they didn’t look like the best of matches, but they were a loving one, and the people of Blumund were great fans of them both.</p>
<p>“I must apologize for not thanking you sooner,” he told me. “You <a id="page-30"/>winning over Marquis Muller and Earl Hellman, as well as applying pressure to the Western Holy Church, helped us all a great deal.”</p>
<p>It was this man’s consent that had allowed Fuze to move so freely. I could have pulled off that plan only because of the promises he kept. And thanks to his singing my praises far and wide, my reputation actually didn’t seem that bad. Judging by the increasing number of merchants coming to my nation, the Kingdom of Blumund certainly proved influential to me.</p>
<p>I gave the king thanks, but he laughed and waved it off. “No, no, Sir Rimuru! There’s hardly any need to thank me. All we did was live up to the terms of the treaty we ratified. And did Fuze tell you, by the way? I had staked quite a bit on you. Our nation’s fate, in fact, is now tied in with yours. And I did this because we <em>do</em> stand to profit, of course, so there’s no need for further thanks!”</p>
<p>He gave me a gregarious smile—but I could tell the king of Blumund could not be taken lightly. He just said, to my face, that he had his own interests in mind. The idea of requiring further thanks made him laugh.</p>
<p>“Still,” I said, “I <em>am</em> happy to see that you trusted in us.”</p>
<p>Showing gratitude is always important. I didn’t mean to keep banging on this point, but I wanted to bring it across.</p>
<p>“I truly wonder if you really <em>are</em> a demon lord sometimes,” the king replied with a snicker. Then he recomposed himself and looked me in the eye. “And I do understand that our Viscount Cazac caused you quite a bit of trouble. I’m quite glad you were able to rescue your countrymen from him.”</p>
<p>Ah, Viscount Cazac. It was mostly Mjöllmile he’d caused trouble for, though. And if I had to guess, that “Orthrus” gang had been operating in the Forest of Jura well before I became demon lord. But it was a stain on the reputation of Blumund, I suppose, although it really all came down to the viscount himself.</p>
<p>He was just a patsy, really. A horrible man. It wasn’t like he’d personally cracked the whip or anything, but a crime is a crime, as much as Cazac apparently crowed about how the nobility can treat low-born monsters any way they want without penalty. Expecting to get off scot-free was far too selfish.</p>
<p><a id="page-31"/>“Well, with everything fully settled now, I have no interest in dragging that case any further,” I replied.</p>
<p>“I appreciate that!”</p>
<p>“So what will you be doing with him?”</p>
<p>As part of Blumund’s nobility, I couldn’t prosecute him under my own rules—but no punishment at all was unacceptable. I didn’t want to make this a huge incident, but whether or not I did anything depended on the king of Blumund. He, fortunately, understood this.</p>
<p>“Cazac no longer holds a noble title,” he said, voice turning low and ominous. “Given his ties with international criminal gangs, it’s fair to say he’s forgotten his duties as a nobleman. I would hardly abide the likes of him referring to himself as Blumundian nobility. Thus, he has been stripped of his titles and exiled from our lands. The House of Cazac is no more, and thus I consider the case to be closed.”</p>
<p>No problems there. It almost seemed too harsh a penalty, but then, slave trading violates international law. Treating him with kid gloves could even make Blumund’s king look like a pushover. Thinking of it that way, the punishment felt almost merciful to me. Cazac had been a noble his whole life; finding another life for himself would doubtlessly pose difficulties. Without his name, fortune, or even a familiar homeland, I didn’t envy the path this man had ahead of him. But if he could stay alive, maybe he could turn over a new leaf. The punishment fit the crime, certainly, and I had no objection to it.</p>
<p>“Very well. I am willing to accept that punishment.”</p>
<p>“A relief to hear! Is it safe to say that our treaty remains in effect, then?”</p>
<p>“I’d hope for nothing else. May we remain partners for years to come.”</p>
<p>We exchanged a firm handshake. The incident was behind us.</p>
<p class="space-break">Now it was on to the main subject. The king’s face brightened as he immediately got down to the business on his mind.</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru, I heard the news from Fuze. He spoke of some grand operation you had in the planning stages?”</p>
<p>Apparently, he wanted to hear more about the outlook on the future I’d given Fuze.</p>
<p><a id="page-32"/>“Well, that’s something involving much more than just your kingdom and mine. I’m hoping we can assemble representatives from all the nations involved for further discussion. I intended to travel to you to discuss it in detail, but…”</p>
<p>“Oh-ho-ho! No need to be so secretive. Fuze gave me a short rundown, but it sounds like something that could very well affect our position in the world. I could hardly leave the matter to my bureaucracy.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I could go into some detail…”</p>
<p>The official discussion was planned for another day. For now, I gave the king my basic plans for turning Blumund into a distribution hub for the world at large. But:</p>
<p>“…I see. Hmm, hmm…”</p>
<p>“My lord, this sounds like a proposal we should move every mountain to make a reality, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>I had given only a quick rundown, but the king had a different look about him by this point. The real him was now on the surface, revealing a man burning with ambition—and his queen, who hadn’t spoken until now, had just as much trouble hiding her excitement. It seemed this woman was as equally astute as her husband. No doubt my pitch was all she’d needed to accurately calculate how much profit was on the table.</p>
<p>Blumund’s king wasn’t their only leader I should watch out for. Here we had a king with a gambler’s penchant for snap decisions, along with a calm, collected, and calculating queen. Their powers combined must’ve been what had made this small kingdom so continuously influential.</p>
<p>“Of course,” I cautioned, “this only happens after the Founder’s Festival is a resounding success. It’s still three days before it begins.”</p>
<p>“Oh-ho-ho! I’m sure there is little to worry about. Why, it hasn’t started yet, and just look at how lively things are! And I can only imagine how many nobles worldwide are making the journey over here.”</p>
<p>“I can only imagine,” echoed the queen. “But as you said, Sir Rimuru, there is no need for us to hurry matters. A plan like the one you proposed will require an agreement from all the nations involved. In the meantime, we will work with our own government to ensure a consensus on this matter.”</p>
<p><a id="page-33"/>“My lady is right. It was simply delightful to hear such a fine proposal from you, Sir Rimuru. Now, shall we be on our way?”</p>
<p>“I hope the Tempest Founder’s Festival is a resounding success,” the queen closed as she and her husband got to their feet. They had no intention of acting all pompous and wasting my time talking in pointless prose. They had what they came for, and now they were done with me. I liked them for that. It was much easier to deal with.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I replied. “Please enjoy our nation to the fullest.”</p>
<p>“We certainly intend to!” the king shouted as they walked away, to which the queen added, “Yes, I can hardly wait.”</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">The day after I spoke with Blumund’s royal couple, I was greeted by another big name—Gazel, the dwarven king.</p>
<p>“Well, Rimuru, here I am!” he said as he sat across from me with an audible <em>whump</em>. “My first journey by carriage in far too long! I’m exhausted!”</p>
<p>Imposing as always, to be sure. He was already reaching out for the tea and snacks on the table, like they were his God-given right.</p>
<p>“Whoa there. Don’t take <em>mine</em>, too, all right?”</p>
<p>I was a little slow on the trigger. In an instant, the last doughnut on the table was up and into his mouth. I had been looking forward to that. Who knew he had a sweet tooth to go with his tremendous drinking habit? There’s just never any underestimating him.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, no need to sweat the details. If such trifles still bother you, you have much left to learn, mm?”</p>
<p><em>Much left to learn how?</em> You’re <em>the one stealing my doughnuts.</em> I stared at the self-serving Gazel, but he gave me no quarter, returning the gaze.</p>
<p>“And thanks to the chiefs raising a hue and cry, we had a whole caravan of carriages. The length of it was ridiculous. And it’s all your fault, Rimuru!”</p>
<p>As he explained—in great detail—the journey here from Dwargon normally took a day on winged horse. Since this was an official state visit, however, he wasn’t allowed to go with the Pegasus Knights <a id="page-35"/>alone. It wasn’t just because of security concerns, either. Gazel would be seeing nobility from around the world, and as king of the mighty nation of Dwargon, he needed to show he was a military power. This meant having to pack multiple changes of clothes and such, along with administrators and attendants to help dress him properly. It made his entourage a more than decently sized crowd.</p>
