<p class="noindentt"><a id="page-86"></a>Frey smiled. The thanks helped me loosen up a bit. That was all it took to create new problems for myself.</p>
<p>“Well, I hope our food here is to your liking. And ah yes—are there any ingredients you can’t have? We <em>do</em> have chicken on the menu, but if that’s a problem—”</p>
<p>It was only at that point that I realized the mistake I was making.</p>
<p>“Chick…en?”</p>
<p>Tension cut across the air like an icicle. <em>Oh no</em>, I thought, but it was too late.</p>
<p>“Ah—”</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru, are you equivocating myself with livestock?”</p>
<p>“Ummm, no, I didn’t mean to…”</p>
<p>Frey was still smiling. The Twin Wings around her all but snarled at me. What a mistake. What did I just say? Loose lips <em>do</em> sink ships. They had just sunk mine.</p>
<p>But as I agonized over how to react:</p>
<p>“Pffft! Bwah-ha-ha-ha! Oh man, Rimuru, that was <em>great</em>! You’re just the most incredible man ever. You, calling Frey a bird… That’s just brilliant!”</p>
<p>Carillon, failing to read the room one bit, burst out in laughter.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Milim respectfully added, “<em>I</em> could never do that.”</p>
<p><em>Stop it, guys. Quit giving me those sparkling, wonder-laden eyes of yours.</em></p>
<p>“May I ask what’s so funny, Carillon? And you too, Milim?”</p>
<p>Now Frey was annoyed. I was clearly at fault.</p>
<p>“No, no, I’m sorry. That was a mistake on my part. I just thought you may not like poultry, but I see I was overthinking matters.”</p>
<p>At a time like this, a humble apology is your best bet. Trying to cop an attitude could lead to even worse disagreements later. So I tried to calm Frey down as best I could, bowing my head despite everyone around me.</p>
<p>She reacted to this with a look of surprise. “Hee-hee! Ah, Sir Rimuru, you’re exactly the sort of person I hoped you might be. I realized you didn’t intend to insult me, but I just wanted to test your reaction. Now I know. Seeing how you hold yourself has doubtlessly helped Lady Milim grow and mature as well.”</p>
<p>The composed smile returned to her face. Milim was no longer a <a id="page-87"></a>tyrant. She wasn’t exactly a benevolent ruler, no, but at least she was willing to listen to people a little more—and Frey must’ve thought I was the reason, so she used my mistake to test me a little. She must’ve hoped I was an example for her to follow.</p>
<p>Bowing to her, then, was the correct answer. If Milim was imitating me, after all, I should’ve expected Frey to test me. If I was a <em>bad</em> example for her, after all, she might have kept Milim from visiting me. I had to hand it to Frey—I thought she was a scary big-sister type, but she really <em>was</em> looking out for Milim.</p>
<p>As for bad examples…</p>
<p>“By the way, Caaaaaarillon? What exactly was so funny again? Would you mind explaining in a way I would understand?”</p>
<p>A wave of pressure crashed on Carillon’s head. I could almost hear the sound of twisted metal when it hit home. Frey descended upon him with lightning speed, her graceful hand palming his entire head. In terms of muscle, Carillon could win out, but this eagle-like grip was definitely something Frey had over him.</p>
<p>“W-wait a sec! Ow, ahhh, seriously, <em>ow</em>!”</p>
<p>Frey’s arm was stiffened from her elbow to her fingertips. Her fingers grew into talons harder than steel, expanding in size as they dug into Carillon’s head. Yeah, I <em>bet</em> that hurt.</p>
<p>“No, that… Really, I can’t take any more! I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Please forgive me!!”</p>
<p>Despite their master’s shouting, the Three Lycanthropeers didn’t move a muscle. Phobio fidgeted a bit, clearly worried for Carillon, but the other two just gave the ex–demon lord exasperated stares. Yeah, Carillon could no doubt hold out a little longer—and given his obvious lack of regret, he probably had it coming, too.</p>
<p>“Are you watching, Milim?” I asked. “If you do something bad, you apologize. That’s the correct choice, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I agree! And for <em>that</em> matter, I’ll try not to get you angry in the first place, Frey!”</p>
<p>Milim understood what I was trying to tell her. She could play till she was pooped in the Dungeon, but moderation was key. Take care of everything that needed to get done first, and that made your subsequent recreation all the more fun. If you could <a id="page-88"></a>accomplish that, then great—just watch you don’t cause offense like Carillon.</p>
<p>“Whoa! Come on! Hey! Stop chatting over there and help me!!”</p>
<p>Milim and I nodded, the struggling Carillon serving as a fine example of what <em>not</em> to do.</p>
<p>“Don’t just ignore me! Owwwwww…”</p>
<p>His voice was fading from my ears. <em>Thanks, Carillon</em>, I thought as Milim and I waited for Frey to cool down. <em>We’ll never forget your sacrifice.</em></p>

<p class="tx1">Even as this little fracas was taking place, Shuna was fully carrying out her duties for me.</p>
<p>“All right, here comes more food!” she said with a smile as she brought out all sorts of dishes, the crowd cheering her on.</p>
<p>Putting Carillon’s sacrifice behind us, we all moved on. “Hey!” he protested as Frey finally released him. “Milim! Rimuru! I was screaming at you to help me!”</p>
<p>“Oh, stop complaining! You’re totally fine!”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I agreed. “Frey wasn’t really serious, so it wasn’t <em>that</em> big of a deal, was it?”</p>
<p>Carillon was clearly unharmed, so I felt safe saying that. Apparently, I was wrong.</p>
<p>“No, it was! From the moment she put her claws around my head, that knocked out all my skills. I think that’s Frey’s unique skill or something. If she used <em>that</em> on the likes of me, then it must seriously be love!”</p>
<p>I <em>really</em> didn’t think so, but I didn’t tell him. Shuna’s cuisine takes precedence right now. The dishes were all placed on a single round table. Our attendants had reserved this set for Milim’s party.</p>
<p>“Thanks in advance for this,” Milim said to Shuna. “Middray’s a pretty stubborn guy, so I want something that knocks him on his butt on the first taste!”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! I understand, Lady Milim. Enjoy!”</p>
<p>Shuna smiled, putting Milim’s mind at ease. They had taken a <a id="page-89"></a>liking to each other, so Milim looked even more reassured than when I’d spoken to her.</p>
<p>However:</p>
<p>“I have to say, Lady Milim, I am not impressed by you being taught all these blasphemous ways…”</p>
<p>The moment dinner was served to Milim’s servant Middray, he immediately started chiding me. This was exactly who Milim was talking about in the letter she sent. Hermes, meanwhile, was looking at me, hands clasped together in a prayerful apology—he must’ve been worried Middray’s words would anger me. The long-suffering type, I guess. I liked that.</p>
<p>Watching us from afar, meanwhile, were the now-well-fed nobility, busily chatting with themselves. It was chitchat, yes, but it was <em>noble</em> chitchat. Info gathering was the name of the game, and right now, they were more interested in our exchanges than their own conversation. The question on their minds: How would the demon lord Milim and her people react to the food they considered so tasty? Especially given how one of them, Middray, already demonstrated so little understanding of our efforts? Some would no doubt conclude that, while having different values wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, humans dealing with magic-born would remain an uphill battle.</p>
<p>If that happened, then so be it, but I figured we were fine. Hermes, Milim’s other attendant, apparently wanted to spread the general concept of cuisine among the Dragon Faithful, besides.</p>
<p>So I decided to engage Middray. “Blasphemous?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Hmph! Since ancient times, we have deemed it proper to praise the blessings of our foodstuffs—and to enjoy them as is, in their natural form. And now I am presented with this…”</p>
<p>It was a salad with dressing. That was no good. Neither, it seemed, was potato salad, since it meant mashing the potatoes and defiling their original form.</p>
<p>“And what manner of behavior is this? Grilling meat—all right, fair enough. But why do you then stain it with this mysterious liquid? It is deplorable—truly deplorable!”</p>
<p>Middray must’ve been angry, because I saw a throbbing vein on his forehead as he glared at me. This offended Shuna enough to wipe <a id="page-90"></a>the smile from her face, and she glared right back at him. Hermes, noticing this, grew pale and started bowing profusely to Shuna and me…but Middray, not bothered by this, kept right on going.</p>
<p>“What sheer disrespect for our natural blessings! I was prepared to accept whatever you choose to do within your own territory, but now you are getting Lady Milim involved? Outrageous!”</p>
<p>He pointed out the hearty soup and bite-size cream croquettes on the table as he lectured me on his food theories. The sheer force he put behind each word certainly made it clear why Milim asked me for help. Trying to reason with him was exhausting…or, really, stultifying. He was the type who believed he, and only he, was correct, refusing to lend an ear to anyone else.</p>
<p>But that would end today. It’d be one thing if their palates evolved differently from ours, but the only issue here was Middray’s way of thinking. And it wasn’t just a wrong assumption of his or anything—there was just nothing correct about his theory at all. I mean, Milim—the figure he worshipped—couldn’t wait to chow down on this. She was pouting, like a dog ordered to wait for a treat.</p>
<p>It was time to finish this. I knew I had it in the bag. If I got Middray to say, <em>This is good</em>, I won. Just one spoonful of anything from Shuna would seal the deal once it crossed his lips. Thus I was optimistic about this—but then reality came along.</p>
<p>“I absolutely refuse to recognize anything even <em>close</em> to this!!”</p>
<p>Middray was still enraged, uninterested in a single morsel. My victory rode on the assumption that he’d at least try <em>something</em>, but if he wasn’t up for that, it meant I’d lose without a fight.</p>
<p>Milim gave me a concerned look. Hermes’s gaze was skyward, wondering where everything went wrong. With all the yelling from Middray, we were starting to draw a large audience. Even the lower-ranked invitees, the kind who failed to get an audience with Elmesia, started gathering to see how this would turn out. If I lost this verbal sparring match in front of this crowd, the fallout might affect a lot more than my street cred.</p>
<p>“Rimuru,” a worried Milim said, “I didn’t expect Middray to be so stubborn about this. Should I maybe ask him to go to another room for now?”</p>
<p><a id="page-91"></a>“Yes,” added Hermes, “I’m sorry about our head priest. He’s always a little hot under the collar, but he’s really not a bad man… I didn’t expect the topic of food to enrage him so much.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… I thought a taste would change his tune, but I underestimated him. I don’t want to force the issue, so I don’t know…”</p>
<p>I mean, we didn’t <em>have</em> to work this out today. The festival only truly began tomorrow, so there was no need to rush things. So I decided to learn from my mistake, think of a better way to deal with Middray, and move on.</p>
<p>But someone wasn’t willing to let this slide. The hall echoed with a loud <em>wham</em> as Shuna—a smile of a very different sort on her face—slammed her hands against the table in front of Middray. The head priest’s eyes shot open—out of surprise, not pain. I could see why. Shuna had reacted <em>incredibly</em> fast. Even if you were prepared for it, not many people could’ve reacted in time.</p>
<p>“Wh-what are you doing?!”</p>
<p>“Silence!!” a glassy-eyed Shuna shouted, taking a bowl of stew and thrusting it in his face. “See all the ingredients in this stew? This is what Sir Rimuru sees as their ideal state!”</p>
<p><em>Um… What? What’s that mean?</em></p>
<p>“Under Sir Rimuru,” she continued as I sat there stupefied, “there are gathered lycanthropes, there are harpies, there are the magic-born who once served Clayman… There are even dragonewts like yourself. Any one of those races alone would be powerful, I am sure. But bring them all together…and they will enjoy even more power than ever before. Please try this.”</p>
<p>With unexpected force, Shuna made Middray grasp the spoon. Swallowed up by the momentum, Middray meekly brought it to his lips. And here I had given up. Shuna made it look so easy…and once we reached this point, the results were just what we expected.</p>
<p>“…!!”</p>
<p>Abject surprise crossed Middray’s face.</p>
<p>“Wh-what is this…?!”</p>
<p>“Well? It’s good, isn’t it?” said Shuna. “This is called ‘harmony.’ Each individual ingredient tones itself down in order to form a complete overall taste. That’s the fervent hope contained in this stew.”</p>
<p><a id="page-92"></a>…Oh. And here I thought it was just a nice bowl of soup.</p>
<p>“It… It’s good. Better than any kind of vegetable I’ve eaten before… This single spoonful has so much depth to it…”</p>
<p>Yeah, I could imagine. Compared to raw veggies, Shuna’s cuisine is always gonna take the prize. To Middray, it must’ve been an unprecedented, revolutionary discovery.</p>
<p>“Um,” a red-faced Hermes said, “I would appreciate it if you could stop looking at me like a poor beggar on the road…” Very clearly, he didn’t want people to think he was like his boss. I’d probably say the same thing. I knew all about people trying to do the right thing and their bosses shutting them down—and those very peons being held responsible anyway when things went south. I felt bad for him, so I gave him a reassuring nod for his troubles.</p>
<p>Even as Hermes and I exchanged glances, Middray was finishing off the bowl of stew. “If you understand now,” a much sunnier Shuna told him, “then very well. But please remember this: Cuisine is about far more than this single bowl.”</p>
<p>After that stew, Middray seemed much more receptive to her words. “What do you mean?” he asked back, face serious and thoughtful.</p>
<p>“If this stew,” she replied, “is like the land Lady Milim rules over, then this loaf of bread is the Kingdom of Blumund. This steak is the new land of Farminus. If this foie gras terrine is the Dwarven Kingdom, I suppose that makes the seafood here Thalion. You can combine them in many ways—but no cuisine can survive on a single plate. And nations are the same way. It’s the broad, deep connections among them that make them more bountiful and satisfying. <em>That</em> is the world Sir Rimuru seeks.”</p>
<p>The smile on Shuna’s face came from the heart. Middray must have felt something from it, because now his eyes turned to the other dishes on the table. He thought for a moment in silence—not just him but everyone watching from afar.</p>
<p>“It… It is…?”</p>
<p>“Sure, diplomatic relations certainly are important,” I replied.</p>
<p>“Indeed. But I did not know that His Majesty, the Demon Lord Rimuru, had such thoughts…”</p>
<p><a id="page-93"></a>“How wonderful! And even the best of cuisine can be ruined with the wrong amount of salt. Instead he’s bringing different dishes together to form a complete full course, then? A truly fascinating concept!”</p>
<p>Now the crowd excitedly talked among themselves. I, um, couldn’t say I thought about it <em>that</em> way, no—but Shuna’s forceful persuasion must have spoken to their hearts in grand fashion. Considering the total lack of theme to the buffet food, it was <em>really</em> a stretch, but it worked.</p>
<p>Honestly, Shuna had impressed me just now. Not only her speech but the glorious food that did so much of the talking for her. People like Middray, afraid of values different from their own, now found it in themselves to dream of a future where humans and monsters worked together—all thanks to the example of “harmony” within cuisine.</p>
<p>“Also,” Shuna added, “note that it takes more than simply tossing everything into a bowl and mixing it up.” Her eyes turned on Shion behind me for just a moment, and I’ll just pretend I didn’t notice that, thanks. “So now that we’ve convinced you, bear in mind that most food’s best while it’s warm. Lady Milim, Lord Carillon, Lady Frey, and all their attendants—please enjoy it before it gets cold.”</p>
<p>Her words were like a starter pistol to Milim’s ears. She immediately dove in.</p>
<p>“Yes! This is <em>great</em>!!”</p>
<p>That, plus her wide grin, was the answer she had for us, loud and clear. No need for grandiose vocabulary with her. One look at that face, and it was easy to understand.</p>
<p>“I…see. I have been mistaken…and Lady Milim waited so patiently for me to realize it…”</p>
<p>The message came across to Middray, too. After far too long, he had finally seen the light.</p>
<p>“Now, Sir Middray, no need to feel depressed. You’ll just make things gloomy for the whole table. Let’s enjoy it while it’s hot!”</p>
<p>Hermes’s advice—not advised for the current situation, although he likely knew that full well and said it anyway—made a vein throb on Middray’s head once more.</p>
<p><a id="page-94"></a>“Youuuu…”</p>
<p>“Um, what? Why is your head looking like a melon…?”</p>
<p>“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Why be angry, Middray? Hermes is right. Besides, if you don’t chow down soon, <em>I’m</em> gonna eat it all instead!”</p>
<p>“Pffft. Count yourself lucky today, Hermes. On behalf of Lady Milim and this fine food before me, I will forgive this affront!”</p>
<p>Smiles and laughter filled the scene, as if everyone—man and monster alike—shared in the same heart.</p>
<p>“You’ve got some little sister,” I remarked to Benimaru when we happened to make eye contact.</p>
<p>“Don’t I, though? I’m so proud of her.” He nodded back, like this was a given. Shuna, who must’ve overheard us, blushed a little and headed to the back room.</p>
<p class="space-break">The feast was set to run from six to nine p.m. that evening, but we wound up extending it another two hours. One reason was all the latecomers—the VIPs and such who had snubbed the event at first but ran over once news of Elmesia’s appearance spread. The other was the, shall we say, <em>excessively</em> healthy appetites of Middray and Carillon’s band. It was a long time before they finally said “no more,” for sure.</p>
<p>But the reasons don’t matter. In the end, it was a huge success. And so the preopening feast, despite a few unexpected bumps along the way, came to a close after providing results beyond what even I expected.</p>
