<p class="noindentt">Compared to him, I had it <em>damn</em> lucky. Like Hinata told me as well, trying to replicate Japanese cuisine in this world was, to say the least, a challenge.</p>
<p>Hakuro’s granddad, though, huh? I remember him described as an otherworlder named Byakuya Araki. Did he live back in, like, the Edo era, maybe? Samurai and shoguns and so on? I doubted he was a sushi chef himself, but when could he have been born?</p>
<p><em>…But, ah, it doesn’t matter. Gotta live life in the now.</em></p>
<p class="space-break">The buffet table was alive with chatting guests. The food was a hit, everyone raving about it. Shuna and Yoshida had given everything they had to their team-up, so I’d say they deserved all the praise they got.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the sashimi and <em>nigiri</em> sushi Hakuro made for the crowd was still being wholeheartedly ignored. Maybe the terrifying sight of that spear tuna was a little too stomach-churning to whet their appetites. I spotted at least one show-off telling his friend, “Good heavens, that’s an A rank…,” and so on. There’s one trivia whiz in every crowd, isn’t there?</p>
<p>But…c’mon. It was freshly cut sashimi; there was no way it could taste bad. I wished they wouldn’t act so boorish and give it a try, at least. In this world, you could detect poison in food without eating it first, so everybody here knew that wasn’t a concern. The visuals must’ve convinced them this was some kind of low-grade garbage food.</p>
<p>Well, if nobody was willing to step up to the plate, it was time for me to lead off.</p>
<p>“I’ll take one.”</p>
<p>“By all means!”</p>
<p>Hakuro was kind enough to whip up a new piece of <em>toro</em> fatty tuna for me. I placed some soy sauce on it and popped it in my mouth. The combination of fragrant wasabi and the tuna’s melt-in-your-mouth umami came together, forming an explosion of supreme taste.</p>
<p><a id="page-74"></a>It was so gooooooood!! <em>So</em> good. I mean, I’d been to crazy-fancy places in Ginza before, and I’d <em>never</em> had anything at this level.</p>
<p>“This is <em>amazing</em>, Hakuro!!”</p>
<p>“That it is, I’m sure. I was concerned such fine fish may not last long tonight, but I fear the audience reaction is a tad disappointing. It will be something to look forward to over drinks tonight, though, no doubt!”</p>
<p>Hakuro and the rest of the staff would eat after the guests left. He must’ve been hoping for some spear tuna to enjoy with his sake later. And he was right—the snub from the guests was a pity, but if he’d made this for himself anyway, then no harm, no foul. In fact, he almost seemed to <em>want</em> them to hate it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was Hakuro who had to be disappointed.</p>
<p>“Would you make me a piece of tuna underbelly without the wasabi, please?”</p>
<p>Well, well, who’s this? Someone with a lot of guts, asking for the <em>ootoro</em>, arguably the best part of the whole tuna. And no wasabi?!</p>
<p>“What are you, a child?”</p>
<p>“Oh, shut it. I don’t like that sting in my nose.”</p>
<p>It was Hinata, dressed in a simple night dress and acting a little too big for her britches for my taste. Ordering sushi like it was her divine right!</p>
<p>“Too bad there isn’t a little more variety.”</p>
<p>And now she was complaining about <em>that</em>? First no wasabi, then a larger menu? Okay, I’ll grant you that not everybody’s on the wasabi bandwagon—it can be tough if you’ve never had it before. I asked for no wasabi up until around middle school age myself. But as a grown-up, a <em>real</em> connoisseur knows how to enjoy the flavor of the wasabi as part of the package.</p>
<p>“What do you mean ‘<em>a real connoisseur’</em>? What’s that even matter? If it tastes good, it tastes good.”</p>
<p>She was chortling at me now…but she was right. Goddamn it. Why does Hinata have to be so <em>rational</em> about everything?</p>
<p>So she picked up the plate from Hakuro, beaming. Slowly, she placed a piece inside her mouth, closing her eyes.</p>
<p><a id="page-75"></a>“This…really is excellent. First sashimi and then sushi… It rankles me, but I have to respect you, Rimuru.”</p>
<p>Sounds like a satisfied customer. She savored the tuna, a look of joy on her face.</p>
<p>“Right,” said Yuuki, coming up from behind, “I’ll have one, too. Oh, and <em>with</em> wasabi, because I’m not a kid.”</p>
<p>Given the jab at Hinata, he must have been observing us for a while. I knew he had sampled quite a bit from the buffet, but he must’ve still been just as hungry. Taking a plate from Hakuro, he finished off the contents fast, no doubt waiting for this moment.</p>
<p>“Whoa. It’s just melt-in-your-mouth! Man, getting to eat sushi <em>this</em> good, over <em>here</em>… It’s honestly kind of moving.”</p>
<p>He was already reaching for the sushi as he spoke, a smile on his face.</p>
<p>“It certainly is different from freshwater fish,” countered Hinata, “is it not? You know, I asked the Free Guild for fish like this, but they turned me down, and I can’t magically transport them to me. I had given up on it. But this definitely brings a little more joy to my life.”</p>
<p>Apparently, Hinata had missed seafood so much that she’d asked Yuuki to bring some over to her. That, however, was logistically difficult—there were so many issues to deal with, they couldn’t find anyone to tackle the job. Hinata must’ve brought that up to get back at Yuuki for his wasabi jab.</p>
<p>“Well, I couldn’t do much about <em>that</em>,” Yuuki replied with a pained grin. “The northern seas are too full of giant fish to be safe, and the south is too far away to make transport very efficient. And you can’t make a profit off seafood if you’re shipping it in just from inland waters.”</p>
<p>He was right. Logistics in this world were still pretty weak. As I expected, inlanders had almost no chance to sample fresh fish. Getting seafood to them was just too difficult. Wagons could carry only a little at a time, and temperature control was a major hassle. You’d have to either bring along a sorcerer or have vast quantities of ice available in each town—and even then, there was no telling if you could maintain freshness from the shores all the way to inland cities. You’d have to be <a id="page-76"></a>pretty rich to have a chance at a fresh fillet, and in fact, the idea probably wouldn’t even occur to you in the first place. The concept of fish in stews and such existed, but again, the problem was supply.</p>
<p>This, too, was just what I pictured. Thus, I wanted to take this opportunity to tell the world about the delicacies they could enjoy only in my nation. I’d build more of a distribution network later, but until then, I wanted Tempest to have a monopoly.</p>
<p>Whether they were put off by the spear tuna’s appearance or hesitant about exotic food cultures, nobody had touched the sushi or sashimi. But now, with both Hinata and Yuuki singing its praises, the tides were about to turn. A man stood up from the corner King Gazel was occupying and came over.</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru, can we have some as well?” he asked.</p>
<p>If I recalled correctly, this was Dolph, captain of the Pegasus Knights.</p>
<p>“Certainly, go ahead. I’ll have it brought over.”</p>
<p>As if on command, Hakuro’s hands began moving at astonishing speed. The plates were quickly lined with fresh-made sushi, sashimi, and <em>osuimono</em>, a light seafood broth. These were brought over by our elf-girl waitstaff, all arranged in a neat row in front of Gazel, Yohm, and the others seated on their pillows.</p>
<p>Now, for the big moment. How would they react?</p>
<p>“…Mm. Excellent as always.”</p>
<p>“<em>Kahhh!</em> This is good!!”</p>
<p>With a swig of chilled sake, Gazel grabbed a piece of sashimi—and it certainly didn’t seem to disappoint him. Yohm, meanwhile, was enrapt at his first bite, expressing himself in his usual honest (and very un-noble) way.</p>
<p>The rest of their friends had similar praise for it.</p>
<p>“I had no idea that monster fish could be so delicious!”</p>
<p>“I thought fish wasn’t good for much of anything apart from grilling…”</p>
<p>“Hey, if it tastes good, it tastes good, you know?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and certainly Sir Rimuru has never brought us anything short of excellent!”</p>
<p><a id="page-77"></a>Good, good. Glad I had everyone satisfied. And even better: A large number of people were observing their reactions.</p>
<p>“Me too! I’d like to have some!”</p>
<p>The moment one noble shouted that, a mad dash of orders for Hakuro ensued. Now it was a big hit—one that made Hakuro happy, if a little regretful. Yeah, I wasn’t so sure he’d have something to enjoy with his sake tonight after all. <em>I actually have another spear tuna on hand—let’s surprise him with it afterward.</em></p>
<p>After Hinata and Yuuki kicked off with their light banter, they were exchanging heated opinions about every other topic in the world with each other, drinks in hand. It was hard to tell if they liked or hated each other—but their little debate over wasabi had turned this offering into a success story. It wouldn’t be nice to interrupt them now, so I resolved to thank them later.</p>
<p class="space-break">So the party continued. So far, I’d call it a big success. All the food, Western- and Eastern-style, was earning raves. This was a “come if you like” thing; nobody’s attendance was required, but a lot of people showed up anyway. If we kept up relations with them all, I’d have to be sure to dangle these foodstuffs in front of their eyes and tell them we could get a regular supply going.</p>
<p>This much, too, was as I’d planned it. This kind of on-the-ground PR was my job. I’m not just here to live it up and dine on the hog, no. I’m not extravagant and selfish—that was all prep work for a chance like this!</p>
<p>…But enough excuses.</p>
<p>In that way as well, the event was proceeding as planned. But then:</p>
<p>“U-urgent news, sir!!”</p>
<p>A soldier burst into the room. I guess we had a problem.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">As one would expect, there were guards posted all around this reception hall, including the personal bodyguards of the political <a id="page-78"></a>figures inside. The area around the building was thus full of people, and if there was an issue out there, it was likely to be a serious one.</p>
<p>“What’s up? What happened?” I spoke slowly to the soldier to calm him down. I’d love to run out and see things for myself, but I couldn’t act agitated right now. But before the soldier could answer, a large contingent of bodyguards from all manner of nations tore into the room at great haste.</p>
<p>Seriously, what was going <em>on</em> here?! Our security program was supposed to be perfect. If we had an incident on our hands, something seriously went wrong. I didn’t sense any particularly large aura approaching; this wasn’t a monster attack. If it was, it would’ve been detected sooner. Milim and Carillon <em>were</em> a bit late, but their arrival wouldn’t trigger a panic like this.</p>
<p>So what could it be…?</p>
<p>The soldier turned toward me. “A large flying object has flown in! It’s outside of town!”</p>
<p>As he spoke, the other bodyguards were giving their own reports to their respective bosses, shouting in loud voices.</p>
<p>“Reporting, sir! The emperor of the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion has appeared!!”</p>
<p>“It’s an emergency! The Heavenly Emperor, Elmesia El-Ru Thalion herself, has set foot upon this land!!”</p>
<p>“Her Excellency the Emperor and her entourage are walking toward this reception hall!!”</p>
<p>I was freaking out for a moment, but to sum it up, this was just the emperor of Thalion arriving a little late.</p>
<p>“Whew. <em>That’s</em> a relief. I was wondering what was up.”</p>
<p>I breathed a sigh of relief. But Gazel, who deigned to get up from his seat to approach me, was sighing for other reasons.</p>
<p>“Just as thoughtless and ignorant as ever, eh? What else would happen if Emperor Elmesia left her borders? I know we’re all trying to gauge one another at this event—even me—but the emperor herself is simply too much to handle. I am sure even those not in attendance tonight are hurriedly sending missives back to their homelands.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p><a id="page-79"></a>I wanted more details, and Gazel was just waiting for the chance to give me some. He just <em>loves</em> to go on about all his knowledge in front of me, like some kind of genius—but it <em>did</em> help me, I realized, so I resolved not to complain too loudly.</p>
<p>As he put it, the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion was a large country, one as strong as the Armed Nation of Dwargon, despite being fully independent with no involvement in the Council of the West. Plus, as the term <em>Dynasty</em> suggested, it was a federation of thirteen distinct kingdoms. In terms of power, the Council of the West was definitely the biggest force out there—but given its parliamentarian system, it couldn’t immediately carry out policy at a moment’s notice. Dwargon, on the other hand, was a monarchy under Gazel, so while it fell behind in overall power, its statements still held sway with the Western Nations. The same was true of Thalion.</p>
<p>“Elmesia holds immense power in Thalion. She’s hailed as a descendant of divinity, and she’s the one who declared herself Heavenly Emperor in the first place. I don’t know how divine she <em>is</em>, exactly, but it’s absolutely true that Thalion was founded by a high elf named Elmesia. That woman’s been around for longer than Thalion itself.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t even remotely on the same scale. Dwargon’s history extended back for a thousand years. Compared to that, it was said Thalion could trace its roots back over two millennia.</p>
<p>“Do you see what I mean now, Rimuru? Even <em>I</em> have to be respectful to Elmesia. And imagine if you were a human, with your short life span. Why, you would never have a chance to meet her in your life, even if you wanted to!”</p>
<p>Given Gazel’s obvious distaste for her, Elmesia must have been one tough cookie to deal with. Hmm. I meant to invite only Archduke Erald, I think…but I guess we’d landed someone even bigger.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you know, I guess it’s important to write a name down on your invitations, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“…I don’t think that’s the problem,” a peeved-looking Gazel replied. But she was here, and I had nothing to counter him with. We’d just have to give her the best service we possibly could.</p>
<p>As we spoke, a commotion erupted near the entrance.</p>
<p><a id="page-80"></a>“Looks like she’s arrived.”</p>
<p>“Stay on your guard, Rimuru. Think of her as the slyest old fox you’ll ever see.”</p>
<p>If that’s how Gazel put it, I suppose I’d have to resign myself to some serious competition. I gave him a powerful nod, showing him I was ready to accept this.</p>
<p class="space-break">The hall was in a furor. As I suppose it would be. Here, after all, was an emperor of a vastly powerful nation—one who apparently hadn’t even made a public appearance in decades. Most everyone in the room would normally never get a chance to see her their whole lives.</p>
<p>Elmesia El-Ru Thalion, the leader who declared herself Heavenly Emperor, solemnly strode inside. Everyone there no doubt thought of her as the personification of beauty. They all watched her silently, captured by her presence. Even me, I think—especially since, externally, she looked like such a beautiful young girl. Her skin was like fresh snowfall, her hair a shiny silver. Her ears were long and pointed at the ends, her penetrating eyes the color of jade.</p>
<p>She was female, judging by what Gazel said—no denying that. Are high elves purebred from the fairy races, then? If not, then they must be closely related. Fairies came in all sorts of types, I suppose, but some were descended from the high-ranking spirit classes, and maybe this Elmesia was an example of that, a menace from ancient times. No wonder Gazel was wary of her.</p>
<p>And we had to watch out for her entourage as well. Each guard practically oozed power. They were dressed in ceremonial gear, but even <em>that</em> stuff was all magically charged. All Legend-class, I’m sure. It was strength on the level of Hinata’s sword, Moonlight—and it was coming from their clothing. They had to be at least as strong as Arnaud and the paladins—or maybe, judging by the quality of their gear, the emperor’s guard was even better.</p>
<p><em>It’s a big world out there</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>Then, waving a hand to keep the guard at bay, the emperor stood before me.</p>
<p>“I have accepted your kind invitation,” she said in her clear voice. “It gladdened me.”</p>
<p><a id="page-81"></a>That voice was enough to make all the invitees here melt, it looked like. One might confuse it with a charming magic, but it wasn’t. Her voice really was just that mesmerizing.</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to meet you as well,” I said, returning the favor before her.</p>
<p>Then Elmesia’s jade-colored eyes looked at me.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>Warning. Spiritual Interference detected… Blocked. This was likely not an attack but a natural side effect of Heroic Aura.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">Oh man. This lady’s Heroic Aura on a level that even beat Gazel’s. That means she was at least as powerful as him and quite likely even more so. Demon lord–level, perhaps? It seemed like a keen idea not to get on her wrong side. This was a peaceful invitation, and I wanted to appeal to her with everything I had so we could build a friendly relationship.</p>
<p>“Now, we have some food prepared for all of us, so I hope you will enjoy the remainder of the evening.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am most pleased to see so much careful attention paid to these proceedings. I do look forward to the festivities beginning tomorrow, and I hope they prove to be eminently enjoyable. Also…”</p>
<p>Elmesia had a calm, composed smile on her face as she spoke. Then she brought her face closer to mine. “Doesn’t have to be today,” she whispered so only I could hear, “but I want you to make some time for me, y’know. There’s something I wanna discuss frankly, in a more relaxed environment.”</p>
<p>It was a markedly more casual way of speaking—Elmesia’s true colors showing, I imagined. As someone still getting used to playing the role of a stern, dignified demon lord, it made me feel an affinity for her.</p>
<p>“All right,” I replied. “I’ll let you know when I work out a time.”</p>
<p>She nodded, smiling, then returned to her ring of guards. She kept the smile up, as people clamored around for a chance at winning favor with her while she headed for the buffet table.</p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-82"></a>By the way, I was surprised to see that Erald, the archduke I <em>did</em> invite, was nowhere to be seen. But then I matched eyes with one of her guards.</p>
<p><em>Whoa, it’s</em> him<em>?!</em></p>
<p>He looked so imposing that I totally ignored him at first, but I guess he <em>was</em> here. We exchanged glances and nods, but I definitely wanted to give more formal hellos later.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">It was only a short exchange, but it still exhausted me. Fortunately, Elmesia was now distracting people’s attention away from me, so I decided to kick back in the tatami-mat section. I had assumed this would be a chill little open-invite event, but now I had some real power brokers in here.</p>
<p>“Man, I’m beat.”</p>
<p>“About to get swallowed up, aren’t you? Better keep yourself sharp, or else that old f—”</p>
<p>Gazel stopped himself, taking a swig from his chilled sake to change the subject. I’m guessing the even chillier stare from Elmesia was the reason. I’m sure I wanted to know what he almost said there, although I could venture a guess. Good thing he didn’t finish the sentence. Elves have pretty good hearing, and loose lips sink ships, as they say. I’ll need to be careful, too.</p>
<p>But regardless, time to unwind. I toasted with Gazel and Yohm, opening things up with some chitchat. Unfortunately, I couldn’t relax for long. There was further commotion at the entrance—another celebrity appearance, by the sound of it.</p>
<p>“Looks like she’s finally showed up.”</p>
<p>“She sure has,” I replied to Shion with a nod. “I was worried she’d be too late before long.”</p>
<p>I prepared to give my good-byes and stand back up.</p>
<p>“Oh, Milim’s here?” Yohm said, recognizing her. “Man, she’s painted up all pretty tonight, huh?”</p>
<p>Ever since they had a bit of a tussle, Yohm had kindled something <a id="page-83"></a>of a dislike for Milim. The fact he managed to keep it just to “dislike” probably spoke volumes about his personality. No way any normal person could speak of a demon lord as “painted up” like that, I don’t think. I really had to hand it to him.</p>
<p>“…I see. Bring in the demon lords, eh?”</p>
<p>Gazel’s eyes were sharpened on Milim as well, but it took Yohm to tell him who she was. But I’m sure a few other faces by the door were more familiar to him. After all, she was being led in by members of my own staff—Benimaru, Diablo, Geld, and Gabil.</p>
<p>Now the dwarf king looked nervous. And why not? This quartet was guiding ten people inside, Milim included. She was taking the lead, with two attendants on either side—a bald man named Middray, the head priest of the Dragon Faithful and a fighter worthy enough to earn praise from Benimaru. The other robed attendant was more easygoing. That must’ve been Hermes, the guy Gabil had fought against.</p>
<p>Behind this trio were two former demon lords—Carillon the Beast Master and Frey the Sky Queen. Carillon looked just as majestic as always, and Frey was in a dress I could describe only as “provocative,” turning heads all across the hall. Both of them, to be sure, struck an almighty presence.</p>
<p>Trailing Carillon were the Three Lycanthropeers. Say, this was the first time I’d seen Phobio in a while! He looked a bit thinner than before, but I was glad he was well. Frey, meanwhile, was attended to by a pair of beautiful identical twins, their blond-and-silver hair suiting them well. I had heard of them—they were the “Twin Wings,” her closest servants. I hadn’t realized they were actual twins, but I was sure they were two powerhouses in a fight.</p>
<p>In this group, we had a set of massively powerful rulers, all declaring Milim to be their new queen. Nobody could hide their nerves around them, and I could see why.</p>
<p>“Yep,” I told Gazel as I stood up to greet them. “I’m gonna go say hello.”</p>
<p class="space-break">The moment Milim saw me, she burst into a broad smile.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! The day’s finally here!” she shouted. “Can’t wait <a id="page-84"></a>to see the kind of food that’ll make Middray moan with excitement!”</p>
<p>“Not a problem,” I replied, voice low. “But isn’t anyone angry with you?”</p>
<p>Milim had spent much of the lead-up to this festival poking around my Dungeon and generally avoiding Frey as much as possible. She had been here in town until yesterday, in fact, and they were all late arriving today. This suggested Frey was livid with her, and I was concerned about that.</p>
<p>“Oh, um, no worries there,” she whispered back. “I emphasized to Frey that I’ve built up my self-awareness as a ruler, so I was out protecting my territory the whole time—and she believed me!”</p>
<p>Judging by the sweat running down her face and the way her eyes darted around, I had trouble believing her. Frey was an intuitive woman. Milim had been busy protecting the labyrinth floors I assigned to her, not any of her own lands. If Frey finds out, then I could be dragged in through no fault of my own—but for now, I’d just have to believe in her. I’d have to, but no matter what, I wasn’t involved, okay? Even if it means ditching Milim at the side of the road.</p>
<p>“Thank you for inviting me today,” Frey said after I was done with Milim. “I apologize for our tardiness.” Then she looked into my eyes. “Lady Milim,” she furtively continued, “our new master, was absent from my sight until this morning. It took some time to fit her for her ceremonial wear…”</p>
<p>“Ah, ah-ha-ha, yes, I see! Well, I certainly don’t mind it at all, so please enjoy yourselves for the next few days.”</p>
<p>I turned my eyes away from her penetrating gaze, talking my way out of my imagined predicament. As a slime, if I ever got nervous, it’d never be discernible on the outside. Now, I feared my eye movements made my inner intentions bleedingly obvious. Whenever I dealt with anyone as intuitive as she was, I could never afford to look them in the eye.</p>
<p>“…Oh, of course! Here I am, leaning on you to build an entire new city for us, and now you’ve even invited me to this grand event… I have so much to thank you for.”</p>
