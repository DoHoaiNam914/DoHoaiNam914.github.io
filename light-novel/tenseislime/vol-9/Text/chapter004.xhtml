<p class="noindentt">“If you travel as a king, you need a <em>royal</em> amount of preparation. Having a paved highway to travel on was certainly a boon, but the past few days of travel were just murder on me.”</p>
<p>That must have been why Gazel kept skipping out on his kingdom to travel as light as possible. And come to think of it, Soei had reported that the highway from Blumund was jam-packed with carriages and the like, enough so that the watch needed to play traffic cops for a while, and all the inns along the way were booked solid. Which was great, in a way, but it also reminded me of the need for a larger-scale transport system. Cars in Japan these days, after all, break down very rarely—and if they do, you can call for roadside service and get it handled in no time flat. In this world, though, if you break a wagon axle or something, you’re in trouble. Simply carting the vehicle out of the way of traffic is a painstaking ordeal. You also had horses to take care of, and overall, the whole thing was rife with pitfalls. I deliberately planned for wide highways in anticipation of this, but it still didn’t solve the problem. I was gathering info on these incidents so we could tackle them in the future, but judging by Gazel’s tale, long-distance travel as a noble was an extremely arduous undertaking.</p>
<p>It seemed the traffic jam had mainly been caused by far more nobles deciding to participate than I’d planned for. I’ll need to consider things like that more next time. It’d be nice if we could develop trains and make all of this a lot more comfortable, fast.</p>
<p>But regardless.</p>
<p>“You know, I didn’t expect to see you here at all. I figured you’d send an envoy instead.”</p>
<p>It was true. I really hadn’t. So I was honest with him, hoping he’d take the hint to stop griping at me. It didn’t work.</p>
<p>“Pffft! You think I would do <em>that</em>? When I know you’re up to <a id="page-36"></a>some kind of scheme again? I can’t sleep at night until I see what it is with my own two eyes! And also…I have a question for you.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“So you fought Hinata Sakaguchi? The whole ‘draw’ thing… That’s a lie, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>I figured he knew that, and he did. He was aware I’d fought her, and he didn’t believe the official results one bit. By the looks of things, he assumed I beat her.</p>
<p>“Well, you could call it winning the battle and losing the war, but yeah, I won.”</p>
<p>I explained to Gazel how it had all worked out in the end, warning him to keep it under his hat for now.</p>
<p>“Unbelievable. That woman, of all people… Frankly, she’s stronger than I am. Her swordsmanship, for one—but even in overall strength, I’d lose. You really beat her?”</p>
<p>This was some real talk from Gazel. I guess I’d impressed him. As a Hero King, Gazel would never get a chance to spar with Hinata, so he used his network of spies to analyze her strength instead. The conclusion he made from their findings: He’d be on the ropes. Hearing I’d won must’ve sincerely surprised him.</p>
<p>“Luck had a lot to do with it. I mean, she really <em>was</em> a lot stronger than Clayman, and he was a demon lord. I think the skills I’m blessed with had a lot to do with it.”</p>
<p>Let’s be straight: If I didn’t have Raphael, I’d have lost. And Raphael <em>is</em> a skill of mine, but he’s also managing all my other skills. If he hadn’t harnessed some powers I wasn’t even aware I had, there’s no way I could’ve beaten Hinata.</p>
<p>“Ha! Luck is as important a strength as any other. I’m glad to see my old sparring partner succeed, but I hate to admit how inferior I am <em>that</em> readily…”</p>
<p>“Well, what do you want me to say? With my own ‘real’ powers, I can’t even beat Hakuro yet.”</p>
<p>“Ahhh, you’re as strange to me as always, aren’t you? ‘Real’ or not, those skills are part and parcel of your battle strength, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>He looked a bit exasperated, but I really meant it. Without <a id="page-37"></a>Raphael, I think my best match for a sparring partner would be Gobta, actually. Not that I’d tell anyone.</p>
<p>“Well, whatever. So,” he said, erasing his scowl and giving me a serious look, “what are you up to <em>this</em> time?”</p>
<p>This was his way of switching to his main subject, apparently. I had no idea what it was.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“What do I mean?! The Western Holy Church sent us a missive asking to open a channel for future negotiations! They used to classify us as a nose away from monsters! Why’d they overturn their doctrine like that? It was so sudden, I just <em>know</em> you have to be behind it!”</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>Gazel’s shouting reminded me of my conversation with Hinata and her people. Yes, I <em>had</em> suggested that she could get King Gazel involved. The Dwarven Kingdom had retained its neutrality for a thousand years. You could place boundless trust in them, and even the most orthodox adherents of the Church couldn’t <em>seriously</em> think dwarves were the same thing as monsters. Some, maybe, but it had to be a tiny minority.</p>
<p>That was my motivation behind the suggestion to Hinata, but I forgot to, um, actually ask King Gazel for permission to do that. Or, really, I didn’t think I needed his approval—I wasn’t expecting him to get this riled up over it. Best to play dumb for now. I doubt Hinata explicitly said it was my idea.</p>
<p>“Ohhh? Well, um, I have to say, it’s the first time <em>I’ve</em> heard about this. But you know, I think duking it out with Hinata has helped us develop a sort of friendship. That’s how we reconciled things, besides, and we agreed that we’ll try to stay on good terms in the future. So maybe that got them in the spirit, huh? Like, it inspired them to make some official overtures with you, too?”</p>
<p><em>“…Hohh?”</em></p>
<p>Gazel raised a doubtful eyebrow. It’s times like these that I seriously wished I was in slime form. I thought I could feel a cold sweat running down my back, even though I don’t actually sweat.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><a id="page-38"></a><em>Caution. The subject Gazel Dwargo is applying Read Thought to your surface mentality. This is being permitted due to a lack of perceived hostile or malicious intent. Block this skill?</em></p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara"><em>Yes</em></p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara"><em>No</em></p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">Yes! Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!! If it’s something <em>that</em> important, then just tell me, Raphael!!</p>
<p>But that explained things. I had <em>thought</em> it was a little strange before, but Gazel can read people’s minds, huh? No wonder I’ve always felt a bit odd around him, like he was probing my brain for answers. Between his accurate reading of my actions during battle and how he always seemed a step ahead of me in our conversations, it only made sense he was doing that.</p>
<p>The Great Sage evolving into Raphael must’ve helped me recognize the Read Thought when Gazel pulled the trigger on it. It didn’t seem to be active <em>all</em> the time, thank heavens, but who knows how much info he took from me just now…</p>
<p>I gave Gazel a glance. He grinned back at me, a blue vein visible on his forehead.</p>
<p>“Heh…heh-heh. You saw my Read Thought, did you? Well, I applaud you for it, but if you blocked it, that must mean you’re thinking something <em>evil</em>, I presume?”</p>
<p>“N-no, no, I, uh, don’t think so?”</p>
<p>“You fool! I caught a glimpse of you there! It told me you thought it best to get me wrapped up in this!”</p>
<p><em>Crime never pays, I suppose.</em> He then more or less forced me to confess exactly how my conversation with Hinata had gone. And then:</p>
<p>“I see. So the Seven Days Clergy was behind their humans-first policy…”</p>
<p>“Yeah. And I think Hinata’s people are thinking about purging the Church of anyone poisoned by the Seven Days’ thinking. Given how they’re all dead, I’m sure she can sniff out their sympathizers well enough.”</p>
<p>I went over the internal dealings I had seen in the Western Holy <a id="page-39"></a>Church and Lubelius, carefully leaving out Luminus’s real identity. Gazel nodded and pondered for a minute.</p>
<p>“…I imagine you are right. In which case, it would be foolish to turn this down, then?”</p>
<p>He had decided to accept Hinata’s—or the Church’s—request.</p>
<p>“I thought you would say that.”</p>
<p>“Enough from you. Doing my diplomacy <em>for</em> me, without permission… But oh well. No need to be a stick in the mud during this festive occasion. You’ve given me <em>only</em> the best seats, I am sure? I might as well enjoy what you’ve got for me.”</p>
<p>After that fit he threw, he was willing to give up the subject for now. I figured he was happy enough with how things turned out, but I wasn’t stupid enough to let him know that. I had word that Hinata and her paladins would be at the Tempest Founder’s Festival as well, so I figured it best for them to meet directly and work matters out. Gazel no doubt had some of his own advisers to deliberate with, too.</p>
<p>So I promised him we’d set up discussions after the festival. He was soon on his way.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">It was now morning, three days since Diablo’s return. Yohm’s band was here, and he picked the exact right moment to show up—we were actually holding a preopening feast this evening, the festival itself finally starting up tomorrow. Before then, however, we were at the usual meeting hall, Yohm and a few of his closer advisers seated across from me.</p>
<p>“Hey, pal! It’s been forever and a day, ain’t it? Well, guess what? I’m royalty!”</p>
<p>His clothing certainly had a few more bells and whistles on it, but the person inside hadn’t changed. He was just as brazen as always, greeting me with a defiant grin.</p>
<p>I smiled back. “And clothes certainly make the king, don’t they, Yohm? Thanks for all your hard work.”</p>
<p>“Ha! Hell, thank <em>you</em>! You’re the one who took some grubby bum off the street and elevated ’im up to king,” he said with a smile, “so <a id="page-40"></a>I hope you’re gonna see this to the end, yeah? I’m all in on what you’re aiming for, so don’t leave me hangin’ halfway.”</p>
<p>Just as he promised, Yohm had become a fine king for me—and with Diablo’s behind-the-scenes work, he now had a firm grip on the throne.</p>
<p>Farmus, a nation with a long, illustrious history, had fallen. In its place was born a new kingdom, with the champion Yohm as its accepted leader. It was a nation reborn from the threat it once was, so Diablo thought fit to change its name to “Farminus.” To cement this, he also had Yohm style himself as Yohm Farminus.</p>
<p>Next to him in the meeting hall were two magic-born—Mjurran and Gruecith. They were his constant bodyguards, and I had no doubt they’d keep Yohm safe—although Mjurran wasn’t <em>really</em> a bodyguard at all, of course.</p>
<p>“Lord Rimuru, let me reintroduce myself. I am Mjur Farminus, wife of the king. It is good to see you again.”</p>
<p>Perhaps noticing my eyes on her, Mjurran lifted up her dress a little and curtsied. It was beautiful, enough to make your garden-variety rich heiress blanch.</p>
<p>“You fit into the role of queen like a puzzle piece, Mjurran.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, doesn’t she?” Yohm said, beaming with pride. “She’s educated and all, unlike me.”</p>
<p>“I do have some experience in this, shall we say. Clayman was such a stickler for etiquette and manners…”</p>
<p>There was no doubting that Clayman held himself well, or at least had a thing for noble trappings. He’d festooned his castle with ornate furniture and artwork, and I’m sure he was just as fastidious with his own staff. Looks like that helped us out in the most surprising way with her.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, it’s an experience for all of us. I mean, ruling a nation’s been hard for me, too. A little bit ago, I had to formally greet every species in the Forest of Jura, and it nearly killed me. I felt like some kinda sacred idol.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I hear ya! I have all these nobles requesting audiences with me, and some of those idiots are already forming factions and trying to start something. What a headache, I tell ya! At least <a id="page-41"></a>that old man Razen, our magic expert, is handling all that pretty well.”</p>
<p>Razen himself was not here. Things were still less than stable around their nation, and he was busy darting to and fro, attending to post–civil war matters. I feared for a moment he’d betray us—but looking back, he was only under the effects of Diablo’s Tempter spell, so no worries there. The retired Edmaris, meanwhile, had disguised his identity and was now serving as an adviser, making up for Yohm’s lack of experience and education and helping out in assorted areas of politics.</p>
<p>And as for Gruecith the magic-born:</p>
<p>“So you’re head of the Knight Corps now?”</p>
<p>“I sure am, Sir Rimuru. I turned the job down, but <em>he</em> never listens to me…”</p>
<p>Yohm had all but forced Gruecith to take a role in government. He certainly had the muscle for it, and none of the remaining knights voiced any complaint, so the fledgling nation of Farminus wanted to appoint him head knight, hoping to keep such talent from straying off. He’d balked at first, enjoying the new freedom in his life, but after Mjurran begged him as well, he found it impossible to refuse. Was Gruecith gonna be all right doing that? I didn’t bring it up. He didn’t seem <em>that</em> reluctant.</p>
<p>“I still consider myself part of Lord Carillon’s Warrior Alliance…but for now, I don’t mind babysitting this idiot.”</p>
<p>“Shut up! <em>You’re</em> the idiot!”</p>
<p>No, those two hadn’t changed much. And the sight of Mjurran wincing at them took me back as well. It was a familiar act, but this time, someone interrupted it.</p>
<p>“King Yohm! Captain Gruecith! You’re being terribly rude to the demon lord!”</p>
<p>The loud voice came from what looked like a grade-school boy, a very handsome and intelligent one.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, Edgar, you’re always so serious…”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! And why not? He’s far better put together than you. What more could we ask for in a crown prince?”</p>
<p>“Captain Gruecith! This is not the time for joking. I am trying <a id="page-42"></a>my best to serve as King Yohm’s attendant, making sure he becomes a good, just king!”</p>
<p>Edgar, son of the previous king Edmaris, glowed red with embarrassment. He was still just ten years old, but “<em>well put together</em>” was an understatement. By the looks of things, he was already used to being the butt of their jokes—having to deal with such mean grown-ups at his age had to be difficult. At least Yohm and Gruecith seemed to care for him, as much as they carried on.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have minded more of this pleasant small talk, but it had to end sometime. They were all tired from the voyage, and I’d have other VIPs coming for the preopening tonight. I suggested we could continue this conversation with some drinks later, and Yohm readily agreed.</p>
<p>“So, Yohm, as thanks for keeping your promise, I have a present for you. Diablo—”</p>
<p>“You mean this, Sir Rimuru?”</p>
<p>Before I could finish, Diablo realized what I meant and picked up a certificate we had prepared in advance, kindly providing it to me. I handed it to Yohm.</p>
<p>“Hey, what’s this, pal…?”</p>
<p>Yohm wasn’t particularly great at the whole “literacy” thing, either, so he quickly tossed it over to his assistant, Edgar. With a nod, the boy read it—and then his eyes bulged out of their sockets.</p>
<p>“You, you’re forgiving the rest of the reparations?!”</p>
<p>“Yep. Don’t really need any, now that Yohm’s king.”</p>
<p>They had already paid us 1,500 stellar gold coins in reparations. The total sum of 10,000 stellars was laughably astronomical, and now that our mission was accomplished, there was no need for that money anyway.</p>
<p>Yohm looked at the shocked child with a smile. “Heh-heh! Well, I don’t really get what that means, but there ya go, Edgar.”</p>
<p>He didn’t know, but Edgar sure did. No doubt it’d be another gold star for Yohm’s reputation.</p>
<p>Thus I became known as a person—or a demon lord, I suppose—who was willing to bargain a bit when it came to reparations.</p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-43"></a>My talks with Yohm’s group were over. They all left the meeting hall, dragging a still-petrified Edgar with them.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">It was afternoon now, and I was no longer quite so busy. Visitors were still swarming in, but they weren’t eager to talk right now, either—not when there was this evening to prepare for. A lot of them certainly <em>wanted</em> to see me, and I agreed to, as long as they were willing to wait until after the festival.</p>
<p>I finally had some free time as a result, so (as I promised) I decided to travel to Englesia and pick up Yuuki. I could stop by the school there and take the kids as well—a festival like this, I didn’t want them to miss out on the fun.</p>
<p class="space-break">The streets of Englesia were a nostalgia trip for me. It had been only several months since I left, but recalling life here naturally dissolved any tension from my face.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but travel to the Free Guild headquarters in the middle of the city. Through the modern automatic glass door, I entered an air-conditioned chamber—and the moment I did, I was greeted with sharp-eyed stares. Only adventurers ranked B or higher were allowed in here, and this crowd looked the part—tough, seasoned, and not to be messed with. Looking around the chamber, it was clear nothing had changed. It made me happy.</p>
<p>A few of the men were openly appraising my appearance. Given they were here in the middle of the day, they might’ve been preparing for some big job or another.</p>
<p>“…Who’s that?”</p>
<p>“Haven’t seen ’im around before. Is he new? Hey, you know him?”</p>
<p>“Uh-uh. You think I know anyone <em>that</em> pretty?”</p>
<p>These whisperings weren’t exactly welcome news. Less than a year’s time, and they’d already forgotten about me? But then I noticed—I didn’t have that mask on now, did I? I could fully control my own aura, so I went barefaced, since there was no longer any need for it. I had considered a disguise, but it was too late now.</p>
<p><a id="page-44"></a>Fortunately, I was dressed in my old adventurer’s garb, so as long as I acted the part, nobody would realize I’m a demon lord. Besides, Shuna had expended untold efforts sewing the demon-lord outfit I’d wear for official audiences. It was incredibly gaudy, decorated up and down with nothing but the finest accoutrements, and she even knitted a full-on coiffure to top it off, so it’d look nothing like what I’m sporting right now.</p>
<p>There were still relatively few ways to record things around you in this world anyway. It’s not like people far and wide would know what I look like as a demon lord. Maybe I shouldn’t bother worrying about it. For now, let’s go with this.</p>
<p>So I strode up to the reception desk. A man walked in front of me, blocking my way. I was struck by the weirdest sense of déjà vu.</p>
<p>“Hold on. I dunno what kinda backwater you earned your B rank in, but you think you can just come in without a word to the vets around here? Don’t ya know it’s the polite thing for a new adventurer to give his name first?”</p>
<p>Actually, it wasn’t <em>just</em> déjà vu. I pretty vividly remembered him. This guy was Grassé, friends with Kabal and his crew, and he had whined at me about proper greetings last time, too. He must’ve lived his whole life like he was captain of the football team.</p>
<p>“Ummm, you’re Grassé, right? You’re always hanging out here at HQ, aren’t you? Don’t you have any work to do?”</p>
<p>“Huh? You know my name? So—”</p>
<p>“Mine’s Rimuru,” I said, cutting him off. “I was with Kabal’s party, remember?”</p>
<p><em>I mean, come on, Grassé. I know that mask is gone, but my voice is exactly the same, okay? Why isn’t he picking up on that…?</em></p>
<p>“Huuuh?! Uh, R…Rimuru?”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm. And this is the first time you’re seeing my face, but at least recognize my <em>voice</em>, man.”</p>
<p>“N-no, um, but… Huh? Is it me, or were you kinda smaller last time?”</p>
<p>My name instantly threw Grassé into flustered confusion. I beat him rank-wise, so in his football-captain mind, I was above him. <a id="page-45"></a>Adventuring was largely a meritocracy anyway, so acting superior based on age or years of experience wasn’t really a mainstream trend. If a new guy helps you out, you’ll naturally respect that and help him back in kind—but a lot of adventurers didn’t see the need to be friendly to total strangers, either. Things changed if you were in a party, but in terms of social cliques? That was nearly all based on rank.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I grew,” I said in a huff. More <em>evolved</em> instead of grew, but I didn’t need to be that honest. It seemed to convince him.</p>
<p>“Oh. I get it. But, <em>man</em>, Rimuru, you sure got pretty hot! You must be well near invincible by now, huh? Getting to see that sweet face of yours… I’m so moved!”</p>
<p>He was standing at attention now, like he did with Kabal, as he bowed to me. He always was a snake that way, but I couldn’t hate him for it.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah. But why’re you always here? Aren’t you employed?”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh! Aw, don’t give me that. This is kinda part of my work—I’m educating the new adventurers. There’s a lot of barriers you encounter in the B rank, as you know, and my job’s to approach any brash new guys and take ’em down a notch, that sort of thing. See those guys over there?” He pointed to the group looking at me earlier. “They’re doing the same thing. We all hang here at the HQ in our downtime.”</p>
<p>The group stood up straight and nodded at me.</p>
<p>“Forgive me—I didn’t realize you were Rimuru, a B-rank adventurer,” one of them, the apparent leader, said.</p>
<p>I nodded back at him. “I didn’t think I changed <em>that</em> much…”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, you have! Now that I know, I just realized you got the same outfit on, but otherwise…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, totally. That face is just… Wow. What a standout…”</p>
<p><em>Is it really? That much?</em></p>
<p>“All right, all right. Should I put on the mask?”</p>
<p>Doing that was kind of a pain, but I didn’t want to go through this every visit. I created the mask from my Stomach and applied it to my face, the adventurers looking a little disappointed for reasons I couldn’t fathom.</p>
<p><a id="page-46"></a>“So, yeah. Keep up the good work, guys. Don’t torment the newbies too much.”</p>
<p>With that, I headed for the front desk.</p>
<p class="space-break">Giving my name to the clerk, I had her take me to Yuuki. He was expecting me, apparently, so it didn’t take long.</p>
<p>“Hey, Rimuru! Long time no see! Sounds like you’ve been through a lot, huh?”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t <em>begin</em> to describe it. I got attacked by Hinata, the Farmus Army invaded us, and then the demon lords summoned me… Just one thing after the other, you know? ‘<em>A lot’</em> is the understatement of the year.”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! I figured you’d sum it up like that, Rimuru.”</p>
<p>Yuuki laughed it off, but it definitely <em>was</em> a lot. He understood that, I’m sure; he was all smiles, but there was a touch of gratitude to his voice.</p>
<p>“But, hey, at least I’m good with Hinata now. All’s well that ends well, right?”</p>
<p>“Sounds like it. I met her a few times to exchange information, and I told her a lot about you as a person. You know how, like, suspicious she is of people.”</p>
<p>“Oh, believe me, I do. She barely listened to a word I said.”</p>
<p>“Right? She’s the kind of person who only believes what she sees and hears for herself. It’s always been that way with her, and let me tell you, it’s not been easy.”</p>
<p>We chatted along these lines for a while. I’m sure it <em>wasn’t</em> easy for Yuuki. Hinata’s thought process can be a total mystery sometimes.</p>
<p>“Not that I can really talk about that with anyone but you, Rimuru…”</p>
<p>Hinata had a lot of followers. If Yuuki started complaining about her to the wrong person, she’d know almost immediately. Not that gossip is a good thing. I’ll want to be careful about that.</p>
<p>But it was time to cut to the chase.</p>
<p>“So what do you think? If you’re busy, I won’t force you, but would you like to check out the festival for two or three days?”</p>
<p>“Ha! Of course I’m going. Why do you think I tried so hard to <a id="page-47"></a>get ahead on my work? And I’ve got people here I feel fine leaving this place to while I’m gone. Give me one moment.”</p>
<p>Yuuki stood up and went out of the room, calling for someone. I relaxed with my tea for a moment, and he was back shortly with a woman.</p>
<p>“Let me introduce you guys. This is Kagali, the vice master of the Free Guild. She’ll be running it while I’m gone.”</p>
<p>She was a beautiful woman, very graceful on the outside, and the business suit–like attire she had on fit her to a T. Her eyes were blue, her blond hair tied in a chignon, but her ears were the real standout—long and pointed. She had to be an elf.</p>
<p>“Hello, Rimuru Tempest. Or should I call you Demon Lord Rimuru? My name is Kagali. It is an honor to meet you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. This is my second time here, but I don’t think we met the first time, did we?”</p>
<p>I recalled the secretary who had given us tea, but not this girl. If she was the number two official in the Free Guild, I would’ve expected an introduction sooner—but there was a reason for that.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee! No, you wouldn’t have been able to. I’ve only returned here recently. My passion is exploring old ruins, and I’ve just come back from mapping out the complex at Soma, one of the largest in the west.”</p>
<p>It turned out Kagali was one of the world’s greatest active explorers, lurking around this ruin and that since before Yuuki had founded the Free Guild. Her name was not that well-known—she hadn’t taken part in the Society of Adventurers, the precursor to the Guild—but Yuuki had scouted her for her clear talent nonetheless. The Guild, after all, wasn’t just about fighting. That was Yuuki’s philosophy, which was why he had given an exploration expert like Kagali such a high position on the org chart.</p>
<p>Thanks to that support, Kagali had just pulled off a monumental feat—the complete mapping of the ancient ruins at Soma. This put her name up in lights for much of the world, quelling any dark murmurings of her being Yuuki’s hanger-on. Now she was a vice master anyone could respect.</p>
