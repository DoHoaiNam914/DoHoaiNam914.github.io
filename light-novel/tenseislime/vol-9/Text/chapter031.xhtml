<p class="noindentt">Thus, I had a close-up view…</p>
<p class="space-break">…of Gobta, right after declaring it to be <em>his</em> turn, running straight for Masayuki—and then continuing to run right past him, until he smashed into the wall.</p>
<p class="space-break">I <em>knew</em> he should’ve rehearsed that first. Even before he tried it, I knew there was a pretty big chance he’d screw it up.</p>
<p>“Whoa! Gobta isn’t getting back up! Is he all right?”</p>
<p>He wasn’t. In fact, bashing himself against the wall had knocked him unconscious—and the out-of-bounds line was far behind him. He was out.</p>
<p>That idiot had no control over that transformation at all. Everything worked great up to taking in Ranga’s powers, but I could see those powers treated him like a chew toy. To put it simply, he wanted to start running, then stop running—but his brain was still judging these maneuvers based on his original body dimensions. A second of time in Gobta’s world was far different from that same second in Ranga’s. Before he could even think to stop, his head was against the wall.</p>
<p>Even worse, as Soka pointed out, he showed no sign of getting back up. It was the shock of the collision, rather than actual physical damage, that had knocked him out.</p>
<p>What can I say? First he reveals this supercool new monster, then he reveals himself for the dolt he is. Very true to character.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>I was stunned into silence.</p>
<p>“That fool,” Benimaru muttered, eyes turned upward.</p>
<p>“That’s Gobta for you.” Shion snickered.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Veins throbbed on Hakuro’s forehead…</p>
<p>“Wow, so that’s your fighting apprentice, Dad?”</p>
<p>…and Momiji added more fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>It was, shall we say, a hard-to-describe sort of tension. And Gobta <a id="page-230"></a>deserved it, frankly. The crowd around us was also having trouble parsing these events. I could hear one of them try to explain them, based on the sparse evidence at hand.</p>
<p>“Wait… Did he throw him aside in midair?”</p>
<p>The arena was so quiet, the words echoed oddly well.</p>
<p>“Amazing. Amazing, Masayuki!”</p>
<p>“Whoaaaa… That was awesome!”</p>
<p>“I barely even saw it happen. This is just too crazy!!”</p>
<p>The praise for Masayuki spread like a virus across the coliseum. Then, as if this explanation was the unvarnished truth, cheers began to erupt, heralding Masayuki’s victory before Soka and Diablo could even take action.</p>
<p class="space-break">My neighbor, however, was quivering with anger.</p>
<p>“Is… Is this some kind of twisted joke? After looking all cool like that… I mean, what was <em>that</em>?”</p>
<p>After that radical transformation, this was the result. Gobta had shot expectations sky-high with Milim, then sent them crashing down to earth. It only amplified her anger.</p>
<p>“Now, now, I, um, I think he did his very best! In his own way…”</p>
<p>“Rimuru, you <em>know</em> spoiling him isn’t good for him!”</p>
<p>“That’s right, Sir Rimuru. I think I have been too lenient with Gobta as well. We should all be more stringent with him going forward.”</p>
<p>Hakuro agreed with Milim. This was the first <em>I</em> heard of him going easy on Gobta.</p>
<p>“Right! <em>I’ll</em> whip him into shape. Rimuru, let me borrow Gobta for a while. I’ll make him into the most wonderful fighter you’ve ever seen!”</p>
<p>Milim’s eyes were sparkling now. This was a rare monster, and she just <em>had</em> to have him, I was sure. If I nodded my approval here, that’d be so mean to Gobta…but then I thought of something else.</p>
<p>“Actually, I have a favor to ask of you. I’ll accept your offer if you accept mine; how about that?”</p>
<p>“All right. Let’s hear it.”</p>
<p>“So there’s this set of ruins in Clayman’s domain, right near his <a id="page-231"></a>manor. I don’t want people poking around them without permission, and I think they’re packed with artifacts that’ll teach us about the ancient past, so I’ve been keeping them untouched for now.”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm.”</p>
<p>“And I’d like to explore these ruins, but I wanted to get your permission first.”</p>
<p>“Why’re you asking me?”</p>
<p><em>Because it’s</em> your <em>domain now, doofus.</em></p>
<p>“Milim, who’s the ruler of that domain right now?” Frey asked Milim quietly before I could even say it.</p>
<p>“Oh…” Milim shot straight up in her seat. “Oh, right! That’s me, isn’t it? Right! I knew that!”</p>
<p>Great. Glad she remembered.</p>
<p>“So…”</p>
<p>“Of <em>course</em> it’s fine!”</p>
<p>That was easy. Maybe Milim just wanted to put the subject behind her, but as long as I got her permission, anything was fine. Sorry, Gobta, but at least <em>I</em> was achieving something out of this. I mean, Gobta essentially self-destructed, and I <em>still</em> didn’t know anything about Masayuki’s skills. He wouldn’t mind if I at least got <em>some</em> use out of this travesty, right? It’d help build him up, besides. All’s well that ends well.</p>
<p>“But when you do this exploring, Rimuru, you’ll take me along, right?”</p>
<p>“Ummm, that’ll depend. I’ve actually reached out to an expert from the Free Guild on this topic, but if they give the okay, you can come, sure.”</p>
<p>“Ooooh! Sounds like fun!”</p>
<p>“Yeah? Don’t get your hopes up. It might turn out pretty boring.”</p>
<p>I continued to chat with Milim as we awaited the certified results, which took a few minutes. Finally, Soka and Diablo wrapped up their discussions.</p>
<p>“The judgment is in! And while I’m concerned for the still-unconscious Gobta, the winner is…”</p>
<p><em>Don’t remind me</em>, I thought as I listened to Soka’s announcement.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">“Check this out! <em>Transform!!</em>” came the shout—and only then did Masayuki realize he was being far too optimistic.</p>
<p><em>Whoa, wait a second! What’s that thing?! I heard nothing about this!!</em></p>
<p>There was no way he’d finish Gobta before any summoning took place. He was transforming his own body now—something Masayuki totally didn’t expect.</p>
<p>The sheer power in the air was electrifying. To the amateur-level Masayuki, this looked like a towering monolith of strength. He knew there was healing potion on hand, but no way it could help him. It couldn’t raise the dead.</p>
<p><em>Dude! If one of those claws tears through me, this armor’s about as good as cardboard! If I knew this was gonna happen, I never would’ve turned down full-plate for being too heavy…</em></p>
<p>For that matter, he realized in the midst of his reverie, not even a full suit of magisteel armor could help much.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh!” Gobta shouted. “Now it’s <em>my</em> turn!” Then, not waiting for a reply, he burst into action.</p>
<p>Masayuki was this close to saying, <em>Wait a minute! I give!</em> His life, he concluded, meant far more to him than his pride. Faced with this transformed monster, victory no longer mattered to him at all. But regardless of what he thought, events moved on without him.</p>
<p>Before he could say, <em>I forfeit</em>, a rumbling boom echoed across the arena as Gobta self-destructed. Masayuki, unable to react, just stood there dumbfounded. A small piece of the stone wall scratched against his cheek. The stinging pain told him this was all too real.</p>
<p><em>No… No way… I could never have dodged that. I know people misconstrue my words to my benefit, but if I wasn’t able to get away with murder like this, it’d be hopeless for me…</em></p>
<p>It was clear what would happen. Gobta would be disqualified, and he’d be crowned champion. But Masayuki began to wonder if that was really good for him. Would winning this provide him with anything he wanted?</p>
<p><em>The right to battle a demon lord? You gotta be kidding. That’s totally suicide!</em></p>
<p><a id="page-233"></a>Masayuki wasn’t a fool. If he was named champion, it’d be him against the demon lord Rimuru. He understood what that meant for him. That black wolf who just whipped by him, as well as Lion Mask from yesterday, were both opponents he had no chance of beating—and they both worked under Rimuru. Pick a fight against <em>that</em> guy, and he’d just get pummeled.</p>
<p><em>Pummeled? More like killed!</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t about whether his skill would work or not. The demon lord was in a whole other universe; it was hopeless. Thus, Masayuki decided he needed to get out of here, pronto. Seriously, the crowd thought he <em>threw</em> that freak into the wall? That was just depressing.</p>
<p>He had to do something fast, or else Gobta would lose. Masayuki’s mind raced faster than it ever had before in his life. How could he arrange things so he could lose and remain in one piece?</p>
<p>“The judgment is in! And while I’m concerned for the still-unconscious Gobta, the winner is…”</p>
<p><em>Oh crap.</em></p>
<p>“…Wait.”</p>
<p>Masayuki went on the move, panicking internally but playing it cool on the outside as he brought his hand up toward Soka.</p>
<p>“Um…?” Soka figured Masayuki had something to say, so she handed him a spare mic.</p>
<p>“I think I lost, actually,” he said, trying his hardest to keep his voice from shaking.</p>
<p>“Ummm… But, Masayuki, sir,” Soka replied, bewildered, “it looks very much like Gobta took himself out of the match…”</p>
<p>“Perhaps. But you know, I couldn’t keep up with that attack at all. I don’t think I have the experience needed to challenge a demon lord quite yet; I just thought…”</p>
<p>He spoke slowly, trying not to get tongue-tied as the sweat poured down his entire body. It was a real stretch of an excuse, but he tried to make it sound as reasonable as he could. Then, without saying anything else, he walked out of the arena and never looked back. If someone asked him a question right now, he’d have no answer for it, so he decided to just leave without another word.</p>
<p><em>With my skill active, I’m sure the crowd will imagine some way to make that sound convincing for me. Right now, getting out of here’s my best option…</em></p>
<p>Masayuki had never focused so much on moving his legs before now. But it worked. He was out of his potentially lethal pinch.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Gobta was just lying there, sprawled on the ground, but then Masayuki declared out of nowhere that he lost.</p>
<p>“What is he thinking?”</p>
<p>“Hmm… I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“He couldn’t have been scared of Gobta. What’s motivating him to do that?”</p>
<p>Benimaru and Shion had no clue what had happened, either, as they watched Masayuki walk off.</p>
<p>So was he just a big fake after all? Or was there something else going on in his mind? Ah well. If Masayuki was giving up on fighting me, then I’d call it a good way to settle matters.</p>
<p class="space-break">The crowd, too, was confused at first.</p>
<p>“…Is it because he can’t drum up the will to face the demon lord?”</p>
<p>“No, no! You saw that throw. It was masterful.”</p>
<p>“He said he couldn’t keep up with his attack. Is he hurt?”</p>
<p>“There <em>is</em> a small cut on his cheek…”</p>
<p>“What?! He managed to land a blow on Sir Masayuki?!”</p>
<p>The murmuring continued anon.</p>
<p>“Wait! I’ve got it!” one man screamed. “Sir Masayuki just gave the demon lord a reprieve!”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“The demon lord declared he wants to be friendly with humans. You all know that, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>“So that’s why,” the man smugly said, “what Masayuki did just now was give a <em>warning</em> to Rimuru.”</p>
<p><a id="page-235"></a>It <em>did</em> sound oddly convincing, as much as it irritated me. That’s likely why the people around the man started nodding at him.</p>
<p>“I see… And that reminds me: Sir Masayuki didn’t unsheathe his sword <em>this</em> time, either, did he?”</p>
<p>“Well spotted. You’re right. That’s his way of telling us he could win this tournament anytime he wanted to!”</p>
<p>“Right! And if the demon lord pulls any false moves, he’s not gonna take that sitting down. That’s what he’s saying?”</p>
<p>“Probably. Of course, if they ever <em>did</em> fight, I bet he’d stop before landing a killing blow.”</p>
<p>“So he’s willing to lose some face just to bring the message across… What a wonderful young man he is!”</p>
<p>“<em>That’s</em> the Sir Masayuki I know!”</p>
<p>“He’s so cool!!”</p>
<p>They were starting to interpret this in very surprising ways. But soon, all of them were in agreement, singing Masayuki’s praises like a church choir.</p>
<p>“Ma! Sa! Yu! Ki! <em>Masayukiiiii!!</em>”</p>
<p>What the hell? Was this a religion or what? I felt like I was getting a glimpse into something terrifying.</p>
<p>Masayuki answered the chanting with a raised hand as he exited. His motion was a bit awkward-looking, which struck me as curious. What a strange kid. Why does he get all this praise heaped upon him?</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>Understood. It is believed that this is the effect of a unique skill possessed by the subject Masayuki Honjo.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">Just when I thought some things in the world couldn’t be explained, Raphael stepped up and explained them for me. I guess the professor was doing a little analytical work on him.</p>
<p>Apparently, Masayuki’s skill, when it takes effect, could manipulate the thoughts and feelings of people under its spell. He’d just forfeited the championship because he saw how powerful Gobta had become, I suppose—and given how he’d won over Bovix yesterday, I imagined Masayuki hadn’t thought he could beat <em>him</em>, <a id="page-236"></a>either. I thought back to his performance so far, based on this new assumption. As far as I could recall, it was like he couldn’t even react to what his foes were doing, could he? No wonder he never took out his sword.</p>
<p>I suppose the conclusion to make was that Masayuki himself couldn’t fight very well. Hinata said she couldn’t read his strength at all, and I could see why. There was no strength <em>to</em> read.</p>
<p>Still, it wasn’t safe to look down on him. If he could influence the people around him <em>that</em> much, making him your enemy could be seriously dangerous. Definitely not someone to trifle with—if anything, I think I need to stay on his good side. Maybe I could threaten him, like “Heh-heh-heh, I know your secret”— Nah. Just joking. I bet he was racking his brain figuring out how to deal with Bovix later; no way his friends would let him weasel out of <em>that</em> rematch.</p>
<p>Maybe I’d offer him some sympathy. I could help prop him up as a Hero, even; it’d certainly be helpful advertising the labyrinth challenge to people.</p>
<p>“Soei! Make contact with Masayuki and tell him I want to meet with him.”</p>
<p>“At once!”</p>
<p>“Keep it courteous, okay? If you could invite him to lunch after this, then perfect.”</p>
<p>As a fellow native of Japan, I’d like to talk to him anyway. I’ll ask Hakuro to whip up some sushi. Hopefully this hunch of mine turns out to be true.</p>
<p class="space-break">While I was thinking about Masayuki, Gobta was finally coming to. As he did, Soka and Diablo, after some deliberation, apparently decided to accept Masayuki’s request.</p>
<p>“Today’s been a cavalcade of unexpected events, but with Masayuki’s withdrawal, Gobta is our champion!!”</p>
<p>I could hear jeering from pockets of the crowd. Yeah, <em>I’d</em> be disappointed, too—here we were, the big final, and we’d gotten a champion who gave up and a half-wolf who almost killed himself. <a id="page-237"></a>If I paid good money to see this, I’d find it totally valid to demand a refund. Luckily for me, they were in the minority. Masayuki made that decision himself, and nobody was blaming me for it. I imagine Gobta proved his strength well enough that nobody was too dissatisfied with this result. Of course, Gobta was still the heel in everyone’s mind, and with his antics today, that rep would be set in stone.</p>
<p>“So, Gobta! How are you feeling right now?”</p>
<p>“Uh… Huh? Really? I won?”</p>
<p>“You sure did! And you really put in an excellent performance today!”</p>
<p>Yeah right. All Gobta did was trip over himself and get knocked out, and Soka was trying her hardest to rev him up.</p>
<p>Regardless, though, the fight was over.</p>
<p>Afterward, I stepped back into the arena and gave out awards to each of the competitors, offering all eight of them my thanks and praising their performances. I also gave Masayuki’s friend Jinrai the set of equipment I’d promised him. Gaiye said, “Give that to <em>me</em>, too!” when he saw it for some reason, but we had no such agreement, so I ignored him. Masayuki also agreed to my offer of a meeting—he looked more resolute to me now, but he didn’t have the wrong idea about this, did he? If there was any misunderstanding, I’d take the time to unravel it for him.</p>
<p>That left Gobta.</p>
<p>“You did well, Gobta. I hereby name you a member of the Big Four as of today!”</p>
<p>He had taken a pretty rocky road on his way to it, but a championship was a championship. As promised, I appointed him to the Big Four, a title Gobta would no doubt find quite alluring. From now on, if he ever lost to anyone, I could just say, “Heh-heh-heh! He’s the weakest of the Big Four! A disgrace to his team!” and people would accept it. It was the perfect role for him, one that’d no doubt make Gobta seem pretty cute and charming. In fact, it was almost <em>too</em> perfect for him. Scarily so.</p>
<p>“Thank you! I’ll keep doin’ my best!”</p>
<p><a id="page-238"></a>And with that, the First Tempest Battle Tournament came to a close.</p>
<p class="space-break">If only it really <em>was</em> over for Gobta. But his personal hell was just beginning.</p>
<p>“Okay, are we ready now? ’Cause I’m gonna start training him <em>hard</em>!”</p>
<p>Milim was beaming at me when we returned to the VIP boxes.</p>
<p>“Oh, uh, sure. Don’t overdo it, okay?”</p>
<p>“Nothing to worry about! He’ll undergo my special training inside the labyrinth, so he can die all he wants to!!”</p>
<p>Ah yes, she <em>could</em> use it like that, huh? I wasn’t sure Gobta would see that as much of a consolation. All I can say is, it’s gonna be tough for him. Not even death would offer sweet release for him. Just thinking about it made me shiver.</p>
<p>“Gobta, can we talk over there for a moment?”</p>
<p>Milim marched right over to Gobta…and picked him up with one hand.</p>
<p>“Pyahhh?!”</p>
<p>There was so much strength focused on her arm, I was surprised I didn’t hear any bones crunch. Milim was smiling, but her eyes sure weren’t.</p>
<p>“Congrats on the win. But that last match was pitiful. I’m not going to let <em>that</em> one slide! It’s time to start training you!”</p>
<p>Milim really enjoyed Gobta’s transformation—which was why his subsequent lamebrained acts angered her so much. Her reaction made it clear that her expectations and excitement had been deeply soured.</p>
<p>“You’ll be facing off against me personally. You’re gonna be stronger in no time!”</p>
<p>“Wh-whoa! Lady Milim?! I—I didn’t ask for that!”</p>
<p>Gobta was panicking. I doubted anyone was listening to his input.</p>
<p>“This is a good opportunity for you, Gobta,” Hakuro said with a forceful smile. “I want you to put everything you have into training with her.”</p>
<p><a id="page-239"></a>“M-Master, are you selling me off—?”</p>
<p>“Silence!” Milim said, shutting him down before he could finish. How cruel.</p>
<p>“Oh-ho-ho… Don’t make a disgrace of yourself like that, Gobta. This is all for your sake!”</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure Gobta was listening to Hakuro any longer. This was him getting back at Gobta for acting like such a clown in front of Momiji, I bet. It definitely <em>wasn’t</em> for his sake.</p>
<p>Thus, Gobta was now Milim’s property. I turned my attention to the other party involved in this stunt.</p>
<p>“My master, my teamwork with Sir Gobta brought us the championship!”</p>
<p>Ranga ran up to me, abandoning Gobta without a second thought. Smart of him. He didn’t want to get caught in the cross fire at all. Unfortunately, there was no fleeing from Milim.</p>
<p>“Hold it! Ranga was your name, right? Gobta can’t complete his training without you!”</p>
<p>“?!”</p>
<p>Ranga looked at me, his eyes pleading. <em>Sorry, man. Once Milim gets an idea in her head, she tunes out everybody else.</em> Besides, he was the one who went into battle without my permission, so he had this coming. I didn’t see any need to help him.</p>
<p>“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Don’t worry! I won’t do ya no harm!”</p>
<p>And with that, Milim strode off, dragging Gobta and Ranga behind her.</p>
<p class="space-break">Really, I thought Gobta relied too much on his own good luck. That, and Ranga had a tendency to fight on instinct. If they could polish their skills a bit and work with each other more, that transformation could really be something formidable, you know? Milim must’ve thought to train them because she spotted that. Here’s hoping they worked on that, bit by bit, and gained something concrete from it. I’d be expecting big things from Gobta, and Milim’s the girl who’d bring him there.</p>
<p><em>Farewell, Gobta. Farewell, Ranga. I’ll never forget your courage!</em> I vowed to say a prayer for them as I saw them leave with Milim.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">It was time for lunch—a lunch I’d now be spending with Masayuki.</p>
<p>This was nothing that fancy, really. I told him I wanted to speak with him alone; the rest of his group could stand by in a separate room. We had a little trouble earlier, but I was sure Masayuki could smooth things over with them later.</p>
<p>“Um, well, good to make your acquaintance, I guess? My name’s Masayuki Honjo, and people call me ‘Lightspeed’ and ‘the Hero’ and stuff…”</p>
<p>He was blushing a bit. Yeah, calling yourself “the Hero” in our old world would be about the most embarrassing thing ever. People would think you’re a thoughtless moron if you tried it. I’m sure it made him feel creepy. That, and it looked like he was worried how I’d react to him. He remembered how he promised to defeat me, although that was mostly just his friends egging him on. This must’ve been awkward for him. I’m a demon lord, after all. He had to be scared out of his wits, fearing he’d picked a fight with a foe way out of his league.</p>
<p>He was no doubt conflicted, but he didn’t need to worry about me. I was ready to leave the past where it belonged—in the past. A nice meal together should help us work out our issues.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know we spoke before, but it’s nice to meet you, too. I am Rimuru, a demon lord, but my real name’s Satoru Mikami. I used to work for a building contractor.”</p>
<p>Masayuki wasn’t too keen on touching his food, so I decided to just blurt it out. I hadn’t used that name in a long while, but it still felt like it fit me, a lot more than I anticipated. It wasn’t like I was hiding it—I just never had the chance to use it much.</p>
<p>“…Huh? Are… Are you Japanese?”</p>
<p>Masayuki didn’t quite seem to believe me. And yeah, I <em>did</em> look kind of like a cute little girl at the moment. I couldn’t blame him.</p>
<p>“Yeah, more or less. But let’s talk about that over lunch, all right?”</p>
<p>That finally inspired him to pick up his chopsticks.</p>
<p>“Um, this is okay for me to eat?”</p>
<p><a id="page-241"></a>“Of course. I had them whip up something Japanese for you.”</p>
<p>Sushi and tempura were on the menu today. They had wowed Hinata earlier, and I thought Masayuki would be just as grateful—he hadn’t been part of our pre-festival banquet, so I was sure it’d be the first time he’d seen sushi in years.</p>
<p>“This isn’t, like, my last meal before my execution, is it?”</p>
<p>“No. You seem sensible; we’re from the same place. I just wanna be friends with you.”</p>
<p>Seeing this spread must’ve given him the completely wrong idea. Maybe he thought this was the last meal he’d eat in his whole life. I told him I was from Japan, but he still doubted me.</p>
<p>“Well, um, all right…”</p>
<p>He finally took a bite—and the moment he did, he fell silent. His eyes looked different now, and his chopsticks, and his mouth, sprang into motion. He was so focused on his meal that it didn’t seem like the right time to start talking, so I waited until he was done.</p>
<p>And the moment he was:</p>
<p>“…All right. Satoru—um, I mean, Rimuru, I’ll gladly become your servant!”</p>
<p>I had no idea where this came from. I mean, I could tell he was starving for good Japanese food, but I hadn’t even said anything yet. Besides, he must’ve had his own thoughts about me.</p>
<p>“Servant? Uh…”</p>
<p>“No, it’s fine. I don’t have anything keeping me from abandoning this Hero crap. It’s just embarrassing when they do that ‘Ma! Sa! Yu! Ki!’ chant, and… Really, I’ve been constantly trying to figure out how to escape from all this.”</p>
<p>This sounded like the real Masayuki here. And as I enjoyed some post-meal tea, I let him tell me his story.</p>
<p class="space-break">Masayuki was a pretty smart kid in his old world, going to a high school that put most of its grads into college. He liked reading manga and light novels, something he kept a secret, and he complained to me about how it must’ve led to this for him.</p>
<p>“My skill’s called Chosen One, you know? It’s just so…<em>stupid</em>.”</p>
<p><a id="page-242"></a>He’d wanted to be a hero, and as he saw it, that’s why he wound up here. And his skill, Chosen One, was about what I figured it was. It let him naturally guide the thoughts of those around him, almost like brainwashing—and that’s what brought him to Hero-dom. This ability was beyond his control; he couldn’t turn it off even if he wanted to. That’s not too user-friendly—or maybe it’s a little <em>too</em> much so.</p>
<p>“Maybe it is, but that doesn’t mean it’s not incredible. You would’ve won the championship if you didn’t bow out.”</p>
<p>The tournament was ample proof that this skill worked. Victory was his if he wanted it.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but it’s only caused me trouble. I do nothing, and people just make all these assumptions about me… That was the whole way I won over in Englesia, too.”</p>
<p>As he put it, he let that get to his head. Even with his efforts crushing the Orthrus crime ring, he didn’t actually do anything—people just treated him like a king. He could completely give up and things still worked out his way, so life was generally pretty easy for him. The experience at this tournament, though, made him realize that if this ever failed, even once, it’d end his life.</p>
<p>That was why he’d decided it was time for a reality check, and I thought he was right. But would Chosen One affect me?</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>Understood. Against ultimate skills, nearly all lower-level skills are canceled.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">So it doesn’t affect me. Good. Because I intended to go easy on him anyway, but I didn’t realize he was a complete amateur in battle. I bet even a quick jab from me would be disastrous.</p>
<p>“Well, you made the right choice—and probably at the last moment possible. I think you should be proud of that.”</p>
<p>“You think? But Gobta transformed into that terrifying…<em>thing</em> and… You know, I didn’t need brains to realize I could never beat him.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t so sure about that, actually, A pretty decent chunk of <a id="page-243"></a>people were taking Gobta on regularly… But yeah, Masayuki did the right thing.</p>
<p>So we chatted some more, giving each other our stories and backgrounds. For the most part, though, I just gave a quick rundown of my life, spending more time listening to Masayuki talk. His friends worshipped him like a god, so he couldn’t really speak frankly with them. He had nobody to vent to except Yuuki, and his busy schedule made it difficult to meet up. It made the stress and irritation accumulate.</p>
<p>Basically, he revealed everything about himself to me, without me having to ask any questions.</p>
<p>“Well, I’d like to hear more from you, but my lunch break is just about over. So let me ask you this: What are you going to do now?”</p>
<p>“How do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I mean, you promised Bovix a rematch, right? Are you gonna tackle the Dungeon?”</p>
<p>“Ahhh!”</p>
<p>I guess Masayuki had forgotten all about it. He must’ve been planning to promptly skip town.</p>
<p>“Well…what <em>should</em> I do?”</p>
<p>“Ahhh, don’t worry. Bovix is only guarding the area around Floor 50, and the Dungeon’s super huge, so it’s gonna take a few days just to make it that far.”</p>
<p>“Oh. So if I pretend to tackle it, I’ll make it through today, at least?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. And all the dignitaries here right now are gonna leave town tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The festival ran for three days. The highways were going to be packed with people tomorrow, so we’d mainly be working to keep traffic smooth. The real cleanup work wouldn’t start for two days, once all the visitors were gone. The big Dungeon opening today was mainly a demonstration for the royalty and nobility in town—a pre-unveiling, really, or a temporary opening until it began normal operation.</p>
<p>Thus, I didn’t think anyone would go more than a few floors down in the several hours it was open today. Besides, I also had an idea about that battle between Masayuki and Bovix. Not to disappoint <a id="page-244"></a>him, but I didn’t want Masayuki to get defeated. Since I had him here and all, I wanted him to function like a living, breathing billboard for me, leading the Dungeon-conquering adventurers down and getting them enthused about tackling the challenge.</p>
<p>“So I’d like you to grab people’s attention for me, but do you think you can do that?”</p>
<p>“…Wow. That’s pretty reassuring to hear. That’s why you gave Jinrai all that great equipment, huh? And personally, if screwing up in there won’t kill me, I can tackle the labyrinth worry-free. It sounds perfect!”</p>
<p>He gladly pledged his support. I’d meant nothing of the sort with Jinrai’s gift, but that certainly worked out well, too. Going into the Dungeon de facto topless was just asking to be killed.</p>
<p>“And I’ll be glad to leak some hints about conquering the Dungeon, too. If you can use them to get down pretty far for me, that’d be great. Also, if you see anything you think we could improve, don’t be shy about telling me.”</p>
<p>I wouldn’t offer any help going beyond Floor 50—we wanted to keep things on the up-and-up here, so I advised him to keep that in mind. But even there, he’d never die as long as he held on to his Resurrection Bracelet, so it was all good.</p>
<p>“Sounds great! I feel like I’m beta testing a game or something.”</p>
<p>“Ah… Now that you mention it, it <em>is</em> kinda like that. But no need to knock yourself out today. Try to reach, like, Floor 5 or thereabouts.”</p>
<p>A game, huh? That’s an interesting observation to make.</p>
<p>“All right,” Masayuki said with a refreshing smile. “I’m glad we got to talk to each other, Rimuru. It’s really put my mind at ease. Now I’m starting to think this world isn’t so bad after all.”</p>
<p>His skill had made things pretty easy for him before now, but he was still anxious a lot of the time. Having someone pledge their support for him must’ve eased his worries. That, and our nation was at the cutting edge of technology in this world. Our baths and toilets made our accommodations far better than anywhere else, and the variety and quality of the food here must’ve surprised him, too.</p>
<p>“We have that orchestra, and we’re teaching painting to people. <a id="page-245"></a>Pretty soon, I plan to get some theater productions going. I want to have fun here, and I’m not gonna skimp on investing in that stuff.”</p>
<p>“I really respect you, Rimuru! Um, what about manga?”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! Of course we’ll have manga, Masayuki. That’s a longer way away, but nobody else is gonna do it, so…”</p>
<p>“Whoa! I-I’ll follow you wherever you go, Rimuru!”</p>
<p>And so Masayuki decided to remain in town for the time being. I planned to stay in close touch with him, passing on information and such. Hopefully we could have these talks regularly—I wanted to kick back and ask him about our old world, too. It’d be a nice nostalgia trip. That, and I wanted to prod his memory for manga. He was keenly curious about my collection, and I definitely hoped to stay on good terms with him.</p>
<p>Now I had a new friend.</p>

<p class="tx1">Our Dungeon was finally slated to open this afternoon, and I decided to perform one last check beforehand, just in case. Heading down to the open area at the bottommost floor, I was greeted by Ramiris, who came flying right up to me.</p>
<p>“We’re just about to open things up, but how’s it all going?”</p>
<p>“Ha! Who do you think I am, huh?”</p>
<p>She certainly sounded confident—and Veldora, lumbering out from his room, seemed pretty proud of himself, too.</p>
<p>“Kwahhh-ha-ha-ha! Fear not, Rimuru. We have overlooked nothing!”</p>
<p>Uh-oh. I was suddenly <em>very</em> worried.</p>
<p>“Whoa, are you sure about that? I don’t want you guys doing anything stupid during the unveiling today, okay?”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! No worries! Just leave it all to us! I activated every safety feature.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… But starting tomorrow, the labyrinth will bare its fangs!”</p>
<p>Ramiris and Veldora looked at each other and sneered. Were they really gonna be okay? Because they weren’t assuaging my fears at all.</p>
<p><a id="page-246"></a>“Um, I’m gonna say this just in case you forgot, but we’re closing the labyrinth right after this, okay?”</p>
<p>“Wh-what?!”</p>
<p>Why was Veldora saying “<em>Wh-what?!</em>” to me? I’d told him as much several times before, but I suppose he wasn’t listening.</p>
<p>After seeing how today turned out, I wanted to fine-tune the labyrinth’s difficulty levels. Thus, my plan was to close things up for two or three days, then reopen after that. We also hadn’t worked out admission prices yet, and we needed trained personnel in place to sell the Labyrinth Cards (i.e. the tickets) and other items. We didn’t have the free time or people for that so far, but I wanted to talk it over with Mjöllmile after we finished the post-festival cleanup.</p>
<p>Looking back, maybe it was a mistake to leave the final details to this pair. I mean, Ramiris and Veldora looked like they were having fun, and I was busy anyway, but…man, they were paying <em>no</em> attention at our meetings. But I didn’t want to yell at them, either. Everyone was a little flustered right now.</p>
<p>“Calm down, okay? I’ll do my best to get us officially open as soon as possible, so just sit tight until then.”</p>
<p>“Okay!”</p>
<p>“I will trust in you, Rimuru!”</p>
<p>Great. That ought to get us through today… Oh, but I almost forgot. I had something extremely important to ask.</p>
<p>“By the way, is Milim in here?”</p>
<p>“She is.”</p>
<p>“Yep! She took two unlimited-use Resurrection Bracelets from us and ran off.”</p>
<p>“Ahhh. And I gave her control over Floors 96 to 99, right? The dragon chambers with the elemental-effect floors and everything?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. She has been putting a great deal of work into them.”</p>
<p>“She sure has! And she even gave me the rights to the dragons she caught for those floors! She said that if we raise them right and they evolve into Dragon Lords, they’ll be intelligent enough to understand my commands!”</p>
