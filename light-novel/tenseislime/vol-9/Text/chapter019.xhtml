<p class="noindentt"><a id="page-137"></a>A lot of the audience seemed bored at first. I worried that we should have swapped the order out, in retrospect…but it appeared I was worried over nothing. In fact, maybe this was the right order after all. We certainly fulfilled our main goal of making the movers and shakers in the audience interested in us. I internally resolved to give Gabil and Vester unbridled praise the next time I had a chance.</p>

<p class="tx1">After the presentation came some free activity time. A number of our VIPs would relax at our salon, while others would peruse our food stalls incognito. A few would savor the hot-spring bath, and others would enjoy checking out our amusement facilities. Each one of them had their own guide, so they were free to pursue their own interests. They were all abuzz about the concert and science presentation, too, reportedly spreading praise about them to everyone they spoke to around town.</p>
<p>As I watched them take in the festival, I saw Arnaud and Bacchus come up to me, looking concerned. “We need to talk,” Arnaud whispered to me. It sounded like something important, so I brought Benimaru and Shion along and guided them to a room in the reception hall.</p>
<p>There we saw Luminus. I’d suspected we would, given how agitated the paladins seemed, and I was right. She was in her maid dress, seated with her legs crossed. The juxtaposition of her pale skin and the black garter belts and stockings was, frankly, hot. Arnaud and Bacchus stood bolt upright behind her—the sight of them serving this maid was a surreal role reversal, but it actually fit her well. Luminus’s powerful aura at work, I imagine.</p>
<p>“Now,” she began before I could talk or even sit down, “we have a treaty of nonaggression in place…but that will not be enough.”</p>
<p>I always knew she was impatient, but not <em>this</em> impatient. Exasperated, I helped myself to a chair. Something told me I wasn’t about to get invited to a seat.</p>
<p>“Not enough how?”</p>
<p><a id="page-138"></a>“How else? It lacks interaction! If we cannot make contact with each other, how will we ever have interaction?”</p>
<p>“Um, I don’t see why we can’t…?”</p>
<p>I organized the situation in my mind as I thought over what Luminus meant.</p>
<p>As she said, there was a nonaggression pact between the Holy Empire of Lubelius and Tempest. The Western Holy Church was a part of Lubelius, which also helped boost our position with the Western Nations. I really appreciated that, but in terms of interaction, she was right—we had virtually no diplomatic relations. We were just too physically distant from each other. There was no national-level trade. Any circulation of goods was left to market principles, with whatever merchants or nations wanted to be involved.</p>
<p>We weren’t completely cut off from trade, though. I had actually asked Mjöllmile to send a few traveling peddlers in their direction. Why wait for Lubelius when we could take action ourselves? We were conducting basic market research, and I had already gotten a report of products and goods that the Holy Empire specialized in.</p>
<p>That report told me that Lubelius was an agricultural giant, producing great quantities of crops (primarily wheat) and exporting much of it to the Western Nations. I looked at a sample, and it was very high-quality—tasty, too. I was hoping to import some, in fact, but as mentioned, the distance involved made it tough. Before we started talking about more formal trade, I wanted to see that problem dealt with first.</p>
<p>So that’s where we were now. I wanted to deepen our relations in the future, but if you asked me what could be done right this minute, I couldn’t give you anything.</p>
<p>“You inconsiderate clod. Or are you toying with me?”</p>
<p>“No, no, that’s not it at all!”</p>
<p>Luminus gave my harried reply an irritated sigh. “When I say interaction, I mean <em>cultural</em> interaction. Frankly, I underestimated all of you. The people under our protection in Lubelius lack a great deal in the way of artistic talent. Meanwhile, although I expected little, your musical presentation earlier was impressive. I have reconsidered my views of you today.”</p>
<p><a id="page-139"></a>Whoa. <em>Heaps</em> of praise. She had a few kind words for me as we passed each other earlier, but I guess she really <em>did</em> like the concert. That, and now I understood her. Today’s musical performance finally made her recognize our talents. I imagined Luminus had some kind of musical band, and presumably she was talking about an international exchange with its members, to help improve both of us.</p>
<p>“There are some among the vampires who are artistically inclined. They carry on the heritage of our old music while working on new creative endeavors, but lately they’ve been stuck in a rut. I think some input from visiting creators of your realm would be a fine catalyst.”</p>
<p>I had it right on the mark. And really, I appreciated the request. An experience like this always enriches the heart and mind. And if you want to improve your cultural activity, interacting with other people was the best inspiration you could feed on.</p>
<p>“I like that idea! We couldn’t ask for anything better.”</p>
<p>I had no reason to turn her down, so I readily agreed. Looking at our future relations, besides, it was bound to have more positive impact than bad.</p>
<p>“Very good. I will make sure things proceed along those lines.”</p>
<p>She gave me a satisfied nod. Just as she did, an elderly servant placed some tea in front of us. Gunther, I think his name was—just as strong as Louis Valentine but also one talented servant. Diablo was the same way, come to think of it. Who knew that butlers were such lean, mean fighting machines in this world? And now other servants were bringing drinks to Benimaru and Shion behind me. They weren’t delayed; it was just that the impatient Luminus summoned me so quickly that they couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p>Luminus gave them a cold nod—a sign of a strict master-servant relationship, I thought. But:</p>
<p>“Isn’t that great? Now <em>you</em> can enjoy that music, too, soon.”</p>
<p>It sounded pompous as she spoke to her attendants. But they didn’t take it that way, saying, “Thank you very much” and “I look forward to it!” in return. They looked happy enough to me, so they definitely meant it. Their attitude to Luminus was based on respect, <a id="page-140"></a>it seemed, not fear. I found it odd at first—and then I looked closer and realized they were all vampires.</p>
<p>Their auras were wholly shut off, their powers restrained to the point that they were indiscernible from regular people. They were high-level vampires, I imagined, given how close they were to Luminus. Just the few of them here alone could easily topple an entire nation, I’m sure, and here they were serving tea to us. The world can be one irrational place sometimes.</p>
<p>“Now, Gunther, carry out the necessary details when we return to Nightgarden.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord.”</p>
<p>Luminus nodded and took an elegant, silent sip of tea—a beautiful showcase of manners, one you’d want to teach to a debutante.</p>
<p>“Ah yes,” she brightly said as I stared enrapt at her, “that scientific presentation was quite interesting as well. Dissecting the effects of magicules is quite a fascinating idea to come up with. There are those on my staff with a rather odd interest in research. I was thinking we could send them here, but would you mind that?”</p>
<p>I asked for some more details. The way she put it, there was still little in the way of cultured civilization among the humans who lived on the surface of Lubelius, but the underground mainland boasted a fairly decent level of technology.</p>
<p>“Oh? That’s surprising. I thought you wouldn’t be so secretive with all that.”</p>
<p>“I dislike causing trouble for myself. If we were too conspicuous, we feared that accursed lizard would find us, remember. I hardly want the angels interfering with us, either. That’s why I’ve had all our major research moved underground, until we can fully eradicate them.”</p>
<p>She seemed proud of herself.</p>
<p>The way she framed it, Luminus was the most powerful political ruler among all the demon lords. She was a vampire, so essentially immortal, with a life span transcending even that of elves. The more powerful among her kind didn’t even need to eat, capable of sustaining themselves via minute doses of life energy from human <a id="page-141"></a>beings. There was no doubting the fact that vampires sat at the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>But even they had their deficiencies. Vampires were called “rulers of the night” for good reason—they could wield untold powers in the darkness, but exposure to sunlight wiped them off the planet. It was a huge weakness, but even with it, they remained incredibly dangerous. But again, the more powerful among this advanced race—some among the noble classes under Luminus—could apparently overcome this weakness against the sun. These were called “overcomers,” and they could pretty much go around by day and do whatever they pleased. There were very few of them, which was a good thing, since a vampire without weaknesses would be a nightmare for humanity. Definitely a Calamity-level threat, if not as much a one as Louis or Gunther.</p>
<p>The servants here were overcomers as well. They served Luminus as a sort of hobby, it seemed—with, of course, a heavy nuance of being her bodyguards. Being an overcomer meant having no weak points and therefore a lot of free time on your hands; that was why so many of them enjoyed making assorted things for fun. They’d craft all sorts of junk, in fact, hoping to win Luminus’s affections.</p>
<p>“To be honest,” she said to me, “it’s dreadfully irritating. I have ordered them to develop something more useful, but they’re too fixated on their own ideas, I suppose. They’ve made no progress whatsoever. I would love for you to take them in and give them a little education.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… I wouldn’t mind that, but…”</p>
<p>But of course I’d have qualms about the whole thing unless I got to meet Luminus’s candidates. Being an overcomer meant enjoying life in the ruling class—someone like them traveling to Tempest for study could lead to problems I had no way of predicting in advance.</p>
<p>Luminus, perhaps seeing my indecision, made another offer. “I’m not asking you to work for free, of course. Perhaps I could offer a skill to you.”</p>
<p>“A skill?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The ‘secret skills of faith and favor.’”</p>
<p><a id="page-142"></a><em>What’s that? Sounds really cool! Or at least cooler than the kinds of skills</em> I <em>came up with for myself, such as relearning how to get drunk.</em></p>
<p>“What are those?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s quite simple.” She gave me an evil, complacent smile. “It allows those faithful to you to harness some of your powers.”</p>
<p>Whoa. That sounds dangerous. If she taught me this around all these people…</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>Report. Luminus has used Spatial Severance to isolate your location.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">Raphael neatly pointed it out, cutting me off before I could get worked up. Ah. That <em>would</em> explain why I couldn’t hear anyone besides ourselves right now. She really <em>was</em> a pillar among the strongest of demon lords; setting off skills just came naturally to her.</p>
<p>“So you’ll teach me this in exchange for allowing your students to come here to live for a while? Am I understanding that right?”</p>
<p>“You are. I would be happy enough to have a cultural exchange with our musicians alone. In a way, this is my token of thanks to you.”</p>
<p>She didn’t appear to be lying.</p>
<p>“All right. I’ll take your offer.”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee! Then we have a deal.”</p>
<p>We did. She’d have her musicians trained here, and I’d have my “<em>secret skills of faith and favor</em>.”</p>
<p>To put it very simply, these skills were the principles behind all holy magic. It involved me using my name as a vessel in order to cast spells. Hinata and the paladins, for example, could wield holy magic by using Luminus’s name as a vessel—borrowing a bit of her power with each use. If I could learn the trick behind it, more of the people under me could gain access to holy magic.</p>
<p>Surprising—it seemed like I was getting a lot out of the bargain. Luminus being Luminus, of course, I knew she had calculated all of this.</p>
<p>“That sounds great to me, but are you sure about this?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t mind. You were likely to discover the truth of it for <a id="page-143"></a>yourself in a few years’ time anyway. It is best to take advantage of information while it is still valuable, is it not?”</p>
<p class="space-break"><em>…</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Ah</em>, I thought. <em>All right.</em> And judging by Raphael’s pained silence, it wouldn’t have even been a few years. We were researching the nature of magicules, and after Hinata’s battle, we already knew the existence of spiritual particles. Put those together, and the truth would’ve come to us naturally. Well, not to <em>me</em> but to Raphael, certainly. And Luminus, spotting this, simply offered it while she was still able to extract something from me for it.</p>
<p>“Well, even so, I appreciate it, Luminus.”</p>
<p>“As long as you keep <em>your</em> side of the bargain, all is well.”</p>
<p>Attempting negotiation with Luminus was still too heavy a task for me. <em>This</em> time it didn’t hurt me, but I’d have to think things through more carefully from now on. I mused over this as I shook hands with her.</p>
<p>Thus our budding orchestra would be traveling to Nightgarden shortly, while the noble “overcomers” serving Luminus would be coming here for research purposes.</p>
<p class="space-break">Once Luminus deactivated Spatial Severance, we relaxed a bit, as if nothing had happened. I kicked back and enjoyed my tea, listening as Luminus gave me her review of the morning’s concert. It seemed like she was more enthusiastic about exchanges of the musical, and not scientific, sort. Most of her questions involved our orchestra and when we could get them over to her.</p>
<p>Then, at the end:</p>
<p>“By the way, Rimuru, there were some rather disagreeable people among the dignitaries you invited. Were you aware of them?”</p>
<p>She acted casual about this, her tone unchanged. I wondered what she meant for a moment—but it had to be her way of warning me about something.</p>
<p>I guess it wasn’t my imagination after all.</p>
<p>“Ah yes, <em>that</em> pair?”</p>
<p><a id="page-144"></a>“Mm. If you don’t shirk your duty and keep your wits about you with them, then very well. But I do hope you will make efforts not to denigrate the good name of the Octagram.”</p>
<p>That was her way of signaling the end of our conversation. I nodded at her and took my leave.</p>

<p class="tx1">After my spontaneous conversation with Luminus ended, it was time for dinner.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, Yuuki, Hinata, and I were assigned to the same table. They were all smiles with each other, busily discussing the day’s events and virtually drooling at all the food brought in. I could hardly wait to dig in myself as I listened to their reflections. There were two choices available for the evening’s courses, Japanese and Western; Hinata went for Japanese, while Yuuki and I picked Western.</p>
<p>“I tell you,” Yuuki began, “that was a seriously incredible performance. You really should’ve checked it out, Hinata. The food stalls’ll be open later, you know.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me what to do. I achieved what I set out to do today. What’s the problem? Besides, the <em>takoyaki</em> was <em>so</em> good, and…”</p>
<p>Her voice went down to a whisper and she started making excuses.</p>
<p>“…But really, though. You guys went with ‘Alias’?”</p>
<p>I averted my eyes from Hinata, pretending to have no idea what she was talking about.</p>
<p>“But no, I mean it—it’s <em>really</em> worth listening to. I mean, I quite liked that one song already, but hearing it arranged for an orchestra… It just blew me away.”</p>
<p><em>Nice one, Yuuki.</em> His unbridled praise for Baton and company had successfully diverted Hinata’s attention.</p>
<p>“All right, all right,” she said, not sounding that peeved. “If you’re going on about it <em>that</em> much, I’ll take the kids there tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Hinata, for her part, seemed to make the most of today, throwing her money up and down the festival, much to my appreciation. Clothes, weapons, armor, magic items—she bought it all, and at <a id="page-145"></a>marked-up festival prices, too. She also made her way up and down the food stalls, and honestly, I think she took the kids just as an excuse to stuff herself. They loved her, though, it sounded like, so I couldn’t complain at all—especially since she’d already volunteered to watch them the next day.</p>
<p>“Personally, I’m more interested in that research into magicules,” Hinata continued, lowering her voice again. “Healing potions don’t really work on me, you know, because my body breaks down the magicules… And actually, there are some healing magics that work on me and some that don’t.”</p>
<p>She had apparently done a bit of research of her own, to see if there was any potion out there that worked on her. Having the ability to annul magic applied to her sounded good on paper, but the more you thought about it, the more inconveniences it created.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you know, I haven’t thought about it, huh? I’m affected by magicules, too, I guess, so…”</p>
<p>“When you jump between worlds, you take in a vast amount of energy. Sometimes these manifest as skills, and sometimes it results in nothing—like with you, Yuuki. But you’re right—you’re still affected by them. You haven’t grown at all, for one—”</p>
<p>“Whoa, whoa, don’t put it <em>that</em> way! I haven’t grown, no, but I’ve done a lot in my years here, you know?”</p>
<p>“I know, I know. You don’t have to get worked up every time I mention it. I’m just picking on you.”</p>
<p>Maybe Hinata was just picking on him…but with those imposing eyes of hers? When she said stuff like that with her sharpened glare and joyless face, it really didn’t sound much like a joke.</p>
<p>“All right. But you know, Rimuru, I’m fascinated by the directions you’re taking your research here.”</p>
<p>I appreciated the compliment, but Yuuki was really thinking too much of me.</p>
<p>“No, no, that was really all Gabil and Vester’s own work. I only learned about it the same time all of you did.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you order them to do that research?” Hinata asked. “And <a id="page-146"></a>you let them announce it to VIPs from around the world without even knowing what it was?”</p>
<p>They both gave me incredulous looks.</p>
<p>“Um, this soup is good, huh?” I ventured, fleeing reality while I fished for an excuse. “But look, what could I do? I want them to be independent!”</p>
<p>Not having any other ideas, I tried being more forceful in my approach. It didn’t work. They just glared back at me.</p>
<p>“…All right, I <em>kind</em> of regret that. I was really busy, but maybe I should’ve at least heard what it was first…”</p>
<p>Too late now, of course.</p>
<p>“Man, Rimuru. You sure are something, you know that?”</p>
<p>“Honestly. Sometimes, I seriously think he’s a real big shot. Sometimes.”</p>
<p>That did <em>not</em> sound like praise to me, but ah well. Even I had to admit, it was kind of a slipup. The presentation’s content was great, but I got a bit nervous in the middle of it and Gazel admonished me about it as well—already, I wanted to be more careful next time. Didn’t think Yuuki and Hinata were gonna rake me over the coals about it, too, though…</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, the conversation drifted back into small talk as the dinner continued.</p>
<p class="space-break">Thus the first day of the Founder’s Festival closed to largely excellent reviews. It really felt like a strong start to me, and I had no doubt in my mind that it’d end a great success—not knowing, of course, that I’d learn in short order just how naive I was.</p>
