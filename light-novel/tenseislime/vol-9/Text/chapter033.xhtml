<p class="noindentt"><a id="page-248"></a>Ramiris was all smiles. I guess, in her mind, even Milim had some good facets to her.</p>
<p>The sight of Milim flying through the air, carrying captured dragons in her arms, must’ve given anyone who saw her quite a shock. Apparently, we’d received complaints about it the first two times, but people got used to it from the third time onward. I guess our town’s residents just accepted it as normal.</p>
<p>Milim had found for us four dragons in all—a Fire Dragon, Frost Dragon, Wind Dragon, and Earth Dragon. These were elemental Arch Dragons, just as Milim had promised us, and even now they were about as intelligent as your typical farm animal. Give them care like you would any pet, and it’d be possible to connect with them.</p>
<p>“Huh. Did you put collars on them or anything?”</p>
<p>“For now, yes. These are my beloved servants, so I want to be darn sure we set up a clear master-and-servant relationship!”</p>
<p><em>I see.</em> Ramiris was certainly thinking deeply about this, and what I heard sounded good enough to me. But back to the main topic.</p>
<p>“So is Milim in the dragon chambers right now?”</p>
<p>“Yep. She said she found some playmates to help my servants stay in shape!”</p>
<p>“Indeed. I believe I went fishing with one of them once. But how is someone like him going to play with a dragon?”</p>
<p><em>You’re better off not knowing, I think.</em> But all I needed was Milim’s current location. If she was toiling away near the bottom of the labyrinth, I doubt she’d meddle with our opening at all.</p>
<p>“Right. She probably won’t get in the way, then, so I’m fine with that. We’re about to open the labyrinth right now, so can you come up top for me?”</p>
<p>“Yep! I’d be happy to,” chirped Ramiris.</p>
<p>“I will pass. It is the role of the labyrinth master to await his challengers!”</p>
<p><em>…Look, I told you, nobody’s gonna make it to the bottom in one day! In fact, you’d probably have to wait</em> many <em>days before anyone shows up.</em> I refrained from telling him this, however. That’s so kind of me.</p>
<p>“Great. Well, good luck, then!”</p>
<p><a id="page-249"></a>Leaving Veldora with some encouragement, I took Ramiris along as we teleported to the chamber up top.</p>

<p class="tx1">With lunch over, a large number of people had arrived at their seats. Ramiris and I were there to greet them.</p>
<p>“Welcome back, Sir Rimuru,” Diablo said, smiling. He was done with his refereeing work, and I heard he was looking for me. I gave him a quick nod and hello of my own, then switched gears and took a look at our program. I had a lot of expectations for the Dungeon we were opening. It was one of the centerpieces of our nation’s future development, so I wanted as many of our visitors to explore it as possible. Fortunately, it seemed like few to none of our invitees decided to take an early leave after lunch. The hall was nearly full, so I thought this would function as pretty decent advertising.</p>
<p>Turning toward the event space, I could see Soka and Mjöllmile, the latter of whom would take Diablo’s place as guide and announcer during this event. It was time to go, so I gave them both my signal.</p>
<p>“All right! The time has come! The final event of Day Three of the Founder’s Festival is about to begin!”</p>
<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience. We are about to show you a small portion of our impregnable Dungeon, one of Tempest’s greatest achievements. It is the ultimate challenge for adventurers, presented by our leader, the demon lord Rimuru. Will anybody out there be able to conquer it?!”</p>
<p>Mjöllmile was giving this spiel from center stage, mic in hand. He wasn’t quite as much of a natural at this as Soka, but he looked well enough in his element.</p>
<p>What he had to say was this: Running a demonstration of the labyrinth was well and good, but taking all the visitors here inside the Dungeon was too dangerous. There were several hundred members of the ruling class in here; add our more nearby residents, and the number became several thousand. A crowd that size crammed into the labyrinth would be far too unruly to guide around.</p>
<p>Instead, we’d come up with the idea of sending several parties <a id="page-250"></a>down there and showing their progress on a large screen. That presented a few technological challenges, but we had already succeeded at providing a clear picture on a huge screen at the battle tournament, and we could use the same tech for this.</p>
<p>The projector that Gabil and Vester built was proving useful for a variety of purposes. It’s what we’d used to display the battles on-screen earlier, via a video-recording crystal ball stored inside the machine. This crystal was inscribed with magical communication spells that let it receive images recorded far away and project them here, allowing the audience to watch the challengers from a safe distance and enjoy the entertainment.</p>
<p>Getting a king or prince injured would be a huge problem; as a result, only a few selected parties would actually be experiencing the labyrinth today.</p>
<p>“And so,” a smiling Soka shouted, “we’d now like to open the labyrinth up to adventurers! Are there any members of the audience courageous enough to delve into the Dungeon we’re proud to offer you?”</p>
<p>That was our cue. Ramiris, perched on my shoulder, summoned a temporary doorway to the labyrinth in the center of the stage. We could’ve just brought any challengers down to the basement here, but it was important to put on a show for things like this.</p>
<p>“““Oooohhh!”””</p>
<p>See? The crowd was amazed, just as I hoped they’d be. A quiet sort of excitement was taking root among them, the adventurers in the audience sizing up one another. We were strictly accepting volunteers today, and if possible, I wanted to see a lot of participants—and even if nobody raised their hand, we still had Masayuki’s group. That was part of why I wanted to negotiate with him earlier; he had already explained matters to his friends, and they were on standby right now. I had given them a map of the first five floors to ensure against any mistakes. Hopefully they’d serve as the advertising pitchmen I wanted.</p>
<p>So would we see any volunteers? As it turned out, my concerns were for nothing.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh… I dunno what a demon lord’s labyrinth is all about, <a id="page-251"></a>but I’m ready to rip the facade from it! You might think you’ve cowed us all, what with that phony battle tournament and everything, but you won’t get us <em>this</em> time!”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Basson’s right!”</p>
<p>“If the highway wasn’t so jammed, Basson would’ve won the whole tournament!”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… You’re not forgetting about me, are you?”</p>
<p>“Ah, don’t be that way, Gomez. They know all about how strong you are. As long as you and I are together, our ‘Great Lightning’ team’s got nothing to fear!”</p>
<p>Oh? Looks like we’ve got all kinds of challengers. This Basson guy must’ve shown up too late to join the tournament. If he was around to see it, he should’ve known full well how powerful the competitors were…but with a couple of matches forfeited, the quality of the fighting was admittedly hit-or-miss. I was sure there were a ton of people like Basson who assumed they were invincible and so on. But that was fine. I figured we’d see a few skeptics who refused to believe in any of this. Those would be our future customers, after all.</p>
<p>“And Masayuki the Hero wasn’t anyone special in the end, either, was he? He’s strong, I’ll grant you that, but in a fight, you gotta see it through to the end! Letting the demon lord of this country off the hook like that… How half-hearted of him! It sickens me!”</p>
<p>Um… He admitted that Masayuki was “<em>strong</em>”? <em>Okay, whatever.</em></p>
<p>“Yeah, this so-called labyrinth is a big con job—and Basson and I are gonna expose it for what it is right now!”</p>
<p>Basson’s group certainly had gusto.</p>
<p>“I refuse to allow them to berate you like this, Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“Let me go over and shut them up a bit—”</p>
<p>“Halt!”</p>
<p>I couldn’t let my guard down. Shion was irritated, and Diablo came <em>this</em> close to going out of control. I hurriedly stopped them—but at least they didn’t threaten to kill them this time.</p>
<p>“They’re just a little overconfident, okay? Besides, I think it’ll be more fun if we get people like them.”</p>
<p>They might be a little dumb, I thought, but they were the right <a id="page-252"></a>people for this job. Shion and Diablo nodded their agreement—I was used to handling them by now.</p>
<p>Basson was a fighter with a shaved head; Gomez, a sorcerer in a black robe. They had four others in their party, none of them worth writing home about. This sextet would be our first challengers.</p>
<p class="space-break">Then someone unexpected spoke up.</p>
<p>“We’ll take the challenge!”</p>
<p>Three people jumped out of the audience. I thought I’d seen them before… <em>Wait, is that Elen?!</em></p>
<p>I was having Elen’s trio help with the founding of Yohm’s new nation. They were going around the Free Guild locations in the former Farmus, and I had asked them to aid Yohm however they could. A B-ranked adventurer was a fearsome presence in itself, and Elen’s party was now rated B-plus. They were allowed to cross national borders unhindered, so I figured this was the perfect job for them. They hadn’t joined Yohm on the way here, so I assumed they had gone back home or something, but no. I had no idea they were planning this, in fact—they must’ve been hiding it so Archduke Erald didn’t stop them.</p>
<p>“We’re really going to do it?”</p>
<p>“Oh, of course we are! I haven’t had <em>any</em> adventures lately, so I’ve been waiting for this!”</p>
<p>“Let me ask—as leader, I have the right to say no, right? Right?”</p>
<p>“Um, no? Not at all. It’s already set in stone!”</p>
<p>Crazy. I felt so bad for Kabal. And I thought I’d just heard Erald screaming over in the other room, only to fall silent after the sound of something smashing. I could picture what had happened but chose not to. Hopefully, at least, Elen would be done before her father woke up.</p>
<p class="space-break">Our third party here was led by Masayuki, hero of the day. They all calmly strode onstage, greeting the audience with smiles.</p>
<p>“Ma! Sa! Yu! Ki! <em>Masayukiiiii!</em>”</p>
<p><em>Yes, yes, all right. They hear you.</em> The applause in the room was deafening. What a stud he is.</p>
<p><a id="page-253"></a>Counting Masayuki, there were four people in the party, including the formerly topless Jinrai clad in the armor I’d given him—a suit of Mithril Armor, crafted by Garm and rated as a Rare on the scale. It was heavier than Yohm’s Exo-Armor and not quite as effective but just as durable. It even gave the wearer anti-poison effects.</p>
<p>I had also given Masayuki a rapier as a present. I’d asked him over lunch why he never drew his sword, and he flatly replied, “<em>Well, like, it’s heavy, so…</em>” Honestly, I was shocked by how much of a bluffer he was. He had some kendo experience but none with actual swords—and besides, in this world, slicing Japanese katanas weren’t as popular as heavy, skull-crushing blades, so they were all gonna have a little heft to them.</p>
<p>As he told me, even striking a pose with a sword for a long time was difficult for him. So I gave him this rapier, advising him to try working out a little more as well. This blade was a discarded version of the one I gave to Hinata—it had the same light weight and strength, but not her sword’s unique trait of always killing your opponent on the seventh landed attack. Just swinging this thing around was enough work for Masayuki; he didn’t need that sort of advanced feature anyway. Plus, the rapier also remedied exhaustion for its user to some extent. If all Masayuki would do was strike a pose and keep it steady, this sword was more than enough.</p>
<p>So the party of four was soaking in the cheers from the audience, none of whom questioned their change in equipment.</p>
<p>We planned to set a time limit of three hours, calculated back from my intended goal of keeping anyone from going past Floor 5. Masayuki’s party had a map, giving them an advantage over the others, and I was counting on them to advertise the labyrinth for me.</p>
<p class="space-break">So three parties, then? That didn’t seem like too many, but of course, a lot of people would think twice about challenging a shady, demon lord–run labyrinth. We needed to address, and quell, that hesitation with this demo today.</p>
<p>But just as I was about to move the show along:</p>
<p>“Wait. I’ll join in, too.”</p>
<p><a id="page-254"></a>A man clad entirely in black appeared onstage—Gaiye the Flowing Swordsman.</p>
<p>“You’ve done a fine job trapping me in your bluffs and trickery, haven’t you? Heh-heh-heh… The demon lord’s Big Four, or whatever they’re called, certainly play dirty, do they not? I can understand if they’re afraid of my talents, but they picked a fight with the wrong foe. You can scheme all you want, but I’m about to crush your ambitions for good!”</p>
<p>Quite an introduction. I was wondering what he was doing here, and now I knew, I guess. Basically, he couldn’t understand how Ranga had beaten him and decided it was all a trap. He assumed I was up to something no good with this labyrinth, and now he was standing up to stop me in my tracks, I guess. And yes, I <em>was</em> up to something—but probably not the things Gaiye was picturing.</p>
<p>“Right. This time, I’m going to chop his little—”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Get ’im, Diablo!”</p>
<p>“No. Don’t get ’im. And stop imitating my voice, Shion.”</p>
<p>These people… I swear, why were they always like this? Whenever someone said something about me, they just give them no mercy. And Shion was getting <em>so</em> sensitive to every affront, too, imagined or not. Maybe it was time I thought of some more serious measures for her.</p>
<p>But whatever.</p>
<p>Gaiye looked like he wanted to go solo on this, but was he gonna be okay? I was honestly concerned. On the other hand, it’d be nice to get a sample of how a lone adventurer would fare in the labyrinth. We might as well make him the fourth “party” today.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Now that we had our challengers, the long-awaited moment was here. It was time to open the Dungeon.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much time to work with, so all four parties would be going in at once. Soka would stay here to commentate on the on-screen action. Inside guidance would be best handled by the dryads, who’d also serve as “cameramen” as they accompanied each party. <a id="page-255"></a>We didn’t have many of them, but there were a few—Treyni, Traya, and Doreth included. The others were young and inexperienced in battle but boasted tremendous magical force. Under Ramiris’s management, they’d make for perfect labyrinth managers.</p>
<p>“These four people,” Soka said, “are the curators of our labyrinth. Normally they will not accompany parties entering the Dungeon, but for today’s run, we’ll have one shadowing each team.”</p>
<p>The quartet gave their hellos to the crowd. These were named Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta—not having names would be inconvenient, so I’d just pulled those out of my head. It didn’t cost me any magicules; since dryads are high-level monsters, I could have them consume their own magic force for the job. Ramiris was their boss, so all I did was help come up with their names. As sisters, they all had the same looks, so telling them apart via visuals alone was a challenge. Monsters often rely on things like magical waveforms to identify individuals, but I thought that was asking a lot of humans, so names were more helpful.</p>
<p>“If you guys run into any trouble, feel free to ask them for advice! And now, let me run down the rules for you all! First, I’m going to give these to everyone!”</p>
<p>Soka pulled out a couple of items, Alpha and the other dryads giving the same ones to each party.</p>
<p>“These items here, you see, we’re planning to offer for sale when people enter the labyrinth. Does everybody have them now?”</p>
<p>As she spoke, each item was shown in a close-up on the screen. This pseudo-television technology was really helpful for stuff like this. Currently, it was showing a set of ten High Potions, one Full Potion, and a bunch of Resurrection Bracelets and return whistles. These had been provided for free during today’s beta test—if they were kind enough to volunteer, I didn’t mind giving them some compensation. The dryad chaperones would have some backup items, too, just in case, so they could get whisked to safety if things went south.</p>
<p>Given the size of this thing, it was entirely possible that a party wouldn’t get out of Floor 1 in the time allotted. Even if they took the shortest path to the stairway down, we’re talking a literal mile <a id="page-256"></a>or so of walking—and given that this was a maze, they were gonna be covering much more distance than that. For the next three hours, it’d be best if the parties tried just hard enough to keep the audience entertained—and once time expired, they’d use their items to get back up top.</p>
<p>I had other rewards for them, too, of course. For advertising purposes, I had some treasure chests set up containing souvenirs in the form of decent armor and so on. During actual operation, these chests wouldn’t show up until Floor 2 onward, but we were being generous today.</p>
<p>Finally, Soka explained the most important item in the lot.</p>
<p>“Now, take a look at this item. This is known as a Resurrection Bracelet, and we highly recommend you purchase this when you enter our labyrinth. What does it do? Believe it or not, it resurrects you from the dead!!”</p>
<p>The crowd immediately began chattering about this. ““Impossible!”” I could hear a few of them shout.</p>
<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, quiet, please! This is important, so I want to be sure everybody’s paying attention, all right? The key thing here is that this item <em>only</em> works if you are inside Tempest’s Dungeon! It doesn’t do anything at all outside the labyrinth, and given the stakes involved, we want to be absolutely sure everyone’s aware of that. Always remember that at all times—this doesn’t work outside!”</p>
<p>That <em>was</em> important. If someone assumed otherwise, it’d make for some sad scenes if they tried using it and failed. I didn’t want people to claim I was liable. <em>It’s up to you to keep yourself safe, okay, guys?</em> But I knew that some people just loved to cause a scene and complain about anything and everything, so we needed to be 100 percent sure we drilled this point into everyone’s minds. Nobody could be allowed to think this worked outside the labyrinth; we couldn’t have some idiot think, <em>Hey, maybe it’ll work somehow</em>. If you mess that up, hey, it’s not our fault. The promoter—i.e., me—bore no responsibility.</p>
<p>You know, in my old world, I always felt like people foisted way too much responsibility on retailers and companies. If some fool <a id="page-257"></a>breaks the rules, goes crazy, and gets themselves killed, all I can say is that they had it coming—but if we’re negligent about providing guidance and cautions, then it <em>does</em> become our fault. That’s why we needed to be thorough about our warnings here.</p>
<p>“…So once again, never, <em>ever</em> attempt to use this bracelet outside!”</p>
<p>Soka was being exactly as clear and thorough as I hoped. Good. The only unresolved item on my wish list was to have someone actually die in there—something people would admittedly be reluctant about. But Ramiris had upgraded the Resurrection Bracelets to the point that they even canceled out pain upon determining you were dead. They also gave you a delay of around ten seconds between when you died and when you got teleported back up, so if you or a fellow party member could take suitable measures in time, you could still get fixed up on the spot. Resurrection, being a divine skill and everything, was too high-level for most people to cast, but still.</p>
<p>By the way, Full Potions normally cannot regenerate the soul, but since your soul was stuck firmly inside your own body inside the labyrinth, you actually <em>could</em> “resurrect” people with a Full Potion to restore the body. I feared encouraging this, however, since (again) it may give people the idea they could pull that trick outside as well. That’s why, unless you resurrected a downed adventurer the standard way, their body and soul would get teleported topside after ten seconds. Just like Masayuki, one should just think of it like a dungeon-exploration video game.</p>
<p>Anyway, that wrapped up the initial briefing. Now I just needed someone to try out the Resurrection Bracelet for me.</p>
<p>“So who would like to experience this for themselves?”</p>
<p>I doubted anyone would, actually, but Soka brightly belted out the question anyway. Talk about thick-skinned.</p>
<p>Basson, the giant skinhead of a man, grunted at this. “Hmph! You’ll never die in the labyrinth? That’s a funny joke. If you think I’m gonna believe that and get myself killed in there, you got another thing coming!”</p>
<p>The people around him nodded their assent. This was just common sense. Not even Elen’s team was taking the bait.</p>
<p><a id="page-258"></a>“Heh… Well, who do you <em>think</em> should do it? <em>You</em> go first.”</p>
<p>Gaiye the Flowing Swordsman pointed a finger at Mjöllmile. He wanted someone else to go first, not him, and I guess that was to be expected. I wished he were more polite about it, though.</p>
<p>“Me? An understandable suggestion, I suppose. I’d be happy to.”</p>
<p>Mjöllmile, perhaps expecting this, wasn’t agitated at all. In fact, he’d already experienced it once. The members of Team Reborn under Shion had experimented with it many times, so he fully believed it was safe—and going through it one time removed any fear from the process. So, with as much stately majesty as he could muster, he put on the bracelet and set foot inside the labyrinth. The challengers followed behind him.</p>
<p>“Now, if you actually attack Mjöllmile in here—”</p>
<p>Soka took up the sword on her hip, preparing to slash at Mjöllmile. But before she could continue, Gaiye cut him off.</p>
<p>“You can’t trick me. Krahhh!”</p>
<p>There was an arcing flash in the air, and then he sliced Mjöllmile’s arm clean off.</p>
<p>“…Hey!!”</p>
<p>Soka tried to stop him, but nowhere near in time.</p>
<p>“Gaaahhh!”</p>
<p>Mjöllmile started shouting as well, bringing a hand to the gaping wound. The reduced-pain effect kept him from dying of shock, but I’m sure getting forcibly amputated wasn’t a very pleasant feeling.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! And now it’s almost time for the final blow!!”</p>
<p>Was he just playing with him? What a bastard. I almost lost my temper, but then I saw a smile on Mjöllmile’s face. That restored my cool—and just as it did, Gaiye’s sword hewed Mjöllmile’s head clean off. At once, his body turned into a collection of light particles, flowing up and gathering by the door at center stage. Mjöllmile, along with what he was wearing, formed anew from these particles, fully restored.</p>
<p>The crystal balls carried by Alpha and the other dryads recorded all of this, transmitting it to the large screen in the hall.</p>
<p>“And there you have it! I’m back in perfect shape!”</p>
<p><a id="page-259"></a>Mjöllmile stood there, as if he hadn’t just been brutally murdered. His severed arm was attached to him as well. It couldn’t have been a better performance.</p>
<p>“Whoooaaa!!”</p>
<p>The audience cheered for him. Some of them screamed that it was a miracle. I’d say the demonstration was a success. I didn’t want people to think this was an elaborate trick, but thanks to Gaiye’s penchant for sudden violence, I think everyone was more convinced than they would have been otherwise. If anyone still didn’t believe it, we’d just have to let them experience it for themselves. Of course, it wasn’t risk-free, so the best thing to do in the labyrinth was to simply not die. Take care of yourself down there, and you’ll never have to go through it.</p>
<p>I figured we could let adventurers who challenged the labyrinth spread the stories for us, and things would work themselves out. I thought some curious daredevils would want to get killed just to see what the experience was like, and that was no problem to me, either. The important thing was that adventurers had nothing to fear if they took on the Dungeon—and I thought Mjöllmile had just ensured that for me. I gotta say, he’s got courage. He put up with Gaiye’s morbid antics because this is exactly how he wanted this to turn out. <em>Definitely need to thank him later for taking that role</em>, I thought as I looked at the screen.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">“The Dungeon is now open for exploration! A brand-new world is waiting for you inside. What could be awaiting those intrepid enough to battle their way through to the bottom?”</p>
<p>Soka was onstage, kicking off her commentary, as the screen showed the viewpoints of all four parties. The live connections worked without a hitch, bringing the audience inside the labyrinth. She was taking a documentary-style approach to her announcing, and I really appreciated her attention to detail as I watched the parties set off.</p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-260"></a>The first one that caught my eye was Basson’s, as they plunged past the orderly, well-built stone-type walls that defined Floor 1.</p>
<p>I figured at least one party member would be drawing a map on the way, but nobody was. They weren’t even leaving marks on the walls to keep their bearings, instead just pleasantly chatting as they strode down the corridors. Were they gonna be okay? I knew people like them explored caves and went on hunting missions in lush forests and so on—how did this party find its way to their destination otherwise? They didn’t hire a guide every time, did they?</p>
<p>“Tch! It’s the same damn kind of corridor over and over! And all these crossroads!”</p>
<p>“Weren’t we at this intersection before, boss?”</p>
<p>Just as I feared, they were lost. I’d told them earlier how big this place was, but had they tuned that out?</p>
<p>“Whoa, this is bad news, Basson! This maze is bigger than I thought…”</p>
<p>Ah. Yeah, the first floor alone was over eight hundred feet long per side. They had been told this was a pretty big place, but I suppose they were picturing something cozier. I guess that, if you heard it described as a man-made structure beneath the coliseum, <em>you’d</em> likely think it wasn’t that big, either. But oh well. It wasn’t my problem—and again, it made for good advertising.</p>
<p>However, I really didn’t want these parties to face instant death at the start of Floor 1. If we went that insanely hard on them from the get-go, nobody would want to take the challenge. They needed to get at least a <em>little</em> far in. They could always die to be transported back, and there was an SOS feature in their bracelets as well, which treated the wearer as dead and let them escape at any time. The dryads could also come to their rescue, and there was one accompanying each party, ready to promptly bring them back to the surface.</p>
<p>So I really wanted them to be serious about plumbing this labyrinth…but Basson was too busy getting irritated at his panicky party members.</p>
<p>“What are you people? Idiots? I’ve never heard of such an enormous maze before. That demon lord’s just feeding us a tall tale. He’s using magic or something to disorient us.”</p>
<p><a id="page-261"></a>“Oh… Oh, he is!”</p>
<p>“You’ve convinced me, Basson!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, the magicule concentration around here is pretty high. You’re probably right. This must be illusory magic or the like.”</p>
<p>“You said it, Gomez. We’ve been following the right-hand rule religiously so far. Worst-case scenario, we’ll just wind up back where we came.”</p>
<p>Oh dear. Labyrinth difficulty was the least of their concerns. They might’ve thought they were thinking things through, but they sure weren’t. I wouldn’t be so harsh on them if they were taking notes on paper, but no way could they memorize a path through all these similar-looking corridors, packed with forks, four-way intersections, and dead ends. Between the uniform decor and the twistiness of the paths, simply going right at every opportunity wasn’t going to get you anyplace.</p>
<p>These challengers were just way too idiotic. Couldn’t count on them for too much, I guess…</p>
<p>…But then Basson’s party disappeared. Or, to be more exact, they fell down to the next level.</p>
<p>“Wh-whoaaa! Was that a trapdoor?”</p>
<p>I was as quizzical as Soka. Did we set up any trapdoors on the first level?</p>
<p>“Ramiris…”</p>
<p>“Um… Yes? How can I help you?”</p>
<p>“…When I set up this floor, I really don’t think I installed anything like that. You haven’t been messing around with my design, have you?”</p>
<p>I tried to keep a smile on my face, so as not to scare Ramiris. That being said, I still found it prudent to grab her to keep her from flying away.</p>
<p>“Well, actually,” she replied with a forced smile, “we wanted to make the labyrinth a more complete creation, so…”</p>
<p>Upon further interrogation, Ramiris admitted to placing a fairly decent number of trapdoors around. I had to chew her out for this. <em>A floor</em> this <em>large doesn’t need trapdoors, all right?</em> The idea was to tire adventurers out and sap their endurance, but these kinds of traps <a id="page-262"></a>had the opposite effect, essentially serving as time-saving shortcuts. Traps are only traps, after all, if their effect matches your intended purpose.</p>
<p>“But, um, but, I mean, you had a lot more fiendish trapdoors in the lower levels, didn’t you? So I thought, you know, perhaps you forgot to install some higher up. I just did it out of kindness, you see?”</p>
<p>I didn’t need <em>that</em> type of kindness.</p>
<p>Sure, if they wanted to make this into a punishing gauntlet, I could get that. If I left everything in the hands of Ramiris, Veldora, and Milim, they’d litter the whole labyrinth with insane traps like that. But I didn’t want that at the very start. That was the whole reason I worked on the topmost floors myself!</p>
<p>Quickly, I turned my attention to the other parties.</p>
<p class="space-break">Elen’s group was theoretically led by Kabal, but Elen herself had fully taken over the leader role. On the whole, they had no sense of direction at all, so I thought beating the first floor could prove difficult for them…and I was half-right.</p>
<p>The group didn’t run into any traps, at least, as they carefully advanced. Amazingly, they were even writing down notes as they went, following the textbook method of dungeon conquering.</p>
<p>“Oh? Elen’s party is sure taking this seriously. They didn’t hit any trapdoors, and they’re dodging the traps I set up as well. And they already looted three treasure chests? They’re having a pretty smooth time so far.”</p>
<p>“…Eh-heh-heh!”</p>
<p><em>Um? What’s so funny?</em> Why are they having such a smooth time of it? And something about Ramiris hiding her reaction with a laugh rubbed me the wrong way.</p>
<p>“…Uh, Ramiris?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes? What is it?”</p>
<p>“I trust in you, okay? I know you wouldn’t hide anything from me.”</p>
<p>“Of—of course not, Rimuru!”</p>
<p>“So let me ask: Did you do something to Elen’s group?”</p>
<p>Nothing looked amiss on-screen, but they were performing a little <a id="page-263"></a><em>too</em> well. As one would expect in a dungeon, many of the treasure chests throughout contained nothing of value—but Elen’s party picked three chests in a row with killer loot. It stank of cheating.</p>
<p>“Well, actually…”</p>
<p>Not <em>that</em> again.</p>
<p>“What did you do?”</p>
<p>“Oh, um, well, Elen and her group gave me a nice little gift, so we really hit it off, you could say! So then—”</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>The more I heard, the worse my headache got.</p>
<p>In the midst of labyrinth construction, Elen had given Ramiris a large number of cakes. These were baked by Mr. Yoshida, so I’m sure they were all delicious. Elen had made similar overtures to the dryads as well, and bit by bit, she had gleaned information from them about the first floor. Ramiris realized this after a while, but as she put it, the magic of those pastries was simply irresistible.</p>
<p>“I mean, what could I do?! I didn’t see it as a problem! And Master Veldora and Milim didn’t, either!”</p>
<p>Now she was firing back at me, trying to portray her actions as totally justifiable. But it was straight-up bribery. I was exasperated at how quickly corruption had become an issue down there.</p>
<p>Still, no need to catastrophize about it. I had adjusted the labyrinth today to skew easier difficulty-wise. Plus, only the first floor had been exposed to her. The treasure chests with the <em>real</em> top-shelf prizes weren’t on that level.</p>
<p>“Kabal’s party is doing a good job landing treasure, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“That it is,” Mjöllmile told Soka, joining her in the announcer’s role. “Sir Rimuru mentioned that chests can sometimes be found in small side rooms and the like, but they need to watch for traps as well.”</p>
<p>“Good point! Do you think there are neat items in them?”</p>
<p>“There’s some really good stuff in the lower levels, I would imagine… And speaking of which, I understand there are three types of treasure chests in all—gold, silver, and bronze. It seems only the bronze chests run the chance of being booby-trapped.”</p>
<p>These three chest types contained different sets of items. Floor <a id="page-264"></a>1 contained nothing but bronze chests. Silver chests could contain items up to the Special level of rarity, but most of them were seeded with potions, silver coins, and other useful stuff. This included some of the lesser-quality swords forged by Kurobe, only ranking a Normal in quality. Overall, nothing that would really cost us much if someone was gunning for them.</p>
<p>“But it’s the gold chests you really want, I suppose,” Soka said.</p>
<p>“Quite so,” agreed Mjöllmile, reading from some notes I’d given him earlier. “And apparently, those only show up on floor numbers that are a multiple of ten—the boss chambers, in other words.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>“Well, as all of you know, Sir Bovix has been appointed the guardian of Floor 50. In much the same way, we have other guardians, or ‘boss monsters,’ positioned in chambers in front of the exit stairway in Floors 40, 30, 20, and 10. The gold chests are only for those adventurers who can defeat such formidable foes, and they could even contain Rare-level weapons and armor!”</p>
<p>This was meant to be an advertising event, so I didn’t want opportunities like this one to go to waste. The script here was admittedly kind of trite, like a late-night infomercial, appealing to people’s greed with such refreshing alacrity that I was almost ashamed to be one of the writers. But it worked like a charm. The mention of Rare weapons sent a clamor across the audience.</p>
<p>“I imagine most people here got to see Bovix’s strength for themselves. He is the kind of powerhouse challengers have waiting for them in here, so if anyone thinks they’ve got the muscle for it, I’d love to see them challenge this labyrinth!”</p>
<p>“That’s right! And one more thing: As you can see on this screen, each floor is very large in size. I imagine you’d need to clear out several days if you wanted to fully conquer the Dungeon, huh?”</p>
<p>That was our basic setup—Soka asking leading questions, Mjöllmile answering them. The classic “play-by-play” and “color commentary” setup, and they were doing pretty well as partners.</p>
<p>Like I said before, Floor 1 had only bronze chests.</p>
<p>“…You didn’t mess around with the contents of the chests, did you?” I asked Ramiris.</p>
<p><a id="page-265"></a>“All good there!”</p>
<p>Ah, all right. I didn’t appreciate Elen gaming the system like this, but her party was advancing the “right” way, and it made for perfect advertising. I suppose she earned whatever she picked up down there today. Giving her a map and list of trap locations was a blatant rule violation, but I’d overlook it this time.</p>
<p class="space-break">So I knew Elen’s party was safe. What about Masayuki, whom I’d given my own set of hints?</p>
<p>“And look at this! They’ve already made their way to Floor 4! What speed! We’re definitely seeing ‘Lightspeed’ at their quickest today, folks!”</p>
<p><em>Pfffthhh!!</em></p>
<p><em>Why, man?! It hasn’t even been thirty minutes since we began!</em> Why was he already down to the fourth level?!</p>
<p>Masayuki’s party had hit virtually every trapdoor so far, as if aiming for them, which gave them a head start to the lower levels. And the crowd…</p>
<p>“Ma! Sa! Yu! Ki! <em>Masayukiiiiii!!</em>”</p>
<p>…I didn’t even need to look at them, really. Even audience members who laughed at Basson blundering into a trapdoor sang Masayuki’s praises whenever he found one. It was incredibly unfair, but that was just Masayuki’s power doing its thing. He was probably resenting me right now, given that the info I’d leaked to him was less than fully reliable. Sorry, man. It wasn’t my fault, not that that was an excuse.</p>
<p>By Floor 4, they’d start to see monsters patrolling the corridors. I was sure my map wasn’t looking too reliable at this point, what with those fearsome trapdoors at random locations, but I still prayed they’d do their best with the situation.</p>
<p class="space-break">That just left Gaiye, and he was using his physical gifts to rush through the labyrinth, Delta flying at full speed to keep up.</p>
<p>Being a demi-spiritual being, Delta could “teleport” herself using whatever nearby plant life there was—but doing that would cut off the video she was telecasting, so she was frantically chasing after <a id="page-266"></a>Gaiye instead, I suppose. It was an impressive effort, and I was glad to see her so devoted to her post.</p>
<p>Gaiye, of course, paid her no mind, proceeding along at his own pace. Judging by how he wasn’t getting lost at all on his way to the stairways, I was guessing he had some kind of magical positioning system activated.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>Understood. This is the elemental magic spell Automap.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">Aha. You wouldn’t need a map at all, then, huh?</p>
<p>This magic flashed pinpoint positional data into your brain, sort of like what the Great Sage used to provide me. If Gaiye was keeping it constantly activated, he must’ve been well versed in magic, too, not just swords. Pretty gifted in both as well, I’d say.</p>
<p>Upon reaching out to Fuze, I learned that Gaiye was indeed an A-ranked adventurer, a very rare breed. Based on his performance, I’d call that more than fair. He was on Floor 2 right now but would be reaching the next stairway down shortly. If he kept up this pace, he should make it to Floor 5 in the two hours or so remaining. This was <em>much</em> faster than I envisioned; I didn’t see this speed coming at all.</p>
<p>But something caught my attention. There was something sparkling within Gaiye’s eyes—something unusual. His lips were twisted downward, his eyes bloodshot—and even when he hit Floor 3, he kept up his blazing speed. Unlike the first two floors, however, he started ducking into side rooms, checking them for treasure chests…or, really, just raiding the chests without hesitation, like he knew where they were all along. Strictly silver chests, too.</p>
<p>“Uh… How’s he doing that?” I grumbled. Raphael had no response, so not even he knew.</p>
<p>“I feel like that adventurer Gaiye’s got this intense greed pushing him forward, y’know? Like his nose can smell out where the gold is.”</p>
<p>Ramiris’s appraisal was a tad vague, but I think I might understand what she was getting at. It was clear there was nothing normal about Gaiye, between this and the gruesome treatment he gave Mjöllmile. <a id="page-267"></a><em>Hopefully</em>, I reasoned as I watched him sprint forward, <em>I won’t have to get involved with him much.</em></p>

<p class="tx1">We were now two hours in, and Basson’s party had just found another hidden room.</p>
<p>“Basson! There’s another chamber in here!”</p>
<p>A fellow party member happened upon the latch for the door.</p>
<p>“Not another trap, is it?” a doubtful Basson asked.</p>
<p>The adventurers had been stymied by a paralysis-poison trap I’d laid for them, as well as a treasure chest loaded with sleeping gas. They even got accosted by one of the weaker mimics in the labyrinth, so now they were eyeing every chest with caution.</p>
<p>“Hey, Ramiris, which chest was in that chamber? I’d really like them to find something good soon. It makes for bad advertising otherwise, and I’m kinda starting to feel sorry for them…”</p>
<p>Seeing them bumble around reminded me of my days of buying ten loot crates in a mobile game and getting nothing but crap from them. After all this failure, they just seemed pitiful to me. They’d never come back if they completely lost their drive to continue, so I wanted them to land <em>something</em> pretty soon.</p>
<p>“Um, n-no worries there. It’s just, y’know, that challenger’s party is really awful. Not that I’m one to talk, but I didn’t expect anyone to be <em>this</em> reckless. But that chamber’s got one monster and one silver chest. I don’t remember what’s inside, but it’ll definitely be worth the trouble this time!”</p>
<p>Great. Today, at least, I wanted something good to come their way—</p>
<p>“Whoa, boss, it’s a trap! There’s a monster!”</p>
<p>“Geh. Wanna fall back?”</p>
<p>“We can’t, Basson. He’s already locked on to us!”</p>
<p>“A giant bear?! Yeah, no running from that…”</p>
<p>Both sides began to size each other up, gauging their first move. I…was concerned. Why would the simple presence of a monster <a id="page-268"></a>spook them so much? No, you didn’t see creatures like this on Floor 1, and Floor 2 had nothing too powerful on it. But this hidden chamber had a silver chest with a fairly decent item inside, so we’d just placed a monster in there to protect it. Ramiris was right—this hidden room housed the best prize of the entire floor, and the giant bear guarding it was a C-ranked monster. Basson’s team was rated B; this would be easy pickings for them…and yet, the sight of that beast scared the pants off Basson and Gomez.</p>
<p>“Basson, I see a treasure chest on the other side!”</p>
<p>“And it’s silver…”</p>
<p>“It might be a trap, but we gotta do it. Brace yourselves, people!”</p>
<p>“Let’s go!”</p>
<p>Now the party of six was finally ready to fight, gripping their weapons tightly as they stared the bear down.</p>
<p>“I’ll distract it. You guys catch it off guard!”</p>
<p>Basson, as leader, intended to play the advance-guard role. The moment he jumped into the room, he let out a roar, drawing the bear’s attention. The two of them faced off.</p>
<p>“Whoa, Basson’s party has started fighting a monster! Is that a giant bear they’re up against? Those enormous claws could easily take your life with one swipe, it’s said!”</p>
<p>Soka’s commentary made me realize how wrong I was. Ah yes—this <em>wasn’t</em> a game. Basson’s party wasn’t proving it too well today, but they were professional adventurers, and they didn’t like getting hurt. The stakes dictated that one wrong move could end your life, so naturally, they wanted to avoid any combat that didn’t suitably reward them. I told everyone that dying in here was perfectly safe, but it looked like that’d take a while to sink in.</p>
<p>Maybe I needed to reconsider the pitch I was making with this labyrinth…</p>
<p>And then battle began. Basson was up in front, fending off the giant bear’s attack. His face was taut. He had gone with a set of hard leather armor today, which left his arms and sides undefended—no wonder even a lower-level foe was making him sweat. The swipes from his ax were heavy and punishing, no doubt, but they didn’t <a id="page-269"></a>offer good defense against a clawed foe. Instead, he was deftly using his circular shield to push the giant bear’s arms away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his companions were offering him support, focused on staying safe as they aimed for the enemy’s eyes and footing with their barrage of attacks. It was Gomez the sorcerer who struck the final blow, however, with a Windcutter attack that hit home.</p>
<p>“And the curtain has closed on their battle with the giant bear! That was quite a battle, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“That it was. Truly a textbook approach—not going in too far at any time. These are true veterans of the craft at work.”</p>
<p>I listened to Soka and Mjöllmile’s banter as I thought over the fight. The party <em>had</em> worked well together. They’d wrapped up that battle successfully in around five minutes, with nobody hurt on their side. To me, though, this was a serious problem. My head started to hurt again.</p>
<p>“Guys, this was a fight they would’ve dominated from the start. Why were they being so damn <em>careful</em> with it…?”</p>
<p>“…Yes, I’m a tad surprised as well. But that’s the normal approach, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I guess so. I was worried when I saw they weren’t drawing a map, but I guess their approach to this is just too far removed from what we pictured.”</p>
<p>“Right, right. It might take some people three days or so just to wrap up Floor 1…”</p>
<p>“Hmm… In which case, maybe we better start thinking about supplying food or something…”</p>
<p>Man. I sure wasn’t expecting our plans to go awry like <em>this</em>. Basson’s party had adventurers of assorted ranks, but as a team, they were equivalent to a B. With the right equipment, I figured Basson and Gomez could both merit a B by themselves. The sight of a party of six experiencing so much trouble on Floor 2 was beyond unexpected. They were the clear victors of that battle, but five minutes? That was too long. Yeah, their emphasis on safety was probably the mark of professionals…but maybe they should focus more on healing injuries with potions and learning how to fight a little more efficiently.</p>
<p><a id="page-270"></a>As I fretted about this, the party approached the treasure chest.</p>
<p>“Looks like there’s a treasure chest in the room. And that color’s silver, isn’t it? What could we find inside…?”</p>
<p>Soka’s buildup filled the audience chamber with tension. Other parties had opened many chests by now, but it seemed like the crowd couldn’t get enough of that moment when the chest swung open.</p>
<p>One of Basson’s party members popped open the top. <em>Eesh, at least</em> try <em>to be on the lookout for traps, guys!</em> There weren’t any on silver chests, but they wouldn’t know that… They already had a dose of paralysis-poison earlier, along with sleeping gas before that. Now the party was taking turns picking someone to open chests, like it was a kind of punishment. It was so low-level, it scared me to look at them. For someone like me, used to the unwritten rules of video games, it was complete amateur hour. People here might not be used to uncovering chests in the middle of huge mazes…but was that why they were being so thoughtless about opening them?</p>
<p>Along those lines, Elen’s party was looking far more sensible. They had Gido with them, so up to now, they had managed to raid the chests without getting caught in any traps. Not having a thief-type specialist in his party might be a problem for Basson. Hunter-type adventurers who made most of their coin from bodyguard work might not be used to situations like this. It’d be best for them to bring on a dedicated explorer or just expand the size of their party.</p>
<p>But… Hang on. Maybe the labyrinth really <em>was</em> more difficult than we pictured. I thought Basson’s crew was just kind of low-level, but with nobody here well versed in this kind of dungeon hacking, perhaps things were just going to go slow at first. We’d need to reconsider that later.</p>
<p>“Oh! Ohhhhh! Basson, it’s a sword!!”</p>
<p>Nice! They’d finally drawn a winner—a <em>big</em> winner.</p>
<p>Top prizes for these chests included high-grade potions, ancient gold coins, quality armor, and so on. Starting on Floor 2, you also had a tiny chance at uncovering a Rare-level item, and that was exactly the kind of sword Basson’s team had just found.</p>
<p><a id="page-271"></a>“Oh, actually, Master Veldora said that he adjusted the chests from Floor 2 down to give out more jackpots like that.”</p>
<p>“Did he? Ah. But <em>this</em> party didn’t find anything good until now…”</p>
<p>Veldora saw the problem and addressed it, but with a party <em>this</em> unlucky, it still didn’t help. If he <em>hadn’t</em> fudged the stats a little, Basson would’ve been finding nothing all day. Drawing a Rare item was certainly quite a comeback. It meant good PR for us, and I bet it’d drive Basson’s party to try their luck some more. Thinking about it that way, I had to admit—Veldora did a good job.</p>
<p>“That was a smart decision on Veldora’s part, though. People need to have <em>some</em> positive experiences in here, or else it’ll affect our future strategy.”</p>
<p>I’d have to thank him later.</p>
<p>Basson’s party, meanwhile, was passing the sword around to one another, staring at it and whistling their astonishment. Seemed they liked it.</p>
<p>“Okay, guys,” Basson said as he put his ax away and switched to the sword, “let’s keep this up!”</p>
<p>The next chamber had three lesser bats flitting around, but Basson managed to swipe them all down with one hit. The blade must have helped, because they were starting to move faster. One of Kurobe’s apprentices had crafted that sword, which just barely qualified for Rare status, but to Basson, it must’ve been a legendary piece. The same was true for Gaiye; I heard that even A-ranked pros had difficulty acquiring a full set of Rare equipment. If so, no wonder Basson was so excited.</p>
<p>The party was now proceeding more quickly, making up for lost time and accumulating a large number of magic crystals from the monsters they slew.</p>
<p>“This is nice. We’re definitely comin’ out ahead. I think we’ll earn a lot more than I thought before the day’s through!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I definitely want to pay another visit here once it’s fully open!”</p>
<p>Now the party was all smiles as they ventured farther into the Dungeon.</p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-272"></a>I turned my attention to Elen’s group.</p>
<p>Since they were on Floor 1, they’d have trouble finding any Rare items. They were being very cautious as they proceeded—too much so, really—but the approach paid off with all the chests they got to raid.</p>
<p>Now, though, they were suddenly switching tactics.</p>
<p>“Are we about ready?”</p>
<p>“You’re really going to do this?”</p>
<p>“Um… Do I get a voice in this…?”</p>
<p>“Here we go! Time to hook some big fish!”</p>
<p>Completely ignoring Kabal, Elen began to head for the lower levels. They had just under an hour to go, and I guess they chose this moment to go for broke. It looked like they’d focused on Floor 1 so much up to now because they were trying to gather as many potions as they could. Now it was time to make use of Ramiris’s info and attempt to get all the way down to Floor 10.</p>
<p>“It looks like Kabal’s party is on the move. They’ve been thorough in their work so far, proceeding bit by bit, but now they’re making a beeline for deeper floors.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… Are they looking for treasure chests with larger payoffs? But it’ll be hard to discover chests out of sheer luck…”</p>
<p>“But it looks like you can find Rare items from silver chests, like Basson’s party did earlier, right?”</p>
<p>“Right, but it’s not something you can aim for, really. Sir Gaiye has opened something like twenty silver chests so far, but he still hasn’t scored any Rares.”</p>
<p>“So they’ll need to look for gold chests to be guaranteed Rare items?”</p>
<p>“That’s correct. But they’ll only find gold chests in the designated boss-monster chambers, mostly.”</p>
<p>“Mostly? Are they anywhere else?”</p>
<p>“Well… Actually, there are other powerful creatures in the labyrinth that you may run into at random. These are called ‘area bosses,’ and the rooms they guard could contain golden chests.”</p>
<p>Soka’s and Mjöllmile’s guidance convinced me of what Elen was after.</p>
<p><a id="page-273"></a>“Hey, Ramiris?”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Did you leak out the locations of the area bosses as well?”</p>
<p>“Well, um…”</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“…?! I—I think such a thing might have been included, yes!”</p>
<p><em>Oh lord.</em></p>
<p>But—hey, let’s stay optimistic. These area bosses, something I included mainly for fun, could also be good PR for us—and I knew I laid one out in Floor 4. Its position changes whenever it’s defeated, but those guys should still be where I left them…</p>
<p>Essentially, this floor housed a small monster lair inhabited by several giant bats, each ranked C-plus. If you weren’t aware of them, you’d have to face a torrent of monsters all at once, but if Elen’s party saw them coming, I suppose they could prepare for it well enough. I just didn’t want it to look like they knew in advance there was something in that lair—that’d seem a little too contrived.</p>
<p>But I had nothing to worry about. Elen’s party deliberately used trapdoors to go down to Floor 5, pretended to be injured so they could advertise the effects of potions for me, and claimed loudly to be searching for somewhere to rest all the way to the monster lair. The perfect act from start to finish. They had futures in the theater, I tell you.</p>
<p>“Guys, there’s a small chamber around the corner. Let’s rest in there.”</p>
<p>“All righty! Are you okay, Kabal?”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah. Boy! That potion worked like a charm. I feel absolutely fine, but let’s rest a little bit before we start farming some more.”</p>
<p>Kabal’s delivery was a touch wooden, but nobody noticed. The eyes of everyone in the audience were on the big screen as Gido opened the door.</p>
<p>“Whoa-ho-ho! Giant bats!!”</p>
<p>“Stay calm! Kabal, you’re on!”</p>
<p>“…I don’t want them sucking my blood, but…”</p>
<p>Despite Kabal’s reluctance, he hefted up his Scale Shield, hiding <a id="page-274"></a>behind it as he faced the full brunt of the bats’ attack. It looked like a tricky situation at first glance, but Kabal was cool as a cucumber. The giant bats had no way of cutting through a shield that durable, so he shrugged off their strikes without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>As he distracted them, Elen completed her magic spell.</p>
<p>“Here we go! <em>Icicle Shot!!</em>”</p>
<p>A flurry of small, sharpened shards of ice flew at the bats. In a room this small, they had nowhere to flee. With her magic amplified by her Dryad’s Staff, Elen’s blast of ice tore the entire flock of bats to shreds.</p>
<p>“Hmm… Too easy, by the looks of things.”</p>
<p>“You may be right. If this were Basson’s party, I bet it’d be a life-and-death struggle…”</p>
<p>“I feel like giving out a gold chest for this is costing us.”</p>
<p>“Maybe, but let’s not use Elen’s party as our yardstick for this, hmm?”</p>
<p>Ramiris had a good point. Plus, if you think about it, this went easy for Elen only because she cheated; she wouldn’t get this advantage normally. If she had run herself ragged all around the labyrinth before finally discovering a gold box, I’d be happy to toast her good fortune then.</p>
<p>“That was a fine battle, wasn’t it?” Soka asked Mjöllmile on mic.</p>
<p>“Yes, this is definitely a well-seasoned team of adventurers. They certainly made it look easy. Ah, and here’s Sir Gido opening a treasure chest…”</p>
<p>“Ooooh! A gold chest! Are we really going to see a Rare item come out?!”</p>
<p>I focused in on Gido’s hands. He was guaranteed a Rare, but exactly what, I couldn’t guess.</p>
<p>“Looks like a sword…”</p>
<p>“Awww, I wanted some sorcerer’s armor!”</p>
<p>“A sword?! Sweet! Someone up high must be watching how hard I’m working!”</p>
<p>Three people, three reactions. Gido couldn’t care less, Elen was <a id="page-275"></a>pouting, and Kabal showed his first real enthusiasm of the day. The sheer across-the-board variety made me laugh.</p>
<p>“…And it looks like a weapon, Mjöllmile!”</p>
<p>“Ahhh, I’m sure it is. The demon lord Rimuru has given me word that every gold chest is guaranteed to house an excellent item inside.”</p>
<p>I didn’t remember saying that, but I was glad Mjöllmile was kind enough to hype it up for me.</p>
<p>This chest contained a Tempest Sword—everyone thought it was a Rare, but it was actually a Unique. Like the Tempest Dagger I’d given Gido, it was a masterpiece of a weapon, forged by Kurobe from Charybdis scales. Veldora had made “jackpot” finds like this more common for today, and maybe that’s why Elen’s party scored a killer item that usually showed up just 1 percent of the time.</p>
<p>Then, their mission done for the day, the party promptly prepared to head back. Talk about a cold, calculated approach, huh? I dunno.</p>
<p>“We kind of lavished <em>too</em> much on them,” I said as I laughed at their indomitable drive for riches, “but ah well.”</p>
<p class="space-break">How were Masayuki’s team and Gaiye doing?</p>
<p>Both were drilling deeper and deeper down, as if in a footrace, but it was clear who had the advantage. Masayuki’s party was overwhelmingly ahead, already at the ninth floor by the time two hours passed by.</p>
<p>“They’re just way too fast…”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry! I didn’t think challengers would use trapdoors that way.”</p>
<p>“Ahhh, I doubt Masayuki is deliberately aiming for them, but…”</p>
<p>Even as Ramiris and I spoke, the party tore their way across Floor 9. With over fifty minutes left to go, they reached Floor 10—and thanks to yet another conveniently placed trapdoor, they managed to get deep inside, right nearby the boss chamber. Masayuki’s good luck again, no doubt.</p>
<p><a id="page-276"></a>“I never would’ve guessed they’d go this far in under three hours…”</p>
<p>Their speed just totally floored me.</p>
<p>By this point in the labyrinth, you’d start to encounter monsters in the middle of corridors as well, not just in rooms. Sometimes they’d appear in small groups, too—but Masayuki’s friends did an impressive job against them. Nearly all their foes fell with one hit; at no time were they ever endangered. And since my map was accurate except for the trapdoors, they were still checking it to figure out the way ahead.</p>
<p>Finally, the party reached the last chamber in the floor. The stairs to Floor 11 would appear only once they defeated the boss lurking inside—a black spider, ranked a B in difficulty.</p>
<p>The party cowered against this fearsome sight…</p>
<p><em>“Yahhh!”</em></p>
<p>…and Jinrai then slashed it to death in one swipe.</p>
<p>Damn. <em>That</em> was frustrating. Against Team Masayuki, a black spider didn’t even begin to pose a challenge. If it weren’t for all those damn trapdoors, at least they would’ve had to spend more time getting here…</p>
<p>Thus the party picked up their gold treasure chest, grabbing a Rare-level dagger from it. That, and they even added their names to the floor’s save point. I decided, right then and there, to just do away with all the trapdoors.</p>
<p class="space-break">Once the boss was slain, Masayuki’s group used their return whistle to head back to the surface, making them the second group to emerge after Elen’s.</p>
<p>Just when the party exited the boss chamber, the door leading to it opened again.</p>
<p>“Masayuki’s party is back with us, but now Sir Gaiye is going to challenge the boss!”</p>
<p>“Gaiye has traversed this far into the labyrinth all by himself. No traps or pitfalls have caught him yet, and he’s been going at a breathtaking clip the whole time.”</p>
<p>“Yes, at the speed he’s going, he’s racing past trapdoors before <a id="page-277"></a>they can even open. That’s an unexpected approach to take! I don’t think most people could copy it.”</p>
<p>The adventurer types in the audience nodded in agreement with Mjöllmile. Going solo was one thing, but a multimember team could never pull a trick like that. Gaiye didn’t have the greatest of personalities, but he was every bit worthy of the A rank he was rewarded. He had run into no problems in these early floors, taking every measure available to score as many silver chests as possible. He was about the worst beta tester I could’ve picked, but I couldn’t do much about that now.</p>
<p>“Pffft. That piece-of-garbage swordsman beat me here, eh? Oh well. Bring back that boss for me!”</p>
<p>Gaiye wasted no time copping an attitude. It was grating, but I was mature enough to put up with it.</p>
<p>“So what happens at a time like this, Mjöllmile?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m told that the boss is resurrected in approximately thirty minutes.”</p>
<p>“And the gold treasure chest with it?”</p>
<p>“That’s what I understand, yes. Otherwise, Sir Rimuru was concerned people would start fighting each other for the right to tackle a boss.”</p>
<p>“I see, I see. In that case, I’m afraid Gaiye may not have enough time…”</p>
<p>“No, there’s not much time left. I imagine that’ll be the end of this run for him.”</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes remained out of the three hours allotted. Gaiye, once the situation was explained to him, did not take it well.</p>
<p>“Are you <em>kidding</em> me?! You think you can boss me around in here? I know how talentless all you people are, but I don’t see why I need to stoop down to <em>your</em> level! Get this boss back here now!”</p>
<p>The greed was visible in his eyes as the self-centered vitriol continued. Delta took it all in stride, but the next thing Gaiye said changed matters for her.</p>
<p>“Hmph! The master of a talentless fool is a talentless fool. There’s no need at all for me to abide by the rules of you buffoons!”</p>
<p>Oops. Shouldn’t have said that. That’s all but declaring to the <a id="page-278"></a>master of the labyrinth that you aren’t gonna play by her laws. Gaiye’s shouting wasn’t going to change anything, but was the master going to ignore that insult?</p>
<p>Doubtful.</p>
<p>“Your statement clearly violates the regulations set by us,” Delta calmly stated. “I will let this go if you apologize, but I will not allow any more abusive language.”</p>
<p>Gaiye snorted at her. “What? Why’s a guide like you think you’re so far above me? Don’t make me laugh!”</p>
<p>“Clear rule violation confirmed. Executing punishment.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Punishment? What could you ever do to—?”</p>
<p>At the next moment, Gaiye’s body was bound and lifted into the air by vines that sprang up from the floor around him.</p>
<p>“…Wha—?!”</p>
<p>“I have removed the pain suppressor feature on your Resurrection Bracelet. Do you feel like apologizing yet?”</p>
<p>Small thorns shot out from the vines, piercing into the slits between his armor’s plating. The results were painful for him. This was the spirit magic Thornbind, and Delta was able to launch it with zero spell-casting delay.</p>
<p>“D-damn you! You think that’s all it takes to beat me?”</p>
<p>“This is your final warning. Do you have any interest in apologizing?”</p>
<p>“The hell I do! This level of magic could never—”</p>
<p>His shouting was cut off mid-sentence, as Delta used her slender hands to slice Gaiye’s head off.</p>
<p>He had chosen the wrong person to pick a fight with today. Yes, he was an A-ranked adventurer, but Delta was a dryad. Even without battle experience, her species had instincts that made her a threat beyond Hazard level. Once she was a bit more well versed, she’d be at the Calamity tier with Treyni and the others. Someone like Gaiye had no chance.</p>
<p>The sight of Gaiye, who had wowed in the battle tournament, getting destroyed by the gentle-looking Delta made the crowd audibly gasp. The Flowing Swordsman may’ve thought he was <a id="page-279"></a>strong, but he was killed in an instant, unable to defend himself. Seeing that projected on such a large screen would scare the crap out of anyone.</p>
<p>“Ah yes,” Mjöllmile said in hushed tones. “In the labyrinth, the words of the maze master essentially serve as the law. Ignore her rules, and the managers will deliver a swift punishment like the one you saw just now.”</p>
<p>As he put it, if you followed the rules, you were perfectly safe.</p>
<p>“That, um, that’s pretty scary. So what happens to Gaiye, then?”</p>
<p>“Nothing at all, actually. He <em>will</em> be stripped of the items he’d acquired in this trip into the labyrinth, but otherwise, he is alive and well… Although without the pain suppression feature on his Resurrection Bracelet, I imagine it’s a rather grueling experience for him at the moment.”</p>
<p>There was no real punishment, you could say. All it meant was a reset back to what you were before venturing inside, and nothing else. Serious rule infractions might require us to ban you from the Dungeon entirely…but we planned to discuss that once we saw how things went.</p>
<p>“Ah! Gaiye’s now out from the labyrinth—but unlike you, Mjöllmile, it appears he’s unconscious.”</p>
<p>Immediately after the decapitation, Gaiye dissolved into particles of light and was resurrected at the surface—still knocked out. That’s because Delta exercised her right to restrict the functionality of his Resurrection Bracelet, a sort of nuanced way to mete out extra punishment. He was safe and unhurt, but his body would need some time to recover from the shock of “dying.”</p>
<p>Between his mistreatment of Mjöllmile and outright contempt for Delta, Gaiye was proving to be one of the most distasteful people I’d ever met. Seeing him like this was, to say the least, gratifying. Hopefully, he learned his lesson a little.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Mjöllmile continued, “as long as participants follow the rules, the Resurrection Bracelet always works perfectly. But as all of you saw, Sir Gaiye was deliberately flaunting regulations, so… The labyrinth has a number of rules for visitors to follow—for example, <a id="page-280"></a>no conflicts among adventurers, and always follow the advice of the maze’s managers. We plan to distribute a book of rules once normal operation begins, and our guides will also provide rule rundowns to those adventurers who can’t read. We’ll want all of you to follow the rules and behave well inside, lest you meet the same fate Sir Gaiye just did.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I could imagine Gaiye might be a little disappointed about this result, but during normal operation, all you have to do is wait a short period of time, and the boss will reappear! It’s against the rules to fight other adventurers, so it’s important to wait your turn and conquer this Dungeon the <em>right</em> way!”</p>
<p>Soka used a melodious tone of voice to run all of this down. What’s “<em>the right way</em>” mean here? She didn’t specify. I thought the crowd felt kind of awkward about this, but Soka’s follow-up largely steamrolled over all of that.</p>
<p>As she went on, Gaiye woke up again…then reeled back in shock, remembering what had happened to him. Seeing him recovered (if intensely frustrated) helped calm the crowd down a great deal.</p>
<p class="space-break">Well, good.</p>
<p>It seemed like the crowd had accepted Mjöllmile’s explanations for everything. He may have been a total prick, but the things we learned observing Gaiye were quite useful. If we could work out how to deal with high-level adventurers sprinting down just to raid treasure chests, hopefully we could avoid losing a mint on this. That, and everybody <em>certainly</em> knew how the rules worked now.</p>
<p>All in all, I’d say Gaiye’s journey proved pretty satisfactory for all of us.</p>

<p class="tx1">Thus, each team wrapped up their runs, leaving only Basson’s party inside. They had about ten minutes left, so I’d want them to wrap up shortly.</p>
<p>As I thought about that, one of Basson’s companions screamed loudly and fell to the ground in the corridor. Someone in the <a id="page-281"></a>adjacent room must’ve gotten him; he was alive, but there was an arrow straight through his right eye.</p>
<p>See? I <em>told</em> you going in all careless like that was dangerous.</p>
<p>There was a single skeleton inside this chamber, wielding a bow and taking potshots at anyone through the door. The second party member through the archway was rewarded with a bolt between the eyes; he fell as well, but unlike Gaiye, he disappeared into light particles after ten seconds. Nice. We’d have at least one challenger experience death before time expired, then.</p>
<p>The remaining four party members made quick work of the skeleton.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, look at this!” Soka said, talking quickly. “We haven’t had anyone drop out yet, but that skeleton has just claimed two victims! But don’t worry, because the deceased will be revived shortly back at the surface!”</p>
<p>The audience was riveted by the you-are-there viewpoint they had of the battle. Having it shown on such a huge screen like that really did make it feel like you were exploring the labyrinth with them. I heard screams here and there whenever a monster appeared, which I thought was a pretty cool reaction. Maybe it was like watching a horror film; people started shouting their heads off when that party member died, too.</p>
<p>Maybe staging viewing events of the action inside the labyrinth would be a fun idea. We’d work this out with the participating adventurers in advance, of course; we couldn’t get away with showcasing their exploits without permission. Really, today was helping me come up with all kinds of little ideas.</p>
<p>For now, though, time was almost up. This offered a nice taste of the show to everyone, I thought.</p>
<p>Basson’s party helped keep things tense throughout; in the end, they were pretty good challengers, actually. They may’ve dissed Masayuki and crowed about “<em>ripping the facade</em>” off the labyrinth and accused me of running a con job, but once they were in, they forgot about all of that and focused on their task. Now they were shedding tears and wailing the names of their fallen comrades. Not only did they have the wrong impression, they clearly weren’t the <a id="page-282"></a>kind of people who listened to anything they were told. As beta testers, they were tremendously helpful.</p>
<p>“All right, everyone, it’s just about time to return to the surface.”</p>
<p>Alpha, the guide for Basson’s party, interrupted their mourning in her matter-of-fact voice. Basson looked livid at her for a moment, but Alpha ignored him and forced their return whistles to activate.</p>
<p>“Goddamn you!” Basson protested—but he swallowed his words back on the surface.</p>
<p>“Oh, hey, Basson. I guess I actually got resurrected.”</p>
<p>Being greeted by his alive (and very confused) companion made Basson’s anger vanish.</p>
<p>“Whoa! Awesome!! You really came back to life?!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I thought I was done for, but it didn’t hurt near as much as I thought, and now I’m back to normal.”</p>
<p>“Man, are you serious? ’Cause if so, this is just amazing. There’s so few people out there who can cast resurrection magic, and this bracelet does it all for us?!”</p>
<p>The group chattered on some more as they celebrated their revived companion.</p>
<p>“Ugh, dammit, my eye…”</p>
<p>“How about we use this?”</p>
<p>The man with his eye shot out had it all fixed up with a dose of potion.</p>
<p>“This is crazy. For people like us, you know, our bodies are our main asset. So having this sort of setup is like a dream.”</p>
<p>“Wow, so it’s true?! Man, we can <em>really</em> go all-out next time!”</p>
<p><em>You</em> were <em>going all-out, man. I don’t think I saw you check for traps once all day. Once they get nastier on later floors, you’re goners.</em></p>
<p>I could criticize their style all day, but I stayed mum for now. The key thing was how the crowd reacted, and after seeing how Basson’s party fared start to finish, I think they understood how safe the Dungeon was.</p>
<p>As an advertising stunt, I’d call today a success.</p>
<p class="space-break">The challengers were all lined up onstage now. I headed up as well, standing in front of them, to offer some closing remarks.</p>
<p><a id="page-283"></a>“So what did you all think?” I asked, mic in hand. “Did you have fun today? Our Dungeon will be officially opening to the public in just a few more days. I guarantee to all of you that it’s perfectly safe, so if you’re interested, go ahead and give it a try for yourself. And if any of you can conquer the hundredth floor on the bottom, I will grant you the right to challenge me to battle!!”</p>
<p>With that, the event was over—and my instincts told me we kicked ass. The tournament final was exciting enough, but viewing these test runs into the labyrinth really did make it seem like you were there. It was a great way to round out the show.</p>
<p class="space-break">Of course, it would’ve been perfect if the show actually ended then. But:</p>
<p>(Rimuru, what is the matter? I have yet to see any challengers. How long do I have to wait?)</p>
<p>Veldora, lord of the labyrinth, sent me a Thought Communication that clearly indicated he hadn’t listened to a word I said. <em>Way to ruin the moment, man.</em></p>
<p>(Shut up! How many times do I have to tell you?! Listen to me: You’re not gonna see anyone good enough to make it to the bottom for a while!)</p>
<p>(Wh-what?! That was <em>not</em> how I understood it!)</p>
<p>(Then you understood it wrong, dumbass! Why don’t you try actually listening to me?!)</p>
<p>We argued about this for a little while afterward. You know how you sometimes see kids get yelled at during a fair or festival, because they get too worked up and all that? It’s so regrettably common—so this time, I lectured Veldora until I was <em>damn</em> sure he was sorry.</p>
