<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter035">AFTER THE FESTIVAL</a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page-287"></a>It was the final night of the festival, and to cap it all off, we held a massive banquet. Shuna and Mr. Yoshida worked on full overdrive, sparing no expense to provide the best dinner spread yet. We wanted to leave a good impression at all costs.</p>
<p>Here, I started noticing more nobles chatting and laughing with one another. They must’ve made friends over the past three days, and the mood overall was much more convivial than the first night.</p>
<p>Right now, I knew that Veldora, Ramiris, and Milim were enjoying a fun night in the labyrinth, alongside Carillon, Frey, and Middray, too. Treyni and the elves were working hard to keep them fed and entertained, and I was planning to join them later, dessert in tow.</p>
<p>Over in town, there were visiting merchants, adventurers, nearby farmers, and residents all enjoying good food and drink together. The bars and restaurants were opened up for free, letting people drink, sing, and carry on all they wanted. Here, too, people were letting their guards down. Monsters, humans—it didn’t seem to matter as the night wore on. There was music, along with singers following the beat and dancers moving to the rhythm.</p>
<p>In a way, it was painful to think that this moment was going to end. It seemed like such a waste, sort of. Starting tomorrow, everyone would be back at their old jobs. The thought depressed <a id="page-288"></a>me—but, at the same time, made all the effort feel worth it. It was strange, and I didn’t think I was the only one experiencing it, but everyone still looked like they were having fun.</p>
<p>That, I suppose, is what happiness is. And watching all the happy scenes, I hoped that this peace could last for a long time to come.</p>
<p class="space-break">And so the night wore on…</p>

<p class="tx1">All too cruelly, the festival came to an end.</p>
<p>The highways had been full of people heading back home since morning. The security team, led by Rigur in place of Gobta, had been busy since before sunrise.</p>
<p>“I bet you wanted to sleep past noon the day after this festival, huh?”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! You can’t work security if you let the drink consume you, not the other way around!”</p>
<p>Rigur was serious about his job. No wonder he was Rigurd’s kid. If this was Gobta, I was sure he’d go right up to me and say, “Boy, don’tcha just want to sleep past noon the day after a festival?” I was in full agreement with that, so maybe I would’ve spoiled them a little along those lines, but silence is golden.</p>
<p>Unlike Gobta, after all, Rigur never complained about anything, briskly giving orders to his patrol. Thanks to that, our VIP visitors began their journeys home without major issues. The highways were wide enough, so as long as a wagon didn’t block the road, the waves of people shouldn’t stop. Some even planned to stay in town for a few more days, anticipating the rush back, so I didn’t think we’d have too many complaints.</p>
<p>Leaving the highways under Rigur’s management, I went back to my own work. Today, for starters, I had to pay out those gold coins. Over a hundred merchants were now seated in our main meeting hall, waiting for us. Rigurd and Mjöllmile were maintaining order and explaining matters for me, but it was about time I showed up as <a id="page-289"></a>well. This was going to be a critical moment, and I knew I needed to nail it.</p>
<p class="space-break">Arriving at the meeting hall, I could already hear people arguing from the outside.</p>
<p>“I told you, everybody is going to be paid today, so please stay calm and wait just a bit longer!”</p>
<p>“You think you can trick us like that?”</p>
<p>“I waited for you until the end of the festival. Hurry up and just pay me my due!”</p>
<p>“Whoa, whoa. I certainly understand your concerns, but can you show some deference to us, please?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Are you intending to drag our names through the mud for introducing you to our friend Mjöllmile?”</p>
<p>“No, sir, we’re not. All we want is for what’s owed to us to be rightfully paid…”</p>
<p>“And that’s why I’m telling you to be patient. This nation isn’t going anywhere, and they said they can pay everyone right now in anything besides Dwarven gold coins. Can you help us out a little and hold on until things are cleared up?”</p>
<p>“A likely story!”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Come on—pay up!”</p>
<p>It sounded like some of Mjöllmile’s merchant friends were trying to smooth things over with the tradesmen we owed money to. Maybe this was just how they operated as merchants, but I couldn’t have been happier to see it. It proved that Mjöllmile really <em>was</em> a good judge of character.</p>
<p>“All right, everyone, can we please take a few deep breaths? I, Meusé, representing the Kingdom of Ghastone, am here to tell you that not even a nation of monsters will default on their debts to any of you. Isn’t that right, Mjöllmile?”</p>
<p>That sounded like a big shot. A noble from the Kingdom of Ghastone, one of the commercially active nations ringing Englesia.</p>
<p>“Y-yes, Duke Meusé, you are exactly right! However—”</p>
<p>Hmm. A prince from Ghastone—not a superpower but still decently sized. Any noble with a title like that was no slouch.</p>
<p><a id="page-290"></a>“In that case, I do hope you will put to ease the minds of everyone here and provide payment, following the international regulations of the Council of the West.”</p>
<p>Duke Meusé was a powerful noble, but he was still acting like a gentleman in these negotiations. Mjöllmile was an important person in my government, but for now, he had no official title or noble name. He was still something of a guest, with some temporary power as my representative at times like this. Rigurd, one of my ministers, was also there, but the fact that this prince remembered Mjöllmile’s name and dealt with him personally… It was literally the royal treatment. I mean, a noble remembering a commoner’s name—oftentimes, even if they knew the name (which was frequently not the case), they’d pretend not to. That was how nobility worked, apparently, the way Mjöllmile described it to me, so I bet he’s the most surprised of all right now.</p>
<p>“P-please, Duke Meusé, just one moment. Our initial contract stipulated that payment via customary methods is acceptable. By ‘<em>customary</em>,’ of course…”</p>
<p>“Mjöllmile, I am not here to concern myself with such trifling matters. When working with merchants, and with nations as well, trust is the most important thing. And trust is something created by keeping one’s promises, is it not?”</p>
<p>“You are absolutely right, my prince, but—?!”</p>
<p>“Silence! These people engaged in business with you because they trusted your team. You have no intention of trampling over this trust, do you?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. But we have our own issues to deal with—”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh! I see, I see. So that’s how it is, Mjöllmile? Well, fortunately for you, I’ve got an idea for how to solve those issues. Would we be able to talk in private for a moment? You can take Sir Rigurd there with you.”</p>
<p>…Ah. So that settled it. It was exactly what Elmesia had warned me about. It was like when something I studied until I had it perfectly down showed up on the test—that feeling of total control. It was like I had that inside me.</p>
<p><em>I’m gonna ace this.</em></p>
<p><a id="page-291"></a>“Um, what do you mean?” Mjöllmile continued, making a grand act out of it. Like any veteran merchant, he was both cold-blooded and a born actor. He must’ve realized the same thing I did, but he didn’t let any of it show on his face. I could probably just leave things to him and this problem would be solved, but I didn’t want it that way.</p>
<p>It was time to take action. There was no point eavesdropping forever; I wanted to end this farce sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="space-break">Diablo opened the doors wide. “That will not be necessary,” I said as I walked through them. Behind me was Benimaru, followed by Shion and then Diablo, who quietly closed the door behind us.</p>
<p>“Did you wait long?” Benimaru asked, nodding at the merchants. “You’re being rather loud, you know.”</p>
<p>The merchants looked surprised to see me, my words turning them pale. They must’ve figured I’d stay away and let Rigurd and the others handle matters—but here I was with my staff. I didn’t think they knew what to do next.</p>
<p>“The demon lord Rimuru has entered the building,” Rigurd said, glaring at the merchants. “Bow your heads!”</p>
<p>A few of them stood up and hurriedly bowed. The majority stayed in their seats, giving me funny looks. It figured. If you’re a small-time tradesman, not educated in dealing with nobility, it’s hard to react instantly.</p>
<p>Duke Meusé himself was about to rise, so I spoke up to save him the trouble.</p>
<p>“No need for such formality, Rigurd,” I said with a smile as I looked around the meeting hall. Rigurd nodded and quietly stood aside.</p>
<p>Among the crowd, I saw not only merchants but a few journalists in disguise. I suppose they were going to report this far and wide if we disgraced ourselves as a country. Maybe I’d fall to my knees and tearfully admit that we couldn’t pay; maybe I’d violently force the merchants to clam up. Either way, they’d play up the details in scandalous fashion in their articles, no doubt.</p>
<p>But we were on to them. A journalist more loyal to our side <a id="page-292"></a>snitched about this to Diablo. Thus, he had praised the media assembled—“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh, how laudable of you all”—but they looked dreadfully scared, their smiles frozen in place. I could tell they had a strong desire not to antagonize Diablo; something bad must’ve happened to them before. It sounded a bit threatening of him, but that was an issue between Diablo and the press, not me. It’d be clownish if I was to intervene.</p>
<p>“Well, well, the demon lord Rimuru. I hope you are doing well at the moment? I apologize that we have not come to know each other before now.”</p>
<p>He was the perfect prince, giving me an elegant bow. My presence threw him for only a moment; he regained his composure soon after. A gentle, relaxed expression was on his face as he greeted me for the rest of the group.</p>
<p>“Duke Meusé from the Kingdom of Ghastone? What brings you here? I’m not sure we had any pressing business with you?”</p>
<p>I smiled back, beginning with the line I’d prepared in advance. I wasn’t the type to wither in front of royalty, and here, too, I managed to smoothly handle the occasion. Advance prep and review are <em>so</em> important.</p>
<p>“Well, you see, there are some tradesmen here doing business with this nation for the first time at your festival, and they have come to me claiming their valid rights have been neglected. It is the job of the nobility to protect their citizens, and while I regret my rude directness, I have come to mediate on this issue.”</p>
<p>So brazen. You could just tell he was completely blackhearted. I’m not far behind him, but since I’m a slime, I’m fetchingly translucent compared to him.</p>
<p>“I see, I see. But that’s strange. Mjöllmile over there told me that our budget is ample enough. If people are still waiting for payment, then why is that?”</p>
<p>“Ah, well, these people only accept payment in Dwarven gold coins…”</p>
<p>Mjöllmile was just <em>meant</em> for the stage. He took my question meekly, attempting to explain the issue—only to have Duke Meusé interrupt him.</p>
<p><a id="page-293"></a>“Isn’t that to be expected, Mjöllmile? A legitimate merchant from Blumund such as yourself should be fully cognizant of international commercial law, I would believe! Unlike the slipshod members of the Free Guild, the only currency these people trust is Dwarven gold.”</p>
<p>Duke Meusé was on the merchants’ side, not raising his voice a bit as he pleaded their case, making certain he remained a benevolent third party. I was sure he was waiting for the moment when he could intervene with me and make Tempest owe him a favor.</p>
<p>For now, on the surface, he was acting tremendously fair. But all he was really doing was pushing his own rules on us. I glanced at Diablo. He read my signal and nodded back, smiling. We were all set to go.</p>
<p>“Ah. Yes, I see. I had heard that members of the international media were here, so I was wondering what the issue was, but it was something that trivial?”</p>
<p>“That is why, Sir Rimuru, if you would be able to leave this matter to myself…”</p>
<p>Now Benimaru spoke up. His imposing presence visibly unnerved some of the merchants. They must’ve thought I was going to threaten them into doing my bidding, like their plan called for.</p>
<p>“Not so fast, Benimaru. Based on what I hear, I can understand the concerns of these merchants.”</p>
<p>The audience looked a tad surprised that I held Benimaru back. Or dissatisfied, maybe. Things were going well, and then I had to rain on the parade.</p>
<p>“But, Sir Rimuru, I can’t help but wonder… They may not be Dwarven coins, but we do have ancient gold coins. If they will not accept those, I think we could provide them with the equivalent value of our Tempest-made goods. Why are they not content with that?”</p>
<p>“I agree with you, but I’m sure the merchants have their reasons.”</p>
<p>I gauged Duke Meusé’s response as Benimaru and I bantered. He seemed to be waiting for a chance to speak up, unite the merchants, and entrap me.</p>
<p>“Then how about this? Perhaps you could place your trust in our <a id="page-294"></a>nation and, as Benimaru suggested, accept IOUs or goods in equivalent value?”</p>
<p>Mjöllmile, seeking to end this quickly, got the ball rolling. If the other side agreed to this, then perfect—we had an amicable agreement in hand. But if not—if I was standing here at the negotiation table and they were willing to make me look foolish—then I was prepared for that.</p>
<p>“I—I don’t believe a word of it!”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah!”</p>
<p>“This is a nation of monsters, and that is exactly why we seek payment in reliable, trustworthy Dwarven gold coins. I hope you will find it in your heart to understand that and, please, be generous in your—”</p>
<p>The merchants here ran the gamut, from complete neophytes to veterans familiar with manners around nobility. But either way, their responses were all one-sided, not taking me into consideration at all.</p>
<p><em>Ah</em>, I thought. <em>It’s too bad.</em></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Meusé thought the time had come.</p>
<p>He was worried the merchants might grow hesitant when faced with the demon lord’s coercive ways, but so far they were following his instructions, just as he planned.</p>
<p>And if you think about it, it made sense. Meusé was a prince in Ghastone. He was young, just thirty-five years of age, but he had ties to the powerful Rozzo family. This made him one of the rulers of the Western Nations, part of just a small handful of upper-class nobility. Practically speaking, only a very few people could afford to turn their backs on his orders.</p>
<p>This plan came in the form of an order to him from the eldest member of the Rozzo family. Meusé was asked to make the demon lord Rimuru owe him a favor and gain his trust—and if he succeeded, he was promised a promotion to the Five Elders.</p>
<p>Yes. The Five Elders—the very peak of the entire world. Meusé <a id="page-295"></a>was elated—and at the same time, he swore to tap every power at his command to execute this order, no matter what it took.</p>
<p>Thus he promised a lucrative future to the self-interested merchants he made contact with. He brought in newspaper writers from around the world to ensure his own safety. And now he was personally facing the demon lord, the lone job he couldn’t leave to anyone else.</p>
<p>This Rimuru had made his presence known only a short time ago, but he had already killed Clayman, renowned for his cold cruelty, and declared himself a new demon lord. A fearsome one, said to be connected to the Storm Dragon that laid waste to an army of twenty thousand. Meeting him in person terrified Meusé, but when placed on the scales with the glory he could earn, it was easy to bottle up his fears.</p>
<p>Meusé himself knew exactly what he wanted. That’s why he was being used like this, although he hadn’t noticed. It was exactly the way Elmesia El-Ru Thalion pictured it.</p>
<p class="space-break">Seeing the demon lord and his personal staff in person honestly came as a surprise to Meusé. He was planning to talk Mjöllmile into a corner and ask him to bring the demon lord over. But while this wasn’t quite in the script, it did save him some time. They had reporters in the audience, and there were many more in the hall below this one.</p>
<p>Everything was set up. Once the merchants rejected the demon lord’s offers, Meusé’s plan was all but complete. After that, he just had to assuage the merchants and start running this room. That’s all it would take to make Rimuru start to thank him.</p>
<p>A calm smile emerged on his face as he began to speak, already convinced of his success.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">“How about this, Sir Rimuru? If you are in something of a financial bind, then perhaps you could discuss matters with me personally? Indeed, fate may have brought us together here for a reason. If I could be of service to—”</p>
<p><a id="page-296"></a>It was just as I predicted—and a pretty shoddy acting job, too. Duke Meusé was making the request. My officials, standing behind me, looked on coldly at him. Noticing their gazes, the duke appeared a tad flustered. Maybe he felt something wasn’t going to plan—but it was too late for him.</p>
<p>Time to serve things up.</p>
<p>“I appreciate the offer, but it will not be needed. Come in.”</p>
<p>Following my order, Geld lumbered into the hall, carrying a large tray loaded high into the air with gold coins.</p>
<p>“Wha—?!”</p>
<p>“No…”</p>
<p>“Is all of that…?”</p>
<p>The crowd stirred.</p>
<p>The moment he laid eyes on the coins, the color of Duke Meusé’s face visibly changed. He must have realized that his plan of action had failed.</p>
<p>“You were seeking payment, right?” Rigurd declared. “Very well. Here it is—all in Dwarven gold coins.”</p>
<p>You could hear a pin drop in the hall.</p>
<p>“Wa… Please wait. Wait just a moment, Sir Rimuru?!”</p>
<p>Duke Meusé looked pretty panicked. <em>It’s a bit too late for that, isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>“Yes?” I coldly asked.</p>
<p>“Are…are these all Dwarven gold coins?” he asked, face contorting. “Counterfeit currency is a clear violation!”</p>
<p><em>Hmm… Is that really something you should be accusing me of? Because that really sounds pathetic, Meusé.</em></p>
<p>“Rather a rude thing to say to Sir Rimuru,” Diablo said, stepping forward. Benimaru was looking angry as well, and I was starting to get bad vibes from Shion behind me.</p>
<p>“I… My pardons. But is this really…?”</p>
<p>“If you doubt them,” I said with a smile to the withering prince, “feel free to have them appraised.”</p>
<p>“In that case, if you’ll excuse me, I will use my trusty magic tools to examine them.”</p>
<p>It’d normally be unthinkable to interrupt a conversation between <a id="page-297"></a>Duke Meusé and me, but… Ah well. No point quibbling over little details. This merchant who just spoke up must’ve been a protégé of the duke, a colluder of sorts. No doubt these events disturbed him so much, he forgot his manners. He was a faker, not the real thing—not that I’m much of a “real” king myself yet, of course. But let’s move on.</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru, these reporters told me they wanted to write an article about these negotiations. What should we do?”</p>
<p>Shuna, after receiving my Thought Communication, spoke to me from behind the closed door, just as we had rehearsed. The journalists had gathered outside the room at Diablo’s behest—and when I gave the signal, they’d burst inside to serve as witnesses.</p>
<p>“Well, they have impeccable timing, don’t they?” Benimaru replied. “If we are going to appraise the coins, then let the press be in attendance as well.”</p>
<p>Then, as planned, the reporters entered the meeting hall.</p>
<p>“They… They’re real!!” the shocked merchant/colluder bellowed. Of course they were.</p>
<p>“Indeed,” one of the reporters said with a knowing look, “and these are some impressive gold coins at that. Some of these date back to quite a long time ago. They may not have been circulated before now.”</p>
<p>Those were probably the ones Elmesia had traded to me. I was sure she must have tons of them squirreled away somewhere. And with the reporters attesting to their value, the merchant could do nothing else. Even if he wanted to try swapping real ones out for fakes, the media was practically breathing down his neck—and if he <em>did</em> try that, then Soei, watching on from the shadows, wouldn’t let that go unaddressed.</p>
<p>“So is everything settled, then? I believe our merchants were concerned about their payments, so go ahead and settle our accounts for me, if you could.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord!” Rigurd and Mjöllmile said, answering my rather stuffy-sounding command. Producing a sheaf of documents and receipts, they began the payment process. It all went smoothly, under the watchful eye of the reporters.</p>
<p><a id="page-298"></a>“And you’re the last one, then.”</p>
<p>Now we were all done. Our last piece of business for the Founder’s Festival was settled.</p>
<p>“Ha… Ha-ha-ha… Impressive, Sir Rimuru. I have no idea how you managed to assemble such a fortune in Dwarven gold…”</p>
<p>Duke Meusé looked dreadfully stiff now. In front of him were all those piles of coins, shining even after we paid them out. The merchants looked a tad confused themselves, unsure what to do now that things were off script.</p>
<p>In the midst of this, the merchant I’d called the “<em>colluder</em>” spoke up.</p>
<p>“Well, as far as we’re concerned, as long as you respect international law, we have nothing to complain about. We hope to continue doing business with you in the future—”</p>
<p>“Um, we’ll pass on that, thanks,” I replied.</p>
<p>The merchants stared at me, eyes wide open. So, for that matter, did my staff.</p>
<p>“Wh-what do you…?”</p>
<p>“Our business with you is complete,” I said, as if stating the obvious. “There’s not going to <em>be</em> any more.”</p>
<p>My staff was now shocked. Only Diablo looked on with a smile. I suppose he was the only one who guessed what was on my mind here. That’s too bad.</p>
<p>“I-I’m not sure I understand…”</p>
<p>“What is the meaning of this? If you pay us, we can trust in you anytime…?”</p>
<p>“Are you looking down on us simple tradesmen? You know that nations can hardly trade with each other without traveling peddlers?!”</p>
<p>The truth was beginning to set in, I suppose, as the merchants started shouting.</p>
<p>“<em>Don’t</em>…you <em>think</em>…you are being quite rude to Sir Rimuru, the king of our nation?”</p>
<p>Shion burned with a quiet anger as she spoke. The merchants fell silent, no doubt sensing the danger. I figured I’d take advantage of the silence to finish things off.</p>
<p><a id="page-299"></a>“You know, I’m not into this cat-and-mouse stuff, so I’m just gonna come out and say it. <em>You</em> guys were the ones going on about how you couldn’t ‘trust’ our nation, weren’t you? Well, trust is a two-way street. It requires both sides to believe in each other. I don’t think it involves one side meekly accepting everything the other says to it. Mjöllmile asked you all multiple times to trust in us, didn’t he?”</p>
<p>“Th-that…”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“I mean, I understand what you’re thinking here. We’re monsters, and you know we want to trade with the Western Nations, but you’re not sure if we can truly abide by <em>human</em> rules—that kind of thing.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes, exactly! And that is why—”</p>
<p>“But, you know, that’s why we suggested a compromise with bartering goods or using ancient coins. And you kicked all of that to the curb.”</p>
<p>“…!!”</p>
<p>“Ngh…”</p>
<p>Mjöllmile had practically thrown out his back bowing so much, trying to negotiate with them. But all the merchants here had laughed in his face. I wasn’t about to forgive that.</p>
<p>“You guys only want to do business with people you can trust. And you know what? So do we. We only want to do business with people we can trust. Therefore, I refuse to allow any of you to conduct work in our nation. I won’t ban you from entering, but don’t expect permission to conduct commercial activities anymore.”</p>
<p>It took this declaration for the merchants to realize just how serious this was. We had a new market here, one that lots of people expected would balloon in size, and there was no place for them in it.</p>
<p>The statement made Duke Meusé turn white. If he didn’t know yet that he had failed, he did now. “I—I refuse to allow such tyranny!” he shouted, unable to hold it in. “These people were only asking for their justified rights under international law—”</p>
<p>Did he see being unable to trade with us as a problem? I certainly <a id="page-300"></a>had plans to make this into a giant new economic union, one bigger than all the Western Nations combined. That was probably why he wanted to join the bandwagon early and make friends with me—but if he could read us that far, he really shouldn’t have taken this approach. I never show mercy to my enemies.</p>
<p>“Their rights, huh? I think you may have the wrong idea, so if you’ll let me correct you real quick, our nation is not part of the Council of the West yet. I’d like to join them sometime, but if I can’t, then so be it. I’m not gonna mind.”</p>
<p>“Wha…?!”</p>
<p>“I mean, we’ve already decided this land’s going to be the center of a vast new economic bloc. Why? Because I want it to be.”</p>
<p>“Wh-what kind of nonsense are you…?! Such arrogance, strictly on your own volition—”</p>
<p>“It’s not arrogance. We’re all working together as a team toward the same goal, and we’re bound to see results from it. All I’m doing is helping out.”</p>
<p>I was trying to make it sound all cool, but really, I was prioritizing the stuff <em>I</em> wanted to make happen first, I suppose. I wasn’t sure I could deny claims of being arrogant, but I still had to lash back.</p>
<p>“And I want to be on equal terms with the Council of the West, too. But, you know, if they try to keep us down, then forget it. I’m not gonna force a relationship; we can just work through the Free Guild instead. Do you understand me?”</p>
<p>Besides, if we really needed to, we could sign individual pacts with each nation in the west, like we did with Blumund and the Dwarven Kingdom. There was no need to hurry things along. Just polish up our nation, make ourselves more valuable, and in time, we were bound to have a country that people would trust in. As far as I was concerned, that way of thinking was set in stone.</p>
<p>“All… All right. In that case, I will be glad to serve as an intermediary with the Council. I think we have had some regrettable misunderstandings, but I hope I can be of aid to you, Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>Duke Meusé is certainly a hard worker. Ah well. If he had retreated earlier, I wouldn’t have needed to say all that stuff, but <em>noooo</em>.</p>
<p><a id="page-301"></a>“Mm, I don’t think I can ask for your help, Sir Meusé. You’ve kind of lost your footing here already, you see?”</p>
<p>“Um?”</p>
<p>Duke Meusé froze, unable to parse what I’d just told him. Well, all right. It’s settled anyway. I didn’t want to say it myself, but at this point, explaining everything start to finish was probably the kindest approach.</p>
<p>“Once all the reporters here go back to their home nations, they’re going to write articles. Articles about this struggle related to merchant payments behind the scenes of the Founder’s Festival we held. They’re going to make the truth clear, and I’m sure all the stories are gonna be <em>very</em> entertaining.”</p>
<p>“………”</p>
<p>Duke Meusé’s mind must’ve been racing. It was telling him what would come next, and the results made him look sicker and sicker. See, this was exactly why I didn’t want to say it.</p>
<p>“Here, we have merchants who rejected our requests and demanded payment only in Dwarven gold coins. Then we have this upper-crust member of nobility who comes swooping in to unite them, even though he’s not personally involved at all. If someone read <em>that</em> newspaper article, what would they think?”</p>
<p>“I, um, that…”</p>
<p>Of course, that was all Diablo’s doing. He had assembled the reporters, revealing the information in detail. That alone would prove we were justified as a nation, and most people would sense a conspiracy among the merchant ranks. I agreed with them. Information means something only if it’s used correctly. Instead of fabricating the facts and trying to spread them around, it’s always better to start with the facts and just hand them out.</p>
<p>It was my discussions with Gazel and Elmesia that helped me come up with this strategy, though. Diablo even personally thanked them, talking about how he “still had a great deal to learn” and all. I thought they both helped us a lot this time, and I wanted to more amply repay them sometime soon.</p>
<p>“So there will be no need for you. Mjöllmile, who you so thoroughly disrespected, has my full and utmost support—enough so <a id="page-302"></a>that I trust all my nation’s finances to him. He’s been far more help to me than you have, for one.”</p>
<p>“Ah…?!”</p>
<p>Duke Meusé’s face twisted in humiliation as the merchants began to look desperate. Meanwhile, the reporters were having much more fun than they expected when they first filed in. Some of them were rapidly taking down notes of the event—one they didn’t mind recording, since they didn’t take any of the fallout. A few even had expensive magic items for recording images of our negotiations. This was definitely gonna spread wide. The prince may have called the press over to save his own hide, but it wound up having quite the opposite effect.</p>
<p>“You can take care of the rest.”</p>
<p>“I would be happy to, Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>I patted the shoulder of the deferential Mjöllmile, whispering, “Thanks, Mollie,” as I passed by and out of the room with my staff. It sort of felt like he smiled back at me, but I didn’t see it on his face—his calculating eyes were back on Duke Meusé, then on the merchants around the room. I don’t think anyone would mind if I made him our chief financial manager.</p>
<p>On the other side of the door, I could hear him speak: “Now, since all our business has been settled, if I could ask everyone to accept their payments…” His way of putting a final period on these events, I suppose.</p>

<p class="tx1">Chasing the duke out of town was gratifying, but we still had many problems to deal with. Thus, it was time for our customary review meeting.</p>
<p>We were back in the usual meeting hall, not the fancier one for the festival’s receptions and banquets. It was the night after the festival wrapped up, but a few guests were still around for this conference—Gazel, Elmesia, Yohm and his gang, Fuze, and even Yuuki, Hinata, and Masayuki. They were joined by a few other rare invitees, all here on my invitation, and the rest of my staff <a id="page-304"></a>were all on hand as well, making it a packed house. Milim and the demon-lord crowd were not invited—if I had <em>too</em> many people here, we’d lose cohesion. We had a lot to talk about this time, so the itinerary was already pretty full.</p>
