<p class="noindentt">“Yep. We can leave that job to the exploration-oriented adventurers. And with the map Kagali left for them, I think they’ll make some serious progress.”</p>
<p>There’s the Guild philosophy at work again—instead of leaving everything to a single exceptional talent, they can bring on teams of people for the excavation work. It’d help younger members gain experience, too, killing two birds with one stone in a way.</p>
<p>So Kagali was now working here at the headquarters, helping educate the B-rank and higher adventurers. Given that she got a cut of the proceeds whenever the Guild sold the relics found by explorers, her take-home pay must’ve been astronomical.</p>
<p>“Huh. You can make a lot of money from ruins, can’t you?”</p>
<p>“I have to admit,” she replied, “you can. Although money isn’t my main motivation; this is more my life’s passion. I <em>have</em> auctioned off things I excavated in the past, however, to pay for my expenses.”</p>
<p>Yep. Sounds like lucrative, if backbreaking, work. And speaking of ruins…</p>
<p>“I wanted to ask—who’s got the rights to these ruins? Is it whatever nation they’re located in?”</p>
<p>“Mm…” Yuuki paused. “That’s a hard question to answer. In the case of the Soma complex, that’s managed by the Free Guild. It was discovered in a somewhat tricky location—a desert region called the Barren Lands, farther west from Western Nations territory.”</p>
<p>“Yes. To be more exact, the Barren Lands are located right up against the domain of the demon lord Daggrull. Thus, the area is not under governmental jurisdiction at all—everyone’s too afraid to come near it. Ruins in unaffiliated lands like these don’t have anyone who can lay claim to them.”</p>
<p>“Oh… We’ll have to be careful with those, then…”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Something bothering you about that, Rimuru?”</p>
<p>Yuuki must have picked up on my reaction. I needed no reminding of what that something was. It was the assorted unknown ruins near Clayman’s castle, no doubt packed with magic items. I was sure exploring it would reap a huge harvest for us, but there was one <a id="page-50"></a>snag: Who would the items we dug up really belong to? And what if those ruins invited unscrupulous, profit-seeking adventurers—or worse, out-and-out criminals? The potential for discovering untold treasure was tempting, but even more important to consider was that treasure’s historical value. They provided leads we could follow to learn about the ancients and what they did.</p>
<p>It’s only natural, I suppose, to romanticize about ancient times. If we let just anyone go in the ruins and vandalize them all they wanted, we ran the risk of losing irreplaceable artifacts—that was my main fear.</p>
<p>There was no need to hide this fear, so I decided to bring up the topic with Yuuki. We had an expert explorer on hand, besides.</p>
<p>“Well, actually, there’s another complex of ruins in Clayman’s old domain.”</p>
<p>“There is? You’re sure of that?!”</p>
<p>Kagali’s eyes instantly fixed upon me, like a predator aiming for the kill. It was quite the onrush, and it honestly surprised me a bit.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Clayman had this vast fortune and collection and stuff. He handed out magical weapons and armor to his forces like candy. I’m thinking he harnessed the things he found in that ruin to finance it. The thing is…”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>I paused for a bit, unsure, before continuing. “This might be rude to say to someone who makes exploration their profession, but I’m not really interested in plundering ruins just for the treasure. I want to know how the people there used to live, what kind of culture they had, and why their cities fell. I think ancient people deserve at least that much respect, so we don’t let the past go to waste.”</p>
<p>This was just me being sentimental, I knew. It wasn’t that I didn’t care at all about treasure; there were just more important things. That was why I ordered that ruin closed to outside visitors for now.</p>
<p>“You’re more of a romanticist than I thought, Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘<em>more than I thought’</em>? I’ve always been this way, Yuuki.”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! Yeah, you’re right.” He smiled at me, convinced. <a id="page-51"></a>“You’d have to be, to come up with an idea like building a nation of monsters.”</p>
<p>Kagali, for her part, mulled this over for a bit before nodding. The predatorial drive in her eyes was gone, the intellectual spark now firmly back.</p>
<p>“I see… Certainly, that’s a perspective I did not have. But I understand it. I am not a fan of seeing ruins get vandalized myself. We need to build the right sort of expedition team before we send them to Soma, of course.”</p>
<p>Maybe the romantic part of my thoughts didn’t come across, but at least she saw the need to keep the ruins protected. Hopefully she could lead that effort. She certainly seemed like the right fit.</p>
<p>So that just left one problem.</p>
<p>“Right. Well, the problem is, I’m the sole person responsible for caretaking Clayman’s territory. The demon lord Milim will eventually annex that land, but for now, it’s being run by us, the people who defeated Clayman. I think it’s fair to say he kept those ruins in pretty good shape, so I don’t want to be the one who messes them all up. I think I’ll have to bring this up with Milim—we need to make sure we’re thorough with handling them.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you aren’t going to rule that territory yourself?”</p>
<p>“It might be too much for me. It borders the Eastern Empire, and I don’t really feel like—um, I mean, having to run a border defense line against them is a pretty tall order. We can’t devote <em>that</em> many forces to it.”</p>
<p>Clayman’s domain was a buffer zone with the Empire. It contained a road known as the Valley of Death that wound its way through rugged mountains—a dirt path, not paved at all, but it still provided passage between Clayman’s lands and the Empire. The area was packed with undead creatures, but there was also evidence that Clayman’s forces made regular use of the trail—suggesting that the Empire was carrying out some kind of plan of action through his domain. It wouldn’t hurt to be on our guard about that.</p>
<p>We <em>could</em> deploy the army over there, but we’re running short on personnel right now. Managing the whole of the Forest of Jura took a vast amount of work. I was thinking I could leave Clayman’s <a id="page-52"></a>land to Milim, and if the Empire ever made any moves, I’d just let Milim handle everything.</p>
<p>“So if we wanted to explore those ruins, we’d need the demon lord Milim’s permission?” Yuuki asked.</p>
<p>“I suppose so, yeah.”</p>
<p>“Ah… I have a keen interest in them, but do you think we’d be able to avoid interference?” inquired Kagali.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sure she’d say yes if we asked…but knowing her, I guarantee she’ll want to go in, too.”</p>
<p>“That…”</p>
<p>I was sure that condition would make any would-be explorer hesitate. The general public, after all, feared Milim deeply. Kagali seemed disappointed, but she shouldn’t give up yet. Milim <em>would</em> definitely come along, no doubt about that—but if I’m there, too, what’s the problem?</p>
<p>“But, you know, I was planning to explore those ruins anyway, so having an expert like you along would certainly put my mind at ease, Kagali. And since we’ve introduced ourselves to each other, maybe I could pay you through the Free Guild to help with that effort? What do you think?”</p>
<p>“Meaning that you’d have the right to whatever we found, Rimuru?”</p>
<p>“Well, we can talk about that. I have a museum in my capital, so I’d prefer to put it on display there rather than sell it off. But it’s still gonna be Milim’s land, so we’ll have to discuss matters with her, too. It’s hard to make a decision either way right now.”</p>
<p>“I see. But you’re definitely gonna stage an expedition sometime?”</p>
<p>“Yep!”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” Kagali chimed in, “if I don’t have to worry about expenses, I’d be delighted to take that offer. And if you can handle negotiations with Milim for me, I’d have no reason to say no.”</p>
<p>It looked like Kagali’s interests weren’t strictly about profit, either. She had an intellectual bent as well, and if she did, there were no issues between us. So it was decided: She’d organize the team, and I’d talk to Milim and convince her this was a good idea.</p>
<p>“Does all that sound good to you, Yuuki?”</p>
<p><a id="page-53"></a>“Sure! The Free Guild would be happy to help!”</p>
<p>“Now I’m looking forward to this. I’ll begin making arrangements for this while I run operations in Master Yuuki’s absence.”</p>
<p><em>Ah, right.</em> We’d gotten a little sidetracked, but I was here to invite Yuuki over.</p>
<p>“Thanks very much, Kagali. Sorry you’re staying here while we get to have all the fun, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! Oh, I don’t mind. Enjoy yourselves to your hearts’ content.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. The Guild’s in your hands!”</p>
<p>After saying our good-byes, Yuuki and I left the Guild headquarters. I hadn’t expected this, but now we had the ball rolling on exploring those ruins. I really wasn’t sure who to enlist for that effort, so having an expert oversee operations was reassuring. It wouldn’t be until things calmed down after the Founder’s Festival, but I really couldn’t wait to see what we found in there. We could all stand to learn a lot—maybe it’d even give me some hints for the underground Dungeon we’d built back in town.</p>
<p>Such were my thoughts as I took Yuuki along to my next stop.</p>

<p class="tx1">I removed my mask outside of the HQ. Given that I no longer needed to hide my aura with it, I only really required it in places where revealing my face would cause trouble.</p>
<p>Yuuki, carrying a large knapsack, was eager to talk to me. Receiving that written invite, he must’ve had time to prepare in advance—and given the size of his bag, he must’ve been planning to stay at least a few nights.</p>
<p>“So are you gonna bring the kids along, too?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Now that Hinata and I are even, none of ’em has any reason to be against me. There might be an issue or two with them being over there, but we got some pretty serious security, so…”</p>
<p>We had to, given all the dignitaries we invited. And if we could keep all of <em>them</em> safe, there was no reason we couldn’t protect those five children, either.</p>
<p><a id="page-54"></a>“Okay. In that case, go right ahead.” Yuuki smiled. “They’re a lot more devoted to studying these days, so maybe they’re due for a break and a reward.”</p>
<p>I didn’t send any advance notice to the kids. It would be a complete surprise to them. I kept quiet until I was sure it’d be okay to invite them, and hopefully they’d forgive me for that. I knew they really needed some more advance notice, but depending on how things went, I might’ve had to say no to them. No point in revving them up and disappointing them later if things went awry.</p>
<p class="space-break">After walking for a while, we came to a familiar schoolhouse—the imposing home of Englesia’s Free Academy. A word with the gate guard, and we were taken inside—I was with Yuuki, the school’s honorary chairman, so it took no time at all.</p>
<p>We were soon greeted by the vice principal, who guided us into a classroom.</p>
<p>“Hey, guys! You all doing well—?”</p>
<p>Before I could finish saying hello, Alice tackled me like a lineman.</p>
<p>“Ugh! Mr. Tempest! You’ve been gone for so long!!”</p>
<p>I didn’t think I had been, but maybe that was just my grown-up’s perspective? Children have a different sense of time than we do. I guess this must’ve been hard for them.</p>
<p>“She’s right. You promised me you’d come in regularly to visit!”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Gail’s telling the truth! I thought you forgot all about us!”</p>
<p>“But I’m glad you’re here now, Mr. Tempest!”</p>
<p>Gail, Kenya, and Ryota all gathered around me, expressing their joy even as they complained to me. Chloe wasn’t far behind them, grabbing on to me and smiling.</p>
<p>“Welcome back, Mr. Tempest!”</p>
<p>“You’re as popular as ever.” Yuuki laughed as he watched. “I’m a little jealous.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Yuuki’s here, too!”</p>
<p>“Are you gonna fight me today like you promised, Yuuki?”</p>
<p>“Me too!”</p>
<p>“Right. Our spirit force handling’s improved a lot lately.”</p>
<p>Noticing Yuuki made the children’s smiles grow wider. Kenya <a id="page-55"></a>was even challenging him to a fight, and Ryota and Gail weren’t far behind him. If they had their powers more under control now, I was sure they wanted someone to test them out on. But we were here for different reasons.</p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha! You’d need to train another hundred years to beat me. I’ll fight if ya want, but not today, all right?”</p>
<p>“Awww, why not?” Kenya protested.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” I said, “but there’s no time for that today.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” a confused Chloe asked.</p>
<p>I looked right back at her. “Well, I wanted to invite all five of you to my homeland. We’re holding a big festival starting tomorrow. If you don’t want to go, that’s fine, but—”</p>
<p>“Hurry! We gotta get ready!”</p>
<p>“All right, Ken!”</p>
<p>“Whaaaaa—?! Why didn’t you tell us sooner?! This is <em>huge</em>!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Mr. Tempest! How can you just say this out of nowhere?!”</p>
<p>“Um, um, I can’t wait!!”</p>
<p>The children immediately sprang into action, not waiting for the rest of my speech. They didn’t waste a moment of time. The decision was unanimous.</p>
<p>“All you need to bring is a change of clothes, guys!” I shouted as they scurried off. There was no response, all of them departing like a storm and shouting the whole way.</p>
<p class="space-break">The teacher presiding over class at the time was understandably a little confused as he watched us. “That’s quite a surprise to see.” He sighed once they were gone. “They’ve never been quite that friendly to me…”</p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha! You’re doing a great job with them. They’re a little better now, but it takes a rare teacher to wrangle the likes of these kids.”</p>
<p>“No, no, I suppose it’s only natural that you need to prove your strength for them to listen to you. I hate to say it, but I think I might actually lose to them if I don’t pay attention. There’s no doubting the power they pack, no. By the way…”</p>
<p>The teacher didn’t look familiar. He must’ve been hired on to replace me.</p>
<p><a id="page-56"></a>“Oh, I’m sorry. My name’s Rimuru, and I was teaching them before you. Sorry to interfere with class.”</p>
<p>“Ah, you <em>are</em> Rimuru! I surmised as much when the children called you ‘Mr. Tempest.’ My name is Klaus, and I was hired by the academy as your replacement.” He gave me a bitter smile. “And don’t worry about the class—the vice principal warned me in advance that we may be canceling it for a bit starting today.”</p>
<p>As Yuuki explained, Klaus was once an adventurer, a hunting specialist with a rank of A-minus. He was now approaching fifty and considering retirement before very long.</p>
<p>“Wait, you said <em>you</em> might even lose to them? They’ve gotten <em>that</em> strong?”</p>
<p>“Well, what did you expect? They take pride in the fact that you trained them, sir.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Yuuki said, “if they snuck up on me, maybe <em>I’d</em> even lose.”</p>
<p>They must’ve grown a lot. That was impressive, especially in such a short time. It gave me something to think about, as a resolved-looking Klaus turned toward us.</p>
<p>“Sir Yuuki, I have a request.”</p>
<p>“Mm? What’s that?”</p>
<p>“It’s something I’d like to ask Sir Rimuru as well—but at this rate, I can see myself as no longer able to win against them before long. It’s an advantage that goes beyond any technical skill they have. But letting them slide by with just <em>this</em> much wouldn’t be good for them. I think they need an adult who can serve as a kind of wall for them.”</p>
<p>“How do you mean?”</p>
<p>“It’s simple, Sir Yuuki. These children still have the potential to grow. I don’t want them defeating me to make them arrogant, and thus, I was hoping we could provide someone who can train them in fighting technique.”</p>
<p>I get it. Klaus really seemed to be looking out for these kids. Each one was housing a high-level spirit inside them—spirits that neutralized the magicule energy granted to them in the crossing from their world to this one. As they grew, however, they became able to control and harness these spirits’ powers—and unleashing <a id="page-57"></a>this extra energy would make it simple to cast spirit-magic spells, for example.</p>
<p>They really could become talented elementalists, the way Shizu had. Kenya even had the potential to go Hero-level, just like the light elemental we met said. With the right instructor, fabulous powers would be far more than just a dream to him. Like Klaus suggested, he needed a gifted teacher to guide him along. But:</p>
<p>“All right. So we’ll want a good teacher along those lines, huh? But if we’re talking someone stronger than you, Klaus, it’d have to be a current A-ranker. Hiring someone that far up as a teacher might not be possible…”</p>
<p>Yuuki was right. That <em>was</em> a problem. A retired adventurer would be glad to accept a steady job like that, but an active one could earn a lot more money taking challenging jobs than watching a classroom of kids. The Guild, too, had a mission to keep people safe; they’d naturally prefer their top talent to be working in the field for them.</p>
<p>“I imagine not,” Klaus said with a sigh. “If we’re looking for someone ranked A or higher willing to work as a teacher, well, <em>I</em> sure can’t think of anyone. I can certainly teach classwork and adventuring skills well enough, but…”</p>
<p>He understood full well that this was a big ask. And, yeah, recruiting adventurers to teach must’ve been a pretty tall order. So I made another suggestion.</p>
<p>“In that case, you know, I’m planning to start a school of my own back home. We got a lot of B-ranked dudes over there, and I could probably have Old Man Hakuro, my own teacher, serve as an instructor. When it comes to swordsmanship, at least, he’s better than I am, so I’m sure he could teach them that much.”</p>
<p>Hakuro would be just fine—when it came to sword skills. The children needed more instruction than <em>that</em>, of course, but…</p>
<p>“Whoa,” Yuuki marveled, “that actually sounds great! Would you mind taking over custody of them for a while, then?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s another idea. But they’re still gonna need to learn life skills for <em>human</em> society from somewhere.”</p>
<p>Children learn a lot of these skills interacting with one another. Robbing them of that chance, I worried, could stunt their <a id="page-58"></a>communication skills as they grew up. We’d be seeing more and more adventurers in Tempest over time, and their own children would probably be attending this school I pictured—but that wasn’t likely to gain major momentum for another few years. Until then, they’d have to live in an environment with no other human children, and that struck me as problematic.</p>
<p>“Oh, because it’s nothing but other monsters instead of human kids?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that <em>could</em> be an issue…”</p>
<p>Yuuki and Klaus had the same misgivings, nodding their agreement. I was glad we were on the same page with this—but I couldn’t rest easy yet. There was something else on my mind.</p>
<p>“Which, I mean, they could just travel to Tempest for instruction in battle. We have the teleportation magic for it; they could come over a few times a week if you like. But given their background, I think they better get some instruction in elemental spirits as well.”</p>
<p>This wasn’t a “problem,” exactly, but still not something I wanted to compromise on. The elemental spirits within them helped protect their lives, to a large extent. If they wanted to harness their powers correctly, they’d need more core knowledge about them—knowledge I simply didn’t have. Not to put too fine a point on it, but everything I knew about this world was gained strictly off my own experience. Me trying to explain elementals would be like you or I explaining how to breathe through words alone. I could go over logical facts and stuff, but I couldn’t impart the real essence.</p>
<p>I was reminded of the way Hinata and her paladins fought, a fusion of sorts between spirit magic and swordsmanship. It was a unique approach, and mastering it must require a deep understanding of spirits. If they could impart that to our kids here…</p>
<p>“And, you know, when I think about spirits, I think of the paladins. Should we ask Hinata?”</p>
<p>“Hmm… I was thinking the same thing, but Hinata can be kinda scary, you know?”</p>
<p>“Well…true.”</p>
<p>“She’d never allow the kids to take advantage of her, that’s for <em>damn</em> sure. But I’m worried she’ll be a little <em>too</em> harsh on them.”</p>
<p><a id="page-59"></a>“That’s hard to deny, yes.”</p>
<p>Yuuki and I looked at each other and sighed. But we’d need to save this discussion for later. I could already see the children running back to us, luggage in tow. It was festival season. No point in pondering these thorny issues when there’s so much fun to be had. For now, I could ask Hakuro about instructor work and worry about other matters later. It was procrastinating, I know, but we’d figure something out.</p>
<p>So, following the same thought process I usually turned to for issues like these, I mentally switched gears and quit my worrying.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
<p class="tx1">Leaving the main gate into Englesia, I set up a transport gate in a secluded location. This wasn’t “magic,” technically, so I could deploy one without any magic circle required. Yuuki looked at me rather coldly about that, but the kids were used to it.</p>
<p>“Mr. Tempest, if it’s <em>that</em> easy for you to use these gates, then come visit us more often!”</p>
<p>It was Kenya complaining, and he was absolutely right. I apologized profusely to him. With all the stuff that’d happened, it’d been hard to find free time and I couldn’t really guarantee anyone’s safety, but no point telling him about that. It’d just make the kid all anxious. So, while dancing around the subject a little, I promised to go back to see them more often.</p>
<p>On the other side of the gate, I took Yuuki and the kids straight over to my favorite lodging in town—a private area, separate from the four-star nobles’ accommodations and reserved for our top officials. Yuuki went off to his room, and as he did, I turned toward the children.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, guys, but I still have some work left. You’ll have to wait until tonight to see me, okay?”</p>
<p>“““Awwwww!”””</p>
<p>None of them was too excited to hear this.</p>
<p>“Quiet!” I took a pendant out from my pocket, silencing them. “I thought we could use this to play a game, but…?”</p>
<p><a id="page-60"></a>That lifted their spirits. They were eager to hear more, and once I was sure they were, I began to explain.</p>
<p>“You see this pendant here? It’s kind of a free-pass ticket to all the booths and stuff in the festival, starting tomorrow. Carry this around, and you can eat and drink all you want in the stalls, and you’re free to come and go through any of the event halls you like. But just remember, there’s an upper limit of one hundred silver coins—use that up, and it’s game over. You’ll have to go back to your rooms then, and I’ll give you homework as punishment. But if you’ve been doing your work up to now, I’m sure you’ll be smart enough to stretch this out for three days. Sound like fun to you?”</p>
<p>I knew from the start that I couldn’t watch these kids all day, so I thought up this tactic for them. That’s what you normally did with kids at a fair, right? Give them an allowance and let ’em run free. I felt bad about not taking them around, but I figured the kids would have more fun alone anyway. And with Soei’s agents deployed across town, they’d have no trouble keeping tabs on them.</p>
<p>This way, at least, I could let them loose on the festival without major concern. And, really, one hundred silvers was a crazy-generous budget. Most of the stalls and attractions didn’t even charge you one silver; you’d have to make a concerted effort to spend that much in three days. I called it a “game,” but really it was just a premise I’d invented to set them on their way.</p>
<p>“Let’s do it!”</p>
<p>“I bet there’s all this rare stuff to see… Can’t wait, huh, Ken?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I can’t!”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mr. Tempest.”</p>
<p>“Um, I’ll buy something for you, Mr. Tempest!”</p>
<p>They were up for it, all bursting with anticipation. I gave them the pendant, returning each of their excited nods. It’s always fun, I think: that anticipation before a big event. I also thought about telling them Ramiris was in town but decided against it. I planned to introduce them after the fest anyway, so no need to hurry things. Besides, all the kids—Kenya and Alice in particular—were already busy planning out the next three days of fun. The servants at our lodging would take care of the rest of their needs, I figured.</p>
<p><a id="page-61"></a>“Okay, guys, if you need anything, just ask the hostess in charge here, all right? And I doubt you’ll need to, but if you have to contact me about something, just hold that pendant tight and think hard about me. It’ll trigger a messaging magic.”</p>
<p>“““Okay!””” they all shouted back. Good to see them so eager. And with that, figuring I would be in their way beyond this point, I left their room.</p>
<p class="space-break">Now I had wrapped up all the necessities.</p>
<p>I had a little time before the preopening, so I thought I would take a quick break in my room before it began…but the world had other plans for me.</p>
<p>“…Sir Rimuru, the Hero Masayuki’s party has arrived outside of town.”</p>
<p>Soei quietly appeared to whisper the news into my ear. A Hero, huh? What kinda dude could <em>this</em> be? I thought over the possibilities as I came by to greet him.</p>
<p>As I did, I could see several elves getting jostled around on a large wagon. I had heard they were freed from that Orthrus ring, and I guess the news was true. It was a pretty fancy wagon, too—they must’ve been treated well post-rescue.</p>
<p>On another, smaller covered wagon was a boy with blond hair, sitting in the cabman’s seat with another man holding the reins. Was that Masayuki the Hero? He looked Japanese to me, but with the rounded lines to his face, there might’ve been something in his blood from elsewhere. That sort of pop-idol look, you know? Silky blond hair, almondlike eyes with double-fold eyelids… His face was childish, but he just projected this aura of coolness.</p>
<p>The girls must’ve loved him…but frankly, he didn’t look very powerful to me. You can’t judge a book by its cover, though. He was definitely an otherworlder—I could see it in the faint Heroic Aura he emitted. It was meant to be intimidating, but it didn’t work on me.</p>
<p>Bracing myself, I retained my cool as I turned my eyes toward Masayuki. The party must’ve noticed me just then, slowing down and coming to a stop in front of me.</p>
<p><a id="page-62"></a>“You’re the demon lord Rimuru? Funny to see you personally greeting us at the door!”</p>
<p>“Well, Sir Masayuki is a renowned Hero. Not even a demon lord could afford to ignore him.”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! What d’you think, Masayuki? Wanna settle things right here ’n’ now?”</p>
<p>Sheesh, <em>that</em> was sure friendly of them. I was glad they’d rescued those elves, but what did I do to deserve getting dissed like that? Well, gotta bottle it up. Anger right now would be ill-advised. I was trying to frame myself as a helpful, harmless demon lord, on good terms with Hinata and everything, and no way I could let that effort go to waste.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha! Harsh words from the Hero’s friends! Well, out of appreciation for you rescuing our countrymen the elves, you are free to enter and stay in this town. I could even prepare a house for you, if you want, and feel free to stay as long as you like. But just so we’re clear, I’m not interested in ‘settling’ anything right now, all right?”</p>
<p>There were merchants around us. I decided to take a friendly, humble route. It didn’t exactly provide the results I wanted.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha! Look! The demon lord’s afraid of you, Masayuki!”</p>
<p>The large, seminude man who took the reins roared in laughter as he looked down at me.</p>
<p>“I understand you are seeking friendship with us humans. But I’m unsure how much I can trust this. The rumors say that you’re the one who schemed to topple the government of Farmus. Perhaps you’ve managed to trick Hinata the Saint well enough, but don’t expect to be so lucky with Masayuki here.”</p>
<p>Talk about turning a deaf ear. They were hell-bent on making me out to be the villain, it looked like. But oddly enough, the Hero himself still hadn’t said a word. He had tried to, but every time, one of his companions would speak up first. To be honest, they were acting more like groupies.</p>
<p>“Hmph! The evil must be dispelled, if you ask me. Sir Masayuki, defeat this demon lord at once and bring peace to—”</p>
<p><em>Guys, I’m telling you, we’ve already</em> got <em>peace.</em></p>
<p>The nearby merchants were giving me confused looks, no doubt <a id="page-63"></a>totally lost. If I didn’t put my foot down, I felt like there might be repercussions. But I couldn’t really stage a fight here… Before I could get too worried, however, someone tossed me a life ring.</p>
<p>“What’re you guys doing?”</p>
<p>Yuuki, in a fresh set of clothes, had already heard the commotion.</p>
<p>“Oh! Yuuki!”</p>
<p>For the first time, Masayuki spoke up—and from the sound of it, he had been hoping for divine intervention as well. But his companions weren’t having any of it.</p>
<p>“Well, hello there, Yuuki! Why’s the master of the Guild himself keeping tabs on a demon lord?”</p>
<p>“I’m not, Jinrai. Guys, Rimuru seriously wants us all to get along, okay? And as proof of that, I’ll point out the fact that you’re all still alive.”</p>
<p>So the larger guy was named Jinrai. Yuuki explained to him about how I’d fought Hinata to a draw and that I’m not a bad demon lord. It didn’t convince all of them.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that? The way you describe it, are you implying that Masayuki is weaker than Hinata the Saint?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be <em>that</em> harsh with him. A mere demon lord could never stop Sir Masayuki. And even the guild master could never be forgiven for insulting him this way!”</p>
<p>Masayuki himself was still silent. He sure had some extreme fans.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Yuuki. Like Bernie and Jiwu said, don’t treat Masayuki like a fool, all right? I dunno how strong Hinata’s supposed to be, but a draw’s the best she could do against this guy? In that case, it’s time for the headliner to make his debut, ain’t it? Masayuki could whip this demon lord easy!”</p>
<p>The lauded Hero looked like he wanted to be somewhere else right now. Maybe he didn’t seek conflict with me at all, then? Yuuki, realizing this himself, stepped up to assuage his friends.</p>
<p>“Guys, guys, calm down. Like I told you, Rimuru isn’t hostile against us. There’s no point fighting him.”</p>
<p>“But he’s a demon lord, ain’t he? Who knows when he might hatch some nefarious scheme! And with the Western Holy Church <a id="page-64"></a>sitting on the fence, ain’t it about time Masayuki shows everyone just what kinda Hero he is?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m telling you—”</p>
<p><em>Hmm. I see.</em> I could understand where this guy Jinrai was coming from, actually. I was a demon lord, and he didn’t trust me. And sure, if you weren’t familiar with me yet, maybe <em>you’d</em> feel the same way as Jinrai did about me. I still didn’t know what the so-called Hero thought of all this, but at this rate, we’d never come to terms.</p>
<p>So I decided to accept the challenge. But:</p>
<p>“All right. In that case, I’ve got a suggestion. We’re planning to hold a battle tournament at the festival starting tomorrow. If you enter it and emerge as champion, I’ll gladly accept your challenge! That, and you’ll be able to prove your strength to everyone there. Not a bad offer, right?”</p>
<p>I’ll take the challenge, but before that, I wanted Masayuki and his team to enter the tournament. It’d help me learn how they fought, and for that matter, it might show that I shouldn’t bother with them in the first place. A pretty shrewd idea, I thought, although I wasn’t sure which of them would get to fight in the arena yet. I had planned to restrict the competition to fighters ranked below A, as I was still a little anxious about the arena’s structural integrity. It did just fine against magic from high-level elementals, which was special-A stuff…but hey, if it crumbled, we’d just build it again. As long as we made sure no onlookers got hurt, us duking it out there shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>“Oh? You’re in that much of a hurry to embarrass yourself in public?”</p>
<p>“What do you think, Masayuki?”</p>
<p>“You should accept the offer. It’ll help spread your name far and wide! Yes, let’s prove you’re on the side of justice, in front of the very people you must keep safe!”</p>
<p>“Um, yeaaah…”</p>
<p>Masayuki’s attendants were all gung-ho about it. Masayuki was not. His eyes darted around, seeking an escape. Was this dude really all right? This wasn’t, like, just a huge bluff or something, was it? Nah, it couldn’t be. This gang apparently crushed Orthrus, <a id="page-65"></a>which Soei described to me as one <em>seriously</em> dangerous organization. That’s not the kind of feat you could bluff your way through. Even if he <em>was</em> a big faker… I mean, hell, he could say no anytime.</p>
<p>“…Well, all right. I accept your invitation.”</p>
<p>Ah. Guess I really <em>was</em> overthinking it. After a few moments spent in thought, he said yes.</p>
<p>“Whoa, you sure about that, Masayuki?” a worried Yuuki asked.</p>
<p>The Hero smiled slightly. “Oh, I’ll figure something out. It ought to be just fine. It always is.”</p>
<p><em>That’s a lot of confidence! Especially considering I’m right in front of him.</em></p>
<p>“Very good,” I replied. “And this being a tournament, there’s not gonna be any killing, all right? Keep that in mind for me.”</p>
<p>“Hmph! Who do you think you’re talking to? Let’s go, Masayuki. We’d better rest up for the big day tomorrow!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Masayuki. Considering all the onlookers here, no way this demon lord’s going to chicken out now!”</p>
<p>“And don’t worry. We’ll keep a close eye out for anyone trying to poison or assassinate you.”</p>
<p>“A-anyway, we ought to get going. Better find out when the tournament begins.”</p>
<p>“Rimuru,” Yuuki said as they left, “you aren’t <em>really</em> going to fight Masayuki, are you?”</p>
<p>“Ummm… I don’t know yet. I mean, do you think he could win the tournament?”</p>
<p>“That’s what <em>I’d</em> like to know.” Yuuki sighed. “He’s won a couple Englesia battle tournaments in a row, and honestly, I’ve never heard of him losing against a monster before. A lot of his strength is still an unknown to me.”</p>
<p>I could read it on his face. This was something he did <em>not</em> want to deal with.</p>
<p>“Well, whatever happens happens. But let’s give this a positive spin, huh? Having a bona fide Hero in my tournament’s a mark of prestige.”</p>
<p>It’s all about perspective. Yes, this was a thorn in my side, but compared to conferring with demon lords or fighting Hinata, it <a id="page-67"></a>didn’t strike me as that depressing. We’d need to think of some measures later, but I saw no reason to dwell on it any further.</p>
