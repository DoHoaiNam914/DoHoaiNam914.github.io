<p class="noindentt">“Thanks in advance,” Hinata said as she went off with the children. Suddenly, I felt like I had <em>much</em> more to worry about. Hinata was practically skipping down the street, meanwhile. She got me again, didn’t she? I knew it.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">The moment Hinata was out of sight, I felt a light slap on my shoulder.</p>
<p>“Well, well, Rimuru! I don’t think I’ve ever seen Hinata smile before.”</p>
<p>It was a smiling Yuuki standing there, dressed not in a fancy suit but in a uniform that looked like a modified school outfit. He was here to take me to our designated meeting point for the tour.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I never would’ve guessed she’d be interested in watching the kids. I figured she’d tell me to shut up and storm off.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I dunno about that! You might not guess it, but Hinata’s pretty good at taking care of people. It <em>is</em> a surprise, though. And she looks really great in that dress. Apparently, she bought it in town here. She looks kind of like a pretty, fashion-conscious college student, huh?”</p>
<p>So that <em>was</em> from Tempest? I thought I was mistaken, but I guess I wasn’t.</p>
<p>“In that case, Hinata’s gotta be loaded, ’cause lemme tell you, that dress doesn’t come cheap.”</p>
<p>It was made from hellmoth silk, comfortable against the skin and granting the wearer the effects of Cancel Temperature. It also offered pretty decent defense, reducing damage better than your bog-standard leather armor. But it was <em>lavishly</em> expensive. We had a steady supply of silk fabric, but it still wasn’t nearly enough, and each piece had to be handmade. Between the scarcity and labor involved, we all but had to charge an arm and a leg for it. It was boutique shopping for nobles, not the girl on the street—and Hinata had bought it at first sight yesterday without hesitating. If <a id="page-118"></a>she’d already had it tailored to her size, then clearly money was no object with her.</p>
<p>Not that I’m complaining. Always nice to have a free-spending customer.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s a big party right now, so maybe she’s loosening the purse strings a little? She was looking around town all excited yesterday, too.”</p>
<p>She was?! Maybe I was even more mistaken than I thought. She was really looking forward to the Founder’s Festival, wasn’t she?</p>
<p>…Oh. And <em>that’s</em> why she was palming Luminus off on me. So she could <em>really</em> cut loose, huh?</p>
<p>“What was she looking for yesterday?”</p>
<p>“Oh, just checking out what stalls you had, I suppose. She went on and on to me about how you had <em>yakisoba</em> and roasted corn, for one.”</p>
<p>“She did? Um…”</p>
<p>So Hinata had been casing the festival grounds yesterday. She certainly wasn’t messing around, was she? To her, this event was like a battle she wanted to plunge right into the middle of, heart and soul.</p>
<p>Indeed, we had all kinds of stalls lined up in rows around the coliseum. The fast-food outlet (or what you’d call “fast food” in my previous world) was part of that. Mjöllmile had made all the arrangements for it, and we had the whole menu ready for today—burgers, hot dogs, fries, and a selection of juices.</p>
<p>And that was far from all. Yes, there was <em>yakisoba</em> and corn, but also cowdeer kebabs and other local favorites. We even had shaved ice on offer, although it was still a little too early season-wise. Come summer, that’d probably become a top seller. I made sure the ice was shaved into thin, tiny strips so they gently melted in your mouth, and there were gobs of sweet syrup poured over every bowl. It was truly a treat that reigned supreme—and I know, because I tried it myself.</p>
<p>Take a walk down there, and you were greeted with the fragrant aromas of cooking soy sauce and sugary fruit flavors. Lots of people were working hard for this day, and it showed. I’d used Thought <a id="page-119"></a>Communication to send images of the food I had in mind to everyone involved, and the able hands of Shuna and her staff had made most of my suggestions a reality. Then Mjöllmile worked out all the logistics for the food stalls—and, for some reason, Veldora was opening a grilled-food joint of his own.</p>
<p>Hinata, according to Yuuki, had checked out the whole scene yesterday, deciding exactly where she wanted to visit.</p>
<p>“Wow. Hey, maybe Hinata’s a bigger fan of junk food than she looks, huh?”</p>
<p>“Hey, join the club,” he replied. “You’re right, though. It’s kind of surprising.”</p>
<p>Learning this unexpected fact about Hinata was a welcome surprise…I think. At the very least, I knew now she wasn’t afraid to toss big money around on a whim, so she’d definitely be a favored customer of ours. I <em>was</em> a bit worried, though. Hopefully she doesn’t set a bad example for the kids…</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">So I headed to the reception hall with Benimaru and Yuuki. By the time we did, Rigurd was already going over today’s schedule with the large noble contingent on hand.</p>
<p>“Ah, Sir Rimuru! That was an excellent speech earlier!”</p>
<p><em>Um, was it?</em> Seeing Rigurd look so happy about it warmed me up. Guess it didn’t go so badly after all. Good, good. I returned Rigurd’s smile.</p>
<p>“Now, everybody, let me guide you to our first attraction of the day!”</p>
<p>He began to walk off, leading the group to our first stop—a building right nearby the reception hall. This was our concert hall, its interior remodeled at breakneck speed, but the results looked better than I expected. The high-quality seats were lined up in rows oriented based on our acoustic calculations. Our visitors each sat at their assigned chairs without complaint.</p>
<p>Compared to Japan, I couldn’t help but be biased against this world’s level of culture. I’m sure people on the other side would <a id="page-120"></a>think the same of me, but regardless, those were my feelings. There was a robust art scene, and this world didn’t lose out to my old one much in terms of painting or music—but that applied only to the noble ranks. It served as a diversion for them, something on which to lavish money and time. Whenever a city developed itself to an advanced enough level, the angels would start attacking it—and thanks to that, the ruling classes tended to isolate and conceal scientific research to some extent. Art was the same way, and generally, patrons of the arts saw such work as something to commission and enjoy strictly for themselves.</p>
<p>Personally, I think culture is something nurtured by all of society. There’s genius lurking all over the world, and in such a close-knit art scene, that genius is not only hard to dig up but may likely not be discovered at all. Art, and creative activity, can be enjoyed only when one has room for it in their lives. It’s almost too extravagant to expect that much from this world, but I wasn’t willing to give up. I wanted to search far and wide for that hidden genius, and to achieve that, I needed to start by spreading culture from my own nation. This concert event today was our first step.</p>
<p>A lot of musical instruments in this world resembled the ones I was familiar with. We even had a piano, surprisingly enough—found in Clayman’s mansion, of course. That demon lord was living a stereotypical life of nobility, and we uncovered a large cache of instruments in one of the many ornately decorated rooms in his manor.</p>
<p>There were many among the monster races with an ear for music. There was a tradition for yearly festivals, for one, featuring flute- and drum-based rhythms. And thanks to lending those instruments to the more musically inclined among my people, we were starting to see some budding prodigies.</p>
<p>I had given some practice instruments to those interested, teaching the basics of reading sheet music. That was about as far as my own expertise went, but then my good friend Raphael stepped up. Between the music textbooks I had in Japan and the instrument-related knowledge from the library in this world, Raphael was able to collate all those data and put them together in <a id="page-121"></a>a single volume. The guy was even able to rebuild knowledge I had long forgotten. I couldn’t be more grateful.</p>
<p>After that, of course, it’d all come down to the monsters’ own efforts. It’s really true—if you like something, you get better at it. And in a flash, we had monsters picking the instruments of their choice and improving at them by leaps and bounds. I also had some sheet music re-created from what I remembered from my past—I don’t have perfect pitch or anything, but it didn’t matter to Raphael, who edited and arranged everything just right. I’d worry about infringing on someone’s rights, but copyright organizations—and the concept of copyrights, for that matter—didn’t exist in this world. If someone finds out, hopefully they’ll turn the other cheek for the sake of our cultural expansion.</p>
<p>Violins formed our main inventory, accompanied by trumpets, kettle drums, and so forth. Finding a piano was itself a surprise, but seeing monsters play it like it was the easiest thing in the world was positively moving. I suppose you could debate whether a piano belongs in an orchestra or not, but I didn’t lose sleep over the question. If there was demand for the piano as a way to express yourself, no need to deny it.</p>
<p>I personally had no musical talent, so I just let the monsters do what they wanted. The results had been personally guaranteed by Mjöllmile, and today, I’d be hearing them for the first time. Excitedly, nervously, I waited for things to begin.</p>
<p>Once everyone was in their seats, the lights slowly began to dim as the curtain rose. It revealed a group of performers, all dressed in the same formal wear—a hodgepodge of races and species, each with the instrument of their calling; some humanlike, others closer to animals, but all brimming with confidence and pride in their instruments. A halfling, apparently the conductor, advanced to the front of the stage, giving the audience a deep bow.</p>
<p class="space-break">That, I think, was the boy who had come wailing at me once, crying about how there was no work he could do. “<em>No</em>,” I said, “<em>of course that’s not true</em>”—but he was too weak for construction <a id="page-122"></a>work, he wasn’t good at math, and he tried farming but didn’t last long. He then volunteered for our armed forces, but he wasn’t very good in a fight, either.</p>
<p>The thing about him was, he was great at motivating other people to perform. He had a repertoire of songs he’d sing to help people unify and come together. I think I wound up recommending him to the military band…and while I was at it, I gave him the name of Baton.</p>
<p class="space-break">Baton now lifted his head, his face colored with intense passion. He turned to the stage, taking in the curious stares from the upper-crust audience. He was small, but his back seemed to loom large from my vantage point.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>It’s always so fortunate when you can find what you’re truly good at.</p>
<p>The conductor’s baton rose, and then the music began. It started with an easy, gentle melody but then transformed, growing solemn and grave. Under Baton’s conducting, the musicians moved in perfect harmony, each of them having discovered something they could be proud of as well.</p>
<p>The music they played charmed the hearts of listeners, making them wonder if this exact moment was the best in their whole lives. It was classical—in terms of being from olden times—with the nuance of spanning generations to be recognized as a masterpiece. Some pieces soothed the heart; some sent it soaring to grand heights; some stirred up your courage. One masterpiece came after the other, created by this small band of geniuses. This group, some of whom weren’t even literate, worked so hard to study the music—and now the fruits of their labor echoed beautifully across the hall. Nobody would dismiss them as useless now, and if anyone did, I think I’d punch them out. That’s just how wonderful their playing was.</p>
<p>I had gone to classical concerts maybe two or three times in Japan, but these guys didn’t lose out to them at all, no. I never expected to see music played at such a high level over here. Yuuki, too, closed <a id="page-123"></a>his eyes and listened; I’m sure it was nostalgic for him. I almost wanted to start bragging to him: <em>See? What do you think of</em> that<em>?</em></p>
<p>As I thought about this, the sound came to a close. Then the next piece began—one of my favorite anime opening songs.</p>
<p><em>You’re kidding me.</em> They shifted gears from classical to anime? Like it was the most natural thing in the world? And <em>that</em> was followed by a pop tune. Yuuki’s eyes were no longer closed—they were open and staring right at me. <em>Stop that, man. I’m not the culprit here.</em> After all, the guy who read my memories to create that sheet music was…</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>Understood. My selection prioritized those pieces in my master’s memory data, which provided him with the most psychological satisfaction.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">Raphael seemed a little too proud in that reply. But I couldn’t make any excuses. It was going so <em>well</em>, too! Now the effect seemed kind of ruined. I mean, I <em>liked</em> these songs, yes, but hearing them played with such solemn grandeur in a concert hall just didn’t seem right at all. Yuuki, no doubt thinking the same thing, began to snicker a little.</p>
<p>But it was only Yuuki and I who felt jarred by this. It made sense if you thought about it, but everybody else in the audience was listening to this music for the first time. They’d have no idea where it came from—and Raphael’s musical arrangements were a perfect match for the scene. They’d have nothing to be suspicious about. And whether they were used to the classics or not, I could tell they were enrapt with all this new music they were experiencing.</p>
<p>The orchestral pieces dominated the hall, and the crowd was perfectly quiet as they sat there at full attention. The music from Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, Tchaikovsky, Wagner, and other anonymous geniuses was charming the nobility of this world.</p>
<p>I had to call this concert a great success. Anyone in attendance for this performance had to admit it—even if played by monsters, these tones, these melodies were sheer beauty. Even the anime tracks, in their capable hands, compared favorably with the historical <a id="page-124"></a>classics—and the pop music grabbed your heart like it’s supposed to; the rock revved you up like it’s meant to.</p>
<p>Thus, with enthusiasm taking hold among the audience, the final selection came to a close.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><em>It’s over?</em></p>
<p>The concert lasted only sixty minutes, but it felt so packed, like an eternity had passed. We had planned to end things here; Mjöllmile told me he had arranged for an hour-long set in the morning and afternoon. Much of the audience wouldn’t know a great deal about music, so we opted for shorter sets to keep their attention, without an intermission. This was an experiment for all of us, so we put these measures in place to keep the procedure as simple as possible.</p>
<p>I was only briefed on this; the details were all worked out by the people in front of me. I was proud of them. Standing up tall, I was about to celebrate their success with as much applause as I could muster…when Baton bowed and swung his director’s stick.</p>
<p>Instantly, all the lighting was extinguished. The crowd began to nervously murmur—but it lasted only a moment. Then the spotlight was turned on a single onstage figure, a touchingly sweet woman with light-pink hair—Shuna. She was in a sleeveless party dress, bursting with an allure you didn’t often see from her. And there was another with her—a beauty with purple hair, lit by another spotlight. Was that Shion? I didn’t recognize her at first, what with the slip dress she had on instead of her usual business suit.</p>
<p>Shion stood there like a fantastic vision, as if lit by the moon. Her dress took on a transparent feel depending on the light, revealing a sexier side you didn’t often feel from her. She really was a dignified beauty—until she opened her mouth, at least—and this presentation further accentuated that beauty.</p>
<p>They went up to the front, in their respective spotlights, and bowed deeply. That alone captured your attention, like a fine work of art—but seriously, what were they about to do here? I hated to think it, but…</p>
<p><a id="page-125"></a>The spotlight moved, and Shuna moved with it to the piano—one that sat in place, untouched, the whole performance. Shion, meanwhile, picked up a violin. There was no longer any doubt. They were about to play a duet. Shuna, maybe I could picture as a pianist—but Shion at the violin? Were we really safe, having her play in front of such an influential audience? I recalled the assorted disasters she had engineered with her food in the past—if her musical skill matched that, it could spell doom for us all…</p>
<p>…Or maybe not? I mean, there was no way Shuna would allow that. And Mjöllmile seemed so confident, too, didn’t he? He was virtually staking his life on this whole event, and I doubted he’d let Shion throw a monkey wrench into the works.</p>
<p><em>Let’s believe in them.</em> I closed my eyes, still a bit wary as I waited for the performance.</p>
<p>It began with a slow piano tune accompanied by an intense, impassioned violin melody. Then suddenly, the tone changed. In a way, it felt more like a duel than a duet—but the extreme force behind Shion’s melody seemed to reflect her own disposition, and Shuna’s piano playing (much like Shuna herself) gently enveloped it. The intensity and softness intermingled, accentuating each other in impressive harmony.</p>
<p>Ahhh… This was good. I drowned in the waves of profoundly expressive sound, shaken to my soul. <em>This</em> was different. It wasn’t something you could accomplish with stopgaps. This was the result of innate discipline. It made sense, given Shuna’s roots as an oracle and Shion’s role in protecting her. Music is an indispensable part of any religious rite…and maybe that’s why Shuna and Shion’s melodies seemed to hit me right in the heart.</p>
<p class="space-break">Silence. The dreamlike moment was over—it seemed like forever, but not even five minutes had passed.</p>
<p>When I snapped out of it, I attempted to give them thunderous applause. But before I could, I heard staccato clapping break the quiet. Darn. I was hoping to be first, but I had the rug taken out from under me. I joined the clapping, craning my neck to see whose lead I was following.</p>
<p><a id="page-126"></a>Shockingly, it was Luminus, disguised as a maid in the employ of the two paladins in attendance. She heartily applauded the performers, looking gloriously satisfied. I tried to keep up—and soon, other clapping overlapped with ours.</p>
<p>The reaction was cacophonous. Elmesia, Heavenly Emperor of Thalion; Gazel, king of the Dwarven Kingdom; all the nobility of the Western Nations; Milim and Frey… Even Middray, a man I wouldn’t expect to be very cultured. They all stood up and sent out their applause. This tradition of clapping was the same in this world, it seemed; I wasn’t sure if a long-gone otherworlder had brought it in or if it was just always that way.</p>
<p>What I <em>did</em> quickly learn, however, was that this world didn’t have a custom of giving encores. Public artistry in itself wasn’t a common thing, so I suppose that should have been obvious. Thus I assumed we were done here, but apparently not. Darkness fell on the hall once more, before the entire stage was relit and the orchestra—with Shuna’s piano and Shion’s violin this time—played one final song to round things out.</p>
<p>Music, and art in general, has a way of tearing down barriers. Seeing this concert unfold, I wanted to believe, for just a moment, that there’re things out there that everyone in the world truly can find wondrous.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">The concert was a monster hit. It was the only topic on visitors’ lips as we retired to the reception for a light lunch.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t that just wonderful?”</p>
<p>“Ah, what can I say…?”</p>
<p>“I had my eyes closed, taking it in from start to finish!”</p>
<p>“Me too. And who cares whether it was man or monster? Those melodies are still in my ears!”</p>
<p>“Indeed. Quality is quality. That’s all there is to it.”</p>
<p>Based on my eavesdropping, it sounded like high praise. And at least one member of the crowd was going up to me now.</p>
<p>“Um… Sir Rimuru, I would very much like to hear this <a id="page-127"></a>performance again. What can I do to gain such an opportunity, if I could?”</p>
<p>“We’ll be holding the concert regularly over the next three days,” I told him, but I suppose we should consider a more regular performing schedule. Our song repertoire wasn’t <em>that</em> vast yet, but I was sure it’d grow going forward. Having more chances to show it off would provide more practice motivation, besides.</p>
<p>“That was a fine performance,” Luminus whispered to me as we passed by in the hall. “I enjoyed it more than I expected to.”</p>
<p>Quite a compliment, I thought; she didn’t strike me as the sort to offer praise freely. I should probably consider that a five-star review.</p>
<p>“Shion was certainly a surprise,” I commented to Benimaru.</p>
<p>“I’m sure she was. But… Well, despite all appearances, Shion has always had a good sense of rhythm. She certainly seemed extraordinarily compatible with that ‘violin’ instrument as well. And Shuna, too… I didn’t know she could play piano, but she always did enjoy singing. It does not surprise me.”</p>
<p>It all made sense to him. He apparently knew they were good singers, and come to think of it, I remember them breaking out a happy tune or two as they went about their business. It made me realize, despite my intentions, that I still didn’t really know everyone very well.</p>
<p class="space-break">After lunch, we had our science presentation scheduled for the afternoon. I followed Rigurd as he guided the crowd of nobility, still keyed up from the morning’s events. We passed by the concert hall from before, this time heading straight for the museum. Our destination was the historical archives inside, as much as it seemed odd for nobility to be in there.</p>
<p>Gabil and Vester awaited us at the entrance. Being a former Dwargon minister, Vester was immediately recognizable to a few in the crowd, eliciting murmurs of surprise. Vester himself paid it no mind, flashing a smile as he greeted the tour.</p>
<p>The two of them guided us into the building.</p>
<p>“Inside this case is the first healing potion that Sir Rimuru ever created. It is a complete extraction from hipokute herbs with all <a id="page-128"></a>impurities removed. It boasts ninety-nine percent purity, and while it is not quite up to the level of a Revival Elixir, its healing qualities are equivalent to a Full Potion.”</p>
<p>I listened to Vester talk as we went along. Then I realized we had made a mistake. Vester was offering valid, thorough guidance, yes, but to those without scientific knowledge, it must’ve been incredibly boring. I could already see a few people tuning him out, staring at the ceiling.</p>
<p>That, and we had scheduled this all wrong. If we held the tech demo in the morning, everyone would be awake, refreshed, and perhaps more open to this guided tour. I didn’t think we’d have so much disengagement anyway. But thanks to the thrill of that morning concert, all this scientific mumbo-jumbo must seem like such a letdown. Besides, think about it. We were entertaining people from royal courts and noble mansions. They might care about the things we produced, but with most of them, they couldn’t care less about <em>how</em> they were made.</p>
<p>Vester must’ve picked up on this. He snickered a bit.</p>
<p>“Ah, but I see I am bogging all of you down in needless detail. Let’s turn our attention elsewhere, then, and stage a scientific experiment.”</p>
<p>He exchanged a look with Gabil, who nodded back.</p>
<p>“In this experiment, we will pursue what healing potion <em>is</em>, exactly, as much as we can. Diluting this Full Potion to twenty percent strength creates High Potion, used to treat serious injuries. Dilute this further, and you create twenty doses of Low Potions. That should show you just how effective a Full Potion can be.”</p>
<p>Gabil lined up bottles of all three potions on a table. “If any of us is currently dealing with an injury,” he said, “we would be able to test out the effectiveness of each potion, but it would be barbaric to hurt ourselves for the sake of experimentation. Thus we have come up with rather an interesting experiment.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Vester brought in a broken sword.</p>
<p>“So will a potion fix this sword?” asked Gabil. “Does one of you have the answer to that question?”</p>
<p>“Rubbish! Hipokute herbs only work on living things!”</p>
<p><a id="page-129"></a>The shouted reply came from a man dressed in magician’s garb—perhaps the court sorcerer for one kingdom or another. He totally dismissed the idea, and it looked like he had the intelligence to back up that answer.</p>
<p>Gabil laughed and nodded. “Yes, of course. At the very least, there is no way this Low or High Potion could ever be effective against a sword.”</p>
<p>That much was obvious. There wasn’t much need to stage an experiment. What was Gabil—and Vester, for that matter—getting at with this question?</p>
<p>“So the question is, how far does that rule apply? What do all of you think?”</p>
<p>More protests from the crowd. They must have thought Gabil and Vester were treating them like idiots. Things were even getting a little raucous—I know this wasn’t what they were expecting, but sheesh, pipe down.</p>
<p>But how far could you apply healing potions, huh? Well, they worked on people, of course, as well as animals, plants, and monsters. Where’s the threshold, then, the boundary between effective and ineffective? This was actually kind of fascinating. Is being “alive” or not the main thing? Probably not. It was the presence of a consciousness that likely made the difference.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>Report. Plants have a consciousness as well. A consciousness has its roots in the soul, a collection of the spiritual particles that form magicules. Its presence, or lack thereof, is thought to be the difference.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">Right. Plants have wills—maybe they’re not fully sentient, but they have a desire to keep living. But swords don’t have “souls,” and therefore no wills. They’re just things, so obviously…</p>
<p>…But hang on. Something just occurred to me. Didn’t Kaijin say that swords <em>do</em> have wills of their own? No way…?!</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… I would like to know as well. And the desire to know provides the entryway to new discoveries.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. And trust me, I ordered him to not conduct this ridiculous <a id="page-130"></a>experiment at first. I called him a fool in my mind, for that matter. But I was the only fool in the room. I was so bound by the laws of common sense, I forgot my original drives as a researcher.”</p>
<p>Vester smiled warmly as he sprinkled some Full Potion on the broken sword. Then—just a little, but enough so that everyone could see—the sword reacted.</p>
<p>“““…?!”””</p>
<p>“And here is the answer. While it does not fully rebuild the sword, we are clearly seeing the early signs of repair here.”</p>
<p>“R-ridiculous…”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it. Healing potion could be used for <em>this</em>…?”</p>
<p>The tour group couldn’t hide their astonishment. I could see why. It flew in the face of common sense; you’d have a hard time <em>not</em> being surprised—and that included me. I had no idea they were conducting experiments not even I could anticipate the results of. They didn’t give me any report on this, which only added to the shock.</p>
<p>“Of course, you will only see these effects on arms and armor that matured past a certain level. The weapon must be made of magisteel, at the very least—and it will not give a reaction unless it has been used regularly by its owner.”</p>
<p>Ah. So it’d have no effect unless the sword had a will instilled in it.</p>
<p>“…Why,” Gazel asked Gabil in his low, stentorian voice, “did you want to know something like that?”</p>
<p>“It’s simple, my lord. I found it difficult to believe that plants and vegetation growing in the wild have wills of their own—but after experimentation, we found that healing potions work perfectly fine on them.”</p>
<p>Now that we had Full Potion mass manufacturing underway, there was a decent quantity to work with. Thus they had been trying it on all sorts of things. Certainly, the desire to learn was the first step toward new discoveries. I recalled the experiments we did in grade school science class, challenging ourselves to do things that seemed pointless at first. Gabil had that same spirit—the first thing’s to just try it out.</p>
<p><a id="page-131"></a>So it worked on plants, restoring damaged tree bark and producing new buds from broken branches.</p>
<p>“I then remembered the existence of dryads,” Gabil said. “Vegetation may have only a weak consciousness at first, but over many months and years of life, they can evolve into powerful monsters, can they not? But as I thought, this may only happen under certain conditions.”</p>
<p>Around half the audience was taking a keen interest in this explanation. I’d expect the more quick-witted among them to be fascinated, yes. This was the kind of research I’d normally want to keep confidential, after all. Should I let Gabil keep going? The thought, as mean-spirited as it felt, crossed my mind, but I hurriedly brushed it away as I listened on.</p>
<p>“The only things that react to healing potion are those already intertwined with magicules. Things with no magicules to them at all show no reaction in our testing. What this means is that magicules house consciousness itself—or, at least, the two are deeply related.”</p>
<p>“Yes. And when Sir Gabil presented these data, it led me to reconsider my thoughts as well. Soon, a question arose in my mind: What <em>are</em> magicules?”</p>
<p>Magicules were one of this world’s unique substances, freely spread around the atmosphere like oxygen. They were the engine for all kinds of mysterious forces, and people could wield them to do their bidding, to some extent.</p>
<p>“So we have a sample from a certain plant here… And over in this other room, I can show you an enlarged picture of it.”</p>
<p>We followed Vester to another room, a large, spacious chamber with chairs lined up in rows—something like an AV-equipped college lecture hall. It had a projector, still in the trial testing phases, and there was a stretched-out white sheet on the wall to serve as a screen. Gazel curiously observed the projector but remained politely quiet about it, realizing now was not the time. That’s Gazel for you—mature enough to pick the right time and place.</p>
<p>Once everyone was seated, Gabil turned on the projector, a device with light-based magic inscriptions that let it project color images <a id="page-132"></a>on the screen. The chamber’s lights dimmed as the image appeared, surprising a few in the audience.</p>
<p>“Take a look at this image,” Vester said, ignoring the chatter. “It shows the structure of the plant sample you saw before. And this is the structure of some grass, the type you see growing anywhere…”</p>
<p>He placed the enlarged images next to each other. I didn’t get why Vester was acting so haughty here—“<em>a certain plant</em>” and so on. <em>What’s his aim?</em></p>
<p>“…Are they not the same? I don’t see any difference…”</p>
<p>“No, me neither. Why aren’t they the same?”</p>
<p>The voices in the crowd were met with wide agreement. A few of them weren’t as sure—“<em>that</em> part is different”; “no, <em>that</em> part is”—but I doubted any of them were on the mark. So what was the answer?</p>
<p>“Now, let’s enlarge these further.”</p>
<p>“What do you think? They look just the same, don’t they?”</p>
<p>Vester and Gabil flashed villainous smiles—and then they revealed the trick.</p>
<p>“The plant in the first picture is hipokute herb. The second one is a simple weed we picked from a lawn in town. Do they look the same to you?”</p>
<p>Vester’s question made things begin to dawn on some of the audience. What they saw unnerved them. Hurriedly, they spoke up.</p>
<p>“They <em>aren’t</em> the same. The difference is clear if you look closer!”</p>
<p>“That’s mean of you, Sir Vester. How can we tell the difference just from <em>those</em> images?”</p>
<p>Hipokute was a rare herb. I’d dined on quite a bit of it in the cave Veldora was sealed in; it’s famously the core ingredient of healing potion. Most would assume it’s structured far differently from the grass you step on every day. But a few people, myself included, found Vester’s question <em>very</em> disturbing. Gazel was one of them; I could see the blood drain from his face.</p>
<p>We were showing that hipokute and regular grass were both structured in the same way—proof that, essentially, they <em>were</em> the same. It begged the question of what, exactly, constituted a rare herb—which, in turn, had the potential to overturn common sense itself.</p>
<p><a id="page-133"></a>Vester lifted his arms up high, that sinister smile still on his face.</p>
<p>“Quiet! Quiet, please!”</p>
<p>He and Gabil waited for things to settle down. When they did, he placed a series of images on the projector.</p>
<p>“Squeezing the extract from hipokute and combining its magicules together creates healing potion. The level of this fusion process, as you all know, depends on the properties of the extract produced—and while we cannot go into details, we have successfully refined this extraction process to a purity level of ninety-nine percent. That is how a Full Potion is made.”</p>
<p>Through a variety of images (while still hiding the core technology), Vester explained the potion-making process.</p>
<p>“Now we move on to hipokute leaves. Grinding these leaves and combining their magicules produces a salve that can close wounds, although the effect is not dramatic. This makes sense, since these ground leaves are simply the leavings from the extraction process.”</p>
<p>An image of a leaf filled the screen. The leaf was shown being ground, then mixed with the extract from before to create an ointment—the basic process behind it. Nothing unnatural. I didn’t get where Vester was going with it.</p>
<p>“Now, everyone, look at this image.”</p>
<p>On one side, you had leaves from hipokute herbs grown in our cave; on the other was regular grass. They looked totally different. There was no way they’d have the same organic structure…but as the images flashed by, changes began to occur on the hipokute side.</p>
<p>“Do you see? I only came to notice out of sheer coincidence. Sir Rimuru has ordered me to work on our hipokute cultivation project, but one day, I took an interest in the strained leaves from our extraction process. Making ointment from it is well and good, but it has to be kept under exacting conditions or it quickly loses its effect. Plus, compared to the liquid extract used to make potions, its effect is extremely weak. I didn’t give it much thought, since we had other uses for the extract, but if you think about it, do we really need this ointment? So as I said, I began to look at the strained leaves…”</p>
<p>…And then Gabil realized that the shape of these post-extraction <a id="page-134"></a>leaves, now free of magicules, was different from the hipokute currently growing in the cave. Shocked, Gabil decided to take more detailed records, resulting in the images he was showing us now.</p>
<p>“So at the conclusion of all this, we’ve found that, technically speaking, there is <em>no such thing</em> as a hipokute plant. The plants we call hipokute are actually mutations…”</p>
<p>“Yes!” exclaimed an excited Vester. “And it’s not that hipokute grows in magicule-rich areas—it’s the magicule concentration itself that causes this mutation and creates hipokute from simple grass!”</p>
<p>I could see why he was excited. Everyone who heard him immediately began talking.</p>
<p>“That… That’s a major discovery!”</p>
<p>“S-Sir Vester, this is <em>not</em> the type of thing to announce in a place like this! There could have been some more appropriate occasion… You must contact a scientific society or the like at once and follow the proper announcement procedure!”</p>
<p>It was chaos inside the room. Even those who didn’t take much interest before couldn’t stay silent now—and the audience members who had been paying attention from the start were even more astounded. It was beyond anything they imagined, and the “<em>not the type of thing to announce</em>” remark symbolized just how much it roiled the crowd. Gazel, too, had his eyes wide open, and even Elmesia and Erald were discussing matters with each other.</p>
<p>I was surprised, too. I never gave it much thought before, but the way they put it, it made sense. It was pretty obvious, in fact. I doubted Veldora just <em>happened</em> to be sealed off in a cave full of hipokute herbs. If that was the result of a mutation—or a plant evolution—that was more convincing. And once all the magicules were extracted from this plant during processing, its shape went back to the plain old grass it once was. The dried, strained samples projected on the screen made it obvious that they shared the same organic structure as regular grass.</p>
<p>In which case, no wonder Gabil thought potions could heal swords. Metal might mutate into magisteel ore, just like grass mutated into hipokute, and it was that ore that was processed to make magisteel weapons. Put the pieces together, and anyone <a id="page-135"></a>would wonder if healing potion could work on magisteel as well. The result: the experiment we saw earlier.</p>
<p>“My original question,” Vester continued, “of the exact nature of magicules remains unanswered. Monsters, and magic-born, are exposed to the effects of these magicules—that much is evident. But what about demi-humans? If you took all the magicules out of their body, would they go back to being humans? I have boundless questions along these lines, but investigating them could prove fiendishly difficult.”</p>
<p>“Despite this, we intend to continue our research. And in this land, where some of the world’s greatest minds are gathering, we promise to keep pursuing the answers…and with that, we close our science presentation.”</p>
<p>“To everyone who came out to attend—”</p>
<p>““Thank you very much!””</p>
<p>Gabil and Vester bowed and spoke in perfect sync. They must’ve worked the presentation out in pretty deep detail; I don’t think this was the first time they’d run through this lecture.</p>
<p>The content, however, was excellent. I had left it all to them, but it really grabbed your attention—and what’s more, it spread the word about great discoveries while keeping all the key parts a secret. Most important of all—we didn’t have to worry about anyone copying our technology with what we revealed. Changing the nature of plants with magicules was a grand discovery, but it wasn’t something other nations could easily replicate. They could experiment with it, but it wouldn’t let them mass-produce hipokute or anything.</p>
<p>Our position of superiority remained firm—and our research continued. As Gabil said, great minds were gathering here, and we’d have more before long. In a land so blessed with magicules as this one, we could do all the experimentation we wanted.</p>
<p class="space-break">Overall, this scientific presentation was a major shock to the attendees. After a morning spent enjoying fine music, this afternoon stimulated their intellectual curiosities. I’d leave it to the audience to decide which was more enriching, but given how much interest both events generated, I’d definitely call them a success.</p>
