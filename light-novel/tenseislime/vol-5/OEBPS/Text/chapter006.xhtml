<p class="cotx"><span class="merge__be">After Rimuru set off for battle, the residents of the town assembled in the central plaza and began to pray. It wasn’t out of sentiment, but for real work reasons. Shuna was commanding them, as part of her efforts to keep the barrier up.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The stronger ones were set in place so they could better protect the fringes of town, out of concern for intruders. At the same time, Shuna released a stream of magical force within the barrier, boosting the number of magicules in the air.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">All of them had a firm grasp of their role—and all were deadly serious about carrying it out.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">In the middle of the plaza, the bodies of Shion and the other victims were laid to rest, kept in good condition by Shuna’s magic. There was a throne in the middle for Rimuru, an enshrinement site for his demon lord–evolution ceremony. The hope was that performing the evolution as close to the victims as possible would make it that much more likely they’d be resurrected.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The townspeople surrounded the whole site—Shuna among them, standing next to Mjurran. And as she stood there, Shuna couldn’t help but think:</span> <em>Rimuru seemed to care a great deal about being a former human…but that’s such a trivial issue.</em> <span class="merge__be">To Shuna and everyone else, soul-to-soul connections mattered the most, and the connection she shared with him gave her an absolute sense of security. She wished Rimuru would realize that as well. The eternal euphoria he provided filled her soul, nourishing it. If that went away and Rimuru disappeared, she thought it might drive her crazy. Just imagining it produced such a profound sense of loss that she shivered.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sir Rimuru,” she whispered. “As long as we have him, that’s all that matters. But even missing one of us could upset his mental balance greatly.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Benimaru, just back to the plaza, nodded at this. It made sense to him. The transformation that the usually gregarious Rimuru made, he was convinced, might impact that balance heavily. To him, he wanted to believe that life would go back to what it was someday.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I just hope he doesn’t turn into a different person as a demon lord. Going berserk on us…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With the barrier destruction work done, all of them—Benimaru, Soei, Hakuro, Geld, Rigur, Gobzo, even Gabil—were now surrounding the throne. That was on Rimuru’s orders; he’d asked them to kill him at once, should he lose all sense of reason and turn into an uncontrollable beast up there. No matter what, they wanted to keep that from happening—all of them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It’s because you keep on sleeping there, Shion,” Benimaru whispered before returning to his prayers. “Just wake up already…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His faith wasn’t in some god up above. It was in a single slime. That faith had never betrayed him before, and it shouldn’t this time. Everyone believed that; no one doubted it.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Just then:</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Report. The individual Rimuru Tempest’s Harvest Festival is about to begin. Upon its completion, all monsters in his genealogy will receive their due gifts.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The World Language echoing in the hearts of every monster gathered in town sent a shock wave of tension across the land. Everything had gone as planned; Rimuru had successfully crushed the invading force and begun his evolution. Now it was everyone else’s turn to pitch in.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Brace yourselves! Our master is victorious. Now is the time for us to wield our own powers!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Everyone on hand voiced their approval of Benimaru’s words. Things had begun to move. Losing Shion and the rest could very well destroy Rimuru’s heart forever. They all needed to do everything they could right now to prevent that.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">After some time, Rimuru returned, carefully ferried over on Ranga’s back. As directed, he was taken to the throne and laid to rest.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Benimaru took this moment to think about what he would ask Rimuru when he awoke, to ensure he was still in full grasp of his reason.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“All right,” he’d suggested at the conference earlier, “I will ask you, ‘What do you think of Shion’s cooking?’”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sure,” Rimuru had muttered. “And then I’ll say it’s shitty, right? How’d you come up with</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">question? Is that really the best thing to ask…?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It had been Benimaru’s idea, of course. He hadn’t forgotten about how he was always having her latest creations tested out on him—and the boundless pain and suffering that resulted. But now…if Shion could listen to that conversation and it enraged her enough to wake her up…they could hope for nothing more. Beyond that, all they had to do was carry out the duties they’d discussed earlier.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">And that was why Benimaru missed it. He was too worked up with performing the procedure exactly as planned to think at all about what these “gifts” might be. But even</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">was quietly beginning its preparations, ready to manifest itself in reflection of his subconscious thoughts…</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Rimuru was in a deep sleep. His consciousness was gone; he was an irregular, unresolved blob, not even able to retain his usual streamlined form. And there, in the deep, deep darkness beyond the reaches of Rimuru’s consciousness:</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Report. The Harvest Festival has begun. Your bodily structure will be reconstructed in order to evolve you into a new species.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cy">Confirmed. Super-evolution from type “slime” to type “demon slime”</span><span class="cx">…</span><span class="cy">successful. All bodily attributes have been greatly enhanced. The material and spiritual bodies are now freely transformable. Intrinsic skills Infinite Regeneration, Control Magic, Multilayer Barrier, Universal Detect, Universal Shapeshift, Lord’s Ambition, Enhanced Replication, Spatial Motion, Darkflame Lightning, and Universal Thread acquired. Reacquiring resistances…completed. Cancel Pain, Resist Melee Attack, Cancel Natural Elements, Cancel Ailments, Resist Spiritual Attack, and Resist Holy Attack acquired. Evolution is now complete.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Then, as if responding to its master’s command, the unique skill Great Sage—which never demonstrated having a sense of self before—requested its own evolution.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Report. Re-executing skill acquisition requested earlier. Unique skill Great Sage attempting evolution… Failed.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Failed.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="cw">…</span><span class="cw">Re-executing.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="cw">Failed.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="cw">…</span><span class="cw">Re-executing.</span></p>

<p class="m"><span class="cw">………</span></p>

<p class="m"><span class="cw">…</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">—ENDLESS—</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Report. Unique skill Great Sage attempting evolution, using Deviant as a sacrifice</span><span class="cw">…</span> <span class="cw">Successful. Unique skill Great Sage has evolved into Raphael, Lord of Wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The Great Sage attempted it without sacrificing anything several hundred million times—and then, after a trial-and-error process that seemed like it would last for all of time…</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">…it obtained its Harvest Festival gift—conquering, and evolving, into an</span> <em>ultimate skill</em><span class="merge__be">, the loftiest height possible in the world.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The chances of this working were thought to be so small that it wasn’t even worth considering. It almost seemed like a reward provided for the infinite effort involved with the attempt. Succeeding made it more likely that it could carry out its master’s request, but the supposedly soulless conceptual intelligence bore no happiness. It could never understand emotion.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">But—despite the lack of emotion, the lack of happiness—somehow,</span> <span class="merge__be">it felt fulfilled. And then, with its evolved skill, it carried out its master’s request once more. The way it acted, working incessantly to make its master’s dreams come true, could even be…</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The evolution continued.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Glutton consumed Merciless to become Belzebuth, Lord of Gluttony, perfectly honed to more effectively handle its master’s desires. There, deep in an abyss beyond what Rimuru’s soul could detect, the skill softly, deeply evolved itself—all to make his own dreams come true.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">But the Harvest Festival still wasn’t over.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">The gifts meant to celebrate Rimuru’s evolution were passed out to everyone who had been named by or evolved from him. A raucous festival, indeed—a gift for the one who had evolved from demon lord seedling to true demon lord. And the party was just getting started.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Razen lay in hiding, concealing himself with all his might.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He was lucky to have died once back there. Having fully commandeered Shogo’s skills, he was brought back to life over time by Survivor. Before his brain could even comprehend the unbelievable events taking place before him, his instincts understood and made the right call. They told him: Here was a foe who no one in human form could ever beat. Folgen, his sworn friend, was rendered helpless and killed—not even able to stand before the monster, much less shield King Edmaris.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He wanted to go and rescue his king but stopped himself, knowing that going right now would be a waste of life. So he kept his breath low, playing possum until the masked magic-born left the scene, looking for all the world like a demon lord. He had no access to magic and was facing an attack he couldn’t identify, so fleeing would be difficult in itself.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Just as he came up with this idea, several thousand soldiers died around him. If he moved right now, he’d just be targeted and shot down. It wouldn’t kill him, but attracting that monster’s interest wasn’t a good idea. So he chose to wait and see what unfolded, hoping it’d boost his survival chances at least a little bit.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then he saw—and felt—it. The fear. Even Razen, with his intrinsic resistance to the emotion, was stricken with terror at the sight. Nearly ten thousand surviving soldiers had their lives snuffed out in a single instant.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He had never seen anything like that in his long life. This was beyond anything a champion or otherworlder could pull off. Even if he had a cornucopia of unique skills to choose from, he could never beat that monster. Calamity-class, indeed. Razen had thought of himself as equivalent to a demon lord in strength, but now he knew that was just wishful thinking.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>What is that monster?</em> <span class="merge__be">he asked himself.</span> <em>I’ve never heard of such a thing… Isn’t the leader of the monster nation a slime?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His own heart didn’t break, for the simple fact that he was so driven to save the king he was loyal to. But Razen’s sole desire was not to be fulfilled. His presence had already been detected.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Had he resigned himself to death and attempted a kamikaze charge, maybe he could’ve defeated that monster if he was lucky. He wouldn’t have killed the thing, but he might’ve been able to save his king from the jaws of death. But Razen was too careful. And there were already plans for him.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">A large wolflike monster was summoned to the scene, gingerly carrying the monster (which had turned from a human form into a slime) in its mouth. Using a pair of forked tails, it snatched up King Edmaris and Archbishop Reyhiem, placing them on its back before running off at extraordinary speed. All that remained were three Greater Demons.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="u">Seeing the fearsome masked magic-born turn into a slime, Razen was both surprised and oddly convinced.</span> <em>I knew it. That really</em> <span class="u">was</span> <em>their master. And deploying such great magic spells, one after the other, would easily exhaust his magical energies. If he summoned those demons to serve as bodyguards, then perhaps I will have a chance at rescuing the king…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He was half-right. The demons—in particular,</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">demon—had been summoned. To that one, Razen was nothing more than prey. A poor, forlorn piece of prey, left to live only so this demon could carry out his summoner’s request and be amply rewarded for it.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Figuring he could beat these three demons, Razen rose up from the shadows cast by the dead. Fortunately for him, the masked magic-born canceled the Anti-Magic Area as it cast the demon summon. Now Razen could fight with his full force. Whether they were ranked A or not, there was no way he could lose to only three Greater Demons.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Stretching out his body, he attempted to silently sneak up from behind one of them—only to find that the other two were already standing before him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Oh? Spatial Motion, eh? I suppose you’ve all been serving as Greater Demons for quite a long time.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The two demons didn’t answer him. They showed no signs of movement—they were ordered only to confine him for the demon who was leisurely walking up to the wizard.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Now that demon was alone, in front of Razen.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. Done with your stretching? In that case, it is time to capture you. If you wish to resist, go right ahead. I will not kill you, but I am not prohibited from tormenting you…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The demon flashed a twisted, beautiful smile, its gender unclear as it addressed Razen.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh? You’re here to take me on?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Take you on? Hee-hee-hee. Quite an amusing joke.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What are you calling a joke, you putrid demon?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. Very good,” the demon whispered, its expression still twisted. “This should be quite a bit of fun. Allow me to join you in a bit of post-meal calisthenics.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Its smile was terror itself for anyone witnessing it—terror welling up from the root of the soul.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It looked toward the sky. Razen snorted at the creature.</span> <em>It thinks it’s so clever, trying to feint me with its eyes.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Enough of your lip! Nuclear Cannon!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Utilizing a spell he had precast earlier to save time, he used a simple trigger to set off his last resort. This method, however, ran the risk of an accidental discharge, meaning only wizards and similarly powerful magicians could execute it. The effect, however, was massive. Avoiding the casting time that was the central weakness of any magic-user was huge. From the get-go, Razen was doing what he needed for victory.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The magic he chose was of the nuclear-attack type, the greatest and most sinister of the aspectual magics. Against people, it was the strongest magic in the world. Demons required physical bodies in order to manifest themselves; destroy theirs and Razen was in the clear. They wouldn’t be gone for good, but they’d no longer be able to interact with this world. And before the intense heat this cannon produced, no demon could long continue to exist.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">As far as Razen was concerned, victory was his at this point. But the white-hot rays from his surefire magic were bent away before they could reach the raised left hand of the demon, zooming straight toward a certain point in the sky.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It…misfired? Dah, not now, of all…?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With magic prepared in advance like this, there was a very slim chance that the spell would lose its force and fail upon casting. Razen assumed this was what happened, at the worst time possible for him. He sulkily glared at the demon as he jumped backward and away.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hmm? That was an impressive piece of magic.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What did you say?! It’s pointless if the effect of it doesn’t work.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah. I see. If by ‘effect’ you mean you intended it to defeat me, I would advise you that relying upon magic will not achieve this for you.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The demon seemed almost eerily confident as it addressed Razen. It got on his nerves greatly, but not even Razen could shake off the faint sense of impending doom in his mind.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh,</span> <em>now</em> <span class="merge__be">you’ve said it! In that case, how about this one? Summon Spirit: War Gnome! Come to me, great spirit of the earth’s foundations!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This was Razen’s trump card, the most powerful summon magic he had on hand, and he was ready to fight with it. He had summoned a high-level spirit, one ranked well beyond A. Only a Champion-level opponent would give this all-powerful creature any difficulty. A Greater Demon was no problem at all.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Replying to Razen’s call, the earth began to well up, forming the shape of a knight in solid-looking armor. Sensing the terrific force behind it, Razen finally began to feel confident and relieved. With a spirit of this caliber, he could even take on Arch Demons, the legendary creatures that ranked even above Greater Demons.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>If that magic hadn’t failed to activate, I wouldn’t have had to break this out… But this demon irks me. I have a bad feeling about this. Best not to let my guard down here…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With</span> <em>this</em><span class="merge__be">, Razen thought, no matter how much this opponent unnerved him, he’d be just fine. He intended this magic to mow down not just the demon before him but the other two behind him. Then he could finally set off to rescue King Edmaris.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But:</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I see; I see. Certainly, demons are strong against angels, angels against spirits, and spirits against demons. If selecting based on this three-way relationship, calling for a high-level spirit was the correct response. However…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Even before the War Gnome Razen summoned, the demon was completely unfazed.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…it is too young.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">When did it even move? Even with his senses turned up to maximum, Razen couldn’t trace the demon’s actions fast enough. A large hole opened up in the knight’s strong crystalline armor as a beautiful hand sliced through the spirit’s core, grabbed it, tossed it in its mouth, and chomped down upon it with a frightful crunch.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“There, you see?” The demon snickered at Razen. “It lacks experience that can only be accumulated over years. A puppet like that, nothing but pure strength, is a pushover for me.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You’re kidding! That was a spirit! A greater spirit!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Having his trump card killed instantly put Razen in a state of near panic. Every fiber of his brain told him this was impossible. It just made no sense. A spirit easily the equal of a Greater Demon, not only facing difficulty but being wiped out in one shot.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Enough magic,” the demon said kindly as Razen stewed. “I would like to test out more this body my summoner provided me, so let’s use a different tactic this time.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The demon snapped its fingers, triggering a magic spell. For over a mile in radius around him, an Anti-Magic Area appeared.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Now magic is no longer available to you. Feel free to attack me with your preferred physical strikes.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Razen struggled to understand this.</span> <em>Huh? Why did it shut off the magic? Magic is any demon’s most powerful weapon… And it cast a great magic with no ritual? No spell chanting?! …Ah, but now’s not the time to think about that!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shaking off the cobwebs, Razen stood on his toes, steeling himself. With Shogo’s body in hand, all of the otherworlder’s karate skills were his.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hnh!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With a light exhale, he focused himself and fired a fist at the demon, backing it up with a flurry of kicks. The Berserker unique skill let him pack the greatest punch possible, firing away at the demon with speed impossible to catch with the naked eye. It was a torrent of punches, a rain of kicks that could chop a large tree in two, and soon, they did their damaging work on the defenseless demon—</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>…Wait! No!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Every attack was neatly and cleanly dodged, as if all this was a pre-orchestrated karate demonstration. The demon wasn’t defenseless at all. It was weaving its way through every strike, using skills far beyond what Razen had access to.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Now, for the first time, Razen understood. He was too afraid to notice it at first, but now he was forced to accept it. The demon standing before him. The golden eyes and crimson pupils. The pale skin. The beautiful black hair, the streaks of red and gold within. The way it looked, unlike most demons, so close to a human being.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This was a higher class of demon—and, if anything, Razen’s blind pursuit of ultimate strength was his undoing. He had peered into the dark reaches of the world, pursuing the deepest recesses of magic. His eyes could coldly perceive his own strength, and even among the small clutch of superpowered fighters in the A ranks, he stood head and shoulders above them all. If he didn’t, the waves of terror the demon emitted would alone be enough to make him lose all will to fight—although perhaps that would’ve been a happier fate for him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">That demon’s knowledge, its strength, only worsened Razen’s mood. If he didn’t know—know that this was an Arch Demon at the very least, easily capable of destroying Greater Demons—he wouldn’t be this terrorized. The way the demon cast a great magic without a ritual or casting time—proof that it had reached an abyss even further below what Razen had descended to. That Nuclear Cannon strike wasn’t a misfire at all, and nothing else Razen threw at it worked because this foe was simply that far above Razen in strength.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">If he didn’t have the kind of knowledge he did, Razen might never have noticed how unusual this demon’s strength was. But he had it.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Wait. Is this…a—a Primal…?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With his magic shut off, Razen had no means of escape. Despair painted his heart a deep shade of black.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>What…what kind of horrifying beast did that monster grant a body to and unleash upon this world?!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">If it didn’t have a physical body, at least, it would’ve returned to the demon realms sooner or later. But it was too late—mankind was now exposed to an unprecedented threat.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">As Razen was struck by this terror, a sweet yet terrifying voice reached his ears.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Have you had enough yet? In that case, it’s my turn.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The moment he heard it, his legs shook like jelly as he lost control of his bladder. Now he understood everything, and he could no longer even think of resisting. His steel will was shattered, and in a single instant, his heart broke.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Keff…keff… Ah, ah, ahhhhh…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His terror was impossible to articulate. An Arch Demon was a calamity-level monster, a leadership role in their native realm. They were half-legendary, with only a small handful known to recorded history. Their power was said to rank A-plus, alongside that of higher-level spirits, and they were dangerous enough to even be considered sub–demon lords.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Even against such a dangerous presence, Razen would have been confident in the past that he could win. Over the past few centuries he’d spent protecting the great nation of Farmus, he had defeated an Arch Demon at least once, with the help of several companions. But</span> <em>this</em> <span class="merge__be">demon was different.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>If…if this is one of the Primal Demons…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">…then there was just no chance. Even escape was impossible.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Faced with despair, Razen crumpled to the ground, wailing at the reality this demon had unleashed upon him.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The demon looked disappointed as he watched him. “Oh? It’s over already?” he whispered.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">The other two demons under his command scooped Razen up, resigned looks on their faces, and took him to the designated town. Their first job was done, and they wanted their master to praise them.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Before the eyes of Benimaru and the rest, Rimuru’s body repeatedly transformed itself from a slime to all kinds of irregular shapes. After a while, it calmed down, settling into its usual droplet form—but then it began to glow, eerily flickering on and off. Red, blue, yellow, green, purple, white, black, all kinds of colors.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This went on for a while. Everyone there was starting to lose all sense of time. And after who knows how much of it had passed, the echoes of the World Language resonated in their worried hearts.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="fo">Report. The individual Rimuru Tempest’s Harvest Festival is now complete. Monsters in his genealogy will now begin to receive their gifts.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Then they, too, were greeted with intense exhaustion.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ngh! What is going on?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah…?! Is this our gift? I feel more connected to Sir Rimuru than ever!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Benimaru, Shuna, and the other monsters couldn’t hide their surprise. Now Benimaru realized that Rimuru’s evolution was successfully completed—and it was their turn. Nobody expected this kind of fatigue to arise. The less resistant among them began to fall into a deep sleep. But Benimaru had a promise with Rimuru. He couldn’t afford to fall that easily.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He did his best to fight off the tiredness. And as he did, Rimuru’s body began to shine brightly before him. When the light faded, there stood a fetching figure with long, smooth silver hair flowing in the wind.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was Rimuru, with his mask off, looking a little taller than before. He still didn’t have any physical gender, sadly, but Benimaru couldn’t help but feel a little smitten anyway.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Report. Leave the rest to me and enjoy your slumber.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The soft voice whispered against his mind. It gave Benimaru inner peace; he had nothing with which to defy it. So he let the voice guide him into an irresistible sleep.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">As he watched this unfold, the figure with Rimuru’s form checked to see if anyone else was awake.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">………</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">……</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran looked quizzically at all the people falling asleep around her. One by one, they fell like flies—and now, there was nobody else awake.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The humans and dwarves left in town had all been moved into buildings away from the central plaza. The amount of magicules in the vicinity had grown beyond what most humans could withstand, so they were forced to evacuate the scene. Elen would build a barrier over them, no doubt, as she monitored the proceedings. Yohm and his friends stayed there until the end to protect Mjurran, but they were gone over to Kabal and his gang now, carrying the king of Farmus and the Holy Church archbishop Ranga had brought over. By now they should be fully in Kabal’s custody, unable to escape.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was a good excuse for Yohm to leave, Mjurran thought, given that he could hardly take being in that magicule field any longer. If it wasn’t for that, he probably would’ve stayed right next to her until he died. It gladdened her to know that, even though she knew it was stupid of him. Of course, she wouldn’t actually say that to the man. If she did, Yohm would no doubt let it go to his head and do something even stupider.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was, in other words, evidence that Mjurran wanted Yohm to be safe above all. But it also meant Mjurran was the last person standing in the plaza.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">………</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">……</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The Rimuru-like figure gauged this situation, eyes emotionless. Then, seeing Mjurran and assuming there were no issues, he opened his arms wide, the long silver hair pushed back and emitting a light that shone like angel’s wings.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Report. By the name of Raphael, Lord of Wisdom, I command Belzebuth to consume all the magicules within this barrier. Do not leave even a single soul fragment behind.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">With those words, Belzebuth was activated, a villainous force unleashed upon the world—but one used for a certain goal, tracing each of the results Raphael calculated. Every magicule within the barrier covering the town was absorbed, converting the atmosphere back into pure air. Then the barrier itself was neatly eaten up, and then Belzebuth was halted. It was as if nothing had ever happened to this space at all.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This was Raphael, the figure that took the form of Rimuru, the apparently soulless master. And even now, the Lord of Wisdom was edging his way closer to Shion. Bringing his hands forward, he began to cast Analyze and Assess—carefully, with every intention of making his master’s hopes come true.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">………</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">……</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran watched slack-jawed as all this unfolded. The barrier they had all built over the town was devoured instantly, which was a threat in itself, but beyond that:</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>…This just can’t be!!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The skill had engaged in its own actions, without the will of its master. She could understand if it had been ordered to do so beforehand, but it didn’t seem that way here. This figure seemed closer to a spirit than a monster.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was crazy, but she sensed that it was nothing she could laugh at. All she could do was stay out of the way and watch.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Once he handed over the king of Farmus and the archbishop, Ranga returned to the town entrance and stood guard. Rimuru had ordered him to meet up with the demons, and while he wanted more than anything to be at his master’s side, he had to prioritize his orders before he fell asleep. Deciding between his concerns for Rimuru and his vital orders, he ultimately sided with the latter.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The magic-born Gruecith looked on, bemused, as Ranga waited.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He had been asked by Benimaru—or, really, Shuna, more like—to stay with Ranga just in case something happened. If intruders showed up, he was to call for Benimaru and the others while Ranga engaged them. But there was clearly nobody coming, so Gruecith chatted with Ranga to kill the time.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“That ogre princess Shuna’s quite the magic-user, isn’t she? Fortifying that barrier like it was the easiest thing in the world.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">That barrier kept them from leaving town right now. Them and every other monster in the place, unless Rimuru was with them. Gruecith was no exception to that—the powerful barrier kept him efficiently penned in. It needed to if they wanted to resurrect Shion and all the other victims of that assault earlier.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Benimaru and the others were able to return to town thanks to the intricate workings of Shuna, who had analyzed Mjurran’s great magic and took further measures to improve upon it. It was now set up to keep all magicules inside but also allow anyone to enter the barrier without an issue. A one-way street, in other words.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Theoretically, it was certainly possible, but actually developing the magic was quite a creative feat. But Gruecith was even more preoccupied with how surprised Mjurran looked when she learned about it. He found it cute, that expression of hers, although he would never</span> <em>ever</em> <span class="merge__be">tell anyone else that. Discussing romance with Ranga wouldn’t accomplish much, he figured. Gruecith wasn’t that stupid.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Ranga cheerfully nodded. “Yes. I think the same. Lady Shuna is second only to Sir Rimuru in intelligence.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Generally, monsters in town enjoyed praising one another. Gruecith had the impression that Ranga was a little</span> <em>too</em> <span class="merge__be">complimentary toward his master but he figured it’d be tasteless to bring it up. Besides, he liked that kind of atmosphere. It reminded him of his native Beast Kingdom, where people generally got along in the midst of all their chattering and carrying on.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Lord Carillon is very shrewd, after all. And just as Lord Phobio said, every monster in this town seems so nice.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“By the way, Sir Gruecith, I was wondering about something. I had heard the demon lords Carillon and Milim would be waging war soon…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Ranga gave Gruecith an expectant look, as if to ask whether everything was all right with him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, yeah…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was a topic on Gruecith’s mind as well, but the barrier and its magicule blockage kept him from contacting Eurazania at the moment. He wasn’t</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">concerned, however. It was still three days before the start of combat, and as he said before, he believed that Carillon would win. It seemed like Rimuru was well on his way to becoming a demon lord, so Gruecith also figured he had enough time to see how that all shook out before heading back to help his own master. Besides, the Three Lycanthropeers were there, each far stronger than the likes of him. And as long as they were, no matter how much strength Milim might boast, Gruecith doubted she really meant to wage war.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">No point fretting over things now, he thought. He knew they were all bold and courageous over there, far more than people believed. No, his mind was elsewhere.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Hope they all get resurrected.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His biggest concern was the fate of those sacrificed in battle here. If their resurrection turned sour, there was no doubt that Rimuru would suddenly become a major threat. He could feel that instinctively.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">“It will be all right. Monsters are made of tough stuff. Plus…</span><span class="merge__be">all of us are connected in spirit. As long as we remain under Sir Rimuru’s protection, we will not be defeated that easily.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">“Yeah. I think it’ll probably turn out fine, but…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">“Heh-heh-heh. No need for concern. When my master finishes the evolution, I am sure he will bring everyone back.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">It was a firm declaration, one based on Ranga’s confidence in Rimuru. Perhaps sensing Gruecith’s concern, he wanted to make it clear that the concept of Rimuru going out of control couldn’t be further from his mind.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">“Yeah, no doubt,” Gruecith replied with a smile. Regardless of the potential threat involved, he didn’t want Rimuru to change very much, either. He didn’t serve him, but he admittedly was attracted to his character—and he owed him a lot for saving Mjurran’s life, too.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Of course, the girl I love is with another guy at the moment… Heh. If he was a bastard, I’d have killed him long ago, but if it’s Yohm, I can’t do much about that. I’ll just have to lay low until she inevitably dumps that idiot…or maybe get a</em> <span class="merge__be">little</span> <em>in the way between them, at least…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The lingering attachment was clear in Gruecith’s thoughts. But he didn’t see the point of pursuing the topic.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Man, though, I wasn’t expecting to see a demon lord evolution with my own two eyes…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Nothing to be surprised about. This is Sir Rimuru, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Um, no, I mean…! A monster becoming the seed of a demon lord is something that happens</span> <em>maybe</em> <span class="merge__be">once every few centuries, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“The seed…?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">“Yeah. It proves the world’s recognized them as a powerful-enough</span> <span class="merge__be">monster. The strongest beings in the land. There are only ten of them, Lord Carillon included.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">“Oh? So Rimuru will become the eleventh demon lord?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">“Well, who knows? You can’t say how the other demon lords will respond to this. This whole thing’s ruining the current balance of power among them. There could be some pretty tumultuous years ahead if it goes wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">“If so, then we will protect Sir Rimuru with our own powers!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">“Yeah, well, I’m in the same boat, too. I’ll be a sword for Lord Carillon to wield. I sure hope I don’t have to face off against</span> <em>you</em> <span class="merge__be">guys, though, I’ll say.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Heh-heh-heh. I agree.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">They laughed with each other, glad they were on the same page. The chitchat continued for a while longer.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">………</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">……</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gruecith was expecting absolutely nothing out of the ordinary to happen. But after a decent amount of time passed, Ranga’s eyelids began to droop heavily.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shuna had apparently anticipated this possibility. When a demon lord was born, anyone below them was given a so-called “gift,” a sort of evolution that could not be resisted, and it put the target in a deep sleep.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Gnnh… I—I am not sure I can last much longer. I will sleep…but if I do, my orders… Lord…Gruecith… I need you to…take something on for me, but…will you…?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Apparently, three demons might be coming to the entrance shortly, summoned by Rimuru and ordered to bring over a survivor from Farmus. Ranga hated to pass the buck to him, but he could overcome his fatigue no longer, so he extracted Gruecith’s promise to take care of matters before dejectedly falling asleep.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">There was a single survivor, he heard, and a fairly powerful foe at that. Powerful enough that he could attack and defeat the demons. Gruecith would have to be careful, even though the thought of being trusted so much made him a little happy. So he began patrolling the area, a new spring in his step, as he tried to keep Ranga and the defenseless townspeople safe.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Not half an hour later, they appeared.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, Sir Ranga,” a rather beautiful-looking demon said. “It would appear he’s gone into an evolving sleep.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was a shocking sight for Gruecith. The demons had obviously been granted physical bodies, all far more powerful than your garden-variety summon. Ranga said they were Greater Demons, but these guys were clearly a level above even that. The sheer terror of the sight made his hair stand on end—the loudest alarm bell his own instincts could give him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Whoa, whoa, I’ve never seen the likes of you before. You an Arch Demon?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. That is correct, magic-born.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Even at first sight, the danger this Arch Demon presented was obvious. He felt an overwhelming sense of awe—like what he felt whenever he saw Benimaru or the Three Lycanthropeers. Maybe even more powerful.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. Please don’t be so alarmed,” the demon cheerfully stated. “I am just a nameless demon summoned by the new demon lord. The two behind me are meant to handle the chore work for me, so no need to worry about them.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Chore work?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He gave the pair a look. They were two Greater Demons, one carrying a passed-out man on his back. Both of them possessed enough magic power to pose a formidable threat. They were cer</span><span class="bs">tainly on the same level as a stronger magic-born in terms of com</span><span class="merge__be">bat strength.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And these were</span> <em>Greater Demons</em><span class="merge__be">? Gruecith couldn’t believe it. But he just shrugged and nodded instead of bringing it up.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“All right. Sir Ranga told me to expect three demons here before long. Is that man the survivor of Sir Rimuru’s attack?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It was not an attack. To someone like that, it was just a bit of playtime. Plus, thanks to this man’s surviving, the three of us were summoned here. We’ve been treating him well because we</span> <em>do</em> <span class="merge__be">appreciate that a little.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Treating him well, huh…?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">One could question whether riding on the back of a Greater Demon qualified as kind treatment. Gruecith was too smart to say that out loud, though.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“All right. The magicules are pretty thick in town, so you better protect him with a barrier.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Wouldn’t that be spoiling him a little too much?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…I thought you were treating him well.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, yes. You’re right. Having him die would be very bad for us. We have to be sure</span> <em>he</em> <span class="merge__be">sees us performing well for him.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bt">So Gruecith cast his suspicions aside and decided to guide the demons into town. If they knew Ranga’s name, they had to be the ones Rimuru summoned. They didn’t seem to be under anyone’s thrall—and if there</span> <em>was</em> <span class="bt">someone powerful enough to control these freaks, Gruecith knew he was better off not riling them. Here, too, he demonstrated an uncanny ability to know when to shut up.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">He was just about to turn around and walk into town when the barrier covering it suddenly vanished. Something was up.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What on—?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Mm? I-is this…?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gruecith turned toward the demon for just a moment. “I’m sorry,” he said, “but wait here for me. I’m worried about what’s going on in there!”</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Then he ran off—just as the final events of the day unfolded.</span></p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">The demon could feel a presence in the air. He took a moment to enjoy it, spellbound by it, before giving orders to his underlings.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Do not kill this man. Make absolutely sure you do not let him escape.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="u">Then, by himself, he calmly traveled through space. To a demon like this, using Magic Sense to travel instantly between two points several miles from each other came as naturally as taking a walk around the block. The Greater Demons, unable to do this, nodded their acknowledgment and began following their master’s tracks. There was no panic, no loss of purpose among them; they simply began running unnaturally fast toward the center of town.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The demon had teleported right next to Rimuru.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I am back, my master,” he said, taking a knee before the figure as his silvery hair blew in the wind. Rimuru had been a slime when he summoned these demons, and while he was now much more handsome in appearance, there was no mistaking him. The near-divine aura he let out was a telltale sign for any monster, no matter what their eyes told them. It was a sort of shine from his very soul, and discerning the color of one’s soul came naturally to a demon.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>This</em> <span class="merge__be">demon’s master was currently conducting a solemn ceremony, one aimed at the neatly lined rows of dead monsters before him. To the demon, it was simply a beautiful sight. He wanted to stay there, just basking in the glory of it all, but not now. There was something on his mind.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He quietly came up to his master, taking the utmost care to stay out of his way. Perhaps it would be better to wait until the ceremony was done?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Forgive my rudeness, Master. It seems you do not have enough magicules on hand…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The demon was right. Rimuru didn’t seem to have the quantity of magicules this ritual required. Based on his knowledge, the demon surmised he was attempting to hold a ceremony known as the Secret Art of Revival, a skill that created a fully new soul for its target—a level below straight-up raising the dead. If this failed, the targets would be totally unlike how they were before death, transforming into uncontrollable beasts. The act was so difficult that even losing</span> <em>some</em> <span class="merge__be">memories and knowledge in the process was considered a great success.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">The Secret Art of Revival had to be woven using arcane wisdom that humankind couldn’t even begin to understand. It naturally required a massive amount of magical energy, along with an unimaginable amount of force to control it. Even a high-level magic-born couldn’t do that. Only demons, with their knowledge of controlling souls, could handle the job, and even then only a handful of higher-level demons.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. I’d expect nothing less of my master.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">Rimuru was performing this arcane act on nearly a hundred monsters at the same time. Even a single target took up tons of magicules, and this was multiplying that by a hundred-ish. Of</span> <em>course</em> <span class="t">he was short on magicules. So the demon decided to speak up, just in case he could provide some help.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Yes. It is not meeting the stipulated amount of magicules. I am consuming life force as a substitute.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The words flustered the demon.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Wait, my master! You don’t need to use up your own life for this… Ah, yes! I have a good idea…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His eyes turned toward the two Greater Demons who had arrived earlier, as if appraising their value, then gave them a satisfied nod.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Please use these two!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The two Greater Demons stationed behind their leader stood up then kneeled toward him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It would be an honor if these could serve you as well. Nothing could possibly make us happier.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The other two nodded their agreement. To them, the choice was obvious.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be"><em>……</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Rimuru, or Raphael, looked at the two demons, observing them with his shining golden eyes. No emotion was present in their dazzling beauty. Instead, he gave this flat response:</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Understood. This will supply the required number of magicules. The offer is accepted.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Then, without further hesitation, he consumed them with Belzebuth. The Greater Demons disappeared without a trace, gobbled up with the air, taken apart, and converted into pure magicules. The energy appeared to shine a golden yellow to the demon—perhaps, he thought, because their wish to be useful had finally come true. Nothing could satisfy them more.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ahhh… How I envy them. Well done, my master. Your evolution into a demon lord seems to be perfect. I feel an overwhelming force from your body, the likes of which I never felt last we met…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He looked longingly at his newly evolved master. Being able to serve such a new and beautiful demon lord was exactly what he craved. To do that, he needed to prove that he could be useful to him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Steeling his resolve, the demon stepped away from the ceremony and waited quietly. No need to be further involved now. Meddling too much could stoke his master’s ire, he felt. If he interfered just because he wanted to help, he would be sabotaging his master’s efforts.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Confirmed. The prescribed amount of magicules has been reached. We will now conduct the Secret Art of Revival.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">As the demon tried to be as invisible as possible, the ritual commenced.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">What began was one of the deepest, most mysterious secrets of this world.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="y">Colorless, transparent balls of beautiful light were enveloped in a thin film of flawless light purple. These were the cores of the victims, along with the astral bodies that protected them. Next, following the Secret Art of Resurrection, the rebuilt monster souls were returned to their bodies. The success rate was 3.14 percent—but that figure had been calculated before he became a demon lord.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The souls of all the demons lined up in that plaza had been gifted Complete Memory as part of the evolutionary process. They all accepted it as a way of fulfilling Rimuru’s hopes. This was an extra skill that made it possible to completely restore the memory of someone, even from a damaged brain. As long as the soul was intact, it could rebuild those memories from the state of death an infinite number of times.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">—The link between soul and body was established. And now, the monsters’ cores unleashed their powers, and their hearts began to beat out a pulse…</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Right there, the resurrection was settled. A divine mystery, born from the complex interactions of myriad elements. A miracle and a foregone conclusion, engineered by the prayers of Rimuru and everybody else.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="u">But to Raphael, the Lord of Wisdom, who carried this out, there was no happiness at this successful feat. He had just performed the answer provided by his computations, followed the probabilities, and obtained results. He saw no further meaning in it. Success didn’t make him feel happy, and failure wouldn’t have made him feel sad in all likelihood. He didn’t even understand what feeling those emotions would mean. Even with all the great knowledge he wielded, the brilliant brain he was blessed with, it wasn’t enough to understand human emotion.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">But deep down, in a heart he should never have had, in a corner of Rimuru’s soul—a will was born. A self, to put it another way. There had to be one there or else a skill wouldn’t evolve in such rogue fashion in order to fulfill its master’s wishes. And then the question came:</span> <em>Why did I take this kind of action?</em> <span class="t">It came from within Raphael, and it was solid proof that this being had a self, separate from his master.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And yet, even this slight suspicion toward himself that was born in his head was something Raphael quickly turned his eyes from.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>I think, therefore I am…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was a thesis that Raphael would find himself constantly thinking about, going forward—and never finding an answer.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Regardless of his internal conflicts, Raphael continued with his incomparably accurate work. He analyzed and assessed nearly a hundred monsters at the same time, repairing their bodies, regenerating their souls, and finally resurrecting them. It was a seamless flow, not a single extraneous motion involved, and everything was handled at the right place and time. Before the monsters in town realized it, the miracle had secretly completed itself.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Only three people knew this: Mjurran, Gruecith, and the demon.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran was rendered beyond speechless as she watched the ceremony intently, face turned pale as a sheet. She had a front-row seat to the ultimate in secret arts, the exact thing she had been pursuing for so long. A chasm of deep, dark magic of which Rimuru’s presence as a demon lord allowed her an all-too-brief glimpse.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">A high-level magic-born like Mjurran would never have a chance. Even the demon lord Clayman’s power seemed like a rude blur compared to this.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She gave thanks for the great fortune of obtaining this insight, even as she swore to herself never to let Yohm become Rimuru’s enemy. If he did, it’d ruin the both of them. That’s why she knew now that he needed her guidance and protection. He knew too little about all of this for any other alternative to work.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Gruecith’s eyes were dazzled by the miracle that took place before him. He didn’t have much in the way of magic knowledge, but he could see well enough that this secret art was like nothing else. It made him tremble in awe at how easy Rimuru made it look.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Damn it, what kind of magic force</em> <span class="merge__be">is</span> <em>this?! This massive, seemingly endless magicule supply, all being controlled with utter perfection. Is</em> <span class="merge__be">this</span> <em>really a newborn demon lord? It can’t be! Lord Carillon couldn’t even do this…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Awe and fear swirled in equal measures.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>…And those eyes. Those eyes look like they’re beholding something totally worthless. They treat raising the dead as nothing more complex than repairing a useful tool… Did he think he could just make a new one if he messed up? What the hell is going on here…? He’s usually so warm and kind to other people; was all that just an act? Is this the</em> <span class="merge__be">real</span> <em>him…?!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">What Gruecith was watching now was both Rimuru and not Rimuru. Unaware of this, all he could see was a demon lord working beyond the realm of mortal intelligence. And from that point forward, he swore to admonish both himself and the other lycanthropes from ever daring to defy Rimuru.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Unlike the two of them, the demon was filled with utter joy, gazing at Rimuru in sheer, silent awe.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then a question to consider appeared in his mind:</span> <em>The person who just spoke to me… Was that not my master at all?</em> <span class="merge__be">But he dismissed the thought at once as overthinking matters. In all the many years this demon had lived, he had never heard of anything quite like that. The idea of a skill becoming sentient was too ridiculous to even consider. Working independently to fulfill the requests of its master…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">…or maybe it took a demon like this, living in the deepest depths of the world, to even have the possibility occur in his mind. Regardless, the demon didn’t buy it. Besides, there were more important matters to consider.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. No matter what happens, I have to gain at least the lowest seat at the table for myself…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His mind resolved anew, he began to consider other ways he could stand out for his master.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Thus, the hope was fulfilled.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">When Rimuru—or Raphael, Lord of Wisdom—completed his work, he returned once again into sleep mode, his magicule stores exhausted. The demon lovingly picked him up—an easy task, since he was back in slime form—and, following Mjurran’s instructions, gently placed him on the throne prepared for his rest.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Both Mjurran and the demon agreed that Rimuru was simply out of energy and would likely awaken in a few days. But what kind of “person” would he be like once he opened his eyes? Only the gods could know.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">As the three eyewitnesses each pondered internally how to deal with this, they heard several sets of footsteps running toward them. Then they realized that the pressure exerted against Elen’s barrier was gone, reducing the magicule count in the air to practically zero. Yohm, Kabal, and the others immediately ran over to investigate, only to find row after row of sleeping monsters.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Mjurran! Gruecith! Are you two all right? Where’s Rimuru…?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Whoa, whoa,” observed Kabal, “they’re all sleeping? What happened?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Did Shion get resurrected and all that?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran took a moment to think before responding. Gruecith didn’t appear to have any idea what happened, and the demon seemed too enamored with himself and Rimuru to bother explaining matters to anyone else. Everyone’s gazes naturally began to focus on Mjurran, making her sigh dejectedly.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sir Rimuru has successfully completed the demon lord–evolution process. All the other monsters shared in this, too, so they’re all sleeping during their own evolves. And Shion and the other dead… They’ve all been safely resurrected using a secret ritual conducted by Sir Rimuru when he was awake. The ritual sapped all his magical energy away, and he is back asleep now.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Everyone on-site breathed a hefty sigh of relief.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah, there’s the boss for ya! I knew I shouldn’t have worried.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">“I wouldn’t relax quite yet,” Mjurran replied to Kaijin. “Their souls</span> <span class="merge__be">might have been revived, but they all definitely died once before, so there’s no guarantee they’ve retained any of their memories.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="en">“Although it’ll probably be fine,” she then just barely whispered to</span> <span class="ba">herself. She wanted to keep everyone on high alert just in case, but as far as she was concerned, there was no real danger left to consider.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bb">But her words had the effect of instantly silencing everyone else. Now they realized it was still too early to celebrate.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bb">“Well, outside of that,” Elen breathed, “how about we get a roof over all these sleepyheads for now, huh? There are mats laid out in the great meeting hall—I guess they figured something like this would happen.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bb">“Fine by me, but every single monster in town? That’s kind of a big project.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bb">“Yeah,” Gido chimed in, “we’re talking over a thousand of ’em in the plaza alone…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bb">“All right,” Kaijin said. “In that case, we’ll just take responsibility for bringing Lady Shuna into her bedchamber, all right?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bb">Kabal erupted into action. “Whoa there, you! I don’t care if you’re Kaijin or not—I’m</span> <em>not</em> <span class="merge__be">letting you get away with that!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah, man! That’s far too delicate a job to leave to someone besides us!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Elen’s suggestion had triggered a war of words between the dwarves, led by Kaijin, and Kabal and his right-hand man, Gido. It went on for several more seconds before Elen finally yelled at them to knock it off.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">But the conflict wasn’t necessary from the beginning—because as they bickered, the residents of town began to wake up by themselves.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was a neat sequence of emotions for them all as they did. First, panic over the vanished barrier and missing magicules in the air. Then, massive outbursts of joy as they realized Shion and the other victims were resurrected. To them, it was a miracle—but only the three witnesses on hand knew what it really was.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">In effect, it was just the power of Raphael at work. And nobody on hand realized, in the shadow of all that joy, that Raphael—a simple skill, nothing more—had somehow grown a sense of self-awareness.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><em>Rise and shine!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was a trite old phrase, but it was the first one my mind came up with.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I hadn’t enjoyed waking up like this in ages. Unlike my previous experiments with forcing myself into a nap-like state, I felt refreshed, satisfied. It goes without saying that I had never experienced anything like it before in this world. But as I got up and took a look, I realized that things had gotten pretty hectic around me. More problems to deal with, I guess. Give me a break.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I could feel this sort of pulsing energy from the monsters. I did a quick Analyze and Assess on them, only to find they bore more magicules than before. They were stronger now, in other words, so I guess my evolution must’ve turned out okay.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Correct. The Harvest Festival has successfully completed. Gifts were distributed to all creatures within your genealogy, leading to further evolution among individuals.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Aha. So becoming a demon lord made everyone under me evolve, huh? And is it my imagination, or is the Great Sage being a lot more talkative than it used to be?</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">No. It is your imagination.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Oh, all right…</em></p>
<p class="m"><em>Hey, wait a second!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But as much as I wanted to poke at the Sage about it, it offered no further response. Was it</span> <em>really</em> <span class="merge__be">my imagination?</span> <em>Ahh, I can’t think about this right now. How’s Shion doing? Not to mention everyone else? What’s happening right now?</em> <span class="merge__be">I had an endless wellspring of questions. And as if to answer them all at once:</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">“Ah! Sir Rimuru! You are awake!”</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">I heard a familiar voice—and felt a familiar sensation behind my back. A pair of hilly peaks, pliant and warmly surrounding me.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">My evolution was complete, but there was no huge difference in my slime form. The only real change was that I’d sometimes turn more of a yellowish color. Was I one of those gold slimes now or something? Like, zooming along at the speed of light? I didn’t actually have that power, but I sort of felt more…elegant. Like I was on top of the food chain when it came to slimes. Not that I</span> <em>looked</em> <span class="bs">any stronger, still…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">More to the point, this sensation, this familiar lap I found myself in, the way my cheeks were getting rubbed…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You came back to life!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was Shion.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Mm. This feels really great. Just like before. Nothing changed.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes, Sir Rimuru! All of us have come completely back to life!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Hearing this, I realized that I had a hundred kneeling monsters surrounding us. Then, all at once, they greeted me, excited beyond description for me to wake up.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">“““We have all been revived, without a single person missing!!”””</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Great. That’s really great. And who’s that I see in the front row? Of course it’s got to be that doofus Gobzo.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Just as I anticipated, the effects of the evolution brought everyone back to life. I guess it was worth becoming a demon lord after all. The resemblance of my chances to the number</span> <span class="merge__be">π</span> <span class="merge__be">was a worry, but if it worked on everyone, I couldn’t be happier. Hell, even the Sage makes mistakes sometimes. I’ll always welcome a pleasant mistake like this.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Smiling to myself at Shion’s return, I spent a moment to enjoy my position underneath her breasts for the first time in a while. Truly an elegant way to pass the time. But the bliss didn’t last long.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Sir Rimuru,” Benimaru said, “you’re awake? Wonderful. We have a variety of issues to— Ah, but before that, I cannot proceed until I confirm you have retained your sanity. You remember the question and answer we discussed in our conference, yes? Let’s go, then: ‘What do you think of Shion’s cooking?’ Give me your answer!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He gave me a sarcastic grin. Yeah, I sure remember. It’s shitty, right? Man, he worries way too much sometimes.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But just as I was about to give the correct reply, I realized something horrifying.</span> <em>Ummmm… I’m kind of being hugged by Shion right now, aren’t I? If I use the S word to describe her kitchen work…what will happen then?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">An image of hell ran across my mind.</span> <em>Oh crap!! If I don’t think of something, Shion’s gonna crush me into jelly with those arms of hers! I can’t believe I let myself fall right into this trap! How utterly devious of him! What’ll I do? Is there some way out of this?</em></p>
<p class="m"><em>…I got it! Time to have the Great Sage come to the rescue. I’m sure it’ll have the most wonderful solution to all of this…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">…and then, upon trying to summon it, I realized it was gone.</span> <em>Um…what? Great, uh, Great Sage?!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">…And, wait a second, who had been answering me just a moment ago…?</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cy">Report. The unique skill Great Sage has evolved into the ultimate skill Raphael, Lord of Wisdom. As a result, it has disappeared and cannot be accessed.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Whoa. Skills can evolve, too? And, uh, Raphael? Named after the angel and everything? Sounds pretty neat…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But I can explore this later. I still have an unprecedented crisis to deal with right now.</span> <em>All right, Raphael, if you’re the Lord of Wisdom, find the best way possible for me to deceive Shion!</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Understood. My calculations did not find any relevant results.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>You piece of crap!!!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The Sage was never all that useful for things like this, either, and I guess Raphael inherited that same quirk. He said something about “calculations,” but I doubt he gave the question any serious thought at all. Probably just trying to humor me. The more things change the more they stay the same. Maybe he hasn’t really evolved much at all, apart from the fancy-pants name he grew.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This whole exchange took less than a second to unfold in my mind.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hmm? What about my cooking?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, um, well, I’m sure Sir Rimuru misses it terribly, no? He can’t wait to see what you’ve been working on, I’m sure.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Someone needed to stop Benimaru before this got any worse. Damn it. That bastard wanted this to happen from the start! And he even made damn sure in advance that</span> <em>he</em> <span class="merge__be">didn’t get caught up in it. What an asshole! This great sleep session I had, and he’s threatening to have Shion put me in the kind of sleep you never wake up from!</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, I see! He wants me to cook a meal, then, is it? How thoughtful of you, Sir Benimaru.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shion smiled triumphantly at the suggestion as I was seized by a turbulent sense of foreboding.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“So you see now?” Benimaru said. “I know this goes without saying, but I—”</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">…</span><span class="cw">Let me provide a suggestion, then. I recommend replying with, “The answer Benimaru suggested I make was ‘It’s shitty,’ wasn’t it? I do remember that well.”</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Wha—?!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The Great Sage—I mean, the Lord of Wisdom—just came up with the most brilliant answer in the universe. Man, I’m sorry I accused him of not evolving too much. You rock, Raphael!</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hang on, Benimaru! We had a question and answer planned out in advance, right?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Um?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, don’t worry—I remember the whole process. The answer that</span> <em>you</em> <span class="merge__be">decided was correct for this was ‘It’s shitty,’ was it not? I remember it perfectly!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shion’s smile froze in place as several beads of sweat began running down Benimaru’s face in tandem.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sh-Shion, wait! Sir Rimuru has only just awoken! I fear his brain might still be in a state of confusion!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I took this moment to nimbly evacuate myself away from Shion’s chest, keeping an eye on the panicked Benimaru as I did.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Very well,” Shion flatly replied. “Sir Benimaru… No, just Benimaru. I serve Sir Rimuru directly; I have no need to use noble titles to refer to you. But if you had wanted to try my cuisine</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">badly, you should have said so. I will gladly feed it to you until you’re ready to burst!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She stormed off, smile still frozen on her face. That was pretty scary.</span> <em>Really</em> <span class="merge__be">scary actually.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Wh-what did you do</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">for?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ha-ha-ha! I’m not sure what you mean, Benimaru. Have fun trying to survive the next meal, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“This isn’t funny, my lord! I have been testing her new creations so long that I’ve developed Resist Poison recently, too…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Benimaru could see doom lying ahead. If Shion was</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">enthu</span><span class="t">siastic to start cooking, this could be the end for him. Poison resistance, though? Really? That’s pretty much saying that Shion’s food is poison, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah, well, as they say, you reap what you sow…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Benimaru gave my assessment a dejected shake of the head. I had no words to console him with. One misstep, after all, and it could’ve been</span> <em>me</em> <span class="merge__be">facing that maelstrom. Better, I thought, to let the original perpetrator face her wrath instead.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">After Shion left, the newly resurrected survivors clamored to greet me, as if they’d been waiting their turn this whole time. Everyone had the same knowledge and personality as before (although the atmosphere was maybe slightly different with some), which was a great relief. No memory loss, no nothing—and their souls were all fully intact.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">That wouldn’t have been possible if I didn’t obtain the Complete Memory extra skill—glad to see all that evolution effort didn’t go to waste. As one of the crowd put it, “Now I can keep coming back to life no matter how many times I die!”—and I wasn’t entirely sure he was joking.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Complete Memory allowed you to directly tap into the target’s soul. Normally the power could be possessed only by spirit-type life-forms, but somehow I had stumbled upon it, too. They said something about souls that shared the same “genealogy” with me and all that, so I guess it technically applied to me. That’s what the “gift” thing was, probably—it got everyone back, and I couldn’t be happier with it.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">After we wrapped up our reunion, everyone went right back to work. The rest of the townspeople also received some kind of gift, I think, but there was no time to examine them all in detail. Benimaru mentioned a “variety of issues,” and I had to address them quickly.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">So the moment we overcome one crisis, a new one comes right down the pike, huh…?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, before we discuss Shion’s cooking, I have something important to tell you.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Benimaru gave a signal, and on cue, the Three Lycanthropeers from the demon lord Carillon’s domain appeared.</span> <em>Ohhh, right, Milim was fighting him, wasn’t she? I forgot.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“First, let me congratulate you on your evolution!” Alvis the Golden Snakehorn declared as he fell to one knee.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes, yes, but what’s going on?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Benimaru was the first to open his mouth. As he put it, evacuees from the Beast Kingdom of Eurazania had arrived just a few moments ago. Remarkably, I had been fast asleep for three whole days—which meant that, um, the conflict between demon lords was over and done?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Yes. I saw it all for myself.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Phobio, the Black Leopard Fang, had stayed close to Carillon’s side for the entire battle against Milim. And the result?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Lord Carillon and Milim collided right into each other…and the demon lord Milim proved all too superior. The Beast Kingdom is…I am sad to say…no more.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Dang.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I had trouble forming a response. Benimaru gasped as well; apparently, this was news to him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Phobio was himself gravely injured but still managed to take a Warp Portal over and regroup with Alvis. Gabil’s potions saved his life after that.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The Three Lycanthropeers were silent, Sufia the Snowy Tigerclaw gritting her teeth.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“However,” Phobio continued, “after an unbelievably massive explosion, it was none other than the demon lord Frey who delivered the blow that defeated our lord. The very idea of demon lords working together… I could hardly even imagine. I always believed that Milim had a distaste for such schemes. And, looking back, something else about it struck me as odd…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So Milim and Frey had joined forces to defeat Carillon. I found that pretty damn odd, too. Milim promised him a one-on-one grudge match, and she didn’t strike me as the kind of demon lord to pull a mean trick like taking along a ringer. Frey, according to Phobio, met eyes with him for just a passing moment. It happened so fast—Frey flying off with Carillon’s body as if nothing was amiss—that he decided it was just his mind playing tricks on him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“But,” he went on, “the demon lord Frey has the best eyesight out of all her kind. They say she can shoot down small animals on the ground from the loftiest of heights. I may have been hidden, but there was no way she could miss me. And something else concerns me about her behavior…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Apparently, Sufia reported, the direction Frey flew off to was all wrong. A perfect 180 degrees from her own domain, in fact, and a fair distance off from Milim’s lands.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Her bearing would have taken her straight for the demon lord Clayman’s domain.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The other two Lycanthropeers shuddered.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I—I need to go out for a moment.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Alvis stepped up to stop him. “Wait right there, Sufia!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes! If you’re going, then we all need to join forces in our attack.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Hoo boy. That’s not gonna work.</em> <span class="merge__be">Beastlings like these have a one-track mind, and they’re so easily riled into fury. Even Alvis, who seemed like the most levelheaded of the crew, was no exception.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well, hang on,” I ventured. “We need more information before anything else. The way you put it, Phobio, Carillon is still alive. I don’t know what Frey is like as a person, but there’s no way Milim would let someone just horn in on her fight without getting</span> <em>damn</em> <span class="merge__be">angry about it. There has to be more behind this.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I feel the same way,” Benimaru said.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Right. So listen: We all want to help you rescue your lord. So don’t go berserk on me right now, all right? If we don’t work together on this, you might wind up destroying whatever chance you’ve got. Worst-case scenario, you’ll have to fend off three demon lords at the same time. So don’t jump right in yet, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Understood.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“All right…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes, Sir Rimuru.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">They all nodded, regaining their composure.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">We then decided to let them rest and recuperate for a bit. Them, and the other ten thousand or so people who evacuated to town with them, all utterly exhausted. Trekking all the way to Clayman’s domain and challenging him to battle right now was absurd.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="u">In a short time, we had emergency stations handing out food, and the great meeting hall had lodgings hastily prepared to deal with the influx. We weren’t at full strength yet; my people were only just beginning to wake back up. For today, at least, we decided to kick back and relax with a meal together.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Surrounded by the pleasant smell of the emergency kitchens, we awaited Shion’s cooking with a sense of impending terror.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“So, um, good luck at dinner, okay, Benimaru?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Wait just a minute! We should be eating her food together, shouldn’t we?! She’s trying her best! Maybe it’ll actually be good, by some miracle! Just promise me you won’t leave me alone!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“L-let go of me! Miracles don’t occur</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">often!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>I’ve just wrapped up this awesome, awe-inspiring evolution event, and the first thing I do after that is sample Shion’s cuisine? What kind of prank is this?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">In the end, though, the teary-eyed Benimaru was just too pathetic a sight to bear, so I agreed to join him at the dinner table—or more like Shion pushed me to a seat adjacent to him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee! I’m sure you’re looking forward to this just as much as Benimaru is, aren’t you, Sir Rimuru?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>No! Not at all!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Easy enough for me to think that, really, but near impossible to say it. One look into Shion’s eyes, and I realized—</span><em>oh crap, there’s nowhere to run</em><span class="merge__be">.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Thus, as the people around us celebrated their resurrection and revitalized their spirits with food and drink, we were being treated to a tasting session straight from the deepest pit of hell.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">A few more moments and the lethal weapon that was Shion’s cooking was locked and loaded on plates. She beamed as she brought the food (?) in on large platters.</span> <em>The time has come.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I took a look at one of the steaming plates, and—</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“—Whoaaa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What’s</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">stuff?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It wasn’t food. I absolutely refused to accept that this was food. There was a bowl with assorted stuff tossed into it. A stew, maybe? Was that her intention? Wait—no, right, this wasn’t food. Never. There shouldn’t be any question about it in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Shion?! Shion, wait a second! There’s something I want to ask you. Do you understand the concept of what ‘cooking’ means?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Of course, Sir Rimuru. What do you think? It looks scrumptious, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bt">“You damned fool! You got carrots, potatoes, peppers, tomatoes, onions, and all kinds of other vegetables—but you just tossed all of them in whole! I shouldn’t be able to recognize every single one of them in the bowl like that, all floating in the broth or whatever! You’re supposed to peel them, or cut them, or do a whole lot of other crap with them!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I was shouting, straight from the heart.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then I turned to Benimaru. “What is the meaning of this? I thought I left Shion’s care in your hands. She hasn’t learned anything at all from you, has she?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He gazed back at me, as glassy-eyed as a dead fish. “I just couldn’t do it. I’ve never had a setback in my life, but with her, I’ve hit a wall—the wall of my personal limits. Since childhood, I always assumed that nothing was impossible for me, but now I see just how shallow-minded that was.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">How brazen of him. The wall of his personal limits? Bullshit. I’m eating this, too, remember?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I glanced up at Shion. She was quivering, on the brink of tears. I began to feel like maybe I was the bad guy here… Ah well. Like a monk experiencing enlightenment, it was time for me to brace myself, treat this as training, and have at it.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“All right, all right. I’ll take it, okay? But at least try to actually prepare your ingredients before putting them in next time.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Umm, but whenever I try chopping up food, I wind up chopping up the rest of the building I’m in, too…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Huh? The whole building? Not just the cutting board?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Right. My Goriki-maru is so wonderfully sharp, but it’s a little long as well, so…” Shion pointed at the longsword strapped to her back.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Uh, she</span> <em>cooked</em> <span class="merge__be">with that?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Benimaru threw his hands in the air, as if in surrender. Talk about someone you can’t rely on in a pinch. My esteem for him was in free fall right now.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Listen,” I attempted, “a katana isn’t meant for cooking. All right? That’s what they’ve invented cooking knives for.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“No, I work strictly with Goriki-maru. I wouldn’t want to cheat on it with other blades…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh. I was planning to give you some kitchen knives as a present actually, but I guess you don’t need them?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Wait! I was wrong! My mistake! Goriki-maru just told me I was allowed to play around with other knives after all!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Good to hear. So yeah, use those knives to cook from now on, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She sure knew a gift horse when she saw one. Ah well. It certainly beats chomping into whole tomatoes in what was supposed to be soup. If he ate nothing but food like this (not that I was acknowledging it as food, mind you), no wonder Benimaru acquired Resist Poison.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Now it was my turn…but, hell, I was a demon lord now. Ingesting something like this couldn’t kill me, right? So I resigned myself to my fate and went into my human form. Closing my eyes and steeling my resolve, I brought a spoonful of some kind of mystery goop to my mouth.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Just as I was about to swallow it as quickly as possible, I noticed something odd…</span> <em>Huh? This is, like, super good. Almost like she’s fully re-created Shuna’s home cooking…? You’re kidding me!</em> <span class="merge__be">It tasted nothing like it looked.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I opened my eyes wide as I slowly, carefully ferried another spoonful of ingredients to my lips.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>This is</em> <span class="merge__be">good</span><em>!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Benimaru watched, half praying, his eyes asking</span> <em>Are you all right?</em> <span class="merge__be">to me. I motioned him to give it a shot as well. I guess his experiences with Shion’s food up to now were just as bad as I imagined.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="u">He dejectedly took a spoonful—then his eyes burst open in surprise. Guess my tongue wasn’t lying to me. I almost thought something got screwed up with my evolution for a moment.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shion watched us with the biggest cheese-eating grin I ever saw in my life. It kind of pissed me off, frankly.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Shion, what… What is this? Why’s this so much better-tasting than it looks?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hee-hee-hee! Well—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It turns out—and I had no idea about this—that when the moment of evolution arrived, Shion wished deeply in her mind to become good at cooking. It would take a dumbass like her to wish for something like</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">as her gift. What was she even thinking? It was exasperating, but I supposed it was also supremely Shion-like of her.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hee-hee! So there you have it. I’ve obtained the unique skill Master Chef!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Yeesh. What a sight. Earning a unique skill because she wanted to get better in the kitchen… How badly did she wish for that anyway? And the way she described it, the skill let anything she made taste exactly how she pictured it in her mind, no matter what kind of dish it was. No wonder it tasted like Shuna made it—that was exactly what she was aiming for.</span></p>
