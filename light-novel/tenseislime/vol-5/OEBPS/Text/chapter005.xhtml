<p class="cotx"><span class="merge__be">I headed for the meeting hall, Yohm in tow, once I heard that all my people had quickly gathered there.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">As I stepped inside, the entire Tempest government currently in town was waiting for me, strained looks on their faces. Gabil and Soei were still on standby in the cave, but Soei was connected to me via the Sticky Steel Thread trick, and I figured he was monitoring the audio.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sorry I left you guys in the lurch for so long. We’re here to convene a meeting over resurrecting Shion, Gobzo, and everybody else!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The declaration made the hall stir. They were happy to see me back to my old charismatic self, and now they had hope that there was something to be done. It kindled a flame in each of their eyes. Not one of them expressed a single doubt. Shion and Gobzo were coming back, and it was time to move.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Now, before I give you my own ideas, I would like to hear your opinions about the Kingdom of Farmus and about humans in general.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I received a great deal of feedback very quickly. The majority of them were in agreement with me on one key point: There would be no forgiveness for the humans who had played that cowardly trick on us. They were right to feel that way, no doubt about it. Some of them, however, also said not to treat all humans the same, that there were a lot of good ones out there as well. I was happy to hear that. All this anger, fear, and hatred threatened to drive us away from the goal we needed to seek.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Even after all of this, they still faithfully adhered to the advice I had for them. These monsters considered</span> <em>very</em> <span class="merge__be">seriously the idea of living alongside mankind. I had to love these guys for it. They were precious to me, like family. I never really loved anyone before, so putting it that way sounds kind of fakey to me still, but…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I waited for everyone to settle back down before I continued.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Right. Listen to me, all of you.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I felt all eyes upon me as I began.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I myself am a former human being. I was reincarnated, as it were.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">This caused a little commotion, but nobody spoke up. Shuna, Ranga, and probably Shion already knew, I believed. I didn’t take great pains to hide it, and I think I might’ve even mentioned it offhand to them at some point. Judging by the looks of surprise on many of my audience’s faces, though, word must not have gotten around.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I lived as a human in the same world that the so-called otherworlders come from. I died over there, and then I was reborn here as a slime. It was pretty lonely at first and desolate, but even someone like me managed to make friends here. By ‘friends,’ I mean you. It’s possible that all of you became closer to human with your evolutions because of my own hopes, for all I know.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I paused to gauge the response. Everyone was intently listening to me, nobody expressing any doubts. I kept going.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I created that rule not to attack humans for that reason. I said I liked humans because I used to be one. And let me assure you, it was not my hope that my rule would cause any of you injury. I’m a monster, but I thought that my heart was still human. I wanted to interact with them, and I wound up spending a really long time in human towns and settlements. If only I could have saved those children and come back here sooner…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then, out of nowhere, I ran out of words. I felt like anything I could say would just sound like a trite excuse.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“No, you’re wrong. We were too dependent upon you, Sir Rimuru, assuming you would always be there to protect us. That’s what led to this tragedy,” said Shuna, her beautiful eyes fixed on me.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It pains me,” Benimaru added, “to have my sister say it before I could. This has been an excruciating lesson for all of us, Sir Rimuru. When we lost our Thought Communication with you, that feeling of invincibility we had crumbled. It made us all feel helpless, deep in our hearts. We were forced to realize that this state of affairs was brought about by our…well, really,</span> <em>my</em> <span class="merge__be">dropping the ball.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Wait a moment, Benimaru,” Rigur replied. “If you put it that way, then I am responsible for the town’s security. I am the one most at fault!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It sounded like both Rigur and the rest of them felt an intense responsibility for this. They all insisted it was their fault, refusing to budge. I quickly put a stop to it.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hang on, people. I was chilling out, I let my guard down, and that’s what led to this. Plus, as an ex-human, I put too much priority on my own thoughts. I was careless about my standing in this world, and then this happened. I think it’s all my fault. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Everyone fell silent, each of them taking my words in their own way. There was a moment’s pause before Hakuro finally responded.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You may have put your own thoughts first, Sir Rimuru, but that is not a problem at all. As Sir Benimaru and Lady Shuna stated, all of us dropped the ball. It was our own weaknesses that caused this. We accepted this nation from you, and we let those brutes pillage it because of our negligence. Am I wrong, everyone?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">A streak of tension crossed the room. All of them immediately nodded their agreement to this.</span> <em>Um. Hmm. Wasn’t expecting that.</em> <span class="t">I was worried that people would brand me a traitor, in the worst case, but they were all ignoring my whole coming out as an ex-human. Like, I seemed to be the only one to care at all. I couldn’t help but ask:</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well, no, I mean… You don’t mind having an ex-human as your leader?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Huh? You are still you, aren’t you, Sir Rimuru?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sir Rimuru, you are my only master. What you were in your past life seems not to matter much.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah. What we know for sure is that you’re here for us, is all.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I guess it wasn’t anything like a concern from the start.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sir Rimuru,” Rigurd boldly stated, “we all feel the same way about this. None of us cares a bit, so please, do whatever you like. We will follow you all the way!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I nodded. This really</span> <em>was</em> <span class="merge__be">my home. I felt happy. As long as you were all of one heart, one mind, you could overcome any wall—even the one separating human from monster. That much was crystal clear now.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Kaijin, tearing up a bit as he watched this, steered the topic back to our main issue.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“So let me ask, then: How is Tempest going to deal with humans from now on?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="u">The room fell silent, eyes focused upon me again. Yeah. That</span> <em>was</em> <span class="u">the problem, wasn’t it? The monsters were one thing, but to Kaijin, the other dwarves, Yohm, and Kabal and gang, this was the biggest issue on the table. If I declared myself to be the enemy of all mankind, that’d be a threat to them. I didn’t want that, of course.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“First,” I said, “before I give you my conclusion, let me give you a quick outline of my thoughts. In my old world, there are a couple of different beliefs. There’s one that says humans are inherently ‘good’ by nature and learn how to perform evil deeds as they grow older. Then there’s another that says humans are selfish and evil by default and learn how to do good over time. Basically, people can be good or bad, and humans tend to pick the easier of two options when they have the chance, so if that option leads to evil, they can become bad that way. Just like Farmus did, abandoning all negotiation and throwing around their power.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I figured I was in the right here. After all, people could be good individually but lean more toward evil when they assembled together as a nation.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…However, it would be a mistake to judge all of mankind as evil. It takes a human to do something as contradictory as working hard to make things easier for themselves. I was the same way, really. And I think that as long as you don’t mess up where you’re aiming your efforts at, you can make your existence a lot better for yourself. That’s why it’s so vital to have an environment you can learn in—and I want to create that environment. We can educate those who’ll befriend us, and we’ll do away with the barriers between people and monsters. That makes for better neighbors, after all, when you understand and help out one another. Doesn’t it? That’s the potential I want to believe in…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">That was what I thought about humanity. It wasn’t that I wanted to make mankind my enemy; I wanted us working hand in hand as a result. But:</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…But that’s just my hope for the future. If we trust in them unconditionally and run into this kind of situation again, we’re wasting our time. That’s why I’ve concluded that, for the time being, it’s too early to shake hands with humanity. The most important thing right now is to put on a show of force and make them recognize our presence. We need to build a position where they can no longer afford to ignore us. As it is, we’re probably being downplayed, treated as something they can use and exploit. We had been dealing with nations like Blumund and the Dwarven Kingdom, decent kingdoms that looked out for us, so we forgot about the darker side of being a nation. Even if individual people are good, the moment they form a nation, that’s when they expose their cruel fangs to us. Any nation is basically a bunch of weak people grouping together to become stronger, so I guess you can’t avoid that if you want to keep all the decent ones protected. That’s exactly why we need a show of force for people like that. My ruling this land as a demon lord will make them realize that trying to coerce us with military might will accomplish nothing for them. I can keep the other demon lords in check, too, serving as a shield for the other human nations. If we can make them think it’s better to be with us than against us, that’s all I could ask for.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I took a breath and gauged the reaction. Even the normally clownish Gobta was listening intently instead of napping like he usually did. It was nice to see what I wanted to say get across to them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…If the Western Holy Church has judged us to be evil, then we must be firm in fighting against that. Not just with force but with words and economic policies. I want us to act like a mirror for these people—those who bare their fangs against us will themselves be punished; those who extend a hand will be amply rewarded for it. And then, over a very long time, we’ll try to build friendly relationships. That’s how I think about this.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And with that, I wrapped it up.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kaijin was the first to react. “I think that’s just too idealistic.” He sighed. “Like, what kind of guy trying to become a demon lord talks like</span> <em>that</em><span class="merge__be">? Come on. Gotta admit, though, I kinda like it.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shuna snickered. “Nothing wrong with being idealistic. I think Sir Rimuru has what it takes to build that kind of ideal.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Indeed,” Geld said, “there is no need to lose ourselves in thought. We have decided to follow in Sir Rimuru’s footsteps, and thus we can only believe in him.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I wasn’t sure I liked that lack of critical thought on his part, but he meant it with the utmost sincerity.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="y">“If you</span> <em>do</em> <span class="y">manage to become a demon lord”—Benimaru laughed—</span><span class="bs">“I hope there is a role for us in it all.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I am your faithful shadow, Sir Rimuru,” Soei said—I guess he</span> <em>was</em> <span class="merge__be">listening in. “There is no need to confirm our relationship. I will move according to your orders.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“And I, my master,” Ranga added from my shadow, “am your faithful fangs. The one who will tear apart any foe who stands in your path.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">They all voiced their agreement in their own ways—Rigurd, Rigur, Gobta, Hakuro, and everyone else. Yohm, too. “Damn, pal,” he said, scratching his head. “And you want my crew to build a new nation and turn everyone there to your side? Well, you don’t need to lay it out for us. I know how your mind ticks. You’re a real slave driver to all of us, y’know that?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I’m so glad we have an understanding, Yohm.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, shove it,” he pouted, his lips smiling. Mjurran was on his right, Gruecith on his left, and the rest of his followers behind him. I saw Kazhil, his aide, and Rommel, his main staff officer, among them. They were all humans, and they, too, voiced their agreement in a variety of ways.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hee-hee-hee! So let’s keep things friendly between us, okay, Rimuru?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Everyone nodded at Elen. Her words had weight in my mind. I was pushing a lot of stupid ideals upon them; I didn’t have any excuse for that. I lived life the way I wanted to, and I had to take responsibility for my actions.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Thanks, guys. Hope you’ll still put up with my selfishness in the future!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">They all shouted their agreement, harmonizing like a choir.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">With that out of the way, it was time to switch gears and figure out a strategy against this invasion.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Um, do we have any details on the enemy force?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Soei quoted a figure of at least ten thousand men, but I didn’t hear about what types they were yet. We needed to let the rest of this meeting’s attendees know, too.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes,” Benimaru stepped up to state. “According to Soei’s investigations…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">…We were being invaded by a tandem force, with soldiers from both Farmus and the Western Holy Church. The Church force were the Temple Knights, the minor leaguers—about three thousand of them, which consisted of the garrison that was already stationed in Farmus. In addition to that, essentially there were ten thousand Farmus knights, six thousand mercenary troops, and around a thousand magic-users.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So, around twenty thousand in all. Pretty big force. Larger than our country’s entire population. But if the Church’s Crusader groups and their legendary strength in battle weren’t part of the equation, I didn’t see any major problem. The sheer numbers were more than expected, but the only implication this had was that I’d have a larger sacrifice to snack on. I had no intention of offering any of them mercy, after all. The real question on my mind was how many otherworlders were among them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“How should we allot our own forces?” Geld gingerly asked.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I think,” Benimaru replied, “my force should address the main enemy presence.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He was ready to go, definitely—apparently, he had formed a group of hobgoblin warriors on the sly, trained by Hakuro and pretty well honed. Rigur and Gobta were commanding the goblin rider teams, too, and ready to kick up one hell of a lot of dust. I wasn’t the only one to be enraged by what happened.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But:</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I’m sorry, guys, but I’m gonna be the one to take down these forces. Or, I mean, I hope you’ll let me.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…How do you mean?” Benimaru asked for the crowd.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">My explanation was simple. “It turns out ten thousand sacrifices are all I really need to become a demon lord. Presumably, I’ll be evolving into a so-called ‘true demon lord,’ and that’s how the process works. Luckily, we have double that on our doorstep, so I got more than enough. After that, I just need to show off my force a bit. It’s part of the whole ceremony, or process, toward reaching demon lord–hood. I need to annihilate all the invaders by myself.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I wasn’t being entirely honest here. There wasn’t any need to go it alone, according to the Great Sage—as long as the souls were connected to me, no worries. My own will needed to align with theirs, and that’s all it took. The exact conditions, however, were allegedly a little hard to engineer—it wasn’t just a matter of killing ten thousand and Bob’s your uncle. But I didn’t care.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">A passing thought struck me that maybe Clayman had been</span> <span class="merge__be">aiming for this all along—to start a war for the express purpose of collecting ten thousand human beings together for reaping. Attacking villages singly only got you so far—maybe he aimed for a war that’d let him efficiently harvest those souls and become a true demon lord himself. He just didn’t know the</span> <em>exact</em> <span class="merge__be">conditions needed, so he had to satisfy himself with spreading evil around his domain instead. It almost seemed to me that he was taking advantage of the other demon lords so he could become a true one, even.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He would’ve been eliminated from the fray sooner or later, I suppose… But right now, the demon lord Clayman was my clear enemy. Once I took care of things with Farmus, he was coming up next.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So really, I had just one reason for handling this solo. It was because I had this well of intense anger deep in my chest, and I wanted to release all of it. I didn’t want to give people the impression that I’d kill at the drop of a hat. I wanted them to know I was</span> <em>pissed</em><span class="merge__be">. And if it meant I’d make a mistake and get killed, then that’s just all I was capable of, really.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Plus…you know, I felt like I had to take responsibility for all this. I couldn’t allow myself to take it easy any longer. Even if Hinata was among the invaders, I intended to kill all of them by myself. I’d already seen her skills once. The same skill never worked twice on me, because the Great Sage always had the perfect remedy for it.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">……</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">It felt like the Sage wanted to say something about that, but that assumption had never let me down before. Knowledge provides me the biggest advantage there is. If you use a skill meant to pick someone off on the first view, then you</span> <em>have</em> <span class="merge__be">to kill with it—otherwise, the survivors will pull their knowledge together and come up with countermeasures.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It didn’t matter who my foe was—I wouldn’t lose. I’d never be allowed to. And, perhaps sensing my resolve, Benimaru grudgingly accepted it with a nod.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Very well. We leave this to you, Sir Rimuru…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I nodded back. Although, of course, I didn’t intend for him and everyone else to just keep quiet and wait.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…There is a job I would like to have all of you do for me, though. Right now, there are magical devices of some sort in all four cardinal directions around town, generating that weakening barrier over us. Each is being guarded by a company of knights. I’d guess they’re pretty powerful, but I’d like you to attack them and take them all down simultaneously.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ohhh?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I see. So we</span> <em>do</em> <span class="merge__be">have a role in this?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Allow me, Rogurd, to accept this mission!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah, I’m pretty darn mad right now, too!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Everyone was raring to go, even before I’d finished my request. I raised a hand to silence them. “Hold on. I’ve already decided on my personnel. I want to ask as few people as needed to go through the town’s barrier. First, Benimaru will tackle the east. Hakuro, Rigur, Gobta, and Geld will handle the west. The south will be taken by Gabil and his team; the north by Soei and his. The enemy’s reportedly got teleportation circles in place, so we have to strike them before reinforcements can be sent in! If they</span> <em>do</em> <span class="merge__be">manage to send more troops, call Ranga over immediately, even if you think it won’t be enough to put up a resistance. Did you hear that, Soei?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Not a problem, Sir Rimuru. I thank you for providing us the opportunity. Gabil is ready to go as well, and I doubt any of us will fail.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Does it look like you can win, from your perspective?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It will be simple if we only handle one of the four.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Great. Soei’s team consisted of a mere six people—himself, Soka, and four others. Their skills were honed for assassination missions, and they’d provide a good match even for an entire enemy unit if it wasn’t prepared for them. Plus, with their movement speed, they’d certainly be able to pull the wool over the enemy’s eyes and flee if needed.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gabil and his men had grown far stronger during the evolution to dragonewt form. Each one ranked a good B-plus now, and I doubted they’d lose out to even the most well trained of knights. They all had ample potion, too, so as long as they weren’t one-shot killed, they could keep up a fight indefinitely.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So north and south were no problem, and to the east, I had Benimaru to count on.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I have no concern about your chances, Benimaru, but it’ll be you operating solo against nearly a hundred knights. If you sense any danger—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sir Rimuru, there is no need for worry. It is a given that I will—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You don’t have to go easy on them, keep in mind.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Heh. In that case, victory is assured.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">No worries about him, either. Among our group, only I was stronger than him, and he had the skills needed to handle large numbers at once.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">That just left the west side, which</span> <em>did</em> <span class="merge__be">concern me.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Okay. So: Hakuro, Rigur, Gobta, and Geld…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sir Rimuru,” Rigur said, “you are safe in our hands. I have no intention of tasting defeat twice. But if you are that worried about us, is it because…you feel it’s likely</span> <em>they</em> <span class="merge__be">are among their numbers?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Exactly. The west side connects to the shortest highway route to the kingdom of Blumund. If the enemy anticipated that our merchants would flee down that road, then the knights who attacked us earlier were probably stationed to the west so they could strike at our visitors.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Can you win against them? There’s a very good chance those otherworlders are among them.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sir Rimuru, we are not as weak as we used to be. We have the power to fight, not just to be protected by Sir Hakuro.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah! Plus, I gotta get me some revenge for Gobzo!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I know we number just four,” Geld said, “but I want you to trust us. I promise you, Sir Rimuru, I will wield the powers you granted me as an orc king as much as I possibly can!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Hakuro’s reputation preceded him. Geld was powerful, if not quite as much as Benimaru. Rigur, in his role as leader of our security forces, was just as capable in battle as Rigurd. Gobta… Okay, I</span> <em>was</em> <span class="merge__be">a little worried about him, but I figured not even that fool would try anything too rash.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“All right. Take those magical devices down, make this annoying barrier disappear, and give our people their full strength back!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“““Yes, my lord!!”””</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With them on the job, the barrier was as good as gone. That just left me to take on the invading forces by myself.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">There was one other thing too important to forget.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Now, Shuna…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Like I just said, Benimaru and everyone will remove the barrier for us. However, it’s that very barrier, in all likelihood, that is helping keep the souls of Shion and everyone else within reach. Do you see what I’m getting at?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes, Sir Rimuru. You want us to prepare a replacement barrier for you?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Exactly. Can you do that?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, that goes without saying, my lord. I promise it will be done!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Right now, as we spoke, I was casting a unique sort of great magic. I was also releasing a vast quantity of magicules into the air, filling it. That was what it took to maintain the barrier and supplement the magicule supply around here—and I wanted Shuna to make a new reinforcing barrier to help with that. The rest of the people in town would pitch in, too, of course—whatever it took to boost the chances of bringing them all back alive.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">In the laws of magic, just like the laws of physics, there was the concept of going “high to low.” Basically, if the air was filled with energy, I figured that would help prevent the energy covering all those souls from dissipating. If they lost this protection, the souls could go right through the barrier and be vaporized. A soul is a pure, unadulterated collection of energy; there is nothing to fence it in. And with the astral bodies of monsters made of magicules, if we could keep</span> <em>this</em> <span class="merge__be">energy from dissipating, I figured that would pen up the souls well enough. That was the Great Sage’s take on things, and all I could do was count on that. (Humans, by the way, could pass through the barrier without resistance, since they had relatively few magicules inside their bodies. It was totally different from monsters, who were much more directly affected by that energy.)</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I would love to help with that if I could,” Mjurran said. Great magic, along with barriers, was an apparent specialty of hers. I appreciated the offer a ton.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hey, Shuna…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes, Sir Rimuru. Thank you for that, Mjurran.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Leave it to me. I promise I’ll devote my full energy to it.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So Shuna and Mjurran would be working together to keep my great magic going strong. Now I could fight with a clear mind.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Rigurd! I want everybody left to help keep these two safe in the meantime!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes, my lord!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I—I can do that, too?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You got us here, too, pal!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Allow the noble Gruecith to see this through for you!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah, my bodyguards and I will do our best!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You are in good hands, Rimuru.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah, you heard ’em, boss!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I had Kurobe, Yohm, Gruecith, Rigurd, and the Kabal trio in town. It couldn’t be a safer place if they were here.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">“Right! I imagine our enemy assumes the final battle’s four days from now, but that doesn’t matter to us. Right now, from this very moment, it is time to do what must be done and annihilate our foes!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And with that order, everyone began to move, working to the last man to bring Shion, Gobzo, and everyone else back.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Benimaru’s back was straight, shoulders high, as he strode directly for the magical device installed east of town. One of the Temple Knights there was the first to spot him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Someone approaching ahead! All troops, prepare for battle!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was this company of Temple Knights that established the Prison Field, the barrier weakening the monsters, at Archbishop Reyhiem’s order. There were a bit over a hundred of them, each ranking a B-plus threat individually. Three other companies were in each of the other directions, attending to the barrier devices. They boasted astonishing battle skills, geared more toward tackling monsters than your average knight, and all of them were more than amply trained for the job. And like any devout member of the Western Holy Church, none of them was complacent. They had guards on duty, tense and focused, and Benimaru was discovered in short order.</span></p>
