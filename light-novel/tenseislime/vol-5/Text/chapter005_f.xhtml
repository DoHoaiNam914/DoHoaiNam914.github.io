<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And it had led to this.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I came over to see what all this commotion was about…and Shogo is the last man standing, is he? My, my, look at that! Perhaps I misestimated the power of these monsters after all.” Now another older man stepped in front of Shogo.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He had on his robe, woven with magical fibers, a staff with untold stores of magical force in one hand. This was Razen, court sorcerer and the greatest magician in all of Farmus. With a hand in the air, he used his aspectual magic to cast a Magic Barrier in front of Geld, nullifying his attack. This spell was normally used to build a shield over the caster, but Razen could adapt it to block his enemies’ moves as well.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Nh…! R-Ratthen, you came to thave me…?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shogo clung to the sorcerer’s back. Razen replied with a nod before returning his eyes to Geld and Hakuro.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well, well, well. No wonder our otherworlders weren’t enough to secure victory. I find it hard to believe, but you are both A-ranked and a calamity-level threat. I do not like our prospects. Time to fall back for now.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then, with the Magic Barrier still in effect, he began to chant a high-level teleportation spell. Unlike Warp Portal, which required a magic circle to base itself on, this allowed the caster to define any point they liked to serve as the jump site. You had to be at least wizard-level to use this forbidden spell, and Razen’s ease in completing it indicated the full extent of his power and experience.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Geld attempted to give chase. Hakuro stopped him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“No rash moves, Geld. This is no also-ran.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…What?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Geld faithfully followed Hakuro’s advice—and, before him, the very air tore itself open. Razen had installed a trap in the Magic Barrier, setting it to explode after a given time delay.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Kah-ha-ha! Very shrewd of you to notice that. I should have paid you all much more caution than I did. Perhaps we should not be so optimistic about this battle after all…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He had been wary of Geld’s magical energy, but now, he acted like he noticed the threat of Hakuro for the first time.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You sly fox. You’ve been cautious of me from the very start…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, not at all, my dear ogre mage. It is only natural, after all, to spot this orc lord first in terms of brute strength. But now it is time. I would love to speak with you further, but my spell seems to be completed, so I had best take my leave. We may meet again in battle, assuming you survive…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I rather doubt that,” Hakuro shot back, “because the battlefield you are headed for will be attended to by our master. You have all gone too far this time. You have enraged the one creature in this world you should never have riled. I pity you. Your death will not be an easy one.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Kah-ha-ha! Enough of your silly bluffing—but if you mean it as a warning, I will keep it in mind. Farewell!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With that, Razen disappeared, carrying Shogo with him. Silence returned to the scene, although the sounds of battle could still be heard from outside the tent.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Are you sure it was best,” Geld said, “to leave that sorcerer Razen be…?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I imagine not, but if we fought him, then either you, I, or at worst both of us might have died. He had another hidden magic queued up for us, one set to trigger in the event of his death.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“He did…? And the magic was that much of a threat?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="y">“Likely nuclear in nature,” he muttered bitterly. “The ultimate in aspectual magic. Rigur and Gobta are here as well, and we cannot have them caught up in it. Now is not the time for ill-advised gambles.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Heavengaze gave him a better sense of the magic around him, from the flow of magicules to the extent of its force, than even Magic Sense could allow. It told him that the area beneath Razen’s rib cage was packed with highly dense magic—enough to set off a dangerous, forbidden spell, by Hakuro’s estimation.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I see…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It would not be an issue for Sir Rimuru, but we will still need to prepare for this. We must tell everyone about this dangerous figure before us.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Geld nodded. “I understand. I will relay the news to my own forces.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then they both went outside to assist in the final mopping-up of the western troops.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">With Shogo in tow, Razen safely made it back to Folgen’s side at their headquarters. Triggering several powerful magics consecutively in a short time filled him with a sense of fatigue like none he’d experienced in recent years, but now was no time to rest. He had work to do.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Th-thanks, Razen. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Forget about it, Shogo. You are one of my most valuable tools. One of our kingdom’s most precious pieces of war machinery.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Y-yeah… I lost this time, but not in the next round. I’ll show ’em!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Very good,” Razen gently replied—even as his eyes shone coldly, something Shogo failed to notice. “Your injuries seem to have taken care of themselves, but let me cast some magic to help you rest better. You need to recover your stamina first.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sure. Sounds good.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He accepted Razen’s offer without question—and, without hesitation, Razen cast his spell. It was the illusory magic Mental Strike, a move that shattered the target’s spiritual and astral bodies. Shogo’s spiritual corpus was already heavily damaged by Geld’s attack; this was nothing he could withstand, and he trusted Razen too much to have any of his own resistances up.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So the otherworlder Shogo Taguchi saw his end—doomed to die either way, between his weakness and his egotism. But</span> <em>this</em> <span class="merge__be">death was not one of the body but one of the heart.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">With the still Shogo in front of him, Razen prepared his final great magic of the day.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Rather earlier than planned, isn’t it, Sir Razen?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“My hands are tied, Folgen. The monsters unnerved him so much that he’d hardly be useful to us any longer. The time had come.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Heh-heh-heh… Still a pitiful sight, though. He really believed he was the strongest man in the world, didn’t he?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It appears that way. And look at Kyoya. He honestly believed he could defeat Hinata Sakaguchi, head of the paladins. With</span> <em>his</em> <span class="merge__be">strength.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Bah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Don’t make me laugh. Not even</span> <em>I</em> <span class="merge__be">could take her, and that little upstart expected victory?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Folgen could at least put up a fight against her thanks to the fact that he himself was an otherworlder, summoned by a younger Razen decades ago. He had no locking curse restricting his soul; in terms of their relationship, he was both friends and cooperative partners with Razen. Even to someone like that, Hinata’s strength was in its own realm, enough to convince him without trying that he had no chance.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It is a pity, though,” stated Razen. “Kyoya’s Severer skill slipped through our fingers before I could pass it on to you.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“That’s fine. There’s always next time.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Folgen’s own unique skill was called Spearhead. It gave him special insight into the strength of the forces he led, letting him select from and obtain the skills of any dead member of his force within eyeshot. He could earn only a limited number of skills this way, however, which annoyed him to no end.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Indeed there is,” Razen agreed. “The stronger among our forces always seem to foster powerful skills within them, but look at how selfish they all are! The one fly in the ointment. Summoning at random is much easier, but it never results in anyone strong enough—not that their personalities matter then, since we can always sacrifice them and seize their powers.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“No doubt. We’ve constantly spoiled them, treating them like the linchpins of our armies they are. I see no reason for them to complain about it.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The two shared a laugh.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">And this, right here, was the whole crux of Farmus’s problem. It wasn’t just the otherworlders—the summoners who called the kingdom home were just as egotistical, assuming by birthright they were the strongest out there.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Razen smiled as he continued his work. “But this may be a blessing in disguise,” he said. “At the very end, Shogo</span> <em>did</em> <span class="merge__be">help me out a great deal. I’m not sure what happened, exactly, but he seems to have obtained another unique skill. Now, then…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The job was almost done. He was resetting Shogo’s brain, overwriting it with his own memory. Once he transported the soul over, he was good to go.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You sure you’re all right? There’s no chance of it failing?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Don’t worry. This isn’t the first time. My teacher, Lord Gadora, reincarnated himself by literally birthing his soul all over again. No greater secret magic out there. Compared to</span> <em>that</em><span class="merge__be">, casting Possession couldn’t be simpler.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Razen had completely destroyed Shogo’s astral body in order to take over his physical one. He then destroyed his brain and rebuilt it again with Survivor. It was a total blank, with none of its soul’s memories restored, and now Razen’s own memories were burned into it. All he had to do now was implant his soul into Shogo’s body.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The Possession spell was a simplified version of Reincarnation, the mysterious, esoteric skill first woven by Razen’s master, the great sorcerer Gadora. It was an original skill of Razen’s, and now it was activated. This was how the head sorcerer of Farmus managed to serve his nation over all these many years, transferring himself from powerful body to powerful body. With Shogo’s, he was now reborn as the perfect combination of indomitable spirit and undefeatable muscle, the strongest magic-born in all of Farmus’s history.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ahhh… It does feel so nice to be in a younger body again.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Heh-heh-heh! You’re</span> <em>sounding</em> <span class="merge__be">much older than you look right now.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Enough of that. Now to report to His Highness and show him what I am reborn as.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He slipped back into the robe he had discarded earlier, staff in hand. There was a new spring in his step as he boldly sauntered off, brimming with confidence and aspiration over the new strength he had. It was enough to amaze even Folgen, reinforcing his confidence in his friend and partner.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Losing three otherworlders, a hefty chunk of their nation’s fighting force, stung badly. But Razen’s strength put him beyond the realm of special A rank at this point, so it was hardly worth lamenting. Right now, Razen was confident he could take Hakuro and Geld, those two enemy monsters he’d run into earlier, and easily trounce them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Deep inside, he even had a suspicion that he could challenge a demon lord, the so-called S ranks. Then he recalled the words of warning Hakuro left him with.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Have I enraged the one creature in this world I shouldn’t have? That witch dispatched the monsters’ so-called master long ago, no? He’s…actually alive?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The suspicion made him stop in his tracks.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, ah, nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He immediately started walking again.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>…I’m letting my mind paralyze me. Perhaps he is more of a menace than I thought, but I’m overthinking matters. And even if he</em> <span class="merge__be">did</span> <em>survive that witch, I can just dispatch him myself.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He smiled boldly as he approached the pavilion where his king awaited.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">On the third day, with the sun hanging in the middle of the sky, the nightmare finally began for the Kingdom of Farmus.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">A legion of troops was marching below me—but in my view, they were nothing but sacrifices to feed upon for my evolution.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">These were the ones who got Shion and the rest. Normally, I suppose I should give some kind of warning or indication that I would attack. But I already knew these guys had declared war on us, and if they were marching for town, I imagined they were ready to die for the cause. Besides, this wasn’t even a war. I was planning to consume every single one of them.</span> <em>Fair and square</em> <span class="merge__be">kind of lost its meaning if I intended for there to be no survivors.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This human garbage wrecked my territory. The least they could do now was enjoy the honor of helping with my evolution before dying.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">I was hovering in midair, in human form with my mask on and my wings out. Control Gravity let me unconsciously maintain this position as I peered downward, gauging the situation.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">As I did, Benimaru sent a Thought Communication reporting that the magical devices running the barrier were destroyed. Hakuro also informed me of a dangerous sorcerer he’d encountered, but I didn’t see the fuss. I’d just take care of him alongside the rest. Everyone else was back in town, staying on the lookout to make sure there weren’t any detached forces. It was my turn.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It had taken a little time, but Analyze and Assess had wrapped up its work on the forces below. I now had an accurate picture of their strength and numbers, and I had also finished calculations on a new magical spell. Everything was ready.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>…Shall we, then?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I deployed a large-scale magic circle, big enough to cover the entire Farmus force. It was powered by Anti-Magic Area, a great magic I’d picked up from Mjurran. It was about thirty miles in diameter, and it couldn’t have been more perfectly positioned. It covered the entire atmosphere up to ten feet above the ground, cutting the area off from the sky and the earth. Now the enemy could cast no magic.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">All of this was just to prevent the force from fleeing. I didn’t want to let a single one of them go, so I blocked any chance of their magically teleporting away. Now it was time to deploy the main course—a vast killing magic, the perfect weapon to seal the deal with. It was called:</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">“Die! May the anger of the gods sear through your very souls! …Megiddo!!”</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Dancing, swirling rays of light rained down from the heavens, repeatedly reflecting and refracting near the ground and plunging through the knights before they could react.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">There would be no opening bell to signal the beginning of the quiet massacre.</span></p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Usually, a military force in this world would deploy underneath a protective barrier established by the magical platoon attached to it. This was known as legion magic, and it put the force on notice against any type of magical element. The right kind of so-called “nuclear magic” from long range could change the tide of battle even if there was a lopsided difference in force involved, so most military marches in this world were done while keeping a close eye on magic from any number of distances.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Farmus, of course, had made thorough preparations along those lines, keeping up a stiff guard against all magic it could think of. Considering they were marching for a nation of monsters (including some that ranked even beyond A), they’d be deranged not to.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But none of that prep work had any meaning against my new magic.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Barriers in this world primarily worked on the principle of blocking the flow of magicules. It required a different approach from resisting the laws of physics, something I discovered when I analyzed the barrier.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was simple, if you thought about it. If a barrier could block a heat blast of thousands of degrees, then what exactly was the barrier doing to resist it?</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The aspectual magic of this world worked by intervening into the laws of physics, through the careful control of magicules. If you wanted to block such magic, you could just erect a barrier to keep those magicules from streaming in. Any offense against that barrier would have to outclass it in strength, or else it couldn’t apply any of its effects beyond the barrier. The magic would simply fail to set off. Things like Charybdis’s Magic Interference were applications of this principle.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Elemental magic, on the other hand, rewrote the laws of physics with the powers of spiritual intervention. It didn’t work on such large scales of force and distance, and the barrier had been built to block that type of magic as well. It was a pure test of strength between elementals, which made it easy to block your opponent if need be. As long as you were prepared for ambushes, it’d just devolve into an arm-wrestling match.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Really, with any type of magic, it all came down to figuring out the principle and going beyond it to neutralize the threat. That was why barriers like these were prepared to deal with just about anything, usually stacking at least two types of protective layers above each other.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">To deal with this, I thought outside the box a little and used magic to create a pure form of physical energy. Between my experience with Charybdis and my analysis of Control Magic, I had a general understanding of how the triggering of magic worked. Getting to see Hinata’s Disintegration in action was also an inspiration for the final concept. It all allowed me to have the Great Sage develop a magic effective enough to poke a hole through every type of defensive magic. I had just finished the final adjustments on it, and now it was deployed.</span></p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Over a thousand or so droplets of water were floating around me. I had deployed a dozen-ish large ones up above, shaped like convex lenses. These droplets gathered the sunlight overhead, honing it into thin rays of light and refracting it against the mirrorlike droplets below. This focused all the light upon a single point, where it was then further condensed by the convex-lens droplets down below me before being channeled toward its target. The temperature of these thin rays, no more than a pencil’s width in diameter, was several thousand degrees—more than enough heat to take a person’s life.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The droplets were water elementals I summoned and transformed for my needs. With my magic, each one of them took in the sun’s energy, refracted it, and collected it. And that was how Megiddo, my new</span> <em>physically</em> <span class="merge__be">driven magic spell, worked.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">The first wild blast of light led to a helpless death for over one thou</span><span class="merge__be">sand knights. Their ranks began to fall apart below me—Megiddo was terrorizing them, or so I hoped. But that wasn’t the end. Optimizing my calculations, I automatically adjusted the positions of the relevant droplets and set off the second blast. Another thousand or so fell, unable to resist the searing heat.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">That was the really scary thing about this magic, actually—how little energy it cost me to orchestrate. The convex lens that served as the final launching point was vaporized every time by the heat, but I could instantly provide another one. That was what the water elementals were for. And gathering water vapor from the air didn’t take much work.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">Rebuilding a lens took less than half a minute, so it was even possible to launch a volley of air strikes. All I had to do was gather more water and adjust my aim. It cost me nothing more than whatever it took to summon elementals and keep the machine purring—this spell, for the most part, ran on sunlight, the purest symbol of natural energy. It meant I could use it only during the daytime, but these forces were kind enough to march upon Tempest close to high noon. All potential issues had been addressed. Now I just had to clean up the garbage below me.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">The soundless bolts of light-speed force offered the knights no chance to react as they toasted them. The massacre went on. Magic Sense gave me a perfect picture of their locations, letting me strike them right where they were most vulnerable. The only thing their barrier obstructed was magicules, so I luckily had a clear view of them all.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">Whether a mercenary clad in crude leather armor or a knight in government-issue metal plate, death came to all equally. Occasionally, I would deliberately aim a beam at someone’s arm or leg or torso, making them scream in despair to add to the chaos. It only made the scene more gruesome. Terror was everywhere now.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">What I did</span> <em>not</em> <span class="merge__be">aim for were the fancier wagons and tents. I didn’t know where the king was. If I killed him, I’d never be able to make him confess his sins. I wasn’t</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">compassionate. Anyone stupid enough to incur my wrath needed to be amply rewarded for it.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">A mere five minutes or so after this one-sided strike began, two-thirds of the advancing force were out of commission. That meant over ten thousand lives had been snuffed out by me, their souls harvested.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Now ought to be a good time…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With a flutter of my wings, I descended to Earth, ready to deliver yet more despair to the fools before me.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">When Razen spotted the Anti-Magic Area deployed by the enemy, he was amazed at the sheer size of it. But he paid it no further mind, instantly recognizing that it didn’t matter much to them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Unlike in the Dwarven Kingdom, whose magical forces were the star player in their offense, Farmus’s magicians were tasked strictly with handling defense first, followed by strengthening and support spells. Magic that enhanced the bodies of targets was largely impervious to jamming, which meant having offensive magic robbed of them was not a major problem. Plus, they already had assorted legion magic in effect, and dispulsion magic would be the only way to get rid of that. An Anti-Magic Area made it impossible to cast any new magic within its range; it had no effect on things already cast.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Razen checked one more time to make sure all their defensive magic was still operational. It was.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hmm. Looks all right. Our enemy is rather confident in their close-range combat skills, then?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sounds like a job for me. Let me drum up my knights’ morale for a—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Just when Folgen was replying to the sorcerer’s question, a beam of light slammed down. Razen could barely comprehend what had happened—not just him but everyone in the area. There was a dull</span> <em>ting</em> <span class="merge__be">of impact, and the guard sentry behind them fell, a tiny round hole right between his eyebrows.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah…?! What was that?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Razen found himself shouting out in surprise.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Stand strong! Protect His Highness!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="u">Immediately heeding Folgen’s orders, the knights sprang into action, trying to bottle up their trepidation inside. But it was pointless. That first beam was just a test firing; what followed was a brilliant, dazzling array of light.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">In the blink of an eye, soldiers began to fall anew. There was no time to heal them. The beams ran right through their vitals, killing them instantly.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Gahhh!! My arm—my arm’s…!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Help! Help meeeee!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Aaaaaahhh! Where—where’s it coming from?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Those unlucky enough to be caught up in firing range cried and begged for mercy—or fell into panic at the sight of their unresponsive squad mates. In a single moment, it was pandemonium across the battlefield. Their spirits were once high, their minds confident in victory—but that was all long gone.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The leader of the Farmus Mercenary Brigades bitterly clucked his tongue.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His old soldiers, all veterans of more than a few intense battles in their time, were being run through by these beams of light out of nowhere, killed instantly. The new, younger recruits were running for their lives, driven by terror and barely in control of their senses. It happened in an instant—the blinding light dancing around them, everything within range of it dying all too easily.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Resistance was futile, and after a few moments, the second wave arrived. He saw his right-hand man, the vice captain of the force, fall before him—and that finally made the leader realize this was an enemy attack. Immediately, from the bottom of his heart, he regretted ever joining this expedition.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Goddamn them all! What the hell is behind this?!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">There was nothing he could do to counter this</span> <em>thing</em> <span class="merge__be">that went well beyond his understanding. But the mercenary leader had luck on his side. The third merciless wave that visited the squad killed him painlessly. He was a famed fighter, lauded as an A-ranked champion to the world, and he lost his life before he even knew what had happened.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">In response to this emergency, the anti-monster Temple Knights affiliated with the Western Holy Church stuck to their guns.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“All troops, fall into rows! Every group, stand in close defensive formation and launch your Multilayer Barriers! Show the enemy that no attack can faze our holy might!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">They were trained to move like this, instantly reacting despite all the friends they’d lost. It was a kind of dedication that amazed anyone who saw it. But just as they built their barriers, firm and confident, they all had their heads shot through and died.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was as if someone was ridiculing them from up high, showing them how useless their defenses were. And staying in close formation wound up being suicidal. Having so many troops in a tight space allowed one beam to kill several knights at once.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">No faith in the gods above would be strong enough to have any meaning in the face of Megiddo. By the time the fifth wave subsided, the Temple Knights were annihilated.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The strong and the weak trembled in unison. There was nothing they could do. Even the Farmus Noble Knight Federation, that group of hardy young Farmus noble-born, had collapsed, seeking any kind of escape they could. They were even attacking one another in a crazed, ugly display—but it was that ugliness that allowed them to survive the longest. Whether that was lucky for them or not is a topic for debate.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The magicians among the Noble Knight Federation—Razen’s personal apprentices—were forced to wallow in their helplessness as they died. They were unable to cast magic, and instead it was magic being endlessly thrown upon them. Or was it even magic at all, really? They just didn’t know, and it pained them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Even at the very end of their lives, on the brink of death, they were students. All they wanted to do was know. And they couldn’t.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">At the end of light wave number seven, half of them were dead. Razen and Folgen stared blankly at the scene for a single moment, then resolved to regroup with their king and leader.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="y">There was no longer any way to maintain order among the ranks. Everyone was too busy trying to save their own hides. Their best bet right now was to hasten over to their king and keep him safe. They still had no idea what these beams of light were. Even with their intellectual senses turned up to maximum, it was beyond their grasp. The moment something bright passed by, someone else was fallen. Even the afterglow took precious time to be perceived in their minds. The speed of it all was simply unimaginable.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But Razen had another theory about this. By his observation, a single beam could kill at most a few knights at once. He could tell there was some set of laws behind this light. If there was a wall, something he could use to cut off the light, that’s all he would need. Even if it was—worst-case scenario—a wall of humanity, the king would still be protected. And as for himself? He was willing to bet he could withstand this light.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So he and Folgen pushed toward the king’s tent, shouting the whole way:</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Where is King Edmaris? Is His Highness safe?!”</span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">King Edmaris was doing everything he could to quell the wellspring of terror robbing him of his very breath. He had to save his dignity as a monarch at all costs. His mind raced, his thoughts chaotic.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">There was now no denying it: This campaign was a failure. Even if he wanted to escape alive, developments no longer allowed for that. He just wanted to scream,</span> <em>How did this happen?!</em> <span class="merge__be">but there was no time for that.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Reyhiem, what will…? What should we do?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“We—we must remain calm. We must remain calm!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The king and the archbishop hugged each other inside their ornate tent, shivering. An attendant who had stepped outside to gauge the situation—literally just a moment ago—had already been incinerated.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">It wasn’t so long ago that he had seen off the advance forces, waiting for the knights who would march forth from behind them. They all seemed so confident, so reliable. He was sure this campaign would end in victory, part of the path to glorious honor for him. But a few minutes were all it took to turn the tables. All it took to fill the fields with the dead.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The sight was so detached from reality that King Edmaris couldn’t even comprehend how it had happened. All he could do was sit in his tent and quiver. And Archbishop Reyhiem was exactly the same. He had no interest in protecting the king—he stayed here simply because he imagined it was safest for him. He had no proof of that, but he wound up being correct. None of that merciless light had shone upon them yet.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Your Highness! Are you all right?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Knight Captain Folgen is here for you, my lord!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, Folgen! How great it is to see you! And you too, Shogo. Please,</span> <em>please</em> <span class="merge__be">let us get out of here at once. We must return home and regroup our forces!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Indeed. I have no idea what has occurred. We must leave at once, or we may be caught up in the carnage as well!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With two of Farmus’s greatest fighters on hand, King Edmaris could breathe at least a slight sigh of relief. He ran up to Folgen, practically clinging to him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Now, please, hurry! Where is Razen? We need his teleportation magic if we want to—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The ninth wave of light struck.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Aaaah!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The king squatted down, arms covering his head, as his good archbishop sank to the floor.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Please, Your Highness, stay calm. Your sorcerer stands right before you.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Shogo? No, is that…Razen?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“That is correct, sire.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah… Ahhh! Oh, Razen, Razen, thank you for coming! Now, please, we must go home at once!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“One moment, sire. There are a number of things I wish to report to you, but for now, I will keep it brief. To put it succinctly, right now, we are unable to cast magic within this area. We will need to somehow assemble our knights and use them as shields as we fight our way back to safety.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Um, are you sure about this?” Reyhiem ventured. “We have, um, our current force numbers…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Do not worry, Archbishop,” chimed Folgen. “Thanks to my Spearhead unique skill, I can force our surviving troops to group together. They will form a wall of humanity to keep yourself and His Highness safe.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, ah, ahhhh, I</span> <em>knew</em> <span class="merge__be">I could count on you, Folgen!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Indeed, I would rather rely on no one else right now, Sir Folgen!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Very good. I will relay our status to my men. Prepare to retreat!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It shall be done!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes! Godspeed to you, Sir Folgen!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Folgen nodded back and ran outside, King Edmaris looking expectantly on.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“So how should we prepare?” he asked the man who looked for all the world like Shogo next to him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Razen nodded and provided the king and Reyhiem two pairs of shoes—Winged Shoes, magical in nature, which boosted the wearer’s running speed and reduced their fatigue. Someone well trained in their usage could almost look like they were flying through the air, but the not-so-battle-hardened king could not expect that. He would need to run during this retreat, though, so anything that could make his flight more efficient was a godsend. Even within the Anti-Magic Area, magic that had already been activated would continue undisturbed. Razen had confirmed long ago that magic items weren’t affected at all in one.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Now, sire—the next time a wave of light strikes, we will make a break for the exit outside. Are you all right with this, Sir Reyhiem?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes. I am ready.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Understood, Sir Razen!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">They packed only what they needed with them and waited. Soon, the tenth—and final—bout of dancing light dazzled the battlefield anew.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Now!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Under Razen’s signal, the three of them ran off. Outside, the first thing they saw was Folgen’s broad, burly back. When King Edmaris caught sight of it, he shouted at his knight captain:</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“How is it going?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He was ranked beyond A as an otherworlder, a battle-hardened veteran and the pride of all Farmus. As strongest in the nation, the proud Folgen was one of King Edmaris’s closest confidants and a man he knew he could always trust. But Folgen offered him no answer.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Folgen? Folgen, what is wrong? Answer me!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Fear, confusion, and anger intermixed in his voice as the king slapped the knight captain on the shoulder. Then, in a single motion, the large, monolithic frame tilted and fell to the ground. A closer look revealed a hole in both his temples, running in a straight line from right to left. It was burned through, instantly cauterizing the wound and preventing much in the way of blood loss.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ee, ee,</span> <em>eeaaahhhhhhhh</em><span class="merge__be">!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="y">The king let out a loud yelp of terror, lost his footing, and practically crawled back into the tent. His choice of stance meant his Winged Shoes went to waste, as he demonstrated not even a shade of regal dignity. A warm liquid dripped out from his crotch as he sobbed, eyes and nose dripping like a faucet. And as they did, he knew: He was going to die. If he stayed here, he was dead.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Even as he tried to flee in terror, he kept falling down, his legs failing him. But there was no one there to notice. The knights who Folgen had called together had been wiped out with the tenth wave. Anyone still surviving had lost their sense of reason, too focused on saving themselves. Order and discipline were a thing of the past. The knights could easily boast of being the mightiest military power of the Western Nations, but now they were powerless, lowlier than a disorderly mob.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">All of them now tasted their powerlessness in equal measure. The terror should only have been expected. In a single instant, the absolute superiority over monsters they enjoyed had collapsed into a heap.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The feel of the battle had now changed.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The soldiers, running amok in all directions, stopped moving, their eyes turning toward a single point in the sky. King Edmaris was among them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">The cause of this scourge was there, a human figure flying down from above with its bat-like black wings. It was not that tall, and the mask it wore had a clear crack that made it almost look like it was crying. It had on a kimono of pure black, giving it a beautiful, almost divine look. The only obvious weapon was a straight blade slung at its waist—shockingly light gear for a battle like this—but the drive and ambition that oozed from its every pore provided all the explanation needed to overturn common sense. It proved that even the most elite of Farmus’s forces were worthy of a fate no better than a bug’s,</span> <span class="y">crushed under the heel of this figure as if it took a leisurely stroll across</span> <span class="t">the park.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The instincts of every witness on the scene told them all the same thing.</span> <em>Is that a demon…? No, it…</em></p>
<p class="m"><em>…It’s a demon lord!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Now, finally, King Edmaris realized the greatest mistake he had made. He should never have prodded this wasp’s nest. He should have forged formal relations with them, the way the kingdom of Blumund had. That outfit—and that beautiful, fetching cloth it was made from. And that appearance—that presence. This was surely the leader of the nation.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>So Hinata, that witch from the Holy Church, failed after all?!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The conclusion made King Edmaris’s face turn pale. But perhaps, the terror had gone so far past its limits that he had cycled back into calmness. He had the capacity to think now. That witch was lauded as the most powerful in the Western Nations. She was tasked with defeating the master of the monster kingdom, and that master was now flitting in the air above him. He had never heard of that cold, calculating witch ever failing to execute her orders before.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The voice of a dumbfounded Razen echoed in his ears.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“The master…of the monster nation?! You…you were truly alive all this time…?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="y">Realizing that his chief sorcerer was of the same mind convinced the king once and for all. The witch had failed. And, he saw now, the monster before them had more than enough strength to make that happen.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But that could wait. This monster bore the appearance, the air of a demon lord. Which meant, perhaps…</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>What do I do? How can I survive this?!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">King Edmaris racked his brain. Then, like a flash of light, an idea appeared.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>This might be our best chance! I am a king, a monarch. If I can phrase this to sound like I’ve come to negotiate, I’m sure he will listen to me. The report said he was soft, an easy mark!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It seemed like a brilliant idea. It was not. It was the opposite of that, and it made his thoughts veer in ever more terrifying directions.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>If he’s willing to happily negotiate with a tiny little speck like Blumund, why, he’ll prostrate himself before me when he hears the king of the great land of Farmus speaking to him!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He was failing to read the situation, reasoning with himself strictly based on what he hoped would happen…but that didn’t matter to him. He simply clung to the shallow desire to return home and prepare a counterattack. And it made him take action, instead of realizing how full of wishful thinking his head was.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Once I was ten feet above the ground, I realized how utterly razed the whole area was. It was exactly what I had pictured and calculated out with the Great Sage, mind you, but even</span> <em>I</em> <span class="merge__be">wondered a bit if I’d gone too far.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>…Wait. No. Can’t let my mind waver over something like this.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The survivors who spotted me sank to the ground in fear.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Aaah, help, help me!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I could hear what sounded like people pleading for their lives. I gave each of them a shot between their eyes for their trouble.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="v">It did take some time to get used to things, but now I could control the beams of light like second nature. The key was in the angle of refraction. You could fire all you wanted for the barest minimum of energy. Focusing your heat source on a single point cooked it up to several thousand degrees, and that was more than enough to take down a man or two.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Once I grasped the concept, I could always strike from the most optimal angle whenever I wanted. There’s a slight time lag to deal with, but we’re essentially talking the speed of light, so you can’t dodge it once you see it. I could fire it from six thousand miles away, and it’d still take about 0.034 seconds to find its target. Far faster than a human being could obtain the visual information and transmit it via the nervous system to their brain.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I couldn’t control and aim it with any accuracy without the computations of the Great Sage. Gotta give the guy a hand. It made me realize all over again how amazing it was. If someone fired this on</span> <em>me</em> <span class="merge__be">at close range, I’d have trouble evading it even with the Sage’s help. I could comprehend what it was the moment I caught sight of it, so maybe I could just barely get out of the way in time…but it’d probably come down to luck.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">For humans, there was just no chance. And when the tenth wave was launched, I heard a certain voice for the first time in a while.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Confirmed. The unique skill Merciless is</span><span class="cw">…</span><span class="cw">successfully obtained.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">It wasn’t the Great Sage but the World Language, popping in after a long hiatus.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Uh, dude, I really don’t need that skill. I know I have it and all now, but still.</em> <span class="merge__be">But just as I was about to check what it did, someone down there started shouting at me.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“W-wait! Wait! Are you the master of this domain? I am Edmaris, supreme ruler of the Kingdom of Farmus! Bow before me, for we have matters to discuss!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was some scruffy-looking old man.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Addressing me at a time like this, he was either brave or just a reckless fool. His crotch was all wet, which made me assume he had pissed himself at some point. Between all the tears, snot, and spittle on his face, he probably had seen better days. And this was a king? What a joke.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh? You a body double or something? Don’t worry. I won’t lay a hand on the real thing.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I was just about to open fire on him, not wanting to waste my time on idiots like this, but something stopped me.</span> <em>What if he</em> <span class="merge__be">is</span> <em>the real thing?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“That—-that is no body double!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Huh? Someone else now, just as old and even seedier-looking.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It is not! I swear it by my name as Reyhiem, archbishop of the Western Holy Church!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">Taking a closer look, neither of this pair appeared to be knights. Their clothing was too ornate for that. Whew! That was close. They were more “real” than I thought—but let’s check, just in case.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“All right. Well, I’m gonna kill everybody except for you—you’re definitely sure there’s not some other</span> <em>real</em> <span class="merge__be">king around here?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I am the one and true ruler of my realm! But…but</span> <em>everyone</em><span class="merge__be">?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Eep! W-wait, wait! At—at least spare my life as well, please! I wield great power within the Holy Church bureaucracy. I will gladly testify before all of them that not</span> <em>one</em> <span class="merge__be">of you is an enemy to mankind!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The seedy-looking guy who called himself Archbishop Reyhiem was practically praying to me. It’s not like sparing him would change matters much, but maybe I could use him somehow… And he definitely seemed important, for sure. Let’s keep him alive for now.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Which left the other one…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I gave him a quick glance. The man who called himself the king instantly noticed. “W-wait!” he prattled. “I told you—we have matters to discuss!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Well, all right. I have a positive ID now. Let’s hear him out.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What matters are those, old man? I’ll listen to what you got.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was a nice show of generosity on my part, I thought. But the guy took it as an invitation to shout his head off at me.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“H-how dare you! Such rudeness! I am the leader of the great Kingdom of Farmus! Normally, I would never even deign to speak to the likes of you. Now I’ve granted you that right, and</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">is how you treat me? …But very well.</span> <em>This</em> <span class="merge__be">time, I shall—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then I shot his arm off.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I dunno—I guess the scope of his utter delusion grated on my nerves. I really had no reason to be courteous to him. I save the politeness only for people who sincerely return the favor to me. That much applied whether this guy was a king or not. Plus, was now</span> <em>really</em> <span class="merge__be">the time for him to act all high and mighty?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I guess he didn’t get the situation he was in, so I just wanted</span> <span class="t">to open his eyes without killing him in the process. I took pains</span> <span class="merge__be">to avoid that, really—I even used Dark Flame to sear the wound and prevent excessive blood loss. Like, he was probably gonna die a painful death anyway…but that wasn’t my job. I was kind of hoping Shion could handle that for me. She’d be the one with the</span> <em>real</em> <span class="merge__be">grudge.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Now, will you look at me when you’re talking? Don’t get all carried away just because I’m being nice. You are allowed to speak. Get to it.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">All he did at first was blankly stare at the stump where his right forearm used to be. He realized what it meant at the same time the pain struck home.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Gaaahhhhhhhhh!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He started rolling around on the ground, screaming. Um, what did they call him again? A national hero, the ever-proud something or other? I was finding it hard to equate that great-sounding guy with the old dude in front of me. I still wasn’t sure he was truly a king, but nobody else in the area looked like they’d fit the bill. I told him I was going to kill everybody besides the king, and there were no other claimants to the title stepping up, soooo…</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Guess I’ll just go with this guy as the king for now.</em> <span class="merge__be">As I settled on this, it began to seem like the man’s pained screaming was starting to make the anger within me subside. But if this dude died on me, the potential rebound in my anger level honestly scared me a bit. I had to be very careful not to kill him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Look, did you have something to say or not? If you just wanted to show me your interpretive dance, that’s great, but I’ve had enough.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The statement made him open and close his mouth like a fish, desperately struggling to say something. I guess the terror and pain made it impossible to find his voice. This was getting really troublesome.</span> <em>Ah well. Just for a bit, let’s make him forget the pain.</em> <span class="merge__be">I grabbed the man by the hair, lifted his head upward, and peered into his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You get one chance,” I threatened through the mask. “There’s no next time, got it?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">That was enough to make the guy freeze in place, nodding furiously. Enough to make him regain his wits, I guess. Or maybe I just scared him so badly that it paralyzed all his senses. He was still having trouble with articulation, but now the words were coming out freely.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“This…this is all a misunderstanding! It all began with a misunderstanding. I only came here to form friendly relations with this land. Did you find the force I brought along with me n-not to your tastes? They were here to guarantee my safety, and I merely brought them along out of hopes that I may gain an…an audience with you!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Huh? You declare war on us out of nowhere,” I coldly spat out at this pile of bullshit, “and</span> <em>that’s</em> <span class="merge__be">the nonsense you conjure up for me? The moment I lost friends in that battle, you all became my enemy.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But the guy didn’t give up. “W-wait!” he shouted, talking even faster than before. “You’re wrong.</span> <em>That’s</em> <span class="merge__be">where the misunderstanding lies. The Western Holy Church saw all monsters as enemies, so I wanted to see for myself if it was worth attempting to make peace with you! And then the otherworlders we deployed here went out of control on us. I—I was tricked as well! I had no idea those miscreants were as dangerous as they proved to be. But what a stroke of luck! Now I know for a fact that your nation houses brave fighters capable of defeating those menaces. A country with such wonderful heroes at its disposal certainly passes muster with me! I, er, my nation would be glad to forge formal relations with yours! Wouldn’t that be wonderful? A great honor, if I say so myself! Farmus is a mighty power, unlike Blumund and the other small fry. Wouldn’t aligning with us put you in a much more prominent position? It would put our government at ease, and</span> <em>you</em> <span class="merge__be">would gain powerful backup from our forces. I could even introduce you to the Council at some point. We could both stand to profit greatly from this, no? I mean, I will need to ask for fair reparations to cover for the military losses we’ve incurred, but I truly think this has been a powerful lesson for the both of us. So how about it? You will accept, will you not?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Uh… Wow, is this guy a genius or what? How much does he need to talk down at me, making me as uncomfortable as possible, until he’s happy? And why’s he working under the assumption that I’d gladly pay him anything? Does he really want to piss me off that much, just so he can taste more pain during his inevitable death? Is he one of those?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Unaware of my confusion, the old man just kept on talking, up to the end.</span> <em>Right. Let’s take off his right leg to shut him up.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He started screaming, but I had taken pains to keep him alive again, so I let him be. No need to cauterize the wound or anything; I just cast Dark Flame to burn off the relevant blood vessels, so nothing came out. A pretty useful way to keep someone alive, I thought.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I then realized things had grown awfully quiet around us. I scanned the field, only to find the remaining soldiers kowtowing before me, too awed by the horror to do anything else. They had watched this whole exchange with bated breath, and seeing our talks get (literally) cut off filled them with despair. Some of them were half praying, half pleading for their lives, giving the proceedings a suddenly tragic air.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Sadly, there was no point in pleading now. My normally generous heart had been fully drawn over by the scrawls of rage. And I had just happened to finish analyzing that Merciless skill I got. Turned out it allowed me to seize the souls of anyone begging for their lives or seeking help from me. In other words, if they ever lost the will to fight, it meant death for them. It didn’t seem to have a vast range of uses, really, but something told me it’d help out a bunch right now.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Question. Use the unique skill Merciless?</span></p>
<p class="ext5"><em>Yes</em></p>
<p class="ext5"><em>No</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>If</em> <span class="merge__be">I had accumulated the necessary number of souls to evolve into a true demon lord, I could have always left these guys alive. But, sadly, it looked like I still didn’t have quite enough.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>YES</em><span class="y">, I thought. My heart was calm. There was no pain, no real sense of guilt I could find lurking in some corner. And an instant later, everyone except for Reyhiem and that guy with him (whom I had specifically defined as out of range) was exposed to the tyranny of Merciless. The knights all fell, unable to pose any resistance, and with that, the nearly ten thousand soldiers still alive all breathed their last.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Merciless, huh…? You’re damn right it is.</em> <span class="merge__be">It was safe to merely</span> <em>fear</em> <span class="merge__be">me, I guess, but the moment I fully broke their hearts, I could launch it. It was like they just handed their souls to me on a silver platter. I was free to choose whether I let them live or die—and if I let them off the hook, they came back home, and then they started plotting revenge against me, I could flip the switch on their lives any time I wanted.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Plus, the real surprise when I used this was that it worked even on the soldiers already fleeing me. It applied to everyone I had identified as an enemy at the beginning—in other words, everybody I watched over, up there in the sky. I know I talked a big game about “killing everybody,” but even I expected to lose some of the more prudent ones who decided to ditch this scene early. They were fleeing in all directions, too much of a hassle to track down one by one—but the moment I launched Merciless, the survivor count reached zero.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Just crush an opponent’s heart, and the fight’s over.</span> <em>Whoa. Maybe this is more useful than I thought. I have a feeling I’ll be tapping it again in the future.</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The waves of chaos and terror that permeated the battlefield neatly dissipated. I had made all the pain and fear go away, which I suppose was one way of showing a little mercy—even if it meant my two survivors were about to experience even more pain and fear.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then the World Language echoed anew.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cy">Report. Checking the number of souls required for evolution</span><span class="cy">…</span> <span class="cw">Confirmed. The required conditions have been met. The Harvest Festival will now begin.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">As the voice rang through my mind, I could feel vast amounts of power suddenly flow away from my body. Whether I wanted it to or not, my body was transforming, rebuilding itself. I was becoming a true demon lord—one recognized as such not just by me but by the very world itself.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">My body fell lifelessly to the ground, reverting to slime form.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Oh crap. I could barely keep my eyes open. Like, this wasn’t gonna just be a nap or anything. I was freakin’</span> <em>exhausted</em><span class="merge__be">.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">My vision was starting to fade around me, which I assumed was because Magic Sense was starting to falter. I was even getting dizzy. I mean, yeah, they said I’d have to go through evolution and stuff, but I was seriously worried that my consciousness would fly away from me. I sure as hell didn’t want to sleep in this field full of stinking corpses.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Let’s get back to town. I still have my two conspirator friends safely captured here.</em> <span class="merge__be">My mission was accomplished. There was no harm in returning to Tempest.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">As I tried to console myself with that thought, Magic Sense picked up something. A single person. If they were still alive, it meant I hadn’t broken their heart yet. Better be careful.</span> <em>God, as tired as I am, and there’s still someone left…? I gotta do something about this fatigue—</em><span class="merge__be"></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Report. Once triggered, the Harvest Festival cannot be halted.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Well, shit. I’m, like, in real trouble, aren’t I?!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Hurriedly, I called for Ranga. Lucky thing I had him in my shadow, just in case.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ranga, you there?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes, my master.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He was! Nice. He appeared smoothly out from his hiding place. Seeing him offered so much new promise for me. I sighed contentedly.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ranga, this is a top-priority order. Keep me safe and carry me back to town! And bring these two people along, too. Tell everyone there they are not to be touched, and</span> <em>definitely</em> <span class="merge__be">make sure nobody tries to kill them. You can ask Kabal’s crew or whoever to take care of them until I wake up.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Oop. Here we go. I was now having serious trouble keeping my mind together. Spatial Motion would’ve gotten me there faster, but I was afraid I’d blow myself up if I tried it now.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes, Master. What should I do with the surviving enemy?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Oh. He must’ve noticed, too. I had to think about it. There was someone there, pretending to be dead. Merciless told me after I used it that there were no survivors. So did this guy die then come back to life? It meant his soul was still safe in there. I couldn’t treat this lightly.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Ranga would probably win, I imagined, but I opted for a more careful approach. Safety first and all that. But just turning tail and fleeing didn’t seem right, and it’d be a pain if this foe decided to give chase.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So I chose to summon some demons, who’d hopefully at least delay my foe for a while. It’d really suck if word about Megiddo got out—it worked best only if the adversary wasn’t aware of it—but my safety had to take priority.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I will leave that to the others. They will bring the foe to you if they can capture them. Meet up with them for me.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I shall, Master!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I pooled together what little mental power I had left. Dispelling the Anti-Magic Area, I worked to summon a demon, offering the piles of corpses spread before me. I thought about using Glutton to eat them, but it wasn’t like they’d have any useful skills or anything.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">There was no telling what kind of demon would result, but hopefully it wouldn’t be a waste of twenty thousand bodies. It was exactly the kind of thing a selfish demon lord would do, I suppose, but it was the thought that counted. I hope.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Come to me, demon! I have something for you to eat, so…come on up and serve me now!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I sounded like I was trying to call my dog back from the yard. It was such a hassle to stay conscious that I could barely even pull off the summon correctly. Any demon willing to get summoned with something like</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">must be one damn curious idiot.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But maybe I shouldn’t have let such passing thoughts bother me. In a moment, three demons were there on the field. Just three? And here I thought thirty or so bodies were enough to summon a Greater Demon. Thousands of times that, and three is all I get. Ugh.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Well, at least they’re Greater Demons, ranked A-minus. Certainly no trio of monsters to sniff at. Plus, I</span> <em>did</em> <span class="merge__be">kind of pluck the souls out of all these corpses.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Ugh.</span> <em>Daaamn.</em> <span class="merge__be">I had never felt so wasted since I came to this world. My head barely even worked now. I wasn’t so sure these guys could find this enemy, this needle in a haystack. But whatever.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hey. Guys. There’s someone hiding here, pretending to be dead. Capture them alive and bring ’em to Ranga here.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Three Greater Demons, bossed around by a slime. To an outsider, it must’ve been a surreal sight. I couldn’t help but marvel at it. I was getting deliriously loopy as the dizziness grew. Simply keeping my body together was getting tough.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I needed to get somewhere safe…</span></p>

<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee. The birth of a new demon lord! Quite an old sensation but a familiar one. What a truly wonderful day! Such an offering—and the very first order from our lord, no less. This is such an honor; I couldn’t possibly be more enthusiastic about this. Would it be all right to continue serving you in the future?”</span></p>
