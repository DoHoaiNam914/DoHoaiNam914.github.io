<p class="cotx"><span class="merge__be">King Edmaris of Farmus winced at the report he was just handed. He had reason to. His kingdom’s situation had just faced dramatic changes for the worse.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">It all began when the seal placed on Veldora, the Storm Dragon, vanished from the Forest of Jura. It led to a flurry of requests for monetary and military support from Earl Nidol Migam and the many other nobles with parcels of territory out in the hinterlands. It wasn’t a problem the nation could afford to ignore. Edmaris had ordered measures to be taken at once—but instead of providing what the nobility hoped for, he sought instead to further entrench his authority.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I suggest that we could lay waste to the monsters only after they ravage one or two of our frontier provinces.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“That would certainly help prove the battle might of our Knight Corps, yes.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Heh-heh-heh… Sacrificing a few of those yappy little Free Guild men won’t hurt our budget at all. You can’t pay a creditor if he ceases to exist.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Very true, very true. And what better stage could we set to boost your political strength, Your Highness?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The losses had been factored into the equation, as it were.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was the job of a king to guarantee the safety of those who swore loyalty to him and followed his will in protecting their province. King Edmaris believed this. But there was no need to save the likes of Nidol Migam, some greedy knave more preoccupied with filling his own pockets than serving his people. Things</span> <em>had</em> <span class="merge__be">changed dramatically, yes, but Migam had failed to prepare for the future, and this was what he deserved for it.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">An act like this may temporarily hurt Farmus’s reputation in other lands, but once their knights proved themselves in combat, it would be a wash. Instead of trying to keep the entire country safe, it was both cheaper and safer to attack only when attacked first. The outer provinces were a shield that protected the Farmus homeland. They were useful tools, easily replaceable if lost. And there was no need to risk one’s neck trying to save a set of tools.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Still…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">To Farmus’s central government, which had fully prepared for a monster attack, there was something of a disappointment. A single champion, Yohm, had disrupted the entire plan. This man, rising up from the common people to form his own band, had gone so far as to defeat an orc lord and its entire force—so the rumors had it. And monster-based losses</span> <em>had</em> <span class="merge__be">been down from the usual rate so far this year. The king had no word about Veldora’s disappearance causing the monsters to grow unrulier—if anything, it seemed to be the opposite. That, as well, made the story of this new champion more believable.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“A champion? Ridiculous.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Unbelievable. But the Free Guild said that an orc lord had appeared. Perhaps it is not</span> <em>entirely</em> <span class="merge__be">untrue.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Indeed. They might not have been a full-fledged force yet, but a brand-new orc lord would have several hundred orc soldiers serving it, perhaps. That would still be enough of a threat to the borderlands, but—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ha! This is pointless. If that’s all it is, I could wipe them out myself! And now this man goes around calling himself a champion…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The core of the government—the advisers King Edmaris put the weight of his trust upon—had come to a conclusion.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well, if it means a threat has been eliminated, then very well. A pity it means our royal knights can’t have their day in the sun, though.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">Folgen, head of the Knight Corps, looked less than happy with the chief royal sorcerer Razen’s statement. For now, though, the topic was settled. He could tell well enough that Razen was simply telling the truth. There was no need to sally into battle just for the fun of it—an opinion King Edmaris seemed to accept.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The next issue to tackle, however, wasn’t one they could afford to watch and wait on. Their tax revenues were falling.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Usually, figuring out the state of the national treasury required careful analysis over at least several years. Here, though, the downward trend was both looming and blindingly obvious over the previous fiscal cycle. Month after month, the figures spoke volumes. After a certain point in time, trade-based revenue simply fell through the floor.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The Kingdom of Farmus, thanks to its geographical location, had a hand in almost every international exchange with the Dwarven Kingdom. It was part of why it served as the front gate, so to speak, for the Western Nations. They had the strength of direct trade with the kingdom; no need for dangerous sea or land routes. The high taxes they levied on the goods they imported from there and sold elsewhere provided enormous profits for them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But then, one day, the number of adventurers passing into the</span> <span class="u">nation started to dwindle. Previously, Farmus had been rather</span> <span class="merge__be">bustling with adventurers, all bringing a tidy amount of cash to purchase Dwargon-made weapons and armor. The potions Farmus could provide literally saved lives; adventurers could never have enough of them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">After a while, though, the number of itinerant merchants fell alongside the adventurers. They were seeing similar crowds of them from the direction of Englesia still, but the flow from Blumund and other nations neighboring Jura provided far more profit to them—with the lack of any other competition, Farmus was able to sell potions to these merchants at practically usurious prices. And now those people were gone. With all these foreign visitors suddenly disappearing, of course, it didn’t take long for the inns and taverns that served them to suffer.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The numbers were clear as day on paper within a month, so the economy minister hurriedly ordered his department to find the cause. The report that came back was enough to shock the entire cabinet.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">“A new town has been established in the Forest of Jura—a town inhabited by monsters.”</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The news, provided by a spy sent into the forest, made King Edmaris whisper “It can’t be” the moment he laid eyes upon it. But he remained composed. He was the ruler of a nation, and he needed to project his authority as king.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>I cannot believe it…but I must. The most important thing is: How will I connect this to our own profit?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His outstanding intellect pointed itself toward the future.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Before long, Edmaris ordered an emergency meeting among all the provincial lords of his kingdom.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“But, my lord, the merchants are keenly aware of their own self-interests. They are already traveling to this land of monsters, avoiding Farmus entirely.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It is said the nation provides a safe route all the way to the Dwarven Kingdom…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I heard the same. They have these ‘stations,’ I hear—small guardhouses located every dozen miles or so, each with sentry monsters assigned to them…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It is a difficult tale to swallow, but several trustworthy merchants have confirmed it. If a traveler is attacked in the midst of their journey, they can apparently launch these flares provided to them in town to signal the monsters. Help arrives in five minutes or less.”</span></p>

<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The ministers and nobility called to the conference seemed ready to leap right out of their chairs as they exchanged the stories. Wild, seemingly unbelievable tales flew out of their mouths. None of them could hide their shock.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The Forest of Jura was teeming with monsters. Thanks to its vast size, only low-threat creatures lived in the borderlands near human civilization. But that wasn’t always the case. You saw the odd B-ranked (or above) monster from time to time. The very idea of building a town smack-dab in the middle of this chaos—and even building links to it from Blumund to Dwargon? How much money, and how much military power, would that take? No one at the conference could begin to imagine. Even outside the forest, they had to expend a hefty chunk of tax revenue defending the border villages and towns. They were the nation’s shield, but every shield needed the occasional upkeep.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And</span> <em>monsters</em> <span class="merge__be">lived in this town? That was unheard of.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The nation was apparently led by one calling itself the head of the Forest of Jura. It did not, however, call itself a demon lord; it even wanted to build friendly relationships with human nations. A monster building a nation-state. It was crazy talk.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">King Edmaris raised a hand to silence the room, turning an eye toward one of his ministers.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“The nation,” he said upon the king’s order, “is known as the ‘Jura-Tempest Federation.’ The merchants refer to it simply as ‘Tempest.’ It is led by Rimuru Tempest, a slime who has apparently—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“A</span> <em>what</em><span class="merge__be">?! Are you kidding me?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The minister was cut off by a young man with dark hair and dark eyes who stormed up to his feet. Not a single minister or nobleman would dare to exhibit such rudeness before the king—but this man lived in a realm where politeness didn’t pay the bills. If anything, he was in a position to be forgiven for such outbursts.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He was, in other words, a champion of Farmus. An otherworlder. Thus, nobody took offense at his outburst—or, to be more exact, they didn’t voice any complaints if they did. Some of the more powerful nobles clearly looked down on him, but nobody needed the facts spelled out for them. Publicly revealing any enmity would put a dent in one’s own profits.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This was a human weapon, one of the people summoned by Farmus’s triennial “summon ceremonies” and a man gifted in battle skills. His name was Shogo Taguchi, a twenty-year-old Japanese man.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Enough, Shogo,” chided Chief Sorcerer Razen. “Hear out the report to the end.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“But a</span> <em>slime</em><span class="merge__be">? That’s the lowest of the low. How can some vermin like that become lord of the entire forest? Or—what, is the forest</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">full of wimps? Are you guys training me day in, day out just to swat a bunch of pathetic little monsters?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">As part of this “training,” Shogo had managed to seriously injure ten or so of Farmus’s most elite knights just yesterday. Razen smiled bitterly as he recalled the events. This young man, Shogo, undoubtedly wielded tremendous power—but his heart, his mind were too raw and immature to bear it. It had been three years since he was summoned at the age of seventeen, and in Razen’s eyes, his ferocity had risen by the day ever since. If he weren’t being subdued by the controlling magic placed upon him during the summon, he’d be a bomb big enough to raze an entire nation. Lucky for Farmus, then, that the controlling magic was absolute in its force.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I said,</span> <em>silence</em><span class="merge__be">.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Geh.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shogo returned to his seat, humbly following Razen’s trigger word. Anger still burned in his eyes, but Razen was too dignified in his role as head magician to pay it any heed.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sir Razen,” a clear voice rang out, “I feel Shogo does not mean any ill will. In our world, slimes are notorious for being about the easiest monster there is to kill—well, it depends on the game, actually, but either way.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, Kyoya. If you are in attendance, please help us keep Shogo on his best behavior. We are sharing a room with His Highness. Do not place further shame upon me!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The man called Kyoya was another otherworlder summoned from Japan. His full name was Kyoya Tachibana, and he had been brought here after being summoned into a small nation a ways from Farmus. This made him the newest face among the kingdom’s otherworlders, and now he shrugged in a show of allegiance and</span> <span class="t">glanced at Shogo. The other young man nodded, fell silent, and</span> <span class="merge__be">turned to hear the conversation. Razen, seeing this, asked the minister to continue.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">This town called Tempest was apparently home to a large number of monsters evolved from goblins, orcs, and so on.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">In the self-declared neutral Dwarven Kingdom, it wasn’t uncommon to see creatures like hobgoblins, orcs, and kobolds, but that was the exception that proved the rule. An entire settlement of evolved monsters was something far beyond the realm of common sense for them all.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Occasionally, every few years, you’d see the leader of a pack or herd spontaneously evolve into a higher-level creature. Whenever one was found, they were largely hunted down at once before they grew any more powerful. In human eyes, the way Dwargon freely associated with such beasts was virtually heretical.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Here, meanwhile,</span> <em>every</em> <span class="merge__be">townsperson was evolved. You likely wouldn’t see anything similar in history, no matter how many centuries you turned back the clock. But there was no doubting their spy’s report.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With that in mind, suppressing this upstart federation would be everyone’s likely first instinct…but it wouldn’t be so easy this time. These were monsters with demi-human traits; they had access to knowledge and technology, clearing out the forests, building highways, and even using human language to conduct business. That, and the rumors of that “station” system along the road—another spy report. Each one was officially called a “substation,” manned with monsters who worked in shifts day and night.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">These substations, as the minister calmly explained, were positioned in relevant spots up and down the highway. They had served as temporary lodging for the crews who built the road before being repurposed for this role—and the monsters stationed inside were tasked with keeping travelers safe.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Substations?” Shogo sneered. “What are these, cops?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Shogo—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes, Razen. Silence. I get it.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“No. What are these ‘cops’ you speak of?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Huh? Um, you know, a cop…?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kyoya snickered at the awkward exchange as he provided Razen a quick rundown of how policing worked on planet Earth.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hoh… An organization of sentinels, each charged with their own parcel of land to patrol. I see. But how could a horde of monsters keep this going?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well, maybe there’s an otherworlder like us with them. If he has the right abilities, maybe it’s really easy for this guy to make nice with the monsters.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Huh? Who would go through all that trouble, I ask? If this hypothetical otherworlder was</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">powerful, he would have no problem surviving in this world alone. Why would he go through all the trouble of drawing attention to himself like this?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah, that’s a good point.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shogo and Kyoya quickly lost interest in the topic, but Razen was still intent upon it, face grave as he thought.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>…An otherworlder? Could that be a possibility? Yes, that does sound rather more convincing now…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He nodded back at King Edmaris, noticing the ruler’s eyes upon him. Having a potential otherworlder lurking in the shadows behind this problem nation was a concern, but he wanted to signal his leader that he didn’t see it as a major hindrance to their plan. Razen and his apprentices had summoned far more otherworlders than just Shogo and Kyoya. A possibility was just that—a possibility, one they could weave into their plan of action. No problems to speak of.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Heh-heh…</em><span class="merge__be">, thought Razen as the minister continued.</span> <em>Even if they</em> <span class="merge__be">do</span> <em>have an otherworlder as a leader, they are nothing compared to Shogo, the greatest weapon in our arsenal…</em></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Farmus was hosting fewer merchants, and that meant the country’s finances were looking grim. Once the minister finished explaining that, he went to the main topic of this emergency meeting—the news that there was a new town in the Forest of Jura, one that adventurers were using as a base to gather monster-derived ingredients.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This town offered potions for sale that were just as good as, if not better than, those manufactured by the dwarves, plus a blacksmith at least capable of performing basic weapons and armor maintenance. Some merchants had even taken up permanent residence, no longer having to travel the world over to sell the items they’d harvested. No wonder the place had become a magnet for adventurers. As far from the forest as it was, there was no longer any reason for them to travel to Farmus’s capital.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And that wasn’t the thorniest issue. The big one—the public reason why the king convened this meeting of nobility—was the stable road link now established between the Dwarven Kingdom and the land of Blumund. A brand-new highway, one patrolled by demi-human monsters who guaranteed its safety as a trade route. It meant that most merchants could now travel directly to Dwargon without having to circle through Farmus.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>This</em> <span class="merge__be">they could not afford to ignore. If they let it slide, it could grow into a life-or-death issue for the kingdom. Farmus, after all, had no real manufacturing specialties to speak of. It had no resources under the ground to mine. Having the Dwarven Kingdom next door meant its own industry was still pretty low-level. It grew enough crops to keep its own people from starving, but that wouldn’t be enough.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The whole economy was dependent on the twin supports of tourism and trade. Without those, what could possibly refill the state’s tax coffers?</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The minister saluted King Edmaris as he wrapped up his report. The king nodded back, surveyed the nobility assembled before him, and asked a question.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well. What now, then?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">There was nobody to answer him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The same report the king had seen was distributed among the nobility and ministers in the room, outlining the details behind the just-completed briefing. Everyone gathered was a high-level noble official, deeply involved with running the country and extremely well-heeled. People deep in the core of the central government. People who knew what was at stake if their homeland lost its competitive edge and tax revenue.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">They had no answer for the king, but their thoughts were the same. If anyone dared to speak their mind, though, they might be forced to take responsibility for it all. None was brave enough to risk that.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The common thought:</span> <em>Attack this town and burn it to the ground.</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Farmus was a vast nation. With the resources it had at hand, it could send a maximum of a hundred thousand soldiers into service. But they were dealing with evolved monsters. Regular infantry would be useless. Well-trained knights or experienced mercenaries would need to be deployed. Unlike battles between fellow human nations, this was an annihilation mission—kill or be killed. It was no place for amateurs. It’d just boost the body count and drag down the rest of their forces.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So how many of these hundred thousand soldiers were actually useful in combat like this?</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">First, there were the five thousand members of the Farmus Royal Knight Corps, the all-powerful army led by Folgen, its captain. Serving the king directly, it was a pack of elites, allowed to move freely under the king’s orders. Each one of them rated a B in battle, and they boasted a reputation as the most powerful fighters among the Western Nations.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Next, there was the Farmus Sorcerer Alliance, a thousand-strong group of royal magic academy graduates led by Razen. Each one of them was an expert in magic, handpicked for their unique gifts in battle-oriented spells.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">After that came the Farmus Noble Knight Federation, an elite corps of five thousand composed of specially selected soldiers (including some of the younger nobles) who served the upper levels of nobility directly. They were a force to be reckoned with, even if they were primarily career soldiers with only sparse experience in actual combat.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Finally, there were the six thousand members of the Farmus Mercenary Brigades. This group was normally charged with keeping the peace inside and outside Farmus with a bare minimum of members, but they could be conscripted for emergencies and have their full strength taken advantage of. Their ranks contained a wealth of ambitious young men and women eager to prove themselves in battle and earn a spot in the ordained knight rolls.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">These 17,000 fighters were the standing force for the Kingdom of Farmus, ready to roll out at a moment’s notice. It struck quite a presence, more than enough to dominate over any nearby nation.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But the reports said the monster nation had at least ten thousand inhabitants. If they were all in fact evolved, it likely meant they were a C-ranked force or more, and it wouldn’t be amiss to expect some of them to reach B as well. Even if Farmus was still assured victory, they would have to pay in blood for it—perhaps even the blood of the royal knights and sorcerers, the nation’s greatest treasures. Any casualties in their ranks would no doubt lead to questions and accusations later on. Farmus had spent a fortune cultivating these forces; wasting them in needless combat was out of the question, and “because we’re afraid of losing our tax base” wouldn’t be enough of an excuse to mollify the nobles.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Given that the mercenary brigades alone were unlikely to bring them victory, it was a must that Farmus devote all its forces to the effort. Everybody in the room came to that conclusion in an instant. If any one of them suggested war, however, they might be the one left holding the bag for maintaining all those armies—and any losses incurred along the way.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And how were they going to explain this to the Western Nations? Especially Blumund, which reportedly already had relations with this monster land? They’d put up a strong resistance, no doubt. Everyone in the diplomatic ranks was too conscious of that thought, and of the future, to dare speak without good reason.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Nobody wanted to lose access to their own interests, but nobody</span> <span class="t">wanted to lose money, either. They didn’t, but doing nothing</span> <span class="merge__be">would lead to unavoidable losses—it may even tip the nation over the brink, if it was weakened enough. Every one of them thought the same thing:</span> <em>We have to do something. If only someone could get the ball rolling for us…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">They needed diplomacy to silence their neighbors. Power to make victory in war an assured result. And, more important than anything, a plan for the adventurers living in the monster town. Farmus had to make sure they wouldn’t be hostile—or convince them to join Farmus’s side, even.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">All these problems at hand and no profit to be made from it. Keeping the Forest of Jura’s status quo was difficult enough. If they attacked and destroyed an entire nation of monsters, they couldn’t even claim the land for their own provinces. No wonder they were facing a severe lack of volunteers.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">King Edmaris knew precisely what all his nobles were thinking. He had the exact same thoughts. The difference was, he was already taking countermeasures.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">The moment he heard the briefing, he already had his closest aides on hand, working out how to react. They discussed how to make the most profit from this. The crux of the issue was how to handle it without affecting the national interest.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“If we leave the monster nation to its own devices,” Razen conjectured, “its presence will become known to the Western Nations. Once it does, it’ll be impossible to make any move against it. If we strike, we must strike now.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ha! Monsters?” Knight Captain Folgen half spat out before realizing he was in the king’s presence and immediately regretting it. “Certainly,” he continued in a more disaffected voice, “evolved monsters are a handful. The knowledge a demi-human has certainly makes one a formidable enemy. They are showing at least rudimentary levels of organization, and they number over ten thousand. In terms of the threat, we could charitably call them calamity-level and even boost them up to a disaster, depending. If the leader of such a monster group was hostile toward mankind…it could even mark the birth of a new demon lord.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What?” the king shouted. “If it is really disaster-level, the mere idea of handling this alone is ridiculous!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Nobody could answer him. Razen merely nodded his apparent agreement with Folgen.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Do not worry, sire.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This was Reyhiem speaking, the most powerful religious figure in Farmus. As an archbishop sent by the Western Holy Church, he was (on paper, at least) on an equal position of power as the king himself, given Farmus’s adoption of Luminism as its state religion. That was just a formality, however; in reality, Reyhiem was more of a trusted right-hand man, taking his cues from the king.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, Reyhiem. Do you have a proposal?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bt">The bishop flashed a smile that seemed a little too sinister for a member of the clergy. “I do, I do, of course. Regarding this land of monsters, our Church has already identified it as a very dangerous presence. I was contacted earlier by Cardinal Nicolaus Speltus, and he told me we plan to smite this nation, as it poses a clear threat to the heavens above. However, we have almost completely failed to damage them so far, and we’ve even encountered traitors among the human nations… Our Church wants to avoid making the Council our enemy, as he said, and he told me to keep my ears open for any nation willing to offer us assistance.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“He did! So the Church has already certified them as an enemy of the gods… But they seek the help of other nations?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">King Edmaris’s eyes sparkled. Cardinal Nicolaus Speltus was a close confidant of the pope, the supreme leader of the Holy Empire of Lubelius, the man at the de facto seat of power across all the Western Nations. He was also Bishop Reyhiem’s direct superior, and he was an arrogant, coldhearted man, one occasionally appraised as a “devil under the sage’s mask.” He was a sharp-witted figure, ever ready to take action, enough so to give even King Edmaris pause—and this man had made his decision. Which meant the woman serving him was ready to move. It made the king smile a sincere smile.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“If—and this is just a hypothetical—but if citizens of Farmus were to come to harm in this monster nation, what would happen then?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“The Western Holy Church would take full responsibility to provide rescue to its followers, I imagine.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah. Well, well! We are ever the devout followers of the faith, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You are; you are. Very true.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The king and the bishop shared a smile.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“If so,” interrupted Folgen, “I promise we would be delighted to march forward and smite these monsters. I believe the Royal Knight Corps would be enough to annihilate this nation, but I would like to be thoroughly careful. Archbishop, will the Church be able to provide further resources to us?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Reyhiem, apparently expecting this question, deepened his smile. “We can, Sir Folgen. I understand your concern. Cardinal Nicolaus has already provided his approval to deploy the Temple Knights.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The Temple Knights was a catchall term for Church-affiliated fighters sent off from its central temple to other nations. Said to</span> <span class="bs">number in the tens of thousands, they offered the manpower to</span> <span class="merge__be">back up the immense influence the Church had in the area, the most gifted among them forming the Crusader groups and calling themselves paladins. Farmus’s own Church sites had Temple Knights stationed in them, about three thousand strong—the largest number stationed in any nearby nation.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">Even as an archbishop, Reyhiem didn’t have the authority to issue orders to them. Now, though, Cardinal Nicolaus was ready to give the command. They could all be sent into battle in the forest without a single problem coming up.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You have permission to use the Temple Knights…?” Folgen nodded, satisfied. “The Holy Church must be quite serious about this, indeed.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The king joined him in smiling as he pondered this.</span> <em>Judging by how the Western Holy Church sees all monsters as the common enemy of mankind, there’s no way they would ever allow this nation to exist. Still, without a just enough cause to stir men’s minds with, they would have trouble filling their armies. And</em> <span class="merge__be">that’s</span> <em>precisely why they want to use us, eh? Heh-heh-heh-heh… Well, the same works vice versa, you know…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">If both sides were of the same mind, it would be easiest for them to simply join hands in battle. Such was King Edmaris’s conclusion.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I would suggest,” Reyhiem said to sum up, “that we take up the advance force at the same time as when the Western Holy Church declares the war to begin. You will enjoy the full glory of serving as the sword of mankind!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The king was in agreement. Whether it was diplomacy or war power, there was nothing to fear with the Holy Church backing you up.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">That left just one problem:</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Now, what bait can we prepare for the nobles to pounce upon?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">They needed to make the noble ranks cough up their soldiers, and they needed something to reward the mercenaries with. A worthy cause and some lofty speeches wouldn’t sway them. It could even antagonize them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I imagine glory alone won’t move them,” a scowling Razen intoned. “If we put the Royal Knight Corps, the Sorcerer Alliance, and the Temple Knights within Farmus together, that’s nine thousand troops. That should be enough to assure victory, but…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With the exception of Reyhiem, everyone in this huddle wanted their approach to be foolproof. But it was Reyhiem who broke their silence once more.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh yes, yes,” he said with a smile. “Cardinal Nicolaus mentioned that in his message as well. As he put it: ‘Monsters are not people. Therefore, the Church has no interest in their lands. Do as you will with them.’”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Monsters aren’t people? Isn’t that obvious?</em> <span class="merge__be">King Edmaris had to keep himself from asking out loud. Once they destroyed the monster nation, it’d be a waste of effort if they couldn’t manage their land afterward. An extremely unattractive proposal. But</span> <em>could</em> <span class="merge__be">they manage it?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Perhaps if they blessed the land and then received the Church’s permission to rule over it? The king had no qualms about ruling over monsters—monster slaves and the like weren’t rare sights. If they were willing to negotiate with and submit to them, he could guarantee them protection under the name of Farmus—assuming they converted and became servants of Luminus. If not, they’d raze the land, enslave the surviving monsters, and annex the entire territory.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">There might be certain issues with this if Farmus was dealing with demi-humans like dwarves. Simple evolved monsters, though? Those weren’t people. They could even use magic to enslave them without a second thought.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I see. Cardinal Nicolaus is a broad-minded man indeed, reading that far ahead in time…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“He is; he is! And he wishes for nothing more than the continued prosperity of your kingdom, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">King Edmaris gave this a firm nod. Farmus would gain new territory, along with all the natural resources the Forest of Jura had to offer. No one would complain if he left the region’s defense to them. The Council had already recognized monster slaves as perfectly legal.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Best of all, this would earn Farmus new trade routes—routes that’d let them leapfrog right over Blumund and continue their previous lucrative relations with the Dwarven Kingdom. Charging tolls for the highways already built in the forest could even lead to bigger earnings. Giving the nobility flashes of such potential fortune should be enough to make all of them sign on for battle.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>And then…I’d love to procure and enslave that monster nation’s engineers for us…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">With all apparent problems solved, it was time to see what else was on the table. King Edmaris recalled a certain item that had charmed him not long ago—a bolt of silken cloth. It had been obtained from that monster nation, they said, and it felt more pleasant against the fingers than any fabric he had seen before. Magical fibers and cloth seemed like mere playthings compared to this. Upon further analysis, it was found to be intricately woven with fiber obtained from hellmoth cocoons. Hellmoths were B-ranked dangers, and the idea of using their cocoons was seen as beyond foolhardy… But just look at what you could make from them!</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He simply had to learn how this was made then position it as one of Farmus’s showcase exports. This wasn’t the only wonder product from the monsters, either—others were circulating, according to the report. He had already ordered his government to procure as many examples as possible—but why even make that effort? Just exorcise the evil from the monster lands, and it was all there for the taking. It couldn’t be simpler.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">King Edmaris found himself struggling to maintain his composure at the thought of all these untold riches. It made him want to burst into a childlike smile. If he had the Western Holy Church’s backing, this battle was now a</span> <em>holy war</em><span class="merge__be">, one with him as leader and commander. The honor that victory would earn him suddenly took on an even more important meaning. It’d firmly establish him in the world scene, and it’d firmly put even the upper nobles in their place.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He</span> <em>needed</em> <span class="merge__be">to command this holy war, he thought—and once it was over, he’d be able to bask in the reputation of being King of Champions. Folgen, the champion who’d defeated a disaster. Razen, the sage who’d assisted him. They’d all have their glory. And with Cardinal Nicolaus looking on, Reyhiem could even get on the fast track to the next cardinalship.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Everyone had much to gain from this battle. And while the Western Holy Church would take their “alms” in return, it was a small price to pay for all the fortunes they’d be amassing. And—hell—any of the nobles who excelled in battle could be granted monster lands as tribute. The king wanted their industry and their technology; the land didn’t really matter to him. As long as he retained the right to charge tariffs and tolls, he didn’t mind sharing the leftovers a little. Compared to the small ransom he paid to defend the frontier lands, it’d be a huge money saver.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">In short, King Edmaris wanted exclusive control over all his nation’s riches. So he needed to create a situation where the nobility would have no room to complain if they didn’t step up.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">This entire emergency meeting was a charade to make that happen. A charade to make them all convinced the king thought,</span> <em>Well, if nobody’s going to volunteer, then I suppose it is my duty as leader to</em><span class="merge__be">.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The king looked around the room one more time, making sure none of the higher nobles or ministers was about to open their mouth. Now he had the atmosphere he wanted. The king would</span> <em>have</em> <span class="merge__be">to come out himself. The time had come.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I was hoping I could ask all of you, but perhaps it is too heavy a burden to bear…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">King Edmaris attempted to continue. Before he could, a single nobleman raised his hand.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“My lord, if I may dare to interrupt you! This monster nation, Tempest, has reportedly already made ties with the nations of Dwargon and Blumund. They have begun engaging in trade with adventurers. I thus wonder about the wisdom of making any rash moves…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Indeed,” said another. “And this talk of developing their own technology, with the full assistance of dwarven smiths… If we raised an army, who can say what sort of meddling our neighbor kingdoms would engage in?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This was, in turn, the Marquis of Muller—himself a leader of one of the larger nobility factions—and Count Hellman, who generally followed his lead in court affairs. They both turned to Razen, resisting the urge to scowl at him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…You are correct. To be honest, I can certainly see the wisdom of letting sleeping dogs lie…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I am in agreement with you, Razen,” stated the king. “But—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes, I am aware, sire. If we leave that nation to their own devices, our authority in the region will plummet. Thus, we must strike them before that happens, regardless of the potential profit at stake… This is a competition for survival.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">King Edmaris nodded, eyes clouded with greed. As were Razen’s. They had practiced this exchange earlier. The king, ever thinking about his own nation, and the loyal retainer who served him. None of it was real, but the king’s trap was already sprung upon the audience.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I also have an announcement to make,” Reyhiem stated. “We have not submitted public notice yet, but we have already received divine guidance on the subject. Our gods tell us that the land of monsters must be destroyed.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This unnerved the nobles. It was now a holy war they were talking about, a Holy Church–approved conflict. The will of the nation would be on their side now.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I understand the concerns of our good marquis and count,” the king said. “But I could hardly find it in me to doubt the words of the Holy Church.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“And consider this!” Folgen shouted. “Consider this a way of opening the eyes of the assorted nations who have been tricked and deceived by this country. No monster is worthy of trust—a lesson I feel we should teach them personally!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“B-but…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“That would mean we could potentially take the blame…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hmm?” King Edmaris turned a gentle smile toward his two doubtful noblemen. “Then what do you suggest we do?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Any concerns from neighboring countries would no longer be an issue the moment the Holy Church backed them up. Farmus was a superpower, one with major clout in the Council. If the cause was presented as just, both politically and religiously, it would be simple to spurn any outside interference.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The two nobles turned to face each other for a moment. “Could we perhaps send a messenger?” Muller suggested for them. “If we could negotiate with them, we’d be able to tell whether they are worthy of our trust or not! And if they seem ready to be allies, the monster threat would be a thing of the past. We would have nothing to fear. The Church has not made an official proclamation yet, I am sure, because it wants to discern their true motives first.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Exactly.” Count Hellman nodded.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He and Muller both owned domains that bordered the forest, making defense a constant worry. The marquis’s lands also shared a boundary with Blumund, which they had good relations with. That must be what drove his opposition.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Well, well. Perhaps Blumund has been bribing you…but this is already</em> <em>settled business.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">King Edmaris laughed a bit internally, reveling at how late this resistance was as he placed both of them on his watch list. His mind was already full of the fortune and glory he would no doubt acquire soon.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“No, my good marquis and count,” Reyhiem interjected. “The divination has already been provided. Luminus refuses to abide the presence of any monster—especially monsters who dare to build a nation. Any such nation would mark the birth of a new demon lord! Allowing such a filthy thing to exist is an egregious and unforgivable sin!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Muller and Hellman both gasped, taken aback by this outburst.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="u">“I understand your views,” King Edmaris added solemnly. “Let me ask you: Can we trust these monsters? Who could guarantee that they will not attack people someday? Are you willing to take that responsibility? Are you willing to protect the lives and fortunes of my beloved people? We are dealing with monsters. Creatures we could never fathom. Creatures in eternal conflict with mankind. Don’t you find the views you espouse to be rather imprudent?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The overpowering performance caused both of them to turn white, unable to respond. How could they? The enemy wasn’t even human. What could possibly bring anyone to trust in them? That unspoken implication was impossible to refute.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">As far as King Edmaris was concerned, the so-called leader of this horde was nothing more than a softhearted pushover. The speech he reportedly held at the Armed Nation of Dwargon made that patently clear. When he read that ridiculously idealistic quote in the report—“as we attempt to build a nation in the Forest of Jura that serves as a bridge between the human and monster races”—he laughed. What a foolish, easily manipulated leader</span> <em>this</em> <span class="merge__be">was! Someone with no force of personality, a monster who found it impossible to tell a lie—that was the impression the king received.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>That</em> <span class="merge__be">little tidbit wasn’t included in the reports handed out to the nobility. It was a small trick, crafted to ensure there would be no dissenting opinions, and it could be easily defended as “not my fault” if someone found out.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>If their leader is</em> <span class="merge__be">this</span> <em>softhearted, it might be easier to make them surrender than I thought…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">In Edmaris’s mind, this leader might find war so distasteful that a bit of a sales pitch on the benefits of life under Farmus rule might bring him right to the bargaining table.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>And if so, we can resolve all of this in peace. If they provide their fortune, I could even allow them the right to self-govern…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He tightened his expression, now in danger of becoming twisted in avaricious glee. Confirming that no further dissent was coming, he spoke.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“This is a holy war! We will begin by deploying a vanguard force to relay my will to our foes! If they acquiesce to us, then fine. If not, I will show them the will of divinity with our most loyal of forces!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“““Rahhh!”””</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And with that out in the open, nobody would dare voice their disagreement now. The effort to “cleanse” the land of Tempest had begun.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">After the conference:</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“But what if they</span> <em>don’t</em> <span class="merge__be">surrender once our vanguard force causes an uproar in their territory? They might show their true colors and resist us.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“They could,” Razen replied to Folgen. “That’s why I believe we should send the otherworlder Shogo along with them to prove our strength…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh? I’m not sure if sending Shogo alone would be wise. He may spout a great deal of nonsense most of the time, but his strength is genuine. We can’t allow him to go out of control and lose him for good.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Indeed. Well, you know the number of monsters involved.</span> <em>We</em> <span class="merge__be">might be able to flee back home, but one bad decision and he might just be killed. With Kyoya along, I doubt we will run into any issues. Besides, we have the perfect person for a mission like this.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah. Her, you mean? I see.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">King Edmaris nodded his agreement.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The mission of this military strike was to sap the enemy’s will to fight. If they could subjugate Tempest without any bloodshed, they could hope for nothing more. They had the numbers to guarantee victory if push came to shove, but as the king theorized, the fewer casualties they could get away with, the better.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes,” he said. “We may not need to target our full forces upon these creatures after all. But keep your guard up.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Worry not, sire. We have taken every possibility under consideration. I ordered them to simply spread a little havoc and then return to us.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">As the king hoped, Razen was planning to take a wait-and-see approach.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The three of them were then interrupted by Reyhiem and his near-inhuman smile. “My lord,” he said, “if possible, would I be able to test out one of my secret spells?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Secret? What sort of spell is this, Archbishop?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What are you scheming now, Reyhiem?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He gave them a full rundown, his smile growing ever more cheerful. It proved contagious, spreading to King Edmaris’s face, then Razen’s and Folgen’s as he continued to speak.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Heh-heh-heh… I like it.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Your answer?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Very well. Go right ahead! I will allow it, Reyhiem.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It gladdens me to hear that, sire. I promise it will bring you the utmost of glories!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And so Reyhiem’s pawns slowly, secretly began to move themselves.</span></p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Following King Edmaris’s missive from on high, a vanguard force was quickly formed. It consisted of a hundred mounted cavalry, plus a breakthrough force consisting of several wagons. Three otherworlders were among them: Shogo Taguchi, Kyoya Tachibana, and a woman named Kirara Mizutani.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Umm,” Shogo griped, “I haven’t been on a trip in, like, ages. If they chose me, does that mean, like, it’s</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">kind of thing?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah, no doubt about it.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You hear anything, Kyoya?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…You were there, too, weren’t you? The Kingdom of Farmus is stepping up to wipe out that slime.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“That’s crazy. All these forces just to squish a slime?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well, who can say? If it’s got ten thousand or whatever monsters under its control, that’s gonna be a pretty decent threat.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah, whatever. I mean, the knights in this country are just pathetically weak! Seeing that, it makes me think—like, the humans in this world are such massive wusses that even dinky little monsters are enough to make ’em crap their pants.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kirara laughed. “That, or maybe you’re just too damn strong, Shogo. I mean, that unique skill you got for battle is nuts.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ahh, I’m more scared of</span> <em>your</em> <span class="merge__be">skill than Shogo’s.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah. Even I wouldn’t like my chances against you.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kirara was still young, aged eighteen. Just like Shogo, she had been summoned into Farmus-controlled land three years ago. Her skill—which involved influencing people’s thoughts during negotiation—wasn’t directly related to battle, which led to rough treatment and assumptions that she was just another failed summon. At first.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then it happened. It was too much for her to put up with—and that had made her use the power</span> <em>right</em><span class="merge__be">. “Stop screwing with me, you assholes!” she’d screamed. “I just wish anyone who messes with me would</span> <em>die</em><span class="merge__be">!” The nature of the resulting Bewilder skill ensured that the effect was immediate. Anyone who’d failed to resist it immediately committed suicide.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">A negotiation skill? No way. All she had to do was bark out an order, and she could make anyone do her bidding. It depended less on the actual words and more on what Kirara wanted on the inside. The results were nothing short of a massacre until Kirara’s summoner managed to place a locking curse upon her.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">All three of them had had their powers checked from the moment they were summoned. The first few months were devoted to magic-assisted language lessons, along with a wide array of testing. The locking curse could not be resisted. Any order made with it simply had to be followed, whether you wanted to or not—and as part of that, Kirara was forced to reveal what her skill</span> <em>really</em> <span class="merge__be">was.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She revealed it, but she was inaccurate on a few of the details, thanks to her unfamiliarity with the language. As a fifteen-year-old at the time, for Kirara, learning a foreign tongue was a struggle. Even with the magical support, the mere act of studying was pure torture to her. The results led to that “I hope you all die” tragedy, and ever since, Kirara’s skill had been sealed away, restricted from activating without permission.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The same was somewhat true of Shogo, but (whether it was lucky for him or not) it didn’t take long for Shogo’s full strength to become obvious to all. That was what happened when you killed the thirty magicians surrounding you the moment you got summoned. It was the work of the unique skill Berserker, and as the name suggested, it simply provided a massive boost to the wielder’s physical strength and abilities.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He had been seventeen then, a delinquent from a failing high school, and his discontent and lust for violence had awoken the skill in him. Combined with the karate Shogo had studied since childhood, Berserker provided a massive boost to his fighting strength. That led to thirty massacred sorcerers. If Razen hadn’t been there, it would have been even worse.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was never a given that people summoned into this world would just go quietly with their new guardians. They were taken from their own lives for purely selfish reasons; anyone could see the effect that would have, and the people on</span> <em>this</em> <span class="merge__be">world knew it well. To handle it, each set of summoning-ceremony spells came with a locking curse included that made the otherworlder do the summoner’s bidding.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I swear,” muttered Shogo, “I wanna kill that old man. Just ordering us to do whatever he wants…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah, seriously. One of these days he’s, like, totally goin’ down.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, don’t be like that,” Kyoya replied. “At least if you do what he says, you’re guaranteed the best food and accommodation this world has to offer.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">They had gone through this conversation before. It was never enough to leave Shogo or Kirara convinced.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Huh? Yeah, no shit! Especially when the ‘best they have to offer’ is garbage compared to</span> <em>our</em> <span class="merge__be">world.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, totally,” Kirara added. “There are no cute stores, no cosmetics… No TV, no Internet, no smartphones. This world’s, like, completely devoid of entertainment. I’d be totally fine if this planet just exploded.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The complaints had piled up to the point where all three could blow up at any time. Being forced to carry out orders with no free will, in particular, was proving unbearable. And Kyoya knew that much—but unlike the others, he was willing to take a more flexible approach to his plight. There was nothing he missed about his old world; he was far more interested in the powers obtained on this one—Shogo’s, Kirara’s, and his.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He had observed them, researched them, and thought about what could be done with them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And as he had, this current incident occurred—a monster-slaying quest, their chance to work in the open. Finally, after two years, Kyoya would get to see actual battle.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Maybe Shogo and Kirara don’t like this, but I think this is our big chance. If it turns into a war, that’ll keep the guys with the locking curses on us too busy to keep tabs. Maybe we could even kill them—or maybe they’ll just go die themselves.</em></p>
