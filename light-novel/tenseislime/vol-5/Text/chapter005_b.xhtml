<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And yet—</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sorry, man, but you’re gonna help me vent my anger a bit.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It sounded almost haughty, the way he put it, but nobody was there to complain. In an instant, they were all dead. With his sword, encased in jet-black flame, he cut the knights neatly in half—armor and all—as easily as ripping a sheet of paper. Their fresh blood stained the ground red, like crimson fields of flowers blooming amid the black fire.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">One of them held out just long enough to voice his final resentments.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“N-nobody said anything about this…this…monster…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was the captain of the knight company, and it was his last act on this world before the black flame consumed him. That single dance-like motion from Benimaru didn’t even need half a minute to knock them all out—and another offhand swipe of his sword slashed right through the magical device.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Mission complete,” he whispered. “Now—are any of my allies pathetic enough to be having trouble with this?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He sincerely doubted it, but he still set off to check out the scene in the other directions.</span></p>
<p class="space-break00"><span class="merge__be">Over to the south, Gabil was busy rousing his men.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Gah-ha-ha-ha! I’ve finally been given a place in the sun! I was hoping my successes in putting our potions on the market would’ve merited my appointment to higher government by now… But then we had</span> <em>this</em> <span class="merge__be">distraction happen to us. It is simply outrageous that these minions should get in my way! Isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It is exactly as you say, Sir Gabil!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well put. I was hoping that our efforts would be rewarded by now and that Sir Gabil would be basking in the fruits of his success. But now…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes! Yes, precisely!</span> <em>But!</em> <span class="merge__be">If this battle can prove to Sir Rimuru that I can be of aid to him, I am all but guaranteed a lofty role in his hierarchy! I want to see the full extent of your force in action right now, people! Show them what a dragonewt riled is capable of!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“““Raaahhh!!”””</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Spirits were high, no doubt, although some of Gabil’s men might have questioned the way he phrased that speech. They knew Gabil didn’t need some fancy title in the Tempest government—he had already proven himself a capable leader in their eyes. That was why they had followed him when he was banished from his homeland, after all, and as petty as he could be about it sometimes, they knew he was seriously trying to boost their good name.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Such words,” one of them whispered, “are exactly why Soka and the others make fun of him, you realize.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Shhh! You want him to hear you?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah, well, that’s one of the good things about our general, after all, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“No doubt. You said it.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Enough idle chitchat,” barked Gabil. “Put yourselves into this! Ah, you make life so</span> <em>difficult</em> <span class="merge__be">for me!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, we do not, General!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">A quick laugh.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Right! Forward!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">They were roused and ready to fight as they took flight from the cave, cutting through the clouds as they went southward and attacking in tandem with the others.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The Temple Knights protecting the south were thrown into chaos upon witnessing the surprise attack from the skies. The ever-changing breath attacks—fire, ice, air—took out nearly a third of them in short order.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Retain your positions!” a senior knight half ordered, half shouted as his men flew into a panic. “Go into our air-defense formation and prepare for magical impact!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But he was already too late to avoid Gabil’s second wave of offense.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Damn it! These aren’t lizardmen at all, are they? They don’t have anywhere near</span> <em>this</em> <span class="merge__be">level of force—much less wings to fly with!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Don’t panic! These are dragonewts! They’re not as common, but they’re nothing we can’t handle!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Dragonewts?! I can’t believe it! Such great numbers, and working as a team…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Their confusion subsided before the third attack arrived, as they finally began to grasp the situation. But half of them were already down, and none of the survivors was free of injury.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Curse them! Contact our headquarters and call for reinforcements!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">One of the knights prepared to follow his captain’s order. Then Gabil himself alighted next to him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hngh!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His spear plunged straight through the knight’s heart.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“May God damn you now!” the captain shouted as he engaged Gabil.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Gah-ha-ha-ha! You captain this force? My name is Gabil, but there is no need to remember it. Consider my telling you a final gift before your death!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What? A named monster?! Very well. You should prove a worthy opponent for me!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="y">Gabil was occupying the full attention of the company’s leader and commander, and it threw the rest of the knights into disarray. This was the moment the other dragonewt warriors were waiting for. They were an even match, pound for pound, but thanks to the gift of flight, Gabil’s fighters had the advantage. Even the injured among them had High Potions at the ready, rapidly returning them to the front line.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“God smite them all! We hit them and hit them, and the bastards keep coming back!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="x">“Stay strong! We have the protection of Luminus upon—</span> <em>Gehhh…</em><span class="x">”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Their numbers were few now, and the shock of these monsters working in precise tandem had hardly worn off. The medicine these foes used to heal their wounds struck fear in their hearts. Even the most devout of the knights began to tremble—and as they did, the captain they so heavily relied upon was slain by Gabil.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Gah-ha-ha-ha! Victory is mine!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Now the fate of this battle was sealed. Without a commander, the rest of the knights were helpless, quickly tasting defeat at the claws of Gabil’s men.</span></p>
<p class="space-break00"><span class="merge__be">Over to the north, Soei and his platoon were on the move, silently using Shadow Motion to sneak into the encampment.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Out of nowhere, there was a dull</span> <em>thud</em><span class="merge__be">—the sound of someone’s head hitting the ground. Soei had decapitated the garrison’s commander. It was a signal to all that the battle was on.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“N-no! Where did they…?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Grahhh!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Aaahhh!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The shapeless assassins had successfully thrown the northern encampment into fits of terror.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Sir Soei, these troops were weaker than I thought. I apologize,” Soka said as she took a knee before her leader.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Apologizing would be meaningless. I am the one who shall make the final judgment. Plus…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">Soei paused a moment to think. Soka was right. These were all weaklings. If this was what they were dealing with, Soei’s team could have easily destroyed the magical devices in all four directions. Killing all the men as well would pose a challenge, but completing the objectives and escaping alive would have been no sweat.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But the problem wasn’t here on the north side.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I was hoping</span> <em>they</em> <span class="merge__be">would be here…but I suppose it is the west, after all, just as Sir Rimuru surmised.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes, my lord! I believe you are right.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The otherworlders had to be in the west. By Soei’s estimation, if their team worked alone to strike all four bases at once, it might have failed entirely if Soka and the others ran into those guys. Soei had already reported back to Rimuru along those lines—and that was why Soka’s apology was pointless.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…But who can say,” he whispered as a smile crept onto his lips, “who the unlucky ones</span> <em>really</em> <span class="merge__be">are here?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Hakuro was on his mind—the Hakuro he saw just before they all moved out. The look on his face was nothing short of bloodcurdling. It made Soei happy he wasn’t the one facing him down. The otherworlders who struck in town conducted their killing like a pleasure hunt. Now things were quite different. They’d be taking on the Sword Ogre himself.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It appears to be over,” Soka coldly stated. There were no survivors left among the Temple Knights of the north. Soei and his team were unhurt. It was a victory as total and complete as he had predicted.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">The magic-producing device installed west of town had been placed atop a hill with a good view of the highway leading out. Unlike the other positions, the Temple Knights guarding it felt rather relaxed. Their encampment was the safest of all four, and it was loaded with forces—over two hundred troops in all.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">There was, of course, a reason for this.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hey. Hasn’t anyone fled yet?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, er, Shogo! No enemies sighted today, either, sir!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The soldier who answered Shogo Taguchi’s question seemed terribly ill at ease around him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Pfft. How many days are they gonna waste planning their escape? Or did the merchants and adventurer bodyguards decide to share their fates with the town?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ha-ha-ha! Oh, I wouldn’t be so impatient,” Kyoya said to soothe the clearly annoyed Shogo. “The other positions didn’t have any news, either. If they’re running, they’ll have to go down this road. It’s the only option.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">“Huh. Yeah, I hope,” Shogo resentfully replied. It had been three whole days, and nobody had fled town. It made him suspicious. He was here because of the merchants and adventurers who were supposed to be skipping town. Kyoya seemed content with just shutting down this highway, as ordered, but Shogo had other ideas. Razen, the head sorcerer of the Farmus court, had personally told him that he had free rein to massacre anyone on the highway.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Just as Rimuru thought, the Kingdom of Farmus had decided that anyone from Blumund trying to flee the region should be killed. Shogo was no homicidal maniac, but the order filled him with glee nonetheless. He had noticed something in this new world, and that was the way his skills could evolve.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Once, during training, he had failed to fine-tune his Berserker unique skill, and the results killed one of the knights. Somehow, it felt like he was just a bit more powerful after that event. Maybe killing more enemies with that skill would continue to boost the effect. He still couldn’t defy the locking curse Razen had put on him, but maybe, if he powered up enough, he could later.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">That was Shogo’s thought, but defeating monsters didn’t provide that concrete feeling of strength he craved. It was a disappointment, but now, with carte blanche to kill the Blumundians who would no doubt be flooding this road shortly, he was doing a little dance in his mind.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But the people he had wanted to see so badly showed no sign of appearing, even after three days. For someone as quick-tempered as Shogo, it was sorely trying the limits of his patience.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kyoya tried his best to keep him calm, even as he struggled to contain his own cravings for murder. The previous attack on the town opened his eyes to just how wonderful slashing up bodies could be. Especially that one elderly ogre. Those sword skills were the real thing; Kyoya could tell that much.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Ooh, I’ll never forget that surprised face! The way it was so confident in its own strength! It’s irresistible!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It made him lick his lips in anticipation. And even though his motivations were different from Shogo’s, he was just as ready for the fleeing crowds to appear.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Then they heard a messenger provide a report.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Enemies up ahead! They number…four?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Tension and nervousness found their way into the western encampment. The knights immediately cast magic to boost their physical strength, preparing to engage this threat and going into a formation that guaranteed at least three troops could tackle each one. They might have slept on the job a little, but these were Western Holy Church monster hunters, each one an expert in the field. There was no panic, no agitation. They simply did what needed to be done before a battle began.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Hakuro, Rigur, Gobta, and Geld were coming their way.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Let’s give ’em a show!” shouted Gobta as he drew his dagger and held its scabbard in his left hand. The starwolf he was on leaped forward, and then he jumped off his mount’s back, somersaulting once in the air. Steadying his aim with his scabbard, he launched a Case Cannon strike upon the head of the most important-looking knight in the crowd.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Easily surging past the speed of sound, the two-centimeter-wide iron balls landed a direct hit. There was a soft</span> <em>zwing!</em> <span class="merge__be">sound as the knights behind the targeted captain were bathed in blood…then a</span> <em>thud</em> <span class="merge__be">as he collapsed to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Nice! Direct hit!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The knights began to scream and shout as Gobta admired his efforts.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Enemy of God! What sorcery is this?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The company fanned out, which was exactly what Gobta and the others were anticipating.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well done, Gobta. Keep diverting their attention, but don’t let them capture you.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Roger that, sir!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You’re just as nimble as always,” observed Rigur. “You always</span> <em>were</em> <span class="merge__be">good at sniping like that.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Heh-heh! Yeah, wasn’t I?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Don’t let it get to your head, you fool.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was rare for Rigur to compliment Gobta. The subsequent warning quickly silenced him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Keep your guard up! We need to work together to shoulder some of Hakuro’s and Geld’s load!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Got it!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Rigur and Gobta climbed onto their starwolves, working to throw the knights’ teamwork out of whack. Geld was waiting for this. Even their breathing was fully aligned as he watched them send their wolves into the air—the signal for him to stomp his right foot against the ground. The impact shook the earth under the knights’ legs like an earth tremor. It was called Earthshatter Kick, one of the Arts Geld had learned, and it sent a shock wave of aura force below him to further extend its power and range.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Whoa?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ngh!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The quake lasted for just a moment, but that was enough. By the time Rigur and Gobta reached ground again, they were right in front of several unbalanced, teetering knights. They were left lethally wide open in the midst of battle, fated with nothing but broken windpipes at the fangs of the starwolves.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Boy, that sure was something…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I can hardly believe it. We didn’t even practice that in training, but your timing was perfect, Geld…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Rigur and Gobta looked at each other and grinned. Then the three of them sprang into action anew, maintaining their impeccable teamwork as they beat the knights at their own game. Before their overwhelming numbers, the trio couldn’t have looked less concerned.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But now there was a dark-haired young man standing before them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ha-ha-ha-ha! Nice! I like it! But now you gotta take</span> <em>me</em> <span class="merge__be">on!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, ahhh! Sir Shogo!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Please do something about these monsters!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The smell of death surrounding Shogo intoxicated him, making his face twist villainously. He could feel force flowing through him like never before.</span> <em>Yes! This is it! Just as I thought—my power grows as people die around me!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His spirits soared as he began running toward the trio.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, there he is,” Gobta noted, eyes showing an uncommon (for him) anger as he sized Shogo up. “But he ain’t fightin’ me!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was Shogo who had kicked Gobzo to death back in town as he tried to cover for Shuna. The memory of the moment he heard the news made Gobta boil with fury at the figure running for him. But he was fully aware of the difference in strength between them both. No, Shogo would have to fight Geld, just as they planned originally.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Do not worry, Sir Gobta,” the orc king declared. “It’s time to deliver the iron hammer of justice!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hee-hee! Just Gobta is fine, Geld!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Understood. Allow me to handle the rest, Gobta!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I hope you do, Sir Geld,” Rigur said as he nodded. “Gobzo had his faults, but he was a good man to all of us.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And in another moment, Geld and Shogo were locked in battle.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Amid this fury, there was another confrontation taking place—between Hakuro and Kyoya.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Wow, old man, you survived? If you were lucky enough to live, you should’ve tucked your tail and fled when you could. It woulda been easy for someone as strong as you to make it out.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ho-ho-ho! I may not look it, but I happen to be a very sore loser. Besides, something about some youngster getting a swollen head with me when I haven’t even revealed my</span> <em>full</em> <span class="merge__be">strength just doesn’t seem right.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh? You aren’t talking about me, are you?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Does it not seem that way to you? Well, my apologies. I suppose your brain’s just as empty as your morals.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ha-ha! So getting slashed once didn’t bring the message across, huh? Or are you growing feeble in the head?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bt">Just then, a sharp</span> <em>ting!</em> <span class="bt">echoed across the field. It was the sound of Hakuro’s hidden sword deflecting the blow Kyoya unleashed in the blink of an eye. The otherworlder had lunged upon Hakuro in the middle of their chat. Anticipating the strike, he drew his sword against it as if he had all the time in the world.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Impatient, I see. But I suppose we both are. I can hardly contain my anger any longer.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kyoya suddenly felt a chill down his spine. He took a step back. Hakuro’s ghastly visage mentally overwhelmed him, as much as he didn’t want to admit it.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Don’t make me laugh,” he spat back, eyes squinted and blurred with the desire to kill. “Quit acting like my boss, old man! You couldn’t do a damn thing against my sword!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Not your sword. Your power, yes. As Rimuru put it, your force is based on the spatial element. Not even I had an answer for it—but now that I know the trick, I can avoid it.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah? Well, great. So let’s have a sword fight, all right? Fair and square.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kyoya brought his sword before his eyes—those eyes blazing with a fearsomely evil light—as a distressing grin crossed his face.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Very well. Allow me to show you the true essence of swordplay.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Hakuro held his own blade down low. Kyoya’s grin widened.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You ready?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The otherworlder lifted his sword higher and then swung it down. He was far too out of range to hit Hakuro with it, but his aim was elsewhere. The blade itself launched out, away from the sword’s grip, transforming into millions of tiny shards, each one too small to see but packing lethal force as they hurtled toward Hakuro. Kyoya’s sword was a fake, a dummy created by his Severer unique skill. Switching between it and his actual sword allowed him to trick his enemy, stymieing them in battle.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ha-ha-ha! That fool got tricked again!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kyoya held his stomach as he laughed—but a cold, penetrating voice stopped him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hmm. So such tiresome little deceits are part of your arsenal, eh? It seems I overestimated you.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“No way?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kyoya looked around, searching for Hakuro’s frigid, lecturing voice. He found the ogre exactly where he had been standing, completely unhurt.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What… What did you just</span> <em>do</em><span class="merge__be">, old man?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hmm. Interesting. You weren’t able to see it? Then I suppose you’re just a second-rate fighter or worse.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…What?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“‘Second-rate or worse’ is what I said. I can fully keep up with your sword style, and frankly, I couldn’t find it more childish.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Don’t mess with me, you senile piece of shit!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kyoya lost his cool, eyes wide open. That was why he couldn’t notice. His Severer blade, capable of ripping through anything, had been fully deflected by Hakuro—and now, he had to accept that.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bt">He hadn’t even noticed that the</span> <em>third</em> <span class="bt">eye on Hakuro’s head was now</span> <span class="y">open. Aura, all-powerful and overwhelming, flowed from him. It was enough energy to easily propel him into the A ranks of monsterdom.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Right. I said I would show you the true essence of swordplay. Pay close attention to this!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Shut up! Shitty little monsters, acting all tough and crap…!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kyoya, still enraged, created a new blade and slashed at Hakuro. Hakuro paid it no mind. He just stood there, quietly transforming the intense rage inside him into power. Not even the sight of Kyoya bringing down his sword at point-blank range fazed him. He just kept his third eye open—the extra skill Heavengaze—and dodged his opponent’s unseeable blade by a hairbreadth.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You talk big,” Kyoya shouted as he laughed loudly, “but you can’t do a thing against me!</span> <em>Can</em> <span class="merge__be">you?! There’s nothing you can do! Just sit there and watch my invisible blade rip you apart!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“The time has come, I see. Perhaps your ‘eye’ is not so</span> <em>all-seeing</em> <span class="merge__be">after all…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Huh? What did you—?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kyoya didn’t understand. But he could tell it meant trouble. He took a step back, but it was already too late.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">—A flash.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The resulting sword move—Crestwater Slash—was clearly visible to Kyoya’s All-Seeing Eye…and then Kyoya realized something was wrong. He was frozen. Not “frozen,” exactly, but moving at an impossibly slow speed. The sword flowed its way toward him. His All-Seeing Eye picked up on that; it should have been evadable enough. But the sword kept coming. It touched against his neck. And then it went all the way down into his torso.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Uh?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bt">Then the sword came back out, gouging Kyoya’s heart along the way, as Hakuro just barely grabbed his head before his body hit the ground. In less than a second, it was all over.</span></p>
