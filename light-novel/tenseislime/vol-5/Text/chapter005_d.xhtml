<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…And there we go. I hope you will use the remaining time you’ve extended a thousandfold for yourself to figure out where you went wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Those words, via Thought Communication, were the last thing Kyoya ever heard.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Hakuro could have killed Kyoya at any time. Even in town, he wouldn’t have fallen behind if he had any intention of killing him then. It was a loss with its cause squarely upon Rimuru and his order to drive away their foes alive.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Now, though, his good name was restored. He had waited for the moment when Kyoya’s All-Seeing Eye was at its maximum level of activation. Then he showed his own skills—and the sheer difference in talent between them.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">It would be just a few seconds before Kyoya’s oxygen-starved brain would expire, and even less than that before his consciousness grew cloudy. But thanks to Mind Accelerate, he had extended his perception speed to a thousand times normal. Hakuro’s taunting goaded him into it, although Kyoya had no idea.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Now, all he could do was taste the pain, the bitterness, for a small eternity until the moment he finally, mercifully passed. Such was the end of Kyoya Tachibana, the otherworlder who attempted to con his way through life and met his doom over it.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Shogo was intensely irritated. Geld, the warrior looming in front of him, seemed invincible to his powers. Nothing of the sort had ever happened to him in this world. Everyone always groveled before him, begging for mercy. And</span> <em>now</em> <span class="merge__be">look.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Goddammit…!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He poured every ounce of strength he had into Berserker and launched a kick at Geld’s frame. It helplessly clanged against the orc’s Scale Shield, the unique piece of equipment Garm forged out of Charybdis scales for him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“That’s cheating! If you’re a man, fight me with your bare hands!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Geld raised a quizzical eyebrow at Shogo’s absurd command.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I don’t know what you mean. This is war. Cheating or not, it is only polite to bring out everything you have against your foe.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Don’t give me that shit! I don’t have any weapons, and you’re fully outfitted! You should be ashamed of yourself!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This bewildered Geld. His opponent was making less and less sense. The word</span> <em>patience</em> <span class="merge__be">wasn’t in Shogo’s dictionary; it seemed like he expected his selfish, childlike whining to work against grown men. That was why failing to even put a dent in Geld was filling him with a passionate rage. But that wasn’t Geld’s problem. All he could do with Shogo’s nonsensical ramblings was ignore them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“All right. I’m sorry; I’m sorry,” Shogo backpedaled. “I thought I’d just ask, y’know, if you could put down that annoying shield for me. I’m all warmed up now, so I guess it’s about time I put everything I got into this.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">To Geld, someone whose mind was configured to follow his warrior code, it was impossible for him to follow the thoughts of the oblivious Shogo. But this was a battlefield. Just because his foe threw him for a loop didn’t mean he’d abandon the fight.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Everything you’ve got? Very well. I will do the same as—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Haaah!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">Not listening to Geld’s words, Shogo focused his spirit just below his navel and shouted out loud. Then, like a tiger, he planted a foot on the ground and sped off, unleashing a flying kick in Geld’s direction.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Eeeeee</span><em>yaaah</em><span class="merge__be">!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With a scream, the kick unleashed itself. It put a crack in Geld’s shield.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“One more! Hraaah!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He landed on the ground, away from the shield, and used his momentum to launch another back kick. That was enough to shatter Geld’s shield for good.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His Berserker unique skill had the special effect of breaking the weapons of his opponents. Of course, a unique piece of equipment was hard to break with one or two strikes—that was why Shogo was acting like he had no strategy but was actually attacking the same spot over and over again. He might have looked like a simpleton, but Shogo had a uniquely honed talent for battle—and that skill was perfectly suited for his martial-arts approach.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ha-ha! Lookit that! You ain’t gonna block the next one without that shield!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shogo was proud of his victory. But it didn’t move Geld at all.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I see… So you acted short-tempered and mindless for that reason?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He was impressed. But ever so casually, he took out a brand-new shield from his Stomach.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Huh? What the…?! That’s</span> <em>dirty</em><span class="merge__be">!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What is dirty about this? I told you—this is war. It is only common courtesy to use every weapon at my disposal. No matter what kind of cowardly move you may attempt, I am willing to forgive it.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Right from the start, Geld had been consistently and doggedly sticking to his own principles as he tackled Shogo. He had only one motivation. Shogo was the man behind Gobzo’s death, and the iron hammer had to fall upon him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Cowardly? You callin’</span> <em>me</em> <span class="merge__be">cowardly? Don’t give me that shit, you pig!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I am not a pig…but fine.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Shut up!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shogo let out a deep breath as Geld readied his shield. Composing himself, he observed his enemy, finally recognizing him as a worthy challenger. With that shield, Geld had no opening to exploit—but Shogo decided to force him to the ground anyway. Taking the</span> <em>sanchin</em> <span class="merge__be">stance (a standard position unique to karate), he breathed in and let out all his tension with a “Kaaahhh!!” Muscles tightened up and down his body, boosting his focus.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">It was a basic breathing move, but it was also a harrowing finisher—and, repeating it three times as he took in the air and its magicules, it transformed his flesh and blood, adding the Adamantine Body effect of Berserker to his already well-built frame to make it hard as rock. His body was remade into a living weapon of battle.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Now I’m ready. This is how I</span> <em>really</em> <span class="merge__be">fight, and I’m ready for you. Try to make this fun for me, all right?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“That goes without saying. Come at me!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With a light exhale, Shogo lunged at Geld. With his bodily strength much enhanced, all limiters restricting his powers were gone. The difference was like night and day, and he even moved faster than before.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Shyahhh!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Quickly closing the distance, Shogo launched a frontal punch. The power from his toes upward ran through his navel and focused itself upon a single point in his fist. He called it the Tornado Punch, and it mixed Berserker’s weapon-breaking and Adamantine Body properties to unleash a torrent of force—and as it smashed through Geld’s shield, Shogo felt assured of victory.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Heh! The moment I get serious, this— Wait, what?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The next moment, he realized something felt off. Pain erupted from his limbs, forming together in intense agony in an instant.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Whoa—what’s…?! Goddammit!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was Chaos Eater, a yellow aura that snaked its way around him. Now Geld was on the attack.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Your physical strength is commendable. I can certainly tell that much from what I have seen in this short battle. But it seems rather weak against</span> <em>rot</em><span class="merge__be">.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“R-rot? Shit! Get—get this off me!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The intense pain made Shogo writhe on the ground. Looking on from above, pity in his eyes, Geld prepared his Meat Cleaver blade.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Let me end the pain.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ahhh! W-wait! Wait a second!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bt">Geld’s slow approach made the orc look like a man-eating demon in Shogo’s eyes. He was strong of will when attacking, but now that it was his turn to take a shot, he was defenseless. It was always a sad sight to see, someone experiencing this helplessness for the first time, but that was Shogo now, edging away as best as he could. But that only added to the pain. Shogo had nothing to undo the Chaos Eater around him. The yellow aura drilled further into his body, making the flesh on his hands and legs rot into nothing—but still he tried to get away from his foe.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Geld didn’t care. He had other things on his mind—such as Hakuro, whom he could see casually walking up to him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You still aren’t done, Geld?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, Sir Hakuro. You are finished? I was just about to strike the final blow.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Now, even Shogo could see that the knights around them were strewn across the battlefield.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You—you assholes! What the hell did you do to Kyoya?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Him? He’s dead,” came the matter-of-fact reply as Hakuro tossed something at him. It was Kyoya’s head, rolling along the ground there, and it provided all the evidence necessary.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah,</span> <em>aaahhhhhhhhhh</em><span class="merge__be">!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shogo attempted to flee at full speed, no longer caring about the pain in his limbs. Deep down, he knew he’d be meeting the same fate, and it terrorized him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Goddamn it! God… Why did this happen to me?!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The pain was as intense as the terror and confusion.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Shit… If this keeps up, I’m dead…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His mind raced, trying to figure out a way to survive this. Then, out of nowhere, he had a brilliant idea. He recalled that there, in the tent in front of him, was another otherworlder. So he ran, placing all hopes upon this new plan.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Raising the tent flap, he found Kirara relaxing inside.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hey, you done? ’Cause you sure took your sweet time with—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Shut up! Kirara,” Shogo said as he ran up to her, “I’m sorry, but you’re gonna have to die for me!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Huhhh? What’re you talking about, you dumbass? Why’re you picking a fight with me—?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kirara took it as a joke. It had the effect of greatly shortening her life span.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Clench—</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Nh… Wha…? You’re choking me…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She had left herself wide open, and now Shogo’s hands were fully engaged with her. She struggled mightily, even as Shogo’s tremendous power shattered her neck—but in another moment, her resistance grew weaker.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Memories of her life in Japan flashed before her eyes. The boyfriend she liked. The friends she got along with. The parents who put up with her selfishness. All Kirara wanted to do was go home. Razen had told her himself:</span> <em>“Do what I say, and I’ll develop a spell to whisk you back someday.”</em> <span class="merge__be">To her, this world wasn’t reality, and that meant she could do whatever she wanted—otherwise, she’d have to seriously contemplate all the crimes she’d committed. All the murders. She just wasn’t mentally mature enough to deal with that. She had run from her crimes, from the killings she did after a moment of emotion—and now time was running out for her.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The world went white. The pain was already gone as a cavalcade of familiar faces greeted her…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Mom…!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And this was the end of Kirara Mizutani, the otherworlder who turned her back on her weaknesses and blamed everyone else for them but herself.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Hakuro and Geld had given chase, only to find Shogo in the midst of killing his ally Kirara.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…An abominable deed. You have fallen that far?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“No need for pity now. You are no warrior.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And then a transformation occurred.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Confirmed. Unique skill Survivor</span><span class="cw">…</span><span class="cw">successfully obtained.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Shogo’s desire to live was the trigger for a new power within him, snagged at the expense of Kirara’s soul. The yellow aura eating into Shogo’s body dissipated as he rapidly healed himself. This was Ultraspeed Regeneration in action, one of Survivor’s subskills.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“The World Language… So</span> <em>that’s</em> <span class="merge__be">what he was after?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sir Rimuru described killing your allies as the greatest crime there is. Your deeds are the work of a soulless minion, lower than a monster himself.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Shut up, you worthless maggots! Winning’s what matters, isn’t it? It’s easy! I got the power for it!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="x">Shogo screamed as he unleashed both his unique skills—Berserker</span> <span class="merge__be">for the attack and Survivor for the defense. It fooled him into believing he was invincible. The sheer force—and the Ultraspeed Regeneration and the resistance to all types of elements. As long as a blow didn’t kill him instantly, he had invincible force and the ability to regenerate himself at any time.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="x">Yes. Even if Hakuro used one of his sword strikes to lop</span> <em>his</em> <span class="merge__be">head off, he’d be right back to normal in an instant. Even if Geld used his superhuman strength to smash both his arms, they’d grow right back and be even stronger.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“How d’you like that, you piece-of-shit monsters?! This is it!</span> <em>This</em> <span class="merge__be">is my full power!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And he couldn’t be blamed for bragging to the skies about it. As a combination, his powers were like none seen before.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">But there was one thing Shogo didn’t realize: No matter how lofty the heights you achieved in the world, there was always someone above you.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Shall I lend a hand?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“No need, Sir Hakuro. Please go and support Sir Rigur and the others.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Assuming such support is necessary,” Hakuro said as he stepped back and gave Geld the right of way. The orc strode forward and prepared to strike.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Huhhh? You’re gonna take me on by yourself? ’Cause right now, I’d be more than happy to whip both your asses at once!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You seem to have confidence in your martial arts. So be it. I will fight you with</span> <em>my</em> <span class="merge__be">bare hands as well.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, quit acting like you’re so much better than me. You’re just lookin’ for an excuse for when you lose!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Such was the way Shogo’s mind worked. It made him go immediately on the offensive. His face was brimming with confidence, testing out his new powers—but that ease of mind didn’t last long. It was a bit harder for him to die now, and he was ever so slightly powered up, but that still didn’t make him a foe for Geld to concern himself with.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Orgggh!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Geld had more than ample strength to tear off one of Shogo’s arms and use his free hand to drive a fist into his stomach.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah. Yes, you can heal yourself faster than I can. Now let’s see how much you can stand at once.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">As he said it, he wrapped twin curls of Chaos Eater around his fists and beat them into Shogo. Over and over again, before he could recover, Geld pummeled him into oblivion. Thanks to the Survivor skill, Shogo was enjoying Cancel Pain privileges, preventing him from feeling any of the anguish these injuries provided him. But Geld just kept on punching, doing away with all weapons.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">By its very nature, Chaos Eater bit its way through everything—damaging not only Shogo’s material body but his spiritual one as well. The unique skill Survivor was capable of regenerating all bodily systems, but a life-form’s</span> <em>spiritual</em> <span class="merge__be">needs were beyond its feature set. Indeed, before Geld’s unrelenting attack, it was only a matter of time before Shogo’s frail spirit was against the ropes.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“S-stop, stop! Pleathe, thtop!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It hadn’t even been ten minutes, but to Shogo, it felt like an hours-long torture session. Selfish words fell out of his mouth, seeking salvation for him and him alone. Geld and Hakuro were almost too disgusted to watch.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And that was the exact moment Shogo’s heart and soul broke.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">“I suppose it is over.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It is. Now to finally ease his pain for—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“N-no! Wait a thecond! I—I was jutht kidding! I didn’t really want to; I—I—I jutht got carried away… Help me…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shogo, faced with this cruel reality, fell into confused terror. In this world, simply being an otherworlder gave you overwhelmingly preferential treatment. That only fed his arrogance, twisting his personality beyond repair. And even more importantly, he and the others summoned into the Kingdom of Farmus all suffered from the same affliction: a terminal case of egotism.</span></p>
