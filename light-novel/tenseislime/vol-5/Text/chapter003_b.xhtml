<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He couldn’t discuss this much with the other two. There was too much of a chance they were being magically eavesdropped on. Which wasn’t a bad thing exactly. But there Kyoya was—seeing this as a chance, waiting patiently for the exact moment he could strike and reclaim his freedom.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Soon, the wagon carrying all three of them—each with their own thoughts in mind—set off for Tempest.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran had received an emergency contact from Clayman. He ordered her to deploy a special sort of high magic.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This magic involved taking the entire area within a three-mile radius and converting it into an anti-magic zone. Spells like these took time, so he ordered her to begin working on it at once. The purpose was to shut off communication with the outside world—there was more to it than that, no doubt, but the demon lord offered no further guidance.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was clear Clayman planned something big—something that he didn’t want the people of Tempest to know about. It deeply concerned Mjurran, but she would never be allowed to ask questions. Orders were orders.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">What’s more, this magic was meant as a defensive spell against other magic. It was being specially customized to fulfill Clayman’s request, and as a result, it would have to be launched around a circle with her at the center. There was the rub. To keep high magic going, Mjurran would have to reveal the identity of the high-level magic-born who drove it: herself. There was no way doing so wouldn’t draw the attention of the locals.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">In effect, Mjurran, a magic-user, was being faced with a potential angry mob of Tempestians in a zone that she herself had blocked all the magic from. It was essentially being ordered to die. The magic Clayman stipulated was positionally based, so once it was launched, it’d last for several days whether Mjurran was around for it or not. She was, in effect, a throwaway piece of the puzzle.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Receiving this order crushed her. But there, yet again, the figure of a single man in her life crossed her mind. If she refused this order, it would bring that man an all-too-tragic fate. Mjurran knew this better than anyone else, and that was exactly why the only choice available to her was to accept it.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>I knew this would happen. A suitable end for me, I suppose, but I wish at least</em> <span class="merge__be">he</span> <em>could be spared—</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She recalled the face of Yohm, the man who claimed to love a woman like her, and smiled. For someone who had lived with the coldest of frozen hearts for the past several centuries, those words were as gentle as a spring breeze.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Those words are all I need…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Steeling her resolve, she began to walk off by herself.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Where’re you going, Mjurran?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, Gruecith. Did you need something?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Heh! Not exactly, no.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But he was clearly trying to follow her.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She tried to get away, recalling how Clayman had acted around her just a moment ago. He was always so calm and collected, but his orders just now hid a twinge of panic behind them. “You will trigger the magic as soon as possible,” he had said before shutting off their link. Something unexpected must have happened.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hey, speaking of which, did you see the new dessert they’re offering at the dining hall? It’s called a ‘cream puff’ or something, and Yohm said it was the best thing he ever had. Wanna try it out with me?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gruecith couldn’t have acted more carefree. It annoyed Mjurran a bit. His smile was already starting to corrode her steely resolve.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I appreciate the invite, but sorry. Yohm brought one for me last night. He said it was a present.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Pfft. That bastard… Trying to get a leg up on me again.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“A leg up? What’re you talking about? I have a bit of an errand to do, so if we could talk later—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“An errand? I’ll really get to see you later?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Er, of course. Why wouldn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She did her best to brush him off, leaving Gruecith behind on the path.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well, I got the weirdest news just now, y’know?” He pointed his eyes at Mjurran. “Something about the demon lord Milim declaring war on my leader. It sounded insane to me, but</span> <em>you’re</em> <span class="merge__be">acting pretty weird, too, so I was just wondering.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Ah. There we go.</em> <span class="merge__be">Now Mjurran understood. She had no idea why the demon lords Milim and Carillon were at odds with each other, but she was sure Clayman was pulling the strings yet again. He was pulling them—and then something happened that he hadn’t expected. Maybe Milim’s declaration of war was outside his prediction? Maybe</span> <em>his</em> <span class="merge__be">plan was to have Milim launch a surprise attack on the Beast Kingdom, with Mjurran launching a spell to coincide with that. But now that Milim was going off script, she imagined, the whole thing was falling apart.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>But why does he want to cut off all communication from this country?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Englesia and Tempest had an agreement with each other, but against an angered Milim, they simply didn’t have enough war power. What would be the point of cutting their—?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then it struck her like a bolt of lightning.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>…Oh. He’s afraid of that slime Rimuru. That slime might just have the power to change Milim’s mind, after all.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The demon lord Clayman feared Rimuru, a presence increasingly becoming an X factor in his life, joining the fray. So he ordered Mjurran to prevent Carillon from contacting Tempest’s leaders, who’d then surely relay his SOS to Rimuru. The longer she dallied, the angrier Clayman would be with her. She needed to launch it at once.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Plus,” Gruecith continued, “knowing you, I’m sure you’re already aware, but the top leaders in this nation are pretty damn busy right now. Do anything funny at a time like this, and it’ll be your life, y’know?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He was right. The top staff in Tempest were, to say the least, flustered. Some mysterious armed group had been approaching their territory for the past few days, requiring the full attention of Soei and his agents. There were storm clouds ahead, it seemed, and everyone could practically feel the tension among the leaders.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh? I didn’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Something was happening. Something beyond Clayman’s expectations. It unnerved her. There was no telling what it could be. She had to launch that magic at once, or else Clayman, crazed with fury, might just kill her and everybody else in this town. And Gruecith just</span> <em>refused</em> <span class="merge__be">to let her go.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“‘I didn’t know’ ain’t gonna cut it, lady. I can’t let you do anything weird right now—you got that?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What kind of nonsense is that…? If you’re fighting against Milim, aren’t</span> <em>you</em> <span class="merge__be">in much more danger than any of us?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh? You talk like you know her. Don’t worry about me. Lord Carillon is invincible. I don’t care how strong Milim is; I couldn’t even</span> <em>think</em> <span class="merge__be">of my lord tasting defeat. What I care about more right now is</span> <em>you</em><span class="merge__be">, Mjurran!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Look, really, what are you—?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Let’s stop playing games here. You’re magic-born, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Maybe she’d be able to talk her way out of this. But right up to the end, Mjurran never considered the option of deceiving Gruecith.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Huh. Your mind’s always the sharpest when it comes to things like</span> <em>that</em><span class="merge__be">, isn’t it? Well, no point hiding it. I think the ogre mages spotted it, too.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“So why?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Because I have to. Listen, Gruecith, I like you a lot, too—as a friend. But if you’re going to get in my way right now…I’m ready to kill you.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With that, Mjurran did away with her magic-driven human disguise, revealing her original magic-born form.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah…?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gruecith quivered under the pair of large eyeballs boring down into him, virtually roaring with flame.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Why are you so ready to…? Are you preparing to die? What for? What…? You’ve got a master giving you orders, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I don’t see any need to answer that.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">For Gruecith, that was as good as a yes.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Y’know, they said Lord Clayman’s notorious for using his minions like throwaway cannon fodder. You aren’t—?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Enough from you! Say one more word, and I</span> <em>will</em> <span class="merge__be">kill you, Gruecith!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Seeing the normally immovable Mjurran descend into such a panic told him everything else he needed to know.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh. I get it. If you’re willing to follow him straight to your own death—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He was interrupted before he could finish.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“—Let me hear more about that.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was Yohm, using all-but-perfect camouflage skills to trick them as he strolled out from underneath the trees. He usually took great pains to look out for Mjurran. There was no way he wouldn’t notice her bizarre behavior.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yohm…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She had revealed her secret to the one person she least wanted to—but, oddly, it filled her with a sense of relief. A relief that turned into surprise at what he had to say next.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Mjurran, you have to believe in me. I swear I’ll protect you.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What are you, crazy? You can see perfectly well by now—I’m a high-level magic-born! How is a human weaker than me supposed to keep me safe?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Yohm ignored the frantic plea, growing unusually passionate.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Human? Magic-born? None of that stuff matters, man! I fell in love with you. I love your face, I love your scent, I love your warmth. The way you live, the way you hold yourself all proud like that. I love all of it. And that means</span> <em>everything</em> <span class="merge__be">to me!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…What are you saying? All that was just a fantasy created to trick you.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Don’t worry, Mjurran. I’m prepared to let you keep on trickin’ me…right up to the day I die!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Nh…!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>What an idiot</em><span class="merge__be">, she thought from the bottom of her heart. But it was such a bold, pleading declaration that it struck her completely dumb.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Heh. I won, didn’t I? You’ve fallen for me?” He flashed her the biggest smile she had ever seen. “I swear I’ll believe in you until I die. If I do, then how’s that any different from it being the truth, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran still lacked the words.</span> <em>You’re so stupid. So, so stupid. But if that’s how you are, then I…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Heh-heh-heh. What a pitiful man you are. I approached you because I wanted to take advantage of you. You’re so pathetic; it makes me laugh. This is ridiculous. Enough of this charade!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And with that cold rejoinder, Mjurran began to cast. There was no more time left to waver. The tears she felt on her cheeks surely must have been her imagination.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“No! Stop, you fool! You’re really…?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What’s going on, Gruecith?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With a beautiful, lilting voice, the spell unfurled itself—and the laws of the world began to be rewritten. Yohm and Gruecith were already powerless to stop it. If they could, the only real way would be to kill her. And if that happened, she was okay with it. But she simply</span> <em>had</em> <span class="merge__be">to complete this spell.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She continued to chant, as if in prayer—with her heart and soul, aching to protect the man she loved.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">The scene in Tempest was even more chaotic than Gruecith thought—even before everything went to pieces, just as Mjurran neared the end of her work.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Benimaru, drowning under a deluge of hurried reports, already looked sick of it all. The most worrying one had come from a sentry posted at a substation a few days ago, by way of Gobta. “Uh, Benimaru,” he’d said, “I guess there’s this bunch of humans in full armor, and they’re headed right this way. The sentry asked what they wanted, and they just said, ‘We have no need to speak with underlings!’ and marched on.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Soei had quickly been dispatched to investigate. It was a group of knights, over a hundred in number, and Benimaru decided they could no longer be ignored. Soei kept gathering intel, along with Soka and his other men. Soon, they’d pinpointed the group’s origin: the Kingdom of Farmus.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">As long as the Farmus platoon’s goals were unclear, working with them had been difficult. Thus, Benimaru had Soei’s team keep a close eye on them as he’d discussed the increasingly worrisome issue with Rigurd.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Perhaps we should inform Sir Rimuru?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah,” Rigurd had replied, “after he left us to watch this town, is it really good to keep pestering him?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Perhaps. He makes frequent return trips at night, so we could inform him then.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">That brought them to now. Rimuru, after all, could use his Warp Portal to come back here any time he wanted. So Benimaru left his briefing for later and worked on the medley of other issues awaiting his attention. It was all very unfamiliar work, and being chased constantly by it made the days pass like lightning.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">In the midst of all this, Soei’s team sent a report from Farmus itself. The kingdom was apparently engaging in rapid preparations for war. It made Benimaru wrinkle his eyebrows.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“This might be bad news for us, Rigurd.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I’m afraid so. Not something we can afford to take so casually. I think we had best have Sir Rimuru back here at once.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The two looked at each other. They both concluded that handling this brigade of knights the wrong way could very well lead to war. So Benimaru tried contacting Rimuru—but before he could, he received an emergency magical communication from Alvis, the Golden Snakehorn and one of Eurazania’s Three Lycanthropeers.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">“The Beast Kingdom will enter hostilities with the demon lord Milim in one week’s time. As a result, I want you to accept the citizens we are evacuating.”</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The delays Mjurran experienced in deploying her anti-magic zone allowed this message to squeak its way through. Although Clayman himself should take some of the blame—Milim’s flight speed was so fast that she reached Eurazania far ahead of his planned schedule. Not that it mattered to Benimaru. No, the portent of this news was so vital that it seemed to change the very air around them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You must be joking!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">At once, the top leaders of Tempest were gathered—Rigurd and Rigur, Lilina and the other chief hobgoblins, Kaijin as a special adviser, Shuna as secretary, Shion as Rimuru’s representative, plus Hakuro and Geld. Nearly a dozen people crammed into the meeting hall. Gabil was not in attendance, not having been appointed to this level of leadership yet. Instead, he was simply advised that an emergency was underway and to stand by until further orders. Kaijin also informed Vester of the news, telling him to maintain regular contact with King Gazel of Dwargon as needed.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">And in the midst of all this, the very party of humans who had vexed Benimaru earlier arrived, disguised as merchants.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><em>Dude! This town’s more advanced than the capital of Farmus!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shogo couldn’t hide his surprise.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">He and his otherworlder friends were trundling into town, a single knight serving as their coachman while the rest of the hundred-strong team kept their distance. The unexpected sight of the town rendered him speechless. It was amazing. Nothing about the term</span> <em>monster town</em> <span class="t">had prepared him for this. The sewer system kept all foul-smelling odors at bay—and, really, the monsters walking around seemed more identifiably human than any other species. They were clean, bathed, and wearing more proper clothing than many of the merchants and townspeople around Farmus.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">One look was all it took to confirm that life here was far more bountiful than life over there. It was packed with adventurers, merchants briskly running to and fro as they carried out their business.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Goddamn! I’ve been ripped off this whole time! Why the hell’re the monsters livin’ better than we are?!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The initial waves of shock were wearing off. Now, within Shogo, a darker well of anger was beginning to rise. The same was true with Kirara.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Um, what’s the deal with this? Like, why’re these guys living way swankier than we are? Something’s</span> <em>got</em> <span class="merge__be">to be wrong here.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ahh, don’t get too angry,” Kyoya said—but even he couldn’t help but feel it was unfair. His eyes were squinted, brooding with resentment.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“And this whole place is run by a slime, yeah? If we kick its ass, we can take over this joint, can’t we?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“That’s, like, the best damn idea I ever heard, Shogo! Let’s do it!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I’m fine with that, too, but we can’t stray from our orders too much.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, it’ll be fine! I’m just sayin’—they told us to kick up a ruckus before the rest of the knights showed up, right? Everything’ll work out great!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Totally. Like, they wanna stage it like we’re a bunch of lawful citizens and the monsters attacked us out of nowhere, yeah? I can just use Bewilder to set up some kinda pretext, and all the non-monster adventurers will do whatever I want.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kirara liked her chances, and she had reason to. It was the main reason why the three of them were here. And neither of her friends saw much to worry about, either.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah,” Kyoya agreed, “that’s pretty much what Sir Razen told us to do.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Pfft. Quit callin’ that asshole ‘sir’ around me!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Totally. I hope that dude gets a heart attack or something. Then we’d be, like, free and stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ha-ha-ha! Sorry, just a habit,” Kyoya said. “We can’t really dis him to his face, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His lighter approach had a distinct motivation behind it. Kyoya, unlike the others, was still hiding his true character in this world to some extent. For now, he felt, it was best to play the loyal student around Farmus circles.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">As they spoke, Shogo mentally went over his orders one more time, growing increasingly impatient to kick some ass. “I don’t care what kind of excuse you have to make,” Razen had told them. “Just start some kind of trouble—then</span> <em>you</em><span class="merge__be">, Kirara, use your power to get the adventurers on your side! We’ll begin taking action once you do.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Farmus was currently engaged with a total of three otherworlders. That alone was enough war power to decimate a smaller country. It was rare to deploy three at once, but the government wanted to cover for the possibility that another otherworlder was aiding the monsters.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Once Shogo and his friends began their business, the coachman driving their wagon would send off a signal to begin the rest of the operation. The otherworlders weren’t informed of the exact details, but nothing they’d do would be any hindrance to them, and presumably it’d make things even more favorable for victory. Shogo despised Razen, but even he had to praise his talents. If he</span> <em>weren’t</em> <span class="merge__be">a gifted magic-user, all three of them would’ve been free long ago.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Now he ran a hand through his well-oiled hair, lifting it up like the comb of a chicken.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“All right. How ’bout we get things moving?”</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Kirara was the first to take action.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Aaahhhhh!! You—you touched my butt just now, didn’t you? You tryin’ to do somethin’ to me?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She had deliberately bumped herself against what seemed to be the perfect target—a kind of dopey-looking sentry who was staring into space. This was Gobzo, a guard under Gobta’s command and a hobgoblin known even among his own species for being a bit special.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Unhhh? I—I didn’t do anything!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He lifted up his arms, head swiveling around in search of some kind of support.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hey! Don’t, like, play dumb with me! Just tell me what you slapped me there for. All right?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kirara drew closer to him as she spoke—then, suddenly, she jerked her body backward and tumbled to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Owww!! Help! Somebody call the guards!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Wh-wha—? No! I didn’t even do nothin’! I, uh…I</span> <em>am</em> <span class="merge__be">a guard…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gobzo was already starting to tear up a bit. He was the victim here, but frankly, he didn’t have a lot of allies nearby. The sheer dopiness of his act did little to turn the suspicion away from him—and Kirara was already deploying Bewilder, letting it sink in to the minds of human passersby.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Whoa, the hobgoblin attacked that girl?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“That’s a town sentry, isn’t it? What kind of sentry would pull that crap? I can’t believe it.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“But he just knocked her to the ground, man.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Really? I thought the monsters here were supposed to be nice.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“They</span> <em>are</em><span class="merge__be">. Usually. So what’s the deal with this guy?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The locals were still a bit incredulous, but few to none of the adventurers and merchant types nearby were willing to stick up for Gobzo. Nobody had a full grasp of the events, and it wouldn’t be long before Kirara’s skill had their minds completely under her control.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shogo and Kyoya grinned at each other, then took a step forward to drive the dagger down.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Whoa, dude, so this town just attacks its visitors without warning?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“That’s their plan, huh? Invite merchants and people over and then strike when they least expect it?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">They shouted as loudly as they could as they walked over to protect the frightened-looking Kirara. Their trumped-up charges were lodged. The</span> <em>real</em> <span class="merge__be">show would begin only when this sentry’s supervisor showed up. If he was apologetic, they could just ratchet their beef up the ranks, with the crowd on their side. If he got angry and started throwing his weight around, that’d be a godsend. Even if he didn’t, it’d grow into a huge hullabaloo, the rest of the knights would storm in, and then</span> <em>they’d</em> <span class="merge__be">serve as judge and jury.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shogo was therefore hoping whoever showed up next was just as stupid as their first target. He was disappointed.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“So what’s up?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gobta, apparent captain of the sentries, cheerfully strolled onto the scene—then did something Shogo wasn’t expecting at all.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh man, Gobzo, not you again! I swear, every single time something happens,</span> <em>you’re</em> <span class="merge__be">in the middle of it!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He gave him a bop on the forehead before turning back toward the otherworlders. “Hey, sorry about that, guys,” he said with a friendly nod. “I’ll try to educate ’im better.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“G-Gobta, I, but, I…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You didn’t do it? Doesn’t matter. If you’re under suspicion, you’ve already lost.” He ominously raised an eyebrow. “Remember what Sir Rimuru said about the horrors of being falsely accused of assault on the street?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This raised some eyebrows among the onlookers as well.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“S-so you believe me, Gobta?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The sentry’s boss sighed. “Why d’you have to ask me that? You wouldn’t have the guts to do anything anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gobzo rewarded him with a hug and a hearty “I’ll follow you wherever you go, sir!!” as tears streamed down his cheeks. This didn’t particularly delight Gobta, judging by the look on his face, but he still patted his sentry’s shoulders to calm him down.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It wasn’t a sight that pleased Kirara much.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Whoa, what the hell? Are you saying that I’m, like, lying or something?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, it didn’t sound that way?” a surprised Gobta asked. It was more than enough to set the girl off.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Don’t give me that, you piece of shit! You got a lot of balls, tryin’ to pick a fight with me! Why do you trust this guy right off? You weren’t even here to see it!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The shouting did little to affect the unbothered Gobta. “It’s simple,” he said. “It’s natural for us to trust our friends.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What?! You want me to accept</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">lame excuse?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well,” he calmly explained, “if you want me to explain further, the only girl Gobzo’s got a thing for is Shion, y’see. Everybody in Tempest knows this, so there’s no way he’d try puttin’ his hands on a young girl like you, no.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">There was a moment of silence as everyone digested this.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, that’s just</span> <em>mean</em><span class="merge__be">, Gobta!” Gobzo’s face turned bright red.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah, yeah. Everyone already knows, remember?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>“Everyone…?”</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gobta shrugged. “Yeah, everyone. Deal with it, Gobzo.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I—I think I</span> <em>won’t</em> <span class="merge__be">follow you wherever you go anymore, Gobta!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Now Gobzo was almost as angry as Kirara. Almost.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Will you</span> <em>stop</em> <span class="merge__be">with this stupid crap?! I’m still</span> <em>here</em><span class="merge__be">, you bastards! All of you should just</span> <em>die</em><span class="merge__be">!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">There was no longer any plan of action. All Kirara wanted to do was take everyone making her into a laughingstock and kill them. Shogo and Kyoya would be the only ones left standing in this street intersection, probably, but Kirara was too furious to care. It wasn’t like</span> <em>those</em> <span class="merge__be">guys cared about Razen’s orders that much. So she screamed it out without reserve, half smiling as she did. Thanks to living fairly restricted lives in Farmus, the three otherworlders were near the ends of their ropes mentally—and now the rebound was happening.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Already, Kirara could picture the stabbed, mangled bodies that would litter the street shortly.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But nothing happened.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Wha…? Huh…?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">““—?!””</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The adventurers and merchants looking on were too busy laughing at Gobzo to die for her. It visibly unnerved Kirara, as it did Shogo and Kyoya.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I see,” a gentle but firm voice said to them. “Your skill converts your voice into streams of force that interfere with your targets’ brain waves. That’s quite a powerful one, so I’ll have to prohibit you from using it in our territory.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was Shuna. A pair of hobgoblins had reached her to relay the events just before the conference began. It had sounded like bad news to her, so she’d run over with Shion as her bodyguard.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Shuna revealed a breezy smile as her eyes focused upon Kirara. Her unique Parser skill provided a complete analysis of the girl’s ability, letting her unleash an aura that matched and neutralized the waves of force. One look from her discerning, fearsome eyes was all it took.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You do not appear to be suitable for this nation. Please take your leave at once.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She smiled again—but her eyes were frigid. She could tell Kirara had meant to kill with that attack, and she wasn’t about to take that lightly.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Like…no way…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kirara sat weakly upon the ground. Now she knew it. She was completely outside her element.</span> <em>This</em> <span class="merge__be">woman was different. Not just another face in the crowd. She was a</span> <em>real</em> <span class="merge__be">monster.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Her two companions, however, had yet to pick up on this—or they did, perhaps, but didn’t find it worthy of note. Kirara had lost, but the violence her friends could mete out wouldn’t be suppressed by any weird mystic force. They had absolute confidence in their powers, and now they had the ideal opportunity to test them out. Besides, the plan was in full swing, and there was no canceling it at this point.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hmm…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shuna’s beauty attracted Shogo’s eye for a moment. Then he recalled why they were here. To enslave them. And if a woman as beautiful as this was a monster, there was no reason</span> <em>not</em> <span class="merge__be">to treat her as a slave.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“That’s your attitude, huh? Well, all right. If you’re up for it, I’m ready for you!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His desirous eyes turned to Shuna, analyzing how best to tackle her. He looked forward to bellowing with laughter as she lay on the ground, bruised and crying, and continuing the torment until she begged for mercy.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then a quiet voice broke his concentration.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Your licentious thoughts are written all over your face, lowlife. March straight out of this town, and we’ll let you live. Refuse to obey, and your life will be forfeit!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shion’s slim, well-proportioned body was attired in a business suit, the epitome of cool beauty as she stepped in front of Shuna. Her eyes were furious as she strode forward.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shogo flashed a ferocious smile. He stood strong, never even contemplating defeat. “Ha! I like it! Get in my way, and I’ll crush you!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I see. It appears you will not understand until you are smashed to the ground. Very well. Allow me to engage you!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then the two of them collided.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Kyoya couldn’t wait for this moment. There was no meddling referee overseeing this sparring match and thus no need for him to play the star-pupil role. And with Shogo wrecking things first, he had no reason to be patient any longer.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="u">“If that’s how it is,” he said with a twisted smile and drawn sword, “I get free rein, too, don’t I? I was hoping I’d get to test this out sometime.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Ever since he’d come to this world, Kyoya had been waiting for the tides to turn in his favor. Now, the time had come. Before his eyes was Shuna, with Gobta and Gobzo behind her.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Heh-heh-heh… I can’t wait to see how much I can do!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hoo boy. Gobzo, protect Lady Shuna for me.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes, sir, Gobta!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gobta drew his dagger and lowered himself for combat. Kyoya did the same, sword straight ahead of his eyes. He was a talent in kendo, and his unique skill—known as Severer—was focused entirely on slicing and dicing.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="y">It was backed by his natural-born fencing talents and the extra skill All-Seeing Eye. The skill allowed him to fully grasp the situation around him, as if watching the action from a video game’s camera perspective. It blasted this information straight into his eyes, boosting his reaction time—and thanks to Mind Accelerate, he could recognize and address threats three hundred times faster than normal.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With these three skill powers in hand, Kyoya had become the greatest swordsman in both Farmus and the rest of the Western Nations. Razen had ordered him to keep these powers hidden, but that order was no longer valid. Kyoya finally had his chance to unleash them all, and it made the blood surge through his body.</span></p>

<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Haaa-ha-ha-ha! With these kinda skills, not even that old lady Hinata could challenge me, much less some wimp like you!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With a final hearty laugh, Kyoya descended upon Gobta.</span></p>
