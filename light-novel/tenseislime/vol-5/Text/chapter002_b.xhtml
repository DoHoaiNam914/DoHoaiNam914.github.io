<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I am.” Gruecith laughed as he pulled himself out of the hole in the ground, grinning. “My job here is to explore the world. I’m allowed to do whatever I wish until ordered otherwise.”</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">But now someone was stealthily approaching them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was none other than Gobta.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Hee-hee-hee… I saw them. If she can do that…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He was plotting and planning as he interrupted the pleasant atmosphere surrounding the group. “I saw that battle just now! What a marvel! I am</span> <em>astounded</em><span class="merge__be">. I simply fell in love with that lady’s moves, I did! And that’s why I hope I can ask a favor of her.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He smiled eerily. Yohm and Gruecith both knew him well enough to grasp what this meant. He was scheming something again. Mjurran, on the other hand, raised a quizzical eyebrow at him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, Mjurran, this is Gobta. He’s…um, well, you could say he’s a force all his own around here.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hee-hee-hee! No, I’m really not.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“No, seriously, Gobta here’s a real performer,” volunteered Gruecith. “He let that demon instructor beat the daylights out of him just now, but he always comes back for more.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ooh yeah, that was rough earlier…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gobta modestly turned away a bit before remembering what he was here for. His face stiffened.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“So, um, there’s someone I’d like you to defeat, lady, using that same tactic. That demon—um, I mean, that old coot, um, I mean our</span> <em>sage instructor</em> <span class="merge__be">always goes around acting like he’s king of the world, y’see? So—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Yohm and Gruecith nodded their recognition. Gobta lowered his voice, looking around in case anyone was eavesdropping.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I’ll help you with this, Mjurran. If we can beat him, that’ll force him to treat us with</span> <em>some</em> <span class="merge__be">respect, at least. Besides, I’d</span> <em>love</em> <span class="merge__be">to see how the guy’d react to that.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Indeed,” Gruecith agreed, “it is an excellent strategy. Even an ogre mage would be helpless!”</span></p>

<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So Mjurran, outnumbered three to one, reluctantly agreed to the request. “But can we make this the last time, please?” she begged. “Something that simple isn’t guaranteed to work every time.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, it’ll be fine! The old man’s a swordsman, fighting at close ranges. He prides himself on his speed. He’s</span> <em>got</em> <span class="merge__be">to fall for it!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah! He acts like he’s</span> <em>sooo</em> <span class="merge__be">superior to us hobgoblins, so I wanna make him pay for it for a change!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It was enough to trick even me, after all. A close-range battle, reliant on quick footwork like that, would be much harder if the trap was sprung in the right place.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>That trick worked</em><span class="merge__be">, Mjurran said to herself,</span> <em>because you’re too simpleminded to spot it. It can’t put up with</em> <span class="merge__be">that</span> <em>much heavy use.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“But,” she pleaded, “what pretext should I challenge him with?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hmm… Any excuse should do,” ventured Gobta. “Just tell him you want more instruction on dealing with magic-castin’ foes.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“So this should be a scrimmage, then, not a real battle?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“That’s fine, isn’t it? It’ll just be one strike. Tell him whoever hits first wins, and I’m sure he’ll be fine with it.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Indeed, Yohm. Magic resistance plays no part in those rules—land a spell upon him, and you win. If he touches you first, he wins. A test of speed, you could say.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Um, do you really think I’ll be willing to accept those rules? That puts conjurers at an enormous disadvantage. How can someone like that compete in speed with a swordsman who’s clearly faster than they are?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Ooh yeah,” Gobta admitted.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Accepting restrictions on your own abilities when you don’t know what your opponent’s capable of is like signing your own death certificate.” Mjurran sighed.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">To her, serious-minded at heart, Gobta’s poorly thought-out ideas were enough to give her a headache. Suggesting rules like that was all but advising her foe to expect a trap of some sort. All the men here were too boneheaded to pick up on that.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“All right,” said Yohm. “So Mjurran doesn’t fight. We just want ’im to accept that you’re good with magic, y’know? So since Gobta suggested this first, maybe we can use him as bait.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“A fine idea. He would certainly accept a challenge from the hobgoblin.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gobta began to dislike the direction this was going. “H-hold on a second!” he barked. Yohm and Gruecith were too busy working out the plan to listen. It’d be hard to bow out at this point. Having Mjurran fight for him seemed like it’d bear positive results, but if it was</span> <em>his</em> <span class="merge__be">neck on the line, that gave him pause.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Oh no… If I mess this up, I’ll be in big trouble, won’t I? I guess I’ll have to help think up a more serious plan…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“All right, guys. I have an idea. First, I challenge him to battle. When I do, I want you to put pitfalls in a big circle around us!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“From that distance, a safer bet would be to liquefy the soil and keep him from moving.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“How will that work?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran liquefied a small patch next to her to demonstrate the process to Gobta. He took a step, then marveled as his foot went right in with a</span> <em>ploop</em><span class="merge__be">, resisting his efforts to pull it out.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ooh,</span> <em>this</em> <span class="merge__be">oughtta work!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">That was the end of their deliberations.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Right,” Mjurran said. “So my role here is to wait for the battle-start signal and transform the earth. Is that it?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Right you are!” Gobta beamed.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Now they just had to pull it off.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">………</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">……</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“So will I receive an explanation for this?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gobta, Yohm, and Gruecith had been made to kneel on the bare ground. Mjurran stepped up to join them, but Hakuro shooed her off with a wave and a grandfatherly smile. “You are fine,” he said. “I’m sure these fools before me instigated it, did they not?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“But I couldn’t just—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, think nothing of it. They got caught in your trap, so they reasoned that it’d have to work on me as well, no? It</span> <em>was</em> <span class="merge__be">an impressive spell, but their eyes telegraphed it from the start.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran sighed. She’d seen it coming the whole time, too.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">After settling on their plan, the group had called their teacher, the elder Hakuro. That much, at least, went well enough. One look at the man was enough to make Mjurran recall that he split a megalodon in half with a single swipe. Between his foreboding demeanor and the sheer sense of presence, she already predicted doom for this silly prank. Had this been a no-holds-barred battle, she would have immediately suggested a hasty retreat—but this was just a game, and she reasoned that being defeated would help her cohorts mature a bit.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>It’s not going to work, I’m sure, but it might be a good idea to see for myself how this Hakuro character fights.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So she agreed to join in.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Excellent!” Hakuro bellowed when asked. “That’s the spirit, lads! I will base it on real battle situations for the first time in a while. All three of you, take me on at once! And will the new woman be joining us? She seems to be a magic-user, yes?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Whoa, you old—I mean,</span> <em>sage</em> <span class="merge__be">master! Don’t count us out too early!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Listen to the hobgoblin, sir. Ya sure you aren’t being a little too confident for your own good?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Heh-heh-heh! As your guest, I thought it rude to horn in too much on the fun…but after what you just said, I suppose I’ll</span> <em>have</em> <span class="merge__be">to go all in, won’t I?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The sight of the entire trio latching on to Hakuro’s goading made Mjurran modify a key part of her prediction.</span> <em>This was doomed even before the battle began. I have much to teach them after this…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Despite her complaining, she was used to being Yohm’s military adviser—really,</span> <em>anything</em> <span class="merge__be">adviser at this point. She was as strong and responsibly minded as ever, and she opted to just smile and treat this as a learning opportunity for her group.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Once things began unfolding, the match turned out just as wretched as she predicted. Liquefying the ground around him did nothing to slow Hakuro down.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Geh! Why’s he moving like normal?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="u">Mjurran had laid out her magic in a circle around the area, dispelling it just enough to create a path for the panicking Gobta to escape through. As she did, she defined a position for her pitfall and set it in place. Hakuro acted like it wasn’t there, as if running on thin air.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Ahh, he must have noticed. But nothing would change if he didn’t. That looks a lot like Instantmove to me.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">That was one of the more difficult skills in the arsenal of Battlewill, a set of Arts that only the most talented could ever hope to master. Seeing it unleashed so effortlessly made Mjurran fully aware of just how pointless her tricks were.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Tch! Over here, old man!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But Yohm pressed on, revealing his position with a shout as he slashed at his foe. He was being read like a book. Gobta, to his credit, tried to tumble his way back to safety. He was rewarded with a wooden sword to the forehead.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Not again…” He groaned as he sunk into the ground. Yohm joined him shortly—not to rescue him, exactly, but the real reason didn’t matter much anymore. Hakuro was just too fast. Before Yohm could even stick the follow-through, Gobta was down and Hakuro was behind him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Whoa?! I didn’t even see—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Fools.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">One strike later, Yohm was down.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">If the liquefaction trick didn’t work, the original idea called for Yohm and Gobta to distract their foe while Gruecith snuck in a surprise attack. That proved a similar waste of time. Before Gruecith even realized what Yohm wanted him to do, Hakuro had defeated both his teammates.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And, in the midst of all this, Mjurran looked on at this beautiful demonstration of athletic ability. It required Magic Sense; the naked eye couldn’t keep up fast enough to let her understand what was going on. And she wasn’t</span> <em>just</em> <span class="merge__be">looking. She had the spell cast in advance to keep her magic-born roots a secret.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Still… If you’re going to challenge a foe who requires Magic Sense just to keep your eyes on him, the only thing that’d work is ranged magic covering a wider area. That wasn’t available here, so this was over before it began.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Really,</span> <em>any</em> <span class="merge__be">magic that required casting time wouldn’t do a thing against a target coursing at supersonic speed. For a wizard, tackling a foe like that would require racking several spells in advance, chanting them beforehand so they could be summoned with a deftly woven trigger during battle. That, or using Cast Cancel.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>But even if I used Cast Cancel on my own, it’d only work up to midlevel magic. Any serious attempt might be doomed to fail…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran’s body contained more of the magicules that provided energy for all her spells, but trying to outclass him in strength seemed like a struggle to her. The sight of it all unfolding</span> <em>did</em> <span class="merge__be">make this nonsense seem worth it to her, though. Hakuro was targeting Gruecith, not the cautious Mjurran. Before neutralizing the magic-caster, he first wanted to defeat the biggest obstacle out of the group. In other words, Hakuro didn’t consider her magic to be an impediment.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>A bit insulting, but so be it. Sir Hakuro could likely handle anything I could throw at him, here in my human form. I wish I could have hit him with</em> <span class="merge__be">something</span><em>, though…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Following her pregame analysis, Mjurran had prepared three small explosive spells, meant to be triggered in a staggered arrangement. The first went off before Hakuro’s eyes as he struck down Gruecith—not a lethal bomb but a blindness strike that plunged the two of them into darkness.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ngh?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was enough to produce a surprised grunt from Hakuro. But he pressed right on, unwavering. Gruecith had a keen enough sense of smell that blindness wouldn’t affect him in battle—that was the whole backbone behind this plan—but Hakuro didn’t rely on that sense much, either.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>So much for that. Can he read people’s presences, or…?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Of course, Mjurran had guessed in advance that blindness wouldn’t slow him. Without flinching, she launched her second magic. This was a Flashbang, a spell that created a flash of light and a deafening noise to paralyze the target’s sight and hearing. It was one of her antihuman spells, effective in or out of doors, and she expected the blindness bomb would only accentuate the effect.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And again, she was right. Just before the magic took effect, she saw Hakuro edge backward for a brief moment in his darkness. He was within point-blank range of the light and noise, but he paid it no attention at all as he sprang back into action.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>I knew it…! I suppose Hakuro knows Magic Sense as well…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The reaction to that Flashbang was something shown only by those who could read the flow of magic—the movements of magicules. The blast itself, too, had no impact on him whatsoever. Just like Mjurran, he based his decisions in battle off Magic Sense. That meant he could read all magic before it happened, and</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">meant Mjurran would’ve had to bust out the big guns immediately if she wanted to impact this fight at all.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Ignoring her and tackling Gruecith first was an extremely sensible decision. She had focused on keeping him safe from status ailments rather than trying to cast magic directly herself, but Magic Sense made all that moot. The operation was upended at its very roots.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">If anything, it hurt Mjurran’s ego, seeing her magic be so dismissively tossed aside like that.</span> <em>That was no fun</em><span class="merge__be">, she thought.</span> <em>I was never too enthusiastic about this, but if he thinks he can pick on a wizard, let me show him what that costs!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So she turned her eyes toward Gruecith—and then she lost all interest.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Arrrhhh! My—my eyes; my ears!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What are you</span> <em>doing</em><span class="merge__be">, you fool?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">She could be excused for yelling at her comrade. That Flashbang had been pointed in a single direction. It shouldn’t have affected Gruecith that badly. The idiot must have stared right at it. She</span> <em>told</em> <span class="bs">them all beforehand what magic she intended to use. She could conclude only that Gruecith was the kind of lycanthrope who, if you told him</span> <em>not</em> <span class="bs">to do something, would immediately try that out first.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran threw her arms up in surrender.</span> <em>This is just ridiculous. I thought the way lycanthropes are so stupidly straightforward with people would make them easy to use. But it’s the exact opposite, isn’t it?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“If that did nothing to you, then we have lost. I doubt Gruecith will make any further contributions to our cause.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ho-ho-ho! You are quick to read the tides of battle, my good lady—at least, much more than this rotten trio. So you will not use your final spell?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“No. I doubt it would make any difference.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">The final spell was Sleep Mist, her trump card. Putting Hakuro fully to sleep was likely impossible, but if she could slow his thought process</span> <em>just</em> <span class="t">a bit as he locked swords with Gruecith, that would provide just the chip in the armor into which to potentially drive the sword of victory. Even if it didn’t, Mjurran figured the surprise factor would throw off his game.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But the sight of Gruecith vaguely sort of floating atop the liquefied soil drained her will to continue. So she sighed and unraveled the spell.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">“…Their eyes telegraphed it from the start.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran rolled her eyes when he said it just now. All the prep work she’d done to ensure the magic could never be spotted, and Gobta and Gruecith had their eyes on the ground the whole time.</span> <em>There you go, then</em><span class="merge__be">, she thought with a sigh.</span> <em>It’s all but opening your mouth and telling him, “Ohhh, hey, something’s here.” Yohm was stout enough to resist the urge, at least, but he’s only human. Nothing from him would work on Hakuro.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ho-ho-ho! You may be a fine strategist, my lady, but without a keen insight into your allies’ personalities, one can never hope for truly effective teamwork. No hastily put-together team could ever defeat me.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran nodded at the condolences. “It’s been a lesson for me, yes. I’d like to begin by examining them further in depth.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Mm. Yes. A good idea.” Hakuro nodded, then turned to his three kneeling opponents. “So may I suggest you answer me now? Before I decide to switch blades from wood to metal?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The avuncular smile he’d given Mjurran was a thing of the past. Now he was back in full demonic form.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Pah!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Whoa?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Waaaaaait!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Three hours later, they were still there, legs numb from all the kneeling. Hakuro was making them stay until he was</span> <em>damn</em> <span class="merge__be">sure they wouldn’t pull any more malarkey like that. Mjurran gave them a passing glance as she returned to her bedroom, promising herself that she’d never join them on a “plan” like this again.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">“Now, I say this just in case, mind you, but promise me you won’t try to ‘test’ Sir Rimuru like that, please?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What’re you talking about?” Gobta pleaded to the rather concerned-looking Hakuro. “No way any of that would work on Sir Rimuru!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Oh? Because, to be honest with you, I think it might have more than an outside chance of working…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ha-ha-ha! Come on, Gramps. Don’t you think you’re worrying too much? Someone like Rimuru, he’s not about to fall for a trick play!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hopefully not,” Hakuro said. “If he did, we would all be in trouble.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His three pupils shuddered at the thought.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Y-yeah… We weren’t planning to, but definitely not</span> <em>now</em><span class="merge__be">, no.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Gobta said it. He and that other girl, too. The violent one.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You mean Shion?” Gobta asked. “Or, wait, not Mili—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Whoa, stop right there, Gobta.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The hobgoblin nodded at the panicked-looking Yohm. Gruecith failed to follow this conversation but understood well enough that he should stay out of it. A smart move, although he may not have realized it.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“All right,” Hakuro gravely intoned. “Soei is too prudent to fall for that, but Sir Rimuru and Sir Benimaru… They have their quirks, shall we say? Sir Rimuru seems to be restraining his Magic Sense, too, to some extent.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Why’s he doing that, sir?” asked Gobta.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Who knows,” Yohm replied, looking at him. “I couldn’t even guess how that Magic Sense stuff works.”</span></p>

<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well,” interjected Gruecith, “I certainly see why Lord Carillon accepted Rimuru as an equal. Placing limiters upon his own strengths like that… A constant, never-ending cycle of training!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Huh?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Wow, is that it? Boy, Sir Rimuru sure is great!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Huh. Man, his mind works on a whole different plane from ours, eh?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This, along with Hakuro’s later approval, led to a new fad around Tempest where monsters deliberately limited the release of their skills to better hone them. It had nothing to do with Rimuru, but if he were around, they hoped he would approve.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">All that slogging through liquefied soil and getting rapped soundly by swords had made the three of them very muddy. It wasn’t long before they discussed entering the town’s famous bathing facilities together.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Boy,” Gobta observed, “that lady sure knows how to use her magic. She’s pretty, too!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah, ain’t she? And she’s got personality, too. It ain’t just looks.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I have no argument with that. Her name is Mjurran, right? It’d be nice if she could give birth to my child…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Whoa there, Gruecith. Ya can’t go talking like that. She’s one of my officers.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">“What does that have to do with anything, Yohm? When it comes to romance, I’m free to do whatever I want. First come, first served.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Wow, really? I’ll keep that in mind!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Don’t</span> <em>you</em> <span class="merge__be">start, Gobta!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gruecith snickered at the wailing Yohm. “Maybe I should talk to her myself, hmm?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Damn it, Gruecith, I go first! I’m your boss!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Are you crazy? I just told you: Romance is all about freedom!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah, Yohm!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was turning into quite a heated argument by the time they reached the bathhouse. The moment they washed off and settled into the hot bath, Gobta’s eyes began to emit a sinister twinkle once more. “I just remembered Kabal said something to me when he was here last,” he began. “They say there are some baths in the world with a ‘mixed gender’ rule. He said Sir Rimuru told him about it… And, you know, Sir Rimuru’s word is law, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hang on, Gobta. If that’s an order from Rimuru himself, then we gotta make sure it’s enforced, yeah?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Uh-huh! I think so, too!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What? Gobta, what do you speak of? Tell me more of this…mixed genders.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hee-hee-hee! You like it, too, huh, Gruecith? Well, it’s like this…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He went over the topic in detail, growing more excited with every syllable.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“So you mean…not only Mjurran but Lady Shuna and Shion as well…?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You gotta be kiddin’ me, Gobta. I had no idea those were the rules around here!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The pleasant sensation of the hot mountain-spring soak was putting the trio’s minds at great ease. It also raised their voices high, their schemes echoing around the chamber.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Not all of it bounced back, however. Some of the sound waves wriggled their way right through the wall—and into the ears of Shuna and Shion, who had invited Mjurran to enjoy the women’s bath with them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I wonder if we should develop a potion to banish the stupid from their minds?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Do not worry, Lady Shuna. I will beat it out of them until they cry for mercy and their willpower is retempered!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I’ll be glad to help,” Mjurran added.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Records, sadly, did not exist to say what happened to the men afterward.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">“Mjurran, can we have a talk?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Several weeks had passed, enough time for Mjurran to get fully used to life with Yohm and his crew, when her leader spoke to her.</span></p>

<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Certainly. What about?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Not…</span><em>here</em><span class="merge__be">, if you don’t mind.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">That struck her as odd, but not queer enough to turn down his request. She followed Yohm out of town and toward a deserted patch of forest.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Hmm? Uh-oh. Did he find out who I am? I don’t sense any traps or ambushes up ahead…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The rest of Yohm’s team was still garrisoned in town; Mjurran knew all their exact positions. She didn’t much like the look Yohm had exchanged with Gruecith when he called her to him, but it still seemed like her cover was safe.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>So what is it, then…?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She remained baffled right up to the entrance into Forest of Jura land.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Have we walked enough, then? What is—?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Mjurran!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The interruption made warning flags shoot up in her mind.</span> <em>No! Really?!</em> <span class="merge__be">So had he found out after all? Had he told anyone else yet? Or was Yohm the only one to ferret her out so far? Either way, she had to come up with urgent countermeasures before—</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I love you! I swear: I fell in love with you the first time my eyes met yours!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Her mind stopped.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>…What?! What did he say?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Assorted questions popped in and out of her mind, but that was the only response she could muster. Simply returning Yohm’s gaze took all her mental fortitude.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Looking back, Mjurran</span> <em>had</em> <span class="merge__be">always felt a pair of eyes upon her. It was true ever since she’d infiltrated his force. It belonged to Yohm, and when their eyes met, she found herself averting hers out of awkwardness several times. It made her a tad nervous, perhaps wondering why he was so watchful of her. But maybe her misgivings were really about something else entirely.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Are you serious?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes. I promise I’ll make you a happy woman. I promise!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The sheer frankness of the confession made Mjurran’s cheeks flush. The last time she was (chronologically) a young woman, it was a good seven centuries ago. Her memories of it were vague at best. No memories of anyone else back then. To her, romance was a completely novel experience. Unexplored land.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Anxiety won out over happiness in her head. That, and:</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>…He’ll make me a happy woman? The demon lord Clayman’s used Marionette Heart to make me his personal puppet. If I can’t get my real heart back, I can never be free—and there’s no way to do that. And how could a human ever love me? They all die far too quickly…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So she opted to delay her response. The logical part of her brain told her to say no and get on with life, but somehow, she didn’t quite have the courage for that. Four hundred years of life as a magic-born, and it was the first time she had ever felt so anxious about herself.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Even after the confession, life went on as usual.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="u">Yohm was usually fairly shallow personality-wise, but—perhaps out of respect for her feelings—he made no further advance upon Mjurran. The feeling was no doubt mutual. Whether circulating around villages on monster hunts or relaxing back at town, Yohm showed concern for her, but he never did anything to squeeze a reply out of her.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>I… What should I even do? As long as Clayman lives and breathes, there’s no way his dream could ever come true…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Somewhere along the line, Mjurran began to have daydreams of herself more closely united with Yohm. The logical part of her brain denied it could ever be a possibility, but she just couldn’t bring herself to abandon the thought. Her mind gradually began to open itself to it, enthralling her so deeply that she didn’t even notice Gruecith staring at her, a troubled, lonely expression on his face.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Life was good—and now, within a week’s time, it would be destroyed.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">“It has been a while, Mjurran. Are you doing well?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The magical communiqué from Clayman arrived out of the blue. It made her panic a bit.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“L-Lord Clayman! What motivates you to contact me?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">To her, Clayman was unworthy of her loyalty. If she could, she’d murder him in his sleep. She didn’t because it was so obvious to both parties that she’d fail.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The last time she’d reported back to him, Clayman had been in oddly high spirits. The same was true this time. Mjurran’s instincts sounded the alarm. It creeped her out. Clayman almost never showed emotion to his underlings—if he was so obviously enjoying himself now, things must be going exactly the way he wanted. It did not seem like good news to her—and it wasn’t.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Thanks to the intel you provided me,” Clayman told the cautious Mjurran, “things are going quite well over here. You’ve done a superb job. Why, I’m even starting to think it’s time to return this heart in my hand and set you free.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran paused, confused at the proposal. For just a moment, Yohm’s face appeared in her mind. She could feel her spirit leap with excitement, but she still managed to keep her voice calm. Clayman must never learn of her true feelings. He was a demon lord, a devious Marionette Master perfectly willing to deceive his own servants.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Thank you very much, sir. This sudden suggestion is quite a surprise to me. Does this mean you no longer require my services?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Haaa-ha-ha-ha! Ah, you never change, Mjurran. There is hardly any need for such modesty. Why would I ever want to do away with such a talented pawn? I do hope you’ll still be able to serve a role for me, yes.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I see. I am glad to hear—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Mjurran,” the demon lord quietly interjected before she could finish her wary answer. “There is no need for alarm. I simply want you to perform one final piece of work for me. You won’t turn me down, will you? I’m sure you aren’t ready to die yet, and I’m sure you don’t want to see the man you love die before your eyes!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She could feel the blood drain from her head.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I—I have no love for…?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“For any man, is it? You give me far too little credit, Mjurran. All you have to do is follow my orders, and everything will be fine. I showed you the sweet dream of release there; I wouldn’t mind a little appreciation for that. Just sit tight until I provide your orders, if you could?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then he shut off the link.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran, sadly, had nothing to counter with. No matter how unhappy it made her or anyone else, the only road to salvation was to serve him. The only thing that remained in her heart was the demon lord’s final words: “When it is all over, I will release you. Your dream of living with the man you love may not be a dream before long.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Was this a trap?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">—No, it had to be one. But all Mjurran could do was trust in his words. If she ever doubted them, it’d lead to potential tragedy for both Yohm and her. Far better for her to just do what Clayman said and hope for another passing whim in her favor.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Just as it always was, the only option available for Mjurran was to wait for her orders. But if it really</span> <em>did</em> <span class="merge__be">lead to her release—</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Could I ever really accept him?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She had to explore the thought, no matter how much she knew it was unforgivable.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>If this dream can come true, it’ll likely mean selling my soul to the devil.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was settled. Mjurran was resolute now. And then, as if nothing had just happened, she was back in action.</span></p>
