<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shion’s efforts, as always, were pointed in the completely wrong direction. And nothing could’ve been purer Shion than that.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">So the rest of the day turned into a wild party, a feast that continued well into the wee hours. There was none of the grim pathos of the past few days. Shion, and everyone else, was back, and their presence brought joy to the town.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">There was Gobzo and Gobta, showing off assorted tricks to their audience. One of them had a knife stuck in his head—wonder how they pulled</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">off. It looked like it was bleeding, too, but maybe I just imagined it. They were laughing so much that I’m sure there was nothing to be concerned about.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Yohm was there, too, along with Elen and her bodyguards. He and Gruecith were staggering around, which was still a better showing than the totally passed-out Kabal. But Mjurran was the clear winner of the night. She didn’t act a single bit drunk—an experienced partier, I suppose. Sufia, noticing this, became the latest challenger to fall victim to her in a drinking match as the party descended further into chaos. It was a wild scene, but at least it helped the lycanthropes forget their worries for a while.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Starting tomorrow, we’d have a lot of cleanup work to do. I’d need to consider what to do with the Beast Kingdom refugees, as well as how we’d rescue Carillon. Plus, there was the Western Holy Church to consider. We’d need to pay careful attention to how they reacted, assuming we wanted to keep on the Western Nations’ good side.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">There was a mountain of issues to deal with, but—for now—I supposed we could have a little fun. And maybe it was just for today, but this was turning into a real fest, I’d say. Japanese people love their festivals, after all. No excuse is too petty to kick one off, no reason too trivial for someone to plan a drinking party for his friends. That’s how we lived around here. No need to keep things tense</span> <em>all</em> <span class="merge__be">the time.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">I should also mention that this party wound up becoming a yearly occurrence in this land. They named it the Tempest Resurrection Festival.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Deep into the night, while everyone was sleeping off their epic benders, I was pondering over our future direction when an unfamiliar person greeted me.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I am glad you are awake, my lord. Allow me to express my heartfelt joy at seeing you become a full-fledged demon lord.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The figure bowed deeply before me.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Uh, who’re you?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I…?! Surely you jest, my lord. Nothing could damage a demon’s heart more than to hear that…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The visitor seemed genuinely insulted. He looked like a pretty high-level demon, but I seriously had no idea who this was.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then Ranga poked his head out from my shadow. “Master, this is one of the demons you summoned, using the knights as your bait.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Ohhh, right. This dude’s still here.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ahhh, Sir Ranga!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The demon turned thankful eyes to Ranga, as if in the audience of a personal savior. And, come to think of it, I</span> <em>did</em> <span class="merge__be">see him during the party, fidgeting and looking supremely out of his element.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well, thanks for all your help. I heard you rounded up the survivor for me, too, so Ranga and I could get back here safely.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, no, I am hardly worthy of your thanks. But along those lines…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well, sorry to keep you here all this time. You can go back home now.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…What?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">That would explain his behavior. He wanted to leave, but I hadn’t gotten around to giving the order. So I did—but this demon was acting all weird about it. He had rather handsome features—really, you’d almost call him beautiful, despite being male and all. And now that face looked bewildered, ready to cry at any moment. It worried me.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, um, did I not give you enough of a reward or something?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Nothing of the sort, my lord. As I asked you before, I seek the honor of joining your followers! What do you think? Will you please give it some consideration?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Joining my followers?</span> <em>Umm, I think this Greater Demon I summoned said something like that, yeah, but… Wait. This guy in front of me ain’t just “Greater.”</em> <span class="merge__be">We were talking like nothing was amiss, but this wasn’t any kind of Greater Demon at all.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Huh? Ranga, did I really summon this dude?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You certainly did, my master!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Hmm. All right.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Upon receiving the knight corpses you offered as my summoner, I have earned my physical body. I can only hope that I may repay this great favor to you in some way.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh really? Well, neat…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He did seem kinda strong, and if he wanted to be my follower that badly, then hell yeah. But that was a two-edged sword. If he ever went out of control, I worried that even Benimaru would have trouble stopping him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And what about the other two demons with him?</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Understood. When carrying out the Secret Art of Revival, you began to run short on magicule energy. When you did, the two demons rendered themselves into magicule form and disappeared in order to help you earn the energy required.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>…Man</em><span class="merge__be">. Raphael tossed that bombshell out like it was nothing. He was acting even more coldhearted than the Sage, showing off the kind of stakes he worked with. So the demons helped out with Shion’s resurrection, playing a role of their own behind the scenes? Boy, now I’m sorry I thought for even a moment that they were useless.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But what now, though? This guy’s aching so badly to help me out that he tossed his demon friends under the bus for me. It’d just be mean to ignore that.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I can’t really give you a salary or anything. You okay with that?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“The right to serve you will provide all the joy I need, my lord.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Well, hell, if he’s willing to work for free, I like</span> <em>those</em> <span class="merge__be">terms a lot.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“All right. Well, sounds good to me. As of today, you’re officially one of us.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ahhhh! I thank you, my lord!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Quit with the ‘my lord’ crap. It’s creepy.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I understand. How shall I refer to you, then?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Rimuru works.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ahhh, Rimuru—such a sweet tone that name has. Sir Rimuru it shall be, then…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Talk about grandiose. I had no idea what about me he found so attractive, but he just couldn’t wait to be my servant.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Right, yeah, great. But what’s</span> <em>your</em> <span class="merge__be">name?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Being a nameless demon is more than enough for me, Sir Rimuru.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Huh? He looked way too high-level to not have a name. But that’d be too much of a pain in the ass to deal with. Let’s do what I’ve always done, then.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Okay. Well, in place of any other reward, I want to give you a name. You got a problem with that?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“My word! No, no problem at all. This is the greatest gift a demon could ask for!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His well-featured face burst into abject joy. I guess that’s just how I am, huh? There’s something about me that demons find irresistible. I think I had a right to boast about that a bit.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Right. So, a name. Time to fish into my grab bag of supercar models, maybe? Something that sounds nice and demonic? In fact, why not just throw a fastball straight down the middle with this?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Your name is Diablo. May you live up to it in your service to me!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And the moment I said it, I felt my energy drain. I was getting pretty used to this by now. It took only about half my magicules this time, too. The pessimistic side of me was expecting more, given how high and mighty this demon looked. Naming Beretta, that Greater Demon, took over 30 percent of my magicules, so he must’ve been greater than Greater after all.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Report. The individual Diablo was an Arch Demon. When his master evolved, he experienced a massive upgrade in magicule stores. As a result, making a comparison strictly on percentage of magicules consumed will not provide an accurate picture.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Um, all right?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But really, Raphael here seems a</span> <em>hell</em> <span class="merge__be">of a lot more informal with me than the Sage ever was…</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Incorrect. It is your imagination.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Oh yeah? You seem awfully free with the advice you’re offering, considering that.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But the Lord of Wisdom just said something I didn’t want to ignore. My energy had gone up that much, and Diablo still took half of it? Like, how much of a boost are we talking here?</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Understood. For reference’s sake, the figure is over ten times what it previously was.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Holy crap.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">What the hell did I just walk into? I’ve turned into some kinda monster.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Diablo, the demon before me, remained motionless on one knee. A sort of dark cocoon enveloped his body as he prepared for his own evolution. I am</span> <em>so</em> <span class="merge__be">careless sometimes. I guess there’s no cure for stupidity, even after death, so I’ll just have to grin and bear it.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>No more casual naming for me! I mean it this time!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I swore it to myself, but something told me I wouldn’t stick to it for very long.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The evolution completed itself as I mused over this. Within the dark form I was greeted with, I could see streaks of red and gold amid his black hair. His eyes were just as golden as before, his pupils shining just as eerie a shade of crimson. The areas that’d normally be white were instead a shade of jet-black, which made them stand out all the more. As he rose to his full slender height, I realized he was dressed in the very peak of classy domestic clothing, like a perfect butler. It was a new image for him, compared to the high-born prince he’d looked like before.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He used to be a ruler; now he served one. But, if anything, that arrogant aura that surrounded him had grown, not shrunk.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Diablo. That is my name. My heart is filled with deep emotion, Sir Rimuru. From this day forward, I promise to serve you with all my heart.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He gave me a respectful salute.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">This transformation apparently reflected his desire to be my ever-loyal servant. Demons could use the intrinsic skill Create Material to whip up any kind of clothing they wanted, it turned out, so there was no need for a wardrobe. Pretty useful. I’m kinda jealous.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Almost immediately, he said, “Sir Rimuru, you appear to be fretting about something. What is it that troubles you? Because I would hope you can discuss it with me.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It must’ve been obvious to him. I decided to explain the whole situation, since it’d help me arrange my own thoughts as well. Even if it didn’t lead to an answer, it’d help keep my mind calm.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It’s nothing big… Well, it is, I guess. I’m thinking about the future.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“The future?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Right now, we’ve got too many problems to deal with at the same time. I think we’re already over capacity with all the plans we need to carry out.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I reviewed the circumstances for him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">My main concern was the demon lord Carillon and how Milim was involved with him. But the most pressing matter was how we’d clean up the Kingdom of Farmus and check the Western Holy Church’s movements—both issues that could greatly affect our future relationship with mankind. If we made any misstep with the Church in particular, we’d wind up being the nemesis of every human being in the world. I wanted to do whatever I could to prevent that.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It would be ridiculous, though, to attempt to address all these problems at once. I needed to line up our enemies, our problems, one by one and secure victory against them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I see. All of that makes sense to me now. Allow me, in that case, to shoulder some of the burden! I will be happy to fine-tune matters so multiple problems never occur at the same time for you. Your orders, Sir Rimuru!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Ahhh, ever the sly demon, isn’t he? He understood my worries in a flash and was ready to take action against them. But I wanted to discuss matters with everyone else before deciding on anything.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well, hang on. There’s no big rush. We’ll decide on a direction at a conference tomorrow, so why don’t you join us?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>If Diablo’s that eager to pitch in, let him. He seems pretty shrewd, and it’d be a waste to let his powers go unflexed.</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Report. I believe we do not need to worry about the Western Holy Church. The Analysis and Assessment of the Unlimited Imprisonment that has shut away the individual Veldora will be completed shortly. Releasing this individual is believed to provide a suitable restraint on the Holy Church’s actions.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Ooooh. Neat. Yeah, if we could release Veldora, that’d sure keep the Church from pulling any funny moves.</em></p>
<p class="m"><em>…Uh, wait, whaaaat?! You’re being way too engaging with me, Raphael!</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Incorrect. It is your imagination.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Yeah, yeah, my imagination. Knock it off, man.</em></p>
<p class="m"><em>Let’s get back to Veldora. We can actually release him?</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Analysis is slated to finish by tomorrow afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Wow, Raphael. I guess you’ve gotten a lot more useful than I thought.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Well,</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">certainly opened up a few paths to a solution. As long as we could keep the Western Holy Church in check, that’d give us all the time we wanted to negotiate with the Western Nations. I was scared the Church was agitating them to believe we were evil, and if we kept that from happening, we already knew there were nations there willing to work with us.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Farmus, meanwhile, was no longer a threat. We had crushed the core of their military, and we held their king hostage. We’d help pave the way for Yohm to establish a new nation and focus the attention on him, and nobody there would even have the free time to meddle with us then.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So what problems did that leave?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Right! I think something’s gonna come together after all!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I would focus exclusively on striking the demon lord Clayman. Milim told me that anyone who declared themselves a demon lord would quickly face retribution from the others. Why not turn it into a big debutante ball—get my name out there with a bang and go onstage as the sassiest, brassiest demon lord out there?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, has an idea come to mind?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It sure has. I’ve decided to become a demon lord—in name</span> <em>and</em> <span class="merge__be">deed.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee. That’s the spirit, Sir Rimuru. And I, Diablo, shall be faithful to you for all the days of—”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hmph! And I, Ranga, am his most faithful of servants!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I gave Ranga a pat on the head for that. The unexpected declaration was kind of endearing, I thought.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It seemed like we had a good playbook to work with tomorrow. And under a sky full of stars, atop Ranga’s back as he squinted in bliss, my own mind felt just as clear and glittery.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">The next day, I informed everyone of my plan.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The following people were in attendance:</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shuna, my temporary secretary.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shion, my official secretary. The temporary one was far better-suited to the job, but never mind that.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Rigurd and the other hobgoblin elders in government.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Rigur and Gobta from our security team.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Benimaru and Hakuro, representing our military.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Kaijin and Kurobe from the manufacturing department, along with Garm and Dold.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Geld and Mildo from construction.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Lilina from management.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Soei, Soka, and the other three members of our espionage team.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Ranga in my shadow as kind of an emotional support animal, I guess?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I also invited Gabil to join in, as well as Diablo, serving as a second secretary of mine. It’d be a good opportunity to introduce him, I figured.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Outside of native Tempestians, there was Yohm; his assistant, Kazhil; and Rommel the staff officer. Mjurran and Gruecith were there, of course, along with the Three Lycanthropeers of Eurazania. There were over thirty people in our meeting hall, all told.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Thank you all for gathering here, ladies and gentlemen!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Why this sudden meeting, Sir Rimuru?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I was trying to act all cool here, given that I was about to announce my presence as a demon lord, but Benimaru just cut me off.</span> <em>Guess I’ll keep it normal after all.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“First, I have someone to introduce to you all. This is Diablo, who helped me out of a rough spot just a bit ago. He’s pretty strong, and we can all rely on him, so make nice, all right?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hmm? He certainly seems well guarded… I imagine he is just as experienced as you say, Sir Rimuru.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With Hakuro’s stamp of approval, everyone else safely assumed that Diablo wasn’t some also-ran strength-wise. Without any further complaint, he immediately became one of the gang. Moving on:</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Now—Gabil!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Y-yes?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The dragonewt looked ill at ease in this gathering of top brass. He nervously shot to his feet upon hearing his name.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Effective today, I’m going to name you head of our development department. That’s a provisional title, but it means you’re now in Tempest leadership. Make me proud, all right?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Y-yes! Yes, sir! I promise you that I, Gabil, will eternally put my nose to the grindstone for you!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He choked up midway as he accepted the offer. Research and development seemed to suit Gabil a lot more than I would’ve guessed. I was sure he’d do a great job.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Now it was time to visit the main topic.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“So I’ve decided on our direction going forward, and I wanted to relay it to all of you. This has everything to do with Yohm and the Three Lycanthropeers as well, so I want you to listen carefully.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Whatever you want, pal.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Does this have to do with rescuing Lord Carillon?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">All eyes were upon me. Without further delay, I turned into human form and faced them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I’ve decided to become a demon lord.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Right.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>…Huh? Kind of a tepid response.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Um… Meaning that I’m taking the role…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You already have, haven’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shion gave me an odd look. I guess she figured that was the whole reason she was alive now. And yeah, I was a true demon lord in terms of my rank or whatever, but…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I don’t mean that. I mean, I’m going to declare to the world that I’m a demon lord, too!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh? Meaning that you’re going to challenge the other demon lords at their own game, Sir Rimuru?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Hakuro was kind enough to say it for me.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Right! Exactly! And not ‘the other demon lords’ exactly. I’m gunning straight for Clayman.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Yohm, Mjurran, Gruecith, and the Three Lycanthropeers nodded their earnest approval.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I see,” said Benimaru, boldly smiling. “Seizing a seat at the demon lords’ table for yourself, then? Interesting.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Nobody else had any objection.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Right. Behind the scenes, as Farmus attacked us, it was Clayman controlling Mjurran and all the rest. I can’t let that stand. There’s a pretty good chance he’s the one who sicced Milim and Frey on Eurazania, too. That’s all the reason I need, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">My audience nodded back.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I then discussed my thoughts further with them—about our future relations with the Western Nations, about the postwar cleanup with Farmus, about the need to keep the Holy Church</span> <span class="bs">from interfering with us, and about rescuing Carillon, as I prom</span><span class="merge__be">ised the Beast Kingdom’s denizens. I also passed out work assignments along the way.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Rigurd! I’m leaving negotiations with the Western Nations to you. Evacuating all those merchants back to Blumund should be a pretty good bargaining chip to work with. Keep in mind the trust we’ve built so far and proceed carefully.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes, Sir Rimuru! You can count on me!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He sounded ready for the job. The other elders looked just as enthusiastic about it, practically bursting with confidence. I guess they were on pretty good terms with the merchants.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Benimaru! I want you to tabulate exactly what happened to everyone who evolved in town. We’re going to use every weapon at our disposal to crush Clayman, and to do that, I need to know what kind of powers I have to work with.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes, Sir Rimuru.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He, too, was brimming with confidence. It was the expression of a true general, one worthy of being entrusted with all military matters. He sucked at keeping an eye on Shion, but when it came to</span> <em>this</em> <span class="merge__be">job, here was a man you could rely on.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Shion! I’ll have you interrogate our prisoners. Yohm and Mjurran, you’ll help Shion out with that. Make them talk as much as you can about the state of things inside Farmus, and help us seize their country. Before we do that, we’ll have to finish all the postwar cleanup work, too. There’s going to be a new nation set in place, one with Yohm as its king and leader, and we need all the intel we can to make it work. Don’t kill any of them, all right? They might be useful to us later.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I happily accept the task, Sir Rimuru!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sure thing, pal.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I will do what I can. Hopefully it will help me repay the favor a little.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Shion was ready. I made doubly sure to instruct her not to kill anyone, because I easily imagined her doing so otherwise. We should be fine now, hopefully, even as I sensed a sort of restless turbulence deep within her eyes that concerned me. Hopefully I was just imagining it. She was always quick to fly into a rage, so I figured this would be a good way to let her get back at ’em, but maybe I was being a bit too rash.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Ah well. She wouldn’t be alone, ever, so I figured it’d be fine. I had future work for Yohm and Mjurran, so it’d be best if they helped her for now. I made sure to have them contact me should Shion begin to act unstable. That ought to be enough caution to cover my ass.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Soei!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I will gather information on Clayman as quickly as I can.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Ah. Right. Good. Soei’s certainly a man who can work. He guessed at my motives before I could even give him his orders, and Clayman was the only prey in his eyes right now. Scary dude. Glad I could rely on him—and before I could finish the thought, all five members of our espionage team had disappeared, already carrying out their duties. Once he was back, I was sure we’d have another strategic conference to carry out.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">As for the others:</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Now, as I’ve said, I’m going to crush Clayman. I’d like the Three Lycanthropeers to help me with this if possible?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I would expect nothing else, O great leader of Jura.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Just say the word! We’re running on your orders for now!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“We are all of the same mind. We lycanthropes reward trust with trust—we repay our favors with our lives. We trust you, and you have given us a favor we could never repay. Now allow us to stake our lives on paying you back!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“All right. Well, here’s the order. I want you to rest up, recharge yourselves, and prepare for the decisive duel!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“““Yes, Sir Rimuru!”””</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">All three of them kneeled and acknowledged that they were under my orders. That’d be a huge boost to our war power, not to mention some extra provisions to use against Clayman. That was a relief.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Good. So, I want everyone else to evaluate the damage to our town and repair it. We also need some living quarters set up for the lycanthropes—help them maintain a decent quality of life while they’re here. And keep up your security patrols to make sure we don’t have any fights or trouble!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Everyone nodded their agreement. That marked the end of this salvo of orders.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Excellent. Now we’ll just wait for Soei’s report before we hold another conference. Until then, I want all of you to figure out the main issues with the work you’re assigned and put together a plan we can execute against them!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“““Yes, sir!”””</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The audience stood up and saluted me. I nodded and gave them a little smile, putting on my mask as I sat down.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Get to it!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Every one of them immediately sprang into action.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">The only ones left in the room were Diablo, Shuna, and me. Shion griped a bit about being the “real” secretary and all that, but (luckily for me) she put the orders I gave her first. She lectured Diablo a bit on what the job of secretary entailed, but he was perfectly safe in ignoring all of that. Already he was eagerly nodding and giving thoughtful looks at what I said, so maybe that made Shion get all stuck-up with him. If I hadn’t stopped her, she might still be yapping at him now.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I had given her three prisoners to interrogate. She had to take that job seriously or else it’d be pointless. It wasn’t an interrogation so much as torture at Shion’s hands, truthfully speaking. I had given permission for her to deal any kind of mental anguish she could think of, as long as physical pain wasn’t involved. The victims I resurrected were allowed to join in, too, and I was sure they’d be more than eager to make them sing like canaries.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The anger swirling within me had largely calmed now that they were all back. It meant I had no real drive to kill that seedy-looking old man and the guy from the Western Holy Church. The main perpetrator already had his heart broken by Diablo, besides. I couldn’t forgive them, but I no longer had much interest in laying my hands on them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Depending on how things went, it might be better to let the king of Farmus and the archbishop live so we could more effectively use them. As long as Shion didn’t kill them, then, I was prepared to give tacit approval to whatever she did. If someone hits you, you gotta hit back. Hit back, put the fear of God in them, and make sure they never make the same mistake again. Shion was the perfect person to handle this, and once she extracted the info we needed, I was sure she’d give them a hearty meal—using Master Chef to make sure it tasted</span> <em>just</em> <span class="merge__be">the way she wanted.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">While Shion played the role of interrogator, I had other business to take care of.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">First, I had to study how this world handled postwar cleanup. I wanted to at least consider things like what they did with POWs, as well as the other conventional wisdom surrounding warfare around here. If all of mankind considered us to be monsters, then I could just operate by my own rules—but if there was a chance we could build cooperative relationships, like we had now, I wanted to nudge things in that direction as much as I could.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Thus I decided to examine what nations generally did in times like these. Yohm and Elen’s gang wouldn’t know anything about politics or government. For something like this, Vester was my man. Soon, there was a knock on the door, followed by Diablo bringing the former dwarven minister into my chamber.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I hear you called for me, sir?” he asked when he set eyes upon me. “And let me say, I am so glad to see you safe after all these calamities that befell us!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Yeah, that ain’t the half of it. Not that they were over yet, either. I decided to cut straight to the point.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You said it. But I wanted to ask you: How do human countries around here wage war against each other?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Ah, you are curious about Farmus, then? That</span> <em>is</em> <span class="merge__be">a rather thorny issue to deal with.”</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Vester then began discussing the rules of war with me.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">First off, Western Nations countries that were members of the so-called Council of the West generally didn’t fight one another. Even if they did, it’d have to involve formal declarations of war and a litany of strict rules. Failure to adhere to those would put the full weight of the Council against you—meaning every other nation in that western region, pretty much.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">What about nations not involved with the Council, though? Assorted scenarios could play out in that case, but basically, the Council never got involved no matter who won or lost. If one side engaged in behavior that was cruel and inhumane beyond reason, however, it would certainly torpedo that nation’s reputation within the Council. Just because rules didn’t apply to the other side, that didn’t mean you could do whatever you wanted. Trying to navigate the boundaries of this seemed like a big headache to me.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">On the other hand, though, if you were invaded by another nation, that was a different story. You had the right to request rescue support from the Council, and that was one major reason why the Council had so many small kingdoms represented among its ranks.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Larger nations, such as the Dwarven Kingdom and the Eastern Empire (full name: Nasca Namrium Ulmeria United Eastern Empire), naturally weren’t involved with the Council. Get stormed by one of those outfits, and the Council was ready to handle that with a unified front—but if</span> <em>you’re</em> <span class="merge__be">the one storming them, the Council was totally hands-off. You might even get kicked out of the Council for needlessly riling a superpower like that.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">Having it laid out for me like that, it sounded like the Council—this sort of United Nations–like presence in this world—was based pretty</span> <span class="merge__be">heavily around the idea of weaker nations helping one another out. Considering the ever-present threat of monsters, I suppose, people there had learned that wars among mankind were pointless.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">Now I had some level of understanding to work with. Within that framework, the Kingdom of Farmus had staged a single-handed invasion of Tempest. Was this a holy war, involving the full will of the Western Holy Church? That was a thornier question.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="ba">“That’s exactly the issue,” Vester advised. “If Farmus had won or at least forced a stalemate, the Holy Church could’ve driven a litany of other nations to join the battle. The way things are now, though…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bb">…Yeah. It took one slime to wipe out the entirety of Farmus’s military force. We’re talking</span> <em>literally</em> <span class="merge__be">three survivors. It had to be one of the biggest routs in all of history. Plus, they invaded a country with ties to Blumund. Was it really worth picking a fight with a nation like ours? Beating us wouldn’t earn them anything; it wouldn’t make anyone move from one side to the other. And winning was a pretty big long shot from the start…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“So,” I said, “if the Holy Church abandons Farmus, is it safe to say no other human nation will be willing to stage a military operation against us?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“The Dwarven Kingdom isn’t part of the Council, but they do keep up on their internal goings-on. From my perspective, I would not expect any moves from them at all.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Well, huh. Maybe we’re in a better situation than I thought.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee! I see, I see. Perhaps a show of force would be advisable against the Western Nations…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hang on, Diablo. I have my own thoughts about that.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“My pardons.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Nah, nah. I think I’m gonna ask you to make Farmus capitulate to us.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ohhh! I would be glad to take that duty.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I nodded at him as I thought this over. Once we had Veldora resurrected, the Western Nations and the Church would be essentially bound and gagged. We could use that opportunity to prove we weren’t their enemy. Farmus was probably going to get cut out of the Council before long, besides.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Report. I believe matters will proceed in the way you predict.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Good. With Raphael, Lord of Wisdom and all that backing me up, it had to be a sure thing.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Now, how were prisoners of war handled in this world? Unfortunately, even Vester didn’t have much to offer. Wars just weren’t that common, and POWs were generally exchanged for other prisoners, for money, or for other rights and privileges.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The idea of a nation taking a rival’s supreme leader prisoner was practically unheard of. Such a talentless king would quickly lose the faith of his people, no doubt, so I’d be surprised if anyone accused us of regicide or some other dirty deed like that.</span> <em>I suppose we could say that he died in battle, but it’d be much better to give him back alive, I think.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“All right. Thanks for the advice. I’m glad you’re here for us, Vester.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, no, it’s nothing that impressive,” he replied, visibly blushing.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His personality had mellowed out considerably here in Tempest, making him kind of a cheerful, intelligent man with a darker side that occasionally rose to the surface, but blushing definitely did</span> <em>not</em> <span class="merge__be">fit his look. There’s nothing cute about a middle-aged guy acting all bashful. “Ah, I almost forgot: Is it all right if I report on these events to King Gazel?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sure, no problem. Tell him to give me some feedback if he has any.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Even if we tried to hide it, they’d find out in a flash. Better to just give him the whole, unvarnished truth.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Very well. I will be off, then…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He was still blushing when he took his leave. Then something clicked in my mind.</span> <em>Wait a second. What if he wasn’t being bashful at all? What if he was just that, you know, charmed by me? I did have my mask off.</em></p>
<p class="m"><em>Wait… No way…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Assorted concerning scenarios flashed through my mind. I’d just have to hope none of them came to fruition.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">The moment Vester left the chamber:</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Report. Analysis and Assessment of Unlimited Imprisonment is complete.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Well, perfect. Thanks, Raphael. Let’s go outside and get Veldora out of there pronto.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I’ve got some business to take care of, so I’ll be gone for a bit. I don’t need anyone to accompany me. Shuna, show Diablo around town for me.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Very well. Take care.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Thank you for your consideration, Sir Rimuru.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“No prob. See you later.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Before long, I was deep inside the Sealed Cave—the very place where Veldora was being held, a region I didn’t even let Gabil and his army come near. Unleashing the dragon in the middle of town was likely to cause some, uh, consternation, so I went down here instead. Besides, even when sealed, the area around him was so dense with magicules that people couldn’t even come near the place.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">For me, though, it was easy. It used to take several minutes to pin down the coordinates for Spatial Motion, but now it required no more than a passing thought to wrap it up. In an instant, the two points in space were connected, and a hole opened up before me. One hop was all it took to reach my destination.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Okay. Let’s review where we’re at right now.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I’ve evolved into a demon lord, and my skills have changed quite a bit as a result. Essentially, all those skills (Spatial Motion included) have been brought together under the same umbrella—an umbrella called Raphael, Lord of Wisdom—making them all much easier to use.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="u">The ultimate skills Raphael’s powers involved (quoting from him) were: Mind Accelerate, Analyze and Assess, Parallel Computation, Cast Cancel, All of Creation, Combine/Disassemble, and Ability Adjust. The unique skill Deviant, an old memento from Shizu, was gone, now integrated into Raphael’s own abilities. Maybe that was why he was a lot more talkative than my old partner?</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Incorrect. That is unrelated.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">So it</span> <em>wasn’t</em> <span class="merge__be">“just my imagination” this time. And that must mean… Ahhh, but let’s not pursue this right now.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">By the way, Mind Accelerate lets me extend my rate of thinking by up to a million times. It’s a little hard to picture that with words alone, but crank it up, and it feels like time’s stopped for you. Thanks to all these skills, I could now trigger multiple magics at the same time, with no more than a fraction of a second’s delay between them. It was virtually incomparable with the Great Sage.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The ultimate skill Belzebuth, meanwhile, encompassed Predation, Stomach, Mimicry, Isolate, Rot, Soul Consume, and Food Chain. Soul Consume was a new power for me. Merciless, a power I thought could come in pretty handy, was subsumed into the others—a pity, but it was still active within Soul Consume. I still needed to break my target’s heart before I could take their soul, but it was pretty handy in practice anyway.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Another interesting thing was that Receive and Provide had merged into Food Chain. It set up this entire skill tree of sorts to tap into, with myself at the very peak. Monsters below me could provide their strength to back me up, and I could divert some of my own strength down to them. It was ridiculous—and even now, it was doing its thing, granting me access to the skills the town’s monsters picked up in their evolution. I was letting Raphael take care of all that for me.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">That rounded out my skill set, and even I was shocked at how superpowered it was. There’s no way I could take full advantage of this stuff. Raphael himself was subject to Food Chain, too, placing him in the midst of an Ability Adjust. If these skills were gonna change all the time, why bother remembering them?</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">But enough about me. Let’s turn our attention to Veldora.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This has been a long time coming, hasn’t it? Nearly two years, in fact. But I was finally ready to keep my promise. I still needed to find a vessel of some kind for the guy, but I had a feeling one skill or another would take care of that for me.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>I’m bustin’ you outta there, Veldora!!</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Then I placed the order with Raphael.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The moment I did, a virtual tempest of magicules swirled around within my Stomach. If I hadn’t evolved Belzebuth, I’m not sure the Stomach would’ve been able to take the strain. It felt like a near-overwhelming gale had burst out of nowhere.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I, the great and venerable Veldora, have returned!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Venerable”? Dude, is this some new way of talking you developed while you were in here?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hey!” I said, trying to keep things light. “Long time no see! How you doin’?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…You seem to be treating this great resurrection of mine rather flippantly. But it came more quickly than I expected. I had anticipated a while longer.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah, I’ll bet. Analyzing the Unlimited Imprisonment took a hell of a lot of time in itself. The way I</span> <em>was</em> <span class="merge__be">doing it, I’d probably need another hundred years or so, I’d guess. But then my Great Sage kind of evolved on me, so…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">“Evolved? No wonder, then. Even my unique skill Investigator told me to expect another century or so. All I could do was send the information I gleaned from the inside to your Sage, but the flow of data vastly accelerated itself out of nowhere, so I was wondering what was afoot. A skill evolving, though…? What happened there?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">I answered the question as best I could—I became a demon lord, my unique skill became an ultimate skill, the Sage became Raphael, and I’m one lean, mean, analyzin’ machine now.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ahhh… I see. And you’ve become a demon lord in the span of under two years?! An awakened demon lord is not some imposter pushover. Even I would have problems against such a foe!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">By “awakened,” I assumed he meant a true demon lord. When a potential seed goes through the Harvest Festival, that apparently “awakens” them—not that it really matters to me at this point.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah, well, um… What can I say, huh? I was always kind of like a genius, wasn’t I? Even back then. No regular dude would be reborn as a slime, after all. I kept on naming people, too, and that made me evolve really quickly. I mean, really, it was…easy.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…You’ve taken far too many risks, you fool. No wonder I noticed my magical energy being taken from me when I wasn’t paying attention. Whenever you lacked the energy to carry out your ridiculous naming sprees, you took what you needed automatically from me. Of all the foolish things! It was such a blow to my analysis performance that I feared it would extend my imprisonment. But your evolution saved us this time, then? Never did I ever anticipate</span> <em>anything</em> <span class="merge__be">of the sort!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Huh? So… So I survived all those epic naming sessions mainly because of Veldora?</em> <span class="merge__be">I mean, I</span> <em>did</em> <span class="merge__be">think it was kind of weird, pulling off all these evolutions at what seemed like a minimum of risk. Definitely gotta knock off the naming jags in the future. Hell, no wonder the demon lords didn’t immediately set out to build a vast army for themselves. Now it made sense.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But what’s done is done. Let’s just call it all part of the plan, huh?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I bet you didn’t. Well, I planned it that way the whole time. Did you receive any gift from my evolution, by the way? The World Language said something about everyone in my spiritual genealogy getting something…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">We should have been connected that way, too. But instead, I felt an audible</span> <em>huh?</em> <span class="merge__be">from my Thought Communication. Veldora fell silent for a bit.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then:</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah! Ahhh! So</span> <em>this</em> <span class="merge__be">is an evolved skill! My unique skill Investigator has become the ultimate skill Faust, Lord of Investigation! The power to reach the ultimate truth, the final goal of my boundless research!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He sounded pretty excited about it, dancing around a bit in the cave. I dunno, maybe he’s the type who’s slow on the uptake. His teacher probably would’ve written “too inattentive” on his report card. But whatever.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">“Oh, um, that’s great. A lot easier to evolve than you thought, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You fool!” came the exasperated reply. “Not even I was aware of such phenomena. It is</span> <em>not</em> <span class="merge__be">a lot easier than I thought!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">No, I suppose not. True demon lords were a rarity, after all, and I suppose it wasn’t such a common thing.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">We spent the next while catching up on stuff, sharing our knowledge with each other. Really, we could’ve spent all day down there, but I wanted to get Veldora out into the open sooner or later.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hey, so now that the seal’s gone and everything, you wanna go see what’s going on outside?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, yes. But what will we do about a vessel to serve as my physical body?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I think we can find a way to make that happen, but there’s something I want you to promise me, all right?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh? What is that?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Your aura’s too huge. I want you to hold it back for me. We have human beings in town now, as well as a variety of weaker monsters. If you show up in resurrected form over there, it’s gonna wreck everything, won’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Ah. You really</span> <em>have</em> <span class="merge__be">become a king, haven’t you? All right. You have my word!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Obtaining this firm promise was the whole reason I went so deep into this cave in the first place. I needed to be sure he could keep that crazy flow of magicules in check. Once I had his word, I unleashed my brand-new Enhanced Replication, or whatever it was called. This was the vessel I had in mind for Veldora—an exact duplicate of me, handsome face and everything.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">…Well, huh. No wonder Vester fell for me. I had matured from before, taller and more grown-up. Bewitching, even. Must be the evolution affecting me.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hmm. Is that your intention…?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yep. Use it as your vessel.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Gah-ha-ha-ha-ha! I see! Very well, then!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">With his blessing, I transplanted Veldora’s spiritual body—his heart, as it were—from my Stomach to the Enhanced Replication. He didn’t even have an astral body at the moment, making the operation very unstable, although it’d gradually rebuild itself as part of Veldora’s spiritual life process. My Replication should be the final defense he needed for now…or so I thought.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Report. I have an important development to share.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Whatever Raphael had, it sounded important. Something to do with Veldora, perhaps.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="cw">Report. I have confirmed the establishment of a “soul corridor” between my master and the individual Veldora. After consuming the remains of the individual Veldora and analyzing them, I have obtained the ultimate skill Veldora, Lord of the Storm.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">That was some pretty heady crap that Raphael was reporting on, as if it was the day’s weather. So shocking that I lost my words for a moment. Apparently, Belzebuth consumed the dregs of Veldora that remained in my Stomach, obtaining part of its powers for itself. This firmed up the link between our souls, transforming it into this new power.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The ultimate skill Veldora consisted of Summon Storm Dragon, Restore Storm Dragon, and a family of storm-related magic. Summon Storm Dragon called forth Veldora in dragon form, the way I remembered him. He was a spiritual life-form now, but once he was fully recovered, I should be able to summon him in that shape as well. I can summon only one dragon at a time; if I summon another, the first one disappears. Maybe I could take advantage of this for transport purposes? It seemed feasible.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Restore Storm Dragon copied Veldora’s memories into my own mind. In other words, if Veldora died for some reason, I could replace him—or, to put it another way, the “real” Veldora would reside within my own soul. That was what allowed me to summon him whenever I wanted, I suppose.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The storm magic granted me access to Death-Calling Wind, Dark Lightning, and Storm of Destruction. These were all incredibly powerful spells, not at all the sort you’d find in a grimoire down at the local library, so it was a nice bonus.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">That rounded out the set, and to sum up, it meant Veldora was using me as a kind of backup. Which I didn’t mind, especially if it unlocked all of Veldora’s skills for me.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“A ‘soul corridor’?” Veldora asked. “So all my memories and experiences are gathered in your mind, regardless of where we are in time and space. As long as you do not cease to exist, I am immortal. If I am subjected to Unlimited Imprisonment, you can simply resummon me to spring me out. I was once nearly invincible, but now I see I’ve been granted eternal life as well.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Wow. Really? Like, that</span> <em>totally</em> <span class="merge__be">seems like cheating. Although it assumes I’ll manage to keep myself alive going forward. Still, crazy. I could create these situations, like—</span> <em>Ha-ha! You thought you could take me? Well, check out this storm dragon I just happened to have bumping around in my pocket!</em> <span class="merge__be">Heh-heh-heh. I almost felt bad for my rivals. Talk about the ultimate ace in the hole.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">With that soul-corridor connection, changes began to occur within Veldora. With his heart linked up to my soul, he had lost all his vulnerabilities. In a single moment, both his astral and spiritual bodies were regenerated, giving him new life in his original, complete form.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And then:</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Mnh?!”</span></p>
