<p class="cotx"><span class="merge__be">Long before then—long, long before the Day of Ruin unfolded—the magic-born Mjurran was off to spy on Rimuru and his town once again. Her master, the demon lord Clayman, had given the command right after she finished a delivery of a certain magic item. “Investigate these mystery magic-born,” he said. “Find any weaknesses we can exploit, and find me some intelligence we can utilize on the bargaining table.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">………</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">……</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The report Mjurran gave him several months ago had been quite extensive. It covered the monster town Clayman was curious about, their level of cultural advancement, and the fact that Milim had apparently become friends with the enigmatic magic-born leading them. Said magic-born was a slime, as well as the masked figure Clayman had seen in previous reports. More important than that, however, was how the dryads, the overseers of matters across the Forest of Jura, had recognized this slime as the head of an alliance between them. They were now a kind of third power in the world, one neither human nor demon lord—and that made them difficult to touch.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Clayman didn’t hide his astonishment at the news of Milim’s new friend. The fact that this weak-sounding slime was the real identity behind that masked magic-born was surprising in itself, but Milim’s behavior was unfathomable. Unthinkable. Beyond the realms of imagination. The thought of a demon lord befriending some random magic-born off the street was the height of recklessness. It did nothing but confuse him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran didn’t mind this. She was a regular person, and she long ago concluded there was simply no comprehending the thoughts of a demon lord. There</span> <em>were</em> <span class="merge__be">a couple of things…okay,</span> <em>many</em> <span class="merge__be">things about that demon lord’s behavior that gave her pause, to be honest. But it wasn’t her job to figure out what made them tick.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So she just reported everything she saw to Clayman and gave him the unvarnished truth. He rewarded her with a broad smile. “I see,” he said. “This could prove useful. A very fascinating story, indeed.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">It came as a relief to hear. Mjurran was glad her master was pleased,</span> <span class="merge__be">but above that, she had provided him with her ace in the hole—a crystal ball, the most important magic item there was. The information it contained documented the entire battle between Charybdis and this mystery magic-born, as well as a quick sample of Milim’s own strengths. It was a priceless asset, one that elated Clayman.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">Not even this, however, was enough to make Mjurran a free woman. She needed to put in an even better performance or else Clayman would remain unsatisfied. She might not have been that useful to him, but she knew full well that Clayman was not the kind of man to let an upper-level magic-born go unchecked.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="r">But it was still a major achievement. One that successfully earned her a decent amount of trust. And being granted a solo mission was perfectly suited to Mjurran, too. If she wanted to escape Clayman, any chance to prepare away from his prying eyes was perfect. And with the demon lord’s authority on her side, she had the ability to do what she wanted without checking in with him.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Back at the monster town, Mjurran continued her surveillance.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">During the demon lord Milim’s stay, she had not once engaged in magical conversation with Clayman. She hadn’t used any magic at all in the region—in fact, she’d snuck into the town while holding her breath and restraining her aura as much as possible. For much the same reason, Clayman had not contacted her. Mjurran couldn’t have asked for much more.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Milim was aware of his presence now. True, she had to be more careful than ever. Fully realizing it might already be for naught, she made every effort to stay alert during her duties. Perhaps thanks to that, nobody else had noticed her.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">After a while, Milim left the monster town. What could she be doing now, and where? That went beyond Mjurran’s orders to observe the magic-born and his people. There was no need to worry about it. Now Mjurran figured she could rest a bit, as much as her continued alertness made her hesitate. She kept observing quietly—and to achieve this, she decided to take advantage of a group of humans who were now regular visitors to the town.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">………</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">……</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was now several months since Mjurran had given her report to the demon lord Clayman. She had been active that whole time, but Clayman had never contacted her. She’d given a report when Milim left town, but his only reply was to carry on with her mission.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">She could tell his interest in her was dwindling, and she decided some brash action was called for. She was here to gather intelligence, so she thought of ways she might be able to enter town. It was that group of humans who caught her eye first.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Slowly, carefully, Mjurran gathered her information. It told her this was an armed group that engaged in business within the monster town—a group that Rimuru, that mystery magic-born, was attempting to prop up as champions of mankind. Infiltrating this group would be the perfect approach, she thought. It’d let her enter town freely and with the perfect alibi.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So she put together a plan of action. As a former human, pretending to be non-magical was child’s play for her. Right now, she was beholden to Clayman for everything, but if it meant her freedom, she was ready to do virtually anything. If something could be exploited, exploit the hell out of it—such was her way of thinking. An approach that probably rubbed off on her from Clayman, as loath as she was to admit it.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Before long, she was off to the Kingdom of Farmus, the reported destination of the human party. “My,” she said with a sigh, “human towns have certainly</span> <em>advanced</em> <span class="merge__be">as of late.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran had last been a human being several centuries ago. The only towns to speak of at the time were the capitals of kingdoms, where all the royalty lived. Beyond that, you had a few villages larger than the norm, and that was it. There simply hadn’t been a lot of humans around—not as many as now.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She stayed out of sight by habit as she walked around town, in search of a certain location—the local Free Guild branch, in this territory ruled by Nidol Migam, Earl of Migam. She found it just as the sun was about to dip under the horizon. Opening the door, she saw it was crawling with ruffians of all shapes and sizes. Thickly accented voices attempting to negotiate with the front-office brokers, voices yelling at one another in hopes of raising the sale price of their goods, happier voices bragging about the lofty achievements they scored today… The din almost made her feel dizzy, but she tried to tune it out, not wanting to use her magic for it.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then Mjurran heard someone whistling at her. One of the ruffians, no doubt, sniffing out the fragrance she typically wore to mask the smell of blood.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hey, look! She’s a real beauty, eh?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Now</span> <em>this</em> <span class="merge__be">is a find. What’s a lovely lady like you doin’ in a place like this, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“See this creature I bagged today? I’m gonna sell it in a bit, so how ’bout you join me at the bar and we’ll drink on the profits, eh?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>…Ugh, what a pain</em><span class="bs">, Mjurran thought as she wrinkled her nose. It was beyond her why she was such a target of attention around here. Thanks to living her life in seclusion, avoiding the company of others and focusing solely on her magic research, she was wholly indifferent to her outside appearance. But between the green-tinged silver hair, the blue eyes, and the calm demeanor, the consensus was clear: This was one beautiful woman. A beautiful woman who had just stepped into a Guild branch office packed with people just</span> <em>barely</em> <span class="bs">on the right side of the law. In the evening hours, no less. The furor was only to be expected.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“So? How ’bout it, eh?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Sorry,” she bluntly stated, “I’ve got some business to do.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Aw, don’t be like that,” the man countered. “Just come here ’n’ join me for a bit!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Lay off me, won’t you? I told you—I’ve got business.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">For a magic-born, Mjurran was more convivial with other people than most. But not even she was magnanimous enough to let a total stranger act like her best friend out of nowhere.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Lay off? Hell, you just walk right in here ’n’ think you’re better than all of us?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ahh, quit it, Isaak. You want the guild master to yell at ya again? This ain’t a tavern. Maybe she’s got a job for the Guild, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Pfft. Yeah, yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The man called Isaak took a step back, his eyes still squarely upon Mjurran. She nodded her thanks to the man who had stopped him, then made a beeline for the service window.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I’d like to register, please.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Registration? Will that be for a general-purpose member account, then?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“No. As an adventurer. Umm…” Mjurran paused for a moment, thinking about which department to join—retrieval, exploration, or monster slaying. Then she remembered how she used to make a regular habit of picking and preparing medicinal herbs. “…The retrieval department, please.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Retrieval… All right. There’s a test required, so are you ready to take it?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I am. What do I have to do?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well, please fill this out for us first.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran did so, offering all the information needed for the Guild to provide her identification papers. Then Isaak decided to try his luck again.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Whoa, whoa, a woman filing to become an adventurer? Like,</span> <span class="v">you aren’t by yourself, lady, are ya? I could help with the exam if you</span> <span class="merge__be">like.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He was grinning the whole time, but the question’s real purpose was more to intimidate the rest of the adventurers in the room than anything. Even if Mjurran decided to hire some bodyguards, it’d be harder for anyone else to accept the invite now that Isaak’s hat was in the ring. Doing so would instantly make Isaak your enemy, after all, and despite his attitude, Isaak had a pretty serious rep around this Guild.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">In terms of pure strength, he was on the lower end of the C rank, but that still put him near the top of the membership roll in this rural branch. Anyone with</span> <em>real</em> <span class="merge__be">talent for this line of work usually set up shop in the larger cities, only traveling to the hinterlands if work demanded it. This, unfortunately, gave Isaak something of a mistaken impression of himself. He thought he was one of the big men around the village, and that meant nobody was allowed to defy him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Oh, please. I don’t feel like getting involved with these yokels. Should I just kill him, maybe?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Ending his life here would cause serious problems, but killing him covertly wouldn’t warn the others to stay away from her. Mjurran saw no merit in voluntarily becoming a murder suspect. But what to do, then?</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hmm. I think it’d be faster if I showed off some of my skills to you.” She turned back to the Guild agent, her voice calm and composed. “Hey—I changed my mind. Instead of retrieval, I’ll join the monster-slaying department. I can take</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">exam on-site, can’t I?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The agent nodded.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">A little while later:</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hee-hee! This here’s the inn, lady!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Isaak was scared so straight by the carnage Mjurran released that—without her asking—he became her underling.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">A few days later, Mjurran was already part of the regular Guild crew, taking on work and living nearby—just as she had planned it. Yohm’s team, the armed group she was targeting, would be here soon. She was waiting for them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Isaak, for his part, was proving to be a surprisingly devoted henchman, unwittingly helping her gather more intelligence. He was used to showing people around town, which helped Mjurran catch up on customers much more quickly than otherwise. He also happened to know a great deal about Yohm and his team, which was an unexpected bonus.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Good thing I didn’t kill him after all</em><span class="merge__be">, she mused as Isaak came to her with some pressing news.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“They’re here, lady!”</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Now it was time to proceed with her plan.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The scheme Mjurran devised was fairly simple.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She had asked Franz, master of the local Free Guild branch, to introduce her to Yohm. Her work performance over the past few days was already enough to make rumors about her skill spread far and wide. Franz himself was a catalyst for this, given that he served as Mjurran’s test manager. At this point, nobody involved with the Guild was unfamiliar with her name any longer.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I wish you’d stay with this branch permanently,” Franz even offered her. But that wasn’t part of her plans. All she wanted were those ID papers.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I’m a pretty handy woman when it comes to magic, you know, so if this man is a true champion of the land, I would love the opportunity to serve him. I hear Sir Yohm has few magic-users among his team.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah, that’s a pity to hear. Still, you in Yohm’s party would help us out enormously, if indirectly. Very well. Rest assured that I will give you a glowing recommendation.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Things seemed pretty well set in motion, then. Or so Mjurran thought.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Now she was holding her head in her hands.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Why did it turn out like this?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The introduction had gone well enough, at least.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Huh? I already got a sorcerer and mysticist in Rommel and Jagi. What can some girl do for us beyond that? I’m fine, thanks!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This out-of-hand denial riled Mjurran.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hmm. In that case, let me show you what an angry wizard can do.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">And she did. She, in so many words, beat the crap out of Yohm. This got her on the team, and for some reason, they were treating her as the number-two of the crew, a military adviser with the power to guide their direction, second only to Yohm himself. This put her up there with Yohm’s aide-de-camp, Kazhil, and staff officer, Rommel.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Ugh. I was hoping I could just pose as a shamaness and keep a lower profile in this group…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Maybe, Mjurran ruefully admitted to herself, she had a much shorter temper than she thought.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">The day taught Yohm a lesson he had almost forgotten: Never judge a book by its cover.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">They were in a largely deserted wood outside town. The only witnesses were Franz, who had introduced this woman Mjurran to him, and Isaak, a local petty adventurer.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Yohm sniffed at her. There was no way he could ever let a woman defeat him. A few of his men had joined his side, concerned and overprotective, but they were just silently watching for now.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He saw no reason why he couldn’t handle this fight by himself. After all, he was wearing the Exo-Armor Rimuru gave him, the best protection anyone could ask for. It brimmed with enough magic resistance to neutralize pretty much any threat he might come across.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Ha! I have nothing to worry about with conjurers like her. Just dash forward, close the distance, and cut her down!</em></p>

<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was a tactic that served Yohm well. No magic-user had ever given him much of a headache up to now.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I would like three of you to take me on at once,” the woman called Mjurran declared. “In fact, you can all descend upon me simultaneously.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This offer immediately made Yohm lose his self-control.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Don’t give me that nonsense, lady! Rommel, Jagi, don’t bother going easy on her. We got potions to spare anyway. Give ’er all you’ve got!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">They both prepared to follow his order—Rommel less than enthusiastic about it all, Jagi cool as a cucumber.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was three-on-one when Franz gave the signal to begin. No sane witness could have imagined any possible scenario where they’d lose. The moment the signal came, Yohm was immediately bathed in strengthening magic from Rommel and support magic from Jagi, both enough to make him physically feel his muscles expand to their limits. Supremely confident, he rushed toward his target—and right into a pitfall trap.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ah?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Right in front of Mjurran, just as he planted a foot down to land a lethal blow upon her, that foot fell through the ground.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Aspectual magic: Earth Lock,” came the quiet voice as Yohm floundered. Normally, this magic was used to help the caster gain surer footing—but when used on a target trapped in a pit, it made the walls literally close in. Just as the battle started, Yohm was out of the contest.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“How on…?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I’ve never</span> <em>seen</em> <span class="merge__be">such simple magic used in such a devious way!” marveled Rommel. One couldn’t blame him. Mjurran had used two magic spells, one to soften and muddy the ground enough to build a pitfall and a much simpler one to solidify it again. No matter how resistant to magic Yohm’s equipment was, it couldn’t do much about the ground caving in on him. It was a breathtakingly straightforward tactic, one crafted with a clear understanding of how Yohm would strike.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The two witnesses were stupefied but not enough to miss their enemy’s next few words.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ailment: Silence.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“—?!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“—!!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">That was the finisher.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What a pitiful show.” Mjurran groaned. “Neither of you prepared any defense against ailment magic? How are you going to handle magical opponents</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">way…?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She hadn’t even needed three minutes to claim victory. It all but forced Yohm to accept that she was a force to be reckoned with.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">They were all at the local tavern that night, holding a small celebration to commemorate Mjurran’s induction into the group.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yahhh-ha-ha-ha-ha! You’re a strong woman, you are,” Kazhil managed to work in between his laughter. “Sure wasn’t expecting the boss to get trounced like that!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ahhh, shut it, Kazhil. I just didn’t think it’d be so</span> <em>easy</em><span class="merge__be">. Is that normally how magicians go at it, Jagi?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, no, boss, that’s just crazy! You’ll never find a wizard who</span> <em>wouldn’t</em> <span class="merge__be">flinch at the sight of a skillful warrior’s sword thundering their way. You need to define a point to dig a hole at, too, so you gotta have enough courage to stand right by it to serve as the bait. I don’t think either I or anyone else would try something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“He’s right, Yohm. She must’ve planned out that whole bait job in advance. I guess Mjurran was right—sooner or later, we would’ve met our doom in a clash of magic.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The conclusion made Yohm realize all over again how lacking their team was.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Pfft. True enough. I can brag all day about how invincible I am, but it don’t mean a thing without results. We took you on three against one, and we still lost; I’ll admit that to ya. So, you know, I’m sorry to bother you about this, but I hope you can teach us how to fend for ourselves against magic-wielding foes.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Indeed,” Rommel added, “they never taught us how to fight like</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">at the magic academy. We did learn about taking advantage of the terrain in my legion-magic classes, but…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…Well, I could help you a tad, perhaps…?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, wonderful! I’ve just</span> <em>got</em> <span class="merge__be">to broaden my knowledge a little. Better learn how to use my skills more effectively!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“I’m in on this, too, yeah,” said Jagi.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Certainly, certainly. But just a little, all right?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yeah,” Yohm interjected. “Thanks a lot for puttin’ up with us.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It felt a little shameless to him, asking Mjurran for help. But it nonetheless meant that she was part of the team now—a trusted adviser, no less.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Mjurran was starting to suspect she was a bit of an easy mark. She had infiltrated Yohm’s team in order to more fully investigate the nation of monsters in the forest, which was fine, but now she was some kind of senior official among them.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>These people are so stupid. They don’t suspect for a moment I’m magic-born.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="bs">She looked down on them for that, but there was still a faint smile on her lips. Interacting with these kinds of people for the first time in quite a while was oddly exhilarating. She wanted this to continue, whether she consciously thought it or not; she wanted to enjoy this state of affairs for just a little while longer.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Then, an innocent look on her face, she went back to her usual work.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Once she’d joined Yohm’s team, Mjurran’s days suddenly became packed.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">She was responsible for giving tactical advice to the party, providing in-the-field guidance on working together to fend off monsters and magical attacks. She had inadvertently admitted to them that she was a wizard, but there was no point regretting that after the fact. She couldn’t take back the words, so she resigned herself to their consequences, offering her teachings to Rommel, Jagi, and everyone else in the party at least somewhat familiar with magic.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Tactical advice was enough of a workload; magic only added to it. Simple curses were easy enough to teach others about. She</span> <em>was</em> <span class="merge__be">a witch, so talking about the kinds of magic available to humankind was child’s play for her. Higher-level magic, on the other hand, was a far different story. Some of it could be conjured only by magic-born. Blithely imparting</span> <em>everything</em> <span class="merge__be">she knew could cause serious problems for her later.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">So what were humans capable of? Where did the boundary lie between what they could and couldn’t handle, magic-wise? She needed to know that before anything.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>This is</em> <span class="merge__be">such</span> <em>a pain. Why did it turn out like this…?</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She could whine about it all she wanted, but she knew full well that she had done this to herself.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">As military adviser, she had one other important role: casting the deciding vote on the party’s actions. This was its own barrel of monkeys, one that required far more work than she’d anticipated.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="t">Whenever regular reports came in via the communication crys</span><span class="bs">tals installed in each village, the team’s main officers would congregate and work out their future direction. Mjurran was among them, but something about these meetings—likely the lack of intelligence among the men, she guessed—made them drag on forever without any resolution. It sorely tried her patience. They passed out these</span> <span class="y">incredibly valuable magic items to all these settlements, and now</span> <span class="bs">they were wasting time quibbling over the silliest things thanks to them? She spoke up about all this waste, and once again, she sealed her own fate with it.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Now she was giving orders to each individual platoon, making arrangements for them and reporting directly to Yohm about them. It was all her. She didn’t understand why they were giving so much responsibility to someone brand-new to the squad, but given the lack of other qualified candidates, it was like they had just been waiting to spring all this on someone like her.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The only real decent-minded person among them was Rommel.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="y">“Man, Mjurran, I don’t know what we could’ve done without you!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Receiving such heartfelt thanks made it tough for Mjurran to disappoint him.</span> <em>Imagine</em><span class="merge__be">, she thought,</span> <em>trusting a magic-born like me… I can’t believe what a pushover I am!</em> <span class="merge__be">But she never said it.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He had apparently been hired right from the magic academy by the local earl, who had tapped him to serve as his personal conjurer. He had essentially no battle experience, making it hard for him to be decisive on many matters. Until Mjurran came along, every day was a long trial-and-error process for him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Rommel</span> <em>did</em> <span class="merge__be">seem to have a good head on his shoulders, though. She could practically feel him maturing as she taught him. For now, her main mission was to get Rommel up to snuff as quickly as possible so he could take her place for a change.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">Once they decided on a plan of action, the team had to carry it out. They went around the villages in their territory, in order of priority, and dispatched the monsters that appeared. It was her job to juggle the adventurers stationed in each area and keep the whole operation purring.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Why do I even have to do this? This is ridiculous…</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">She thought she had a legitimate complaint, but as long as she had that mission to infiltrate the monsters’ country, she couldn’t quit in a huff yet. The whole plan was starting to seem like a failure, but she couldn’t bail on it now.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Through it all, days passed on as Mjurran firmed up her position on Yohm’s team. Defeating monsters, saving villages…</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>…This is wrong. It’s got to stop somewhere.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">But even as she whined to herself about it, she also felt oddly fulfilled. Dealing with people for the first time in ages, recalling emotions she thought she’d forgotten about. And then, finally, mercifully, the group found the opportunity to head back to Tempest.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">The magic-born Gruecith was joining them as a guest in their battle training.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Argh… Boy, that old coot sure isn’t letting up today, either!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“G-Gobta… Is that demon, er, is Sir Hakuro like this every time…?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It astonished Gruecith, covered in welts and bruises from head to toe. Gobta, his hobgoblin companion, didn’t look much better.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, you bet he is. No joking!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gobta wouldn’t dare say that in front of the teacher himself. Gruecith firmly agreed, but he bit his tongue so as not to sound ungrateful. It saved the day for him.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ohhh? By ‘old coot,’ you wouldn’t happen to be referring to me, would you?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Gahhh!! M-Master, why are you—?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Silence, you insolent oaf! It’ll plainly be at</span> <em>least</em> <span class="merge__be">a hundred years before I let you call yourself a disciple of mine!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">They’d both thought he was gone, but there he was, completely concealing his presence until the last minute. His wooden practice sword swung down, faster than Gruecith could follow with his eyes, and smacked right against the crown of Gobta’s head. He was out cold in an instant, eyeballs lolling around the backs of their sockets. Gruecith watched piteously as Hakuro then dragged him off, no doubt for yet more “instruction.” All he could do was pray for his friend’s safety.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">He was here in Tempest on orders from Phobio, one of the Three Lycanthropeers, to live in this nation and observe its people. Rimuru, its leader, was away from the land for the moment, but he had already given his full permission for Gruecith to be there. It was hard for him to believe the leader of Tempest was traveling the world solo, but none of his subjects had any objection to it, so he did not press for an explanation.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Right now, his priorities were pointed more toward using this opportunity to gain as much knowledge and experience as he possibly could. Along those lines, he was joining in every training session Hakuro offered him. This was per the invitation of Yohm, the first human friend he’d ever had; Gruecith hadn’t expected it to be so grueling at the time, but</span> <em>this</em> <span class="merge__be">session was different. The training Hakuro gave when only native Tempestians were in attendance was like nothing he had seen from him before.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>This is incredible</em><span class="merge__be">, he marveled.</span> <em>He was going easy up to now just so Yohm and the humans wouldn’t be ripped apart!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Yohm’s training involved a rundown of the basics with a bit of skill training mixed in, but the session they just wrapped up was almost all core foundational stuff. “Don’t expect me to teach any Arts to a bunch of weak-hearted sissies like you!” Hakuro bellowed as he bashed his pupils to bits with his practice sword in battle (Gruecith included). “You’ll have to seize them from me by force! Watch with your eyes, and stake your very lives upon learning them yourselves!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gruecith was at least somewhat confident in his skills when he’d joined in. Now, he wasn’t. The results were clear as day. Hakuro closed the distance between them in an eyeblink, slashing away faster than he could follow. Hence all the bruises on his body.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>I might’ve died if that sword wasn’t wooden… And how could a wooden sword be so damaging to me, even?!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He was a lycanthrope and therefore gifted with natural healing abilities, but dull pain radiated from everywhere he took a blow. It was some unknown-to-him Art, perhaps, that drilled into him and made the damage cut deeper.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">They had put it in different ways, but Gruecith and Gobta agreed: Hakuro was a demon beyond all comprehension.</span> <em>Maybe</em> <span class="merge__be">he could have survived against him for a few moments longer than the other hobgoblins. Now, though, all confidence he had in his own strength was shot.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gruecith had taken an interest in the creatures who served under Gobta, the hobgoblins who rode the starwolves—themselves a rare evolution to see. They were called goblin riders, and they were responsible for security around town. Hakuro trained them, focusing primarily on team-oriented strategy, and they functioned as a single cohesive unit—well honed, well practiced, and moving flawlessly.</span> <em>If I had to tangle with them</em><span class="merge__be">, he thought,</span> <em>five would likely be the most I could handle.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He hoped to invite them to the Beast Kingdom someday, as impossible as he imagined that was. Judging by the residents around town, he knew there was almost no chance they would leave their posts.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">The land of Tempest was filled with warriors whose hardiness went far beyond Gruecith’s imagination. He might have been complaining about it the whole time, but Gobta, his partner in training, was keeping up with every step Hakuro the ogre mage took. That in itself made him formidable. And he was hardly alone. Rigur, head of the security patrol, was even stronger than Gobta. The dragonewts Gruecith occasionally caught sight of seemed just as daunting to him. He had spotted several powered-up high orcs among the ones who served as Tempest’s combat engineers. One among them, named Geld, even looked and acted every bit like a reincarnation of an orc lord. Taking</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">guy on, Gruecith gave himself a fifty-fifty chance. It was his battle to lose.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Last but not least came the ogre mages. Approach one, and their strength was obvious. In his own mind, Gruecith figured he could defeat Kurobe the blacksmith and Shuna, that fetching young lass. Beyond that, he had no confidence at all. The other four ogre mages, his instincts told him, he couldn’t even scratch.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gruecith might have been on the low end of the Beast Master’s Warrior Alliance totem pole, but even he could tell there was something unnatural about this. His instincts on that score—judging by the thrashing Hakuro just gave him—were right.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>What in the hell? This entire town is sheer madness! I mean, they could even take on my homeland in battle, couldn’t they?!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He had to breathe a sigh of relief. His master, the demon lord Carillon, was absolutely right not to challenge Tempest to war.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="merge__be">Yohm’s team returned to town a few days later.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Hey. Doing well?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gruecith smiled back at Yohm. “I am. Glad to see you are, too.” But what struck his interest the most was the beautiful woman among them. “So, who is that?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh? I didn’t think magic-born like you cared about women.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Don’t be stupid! All magic-born aren’t the same, you know. Lycanthropes like us are closer to demi-humans than full-on magic-born. It’s not uncommon for some of us to mate with humans and produce offspring, too.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Really, now? Well, here’s a word of advice for you: Don’t you dare cross that woman. I did, and lemme tell ya, I paid dearly for it.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What? Of all the ridiculous things to say…!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">This threw Gruecith. Yohm the champion, defeated by a woman who couldn’t look more out of place on a battlefield? It was a difficult story to swallow.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Would</span> <em>you</em> <span class="merge__be">like to try your luck, then?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Ha! I like that! No point trying too hard for this one. Let me at her!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gruecith’s behavior was fairly easy to predict. A challenge like</span> <em>that</em><span class="merge__be">, he’d never turn down.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">So they traveled to the usual training ground, and Yohm brought with him the woman—his new military adviser, apparently.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Why do I have to go through with this charade?” she asked, looking seriously reluctant.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, it’s nothing big, Mjurran. I just want you to show this guy how strong you are.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Yes, and I told you, I don’t see why I have to.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“There’s a good reason for it! He’s already put you down. I</span> <em>hate</em> <span class="merge__be">it when people put my team down!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gruecith gave Yohm an exasperated look as he sized up the woman.</span> <em>Hmm. Mjurran’s her name? She sure is a sight to see. But why’s that bastard Yohm trying to trick me?</em> <span class="merge__be">There was a kind, gentle air about her.</span> <em>Strong</em> <span class="merge__be">wouldn’t describe it at all. He couldn’t believe the thought of her defeating Yohm.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">After a few more pleas to his cohort, Yohm at last turned toward Gruecith and smiled.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Heh-heh! I finally convinced her. Gruecith, if you can beat this lady, I promise I’ll serve as your lackey forever. But if she beats you…you’ll have to be my gofer!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“What?! What kind of nonsense are you spouting</span> <em>now</em><span class="merge__be">?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Oh, don’t like your chances?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“…You think so? Well, you’re on. You’re gonna be the one calling</span> <em>me</em> <span class="merge__be">‘boss’ in a few moments!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">He accepted the bait all too quickly.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Listen,” interrupted Mjurran, “you’re probably looking down on me because I’m a woman, aren’t you? It feels ridiculous being the subject of a bet like this, but I’ll be happy to spar with you. But let me warn you: I’m a wizard, so I hope you’ll fight me appropriately!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“A wizard, eh? You sure you should be giving me so many details before combat even begins? Of course, with</span> <em>that</em> <span class="merge__be">getup, it’s pretty easy to picture you as a conjurer.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">The term</span> <em>wizard</em> <span class="merge__be">referred to those adept in at least three different systems of magic. It implied talent in these dark arts far greater than your run-of-the-mill sorcerer or mysticist. The magic they wielded was as diverse as it was powerful—several times more so, it was said, than the attack magic of a typical conjurer. What Mjurran had just said, in effect, was that she was a well-seasoned, battle-tested magic expert.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gruecith got the hint—and it made him respect her more. But he still didn’t take any special precautions. A higher-level magic-born like him had intrinsic magic resistance, and as long as limbs weren’t flying off him, his Self-Regeneration skill could heal most wounds. Anything short of lethal magic could be safely ignored.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Plus</em><span class="merge__be">, he thought,</span> <em>if she can cast magic powerful enough to kill me in one stroke, she’ll need a vast amount of time to chant the spell. Conjurers like her leave themselves wide open—I can just finish her off then.</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">It was the exact same thought process Yohm had gone through back in the day. The results were similarly predictable.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">………</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">……</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">…</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Baaahhh-ha-ha-ha-ha! Woudja look at that!”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">Gruecith found himself bitterly looking upward as Yohm held his stomach and laughed for a good long while.</span></p>
<p class="m"><em>Damn it…!! How’s this even happening?!</em></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">His cheeks were red with embarrassment, not half because he was buried up to chest level in the ground. It took a lot to keep from crying.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="merge__be">“I know I probably should have begun with this,” he told Mjurran a bit later, “but my name is Gruecith. Perhaps it did not show very much earlier, but I am a lycanthrope and upper-level magic-born. And by that, I don’t intend to suggest I could have won if I transformed, let me assure you.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">They exchanged a few pleasantries with each other—pleasantries filled with sarcasm and excuses, although it would’ve sounded innocent enough to the impartial observer.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Well, you two keep gettin’ along, all right? So, Gruecith, about the promise earlier?”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Mm? Ah. Right. Yohm, from now on, I promise I will call you ‘boss.’ The demon lord Carillon is the only master I will ever truly devote myself to, but I see no reason not to show respect to someone I view as above me.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You sure about that? ’Cause I really meant it more as a joke to motivate you than anything…”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“It’s fine; it’s fine. But if I may be honest, if Lord Carillon ordered me to kill you, I would not hesitate for a single moment. My apologies, but that is how the rules operate between us.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“Fair enough. I’ll try to keep that in mind.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">At least Gruecith was honest as he lived up to his end of Yohm’s bet. He had to appreciate the lycanthrope’s devotion to his promises.</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“In that case, I’m going to join your band as well. I’m pretty used to things around town by now, and I’d like to see some other human nations while I’m at it.”</span></p>
<p class="m"><span class="merge__be">“You sure ’bout that?”</span></p>
