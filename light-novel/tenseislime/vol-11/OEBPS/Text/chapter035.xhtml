<p>Getting beaten up in such a one-sided fashion would normally be unthinkable, especially when teaming up with Shion against a single foe. But one look at this scene, and it was obvious just how dangerous Razul was.</p>
<p>Shion took a step forward, covering for Ranga.</p>
<p>“Ranga, you can sit this one out.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous, Shion. He is strong. If we work together, and this is the result, going it alone is hazardous.”</p>
<p>“It’s all right, Ranga. I think I’m grasping him a little now. I want you to stay there and build up your strength until I give the signal.”</p>
<p>With that, she readied her sword in front of her, not waiting for a response. It was a beautiful stance, her core oriented straight toward her foe.</p>
<p>“Impressive. None of the demons could trade blows like this with me.”</p>
<p>Razul seemed astonished. But compliments from someone without a scratch on him did nothing but humiliate Shion.</p>
<p>“Silence. I’m gonna rip that cockiness out of you with my bare hands!”</p>
<p>With that shout, Shion went on the move, holding her sword up high and swinging it down like the demigod-like ogre she was. It seemed like a slapdash move at first glance, but it was performed with a flawless, flowing stroke. But Razul didn’t flinch. A sharp sound reverberated as the exoskeleton that protected him deflected the blow. As an insectoid, Razul was covered from head to toe with armor harder than steel, giving him matchless strength without extra weapons or armor. Even all the magic Ranga lobbed at him <a id="page-328"/>harmlessly bounced off the surface—the exoskeleton generated some kind of special force field that nothing worked against.</p>
<p>Parrying Shion’s attack with his left arm, Razul used his momentum to throw a punch powerful enough to crush rock. A regular human being would be torn limb from limb. Shion, before now, wouldn’t have thought twice about taking the blow—in her mind, either she’d withstand it or die, one of the two.</p>
<p>Now, though, Shion was more mature. Perhaps instructing others had in turn taught her how to keep an eye on the big picture. If she died here, it’d put her whole side at a disadvantage. Even if she couldn’t win this, if she could stretch this out long enough, someone was certain to help her. She could believe that now, so instead of blindly seeking victory, Shion’s focus had shifted more toward survival.</p>
<p>She also had good reason to give Ranga some rest. If she forced him right now, he might be too tired to move later—so she resolved to bear the full brunt of this, while she was still able.</p>
<p>Of course, that wasn’t the only reason.</p>
<p><em>Hee-hee… Now to earn my victory and win Sir Rimuru’s praise!</em></p>
<p>On the inside, she was defiant enough to entertain the thought. Survival came first, but she wasn’t giving up on victory, either.</p>
<p>This growth on Shion’s part had given her more mental leeway to work with. This leeway, in turn, was accelerating the blooming of her still-untapped talents. Now, her whole way of fighting had changed. She was faithful to Hakuro’s teachings, relying more on skill than brute force—and in battle with Razul, she was polishing that even further. That explained the beautiful, traditional moves she exhibited now, like a master sword fighter—real technical skill, in addition to her irrational violence.</p>
<p>The results…</p>
<p>A shock wave of force shot out from Shion’s sword as she hammered it down, leaping at Razul. It was little more than a smoke screen to him, of course, but with that moment’s distraction, Shion closed the distance between them. With a flowing movement, she unleashed her attack. Razul parried it again, but he could feel <a id="page-329"/>his arms starting to go numb. Shion’s skill had just ratcheted up, somehow—even in the middle of battle, she was constantly growing.</p>
<p><em>Not yet! I’m not done yet…!!</em></p>
<p>That strike just now had the effects of her unique skill Master Chef attached to it. She had come upon the idea of using Guarantee Results to crack his thick exoskeleton. She got deflected, again and again, but she didn’t give up, smashing her great sword down on the same spot, thinking about nothing but destroying that shell.</p>
<p>In effect, she was looking to bend the laws of nature themselves to crush the uncrushable. Razul was an overwhelming foe, but Shion persevered, sticking it out, never despairing if her abilities didn’t work, constantly believing her wish would come true as she kept attacking. Razul, meanwhile, quietly parried her attacks.</p>
<p>The battle continued along. Razul didn’t panic, showing machinelike accuracy as he dealt with Shion. Shion, meanwhile, was exercising her full force, even deploying her Ogre Berserker skill to strike with power beyond her limits. But even with that, this seemed like little more than a preliminary trial to Razul. The strength difference was just too much—Shion had to exhaust everything she had just to keep her head above water.</p>
<p>Razul’s movements were like a gently flowing river—but suddenly, a mighty rain made that river overtop its banks. Thanks to constantly tapping her skills, Shion’s spiritual force was at its limit. Should she lose her balance, the fallout would likely spell her defeat. And that wasn’t all. With Ranga out of the battle, Razul had a bead on every move Shion made. After carefully probing her, he concluded that there was nothing left her for to bring out.</p>
<p>The next moment, Razul’s aura ballooned. With ferocious force, he began an all-out attack on Shion, using at least twice as much force as before as he rained a flurry of blows upon her. A moment ago, Razul was a statue facing the torrent of Shion; now the opposite was true.</p>
<p>“Your strength is real. You may be proud of it. But you cannot beat me. At best, you could scratch my outer shell, perhaps? Give up and surrender at once!”</p>
<p><a id="page-330"/>That was Razul’s final offer. But Shion was unaffected.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee! Laughable. Did you think I was just raging here without any plan? My wish is to ascend to the loftiest peaks. If I cannot venture beyond them, not only will that impertinent Diablo chide me, but I won’t be able to serve Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Slow on the uptake, insect? I mean that I will overpower you.”</p>
<p>Shion’s aura suddenly exploded out as she once again slashed at Razul with everything she had. Sword crossed against arm—and this time, too, Shion’s attack was deflected. However, Shion merely smiled.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee! Just as I hoped for.”</p>
<p>Standing back up, she faced Razul down once more.</p>
<p>“Ridiculous. Your attacks could never strike home.”</p>
<p>But Shion only snorted at him.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Shion recalled her own shallowness.</p>
<p>Power is a symbol of justice. As a monster, that was simple common sense, and the weak deserved nothing but to be exploited.</p>
<p>Born as an ogress, Shion was in the upper classes of the Forest of Jura. But at least one person worried for her—and that was her and Benimaru’s teacher, Hakuro. Shion had thoroughly tempered her body, which gave her a measure of maturity, but she still didn’t really understand the concept.</p>
<p>She didn’t ridicule Rimuru’s decree that monsters weren’t allowed to look down on other species, but part of her mind simply thought it didn’t apply to her. The weak are doomed to die—that was the natural order of things.</p>
<p>When she herself died, that was when Shion realized she had it wrong. One didn’t fear being killed because they were afraid of death—they were afraid they’d be gone without being able to help anyone else. And when Rimuru rescued her, the sense of relief she felt—this realization that she wasn’t forsaken, as if she had two parents protecting her—filled her heart to the brim.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-331"/>After their battle against the Crusaders as well, Rimuru lectured her, and she changed again. Back then, she couldn’t make herself all that angry against the humans she thought were her hated enemies. She questioned that, but Rimuru’s words cleared away her doubts. Not <em>all</em> of humanity was evil—there were bad guys but also good guys. It was her job to judge them properly.</p>
<p>A person’s value lies in the way they live. Strength, or weakness, didn’t mean anything. Someone who seemed useless now could someday awaken to their talents in one field or another. It was up to each person, and not someone else, to decide their own value. Rimuru was trying to say that, and Shion understood—and when she did, she realized just how foolish it was to envy others.</p>
<p>Comparing herself to Diablo, Shion knew she was inferior. In her mind, she feared that Rimuru might abandon her entirely. But she was wrong. Realizing that Rimuru would never forget her made all those worries go away—and in recent days, the ugly emotions that used to dominate her heart had disappeared.</p>
<p>There was no need to envy others—all you have to do is surpass them. Shion turned those senses toward herself. Instead of seeing people as her rivals, she began to find meaning in surmounting her own limits. That way, she believed, she could always grow and mature—and even if it was slow going, with her long life span, she could reach dimensions that those with more fleeting lives could never see.</p>
<p>Once Shion started thinking that way, all her anxieties vanished—and that change of heart encouraged her growth. And that indomitable spirit was now blossoming under extreme circumstances…</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Confirmed. The subject Shion’s intrinsic skill Ogre Berserker has evolved to the unique skill Divine Berserker.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">This was a happy accident, not something Shion aimed for—a miracle that occurred precisely because she kept struggling, never giving up on victory.</p>
<p><a id="page-332"/>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Let me tell you something—the goddess of victory always smiles upon those who never give up! Here we go—Divine Release!!”</p>
<p>Without a moment’s hesitation, Shion tapped into the freshly transformed unique skill Divine Berserker. Ogre Berserker had already used and abused her body; now every muscle screamed at the excessive burden. She used Ultraspeed Regeneration to shut them up.</p>
<p>The unique skill Divine Berserker was, in essence, an upgraded version of Ogre Berserker. It wasn’t a true berserker-type move, abandoning all reason and going into a murderous rage; instead, it simply boosted the user’s stamina and spiritual force. Like Benimaru’s Magic Burn, it was a bodily enhancement that granted her the essential force of a spiritual life-form. But it was no panacea. It had one major disadvantage. In Shion’s current state, her physical strength would be loaded on top of her spiritual body—but it consumed magicules at such a fast rate that she’d be running on empty in short order.</p>
<p>Thus, the moment she triggered Divine Berserker, she was already nearing her physical limits. Shion was in this to win it—she had to settle everything with the next strike.</p>
<p>“What…is that power…? It’s coming for me?!”</p>
<p>Under the influence of Divine Berserker, an eye-watering mystical force flowed out of every pore of Shion’s body. At the same time, it honed every one of her senses, letting her feel just how much power was surging within.</p>
<p>“Now, Ranga!”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Shion lifted Goriki-maru Version 2 high with both hands. A blast of Dark Lightning charged up by Ranga descended upon it. He had waited for the right moment to unleash it, and it was the most powerful force he was capable of right now. Ranga believed in Shion—even if that lightning damaged her, if that was her will, he wouldn’t hesitate to act.</p>
<p><a id="page-333"/>“You impudent…! My shell—”</p>
<p>Shion had no time for Razul’s words.</p>
<p>“Chaotic Fate!!”</p>
<p>Her will now had the power to alter the results of every type of natural phenomenon. She threw all of it into her lightning-infused sword, thrusting it downward from on high…</p>
<p class="space-break1">Razul’s exoskeleton had blocked every attack from Shion. On his left arm, there was but a single scratch. However, that was all Shion needed. If something had worked before, even a little, she could utilize Optimal Action on it. Combining that with Guarantee Results to guide her hand was the true worth of her Master Chef unique skill.</p>
<p class="space-break1">…With a flash, the broken blade flew into the air. Shion’s sword had finally been smashed into two pieces. But it was Razul who fell. His left arm was severed, a large gash cleaved open from the tip of his shoulder down the center of his body. The ruinous lightning that slammed its way through promptly fried all his major organs.</p>
<p>Now the battle was over.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Razul crumpled into a heap. He understood he would die soon. His eyes swiveled up to Granville, still fighting against Luminus.</p>
<p><em>Forgive me, Gren… I’m taking my leave before you. We will meet again, at that promised land…</em></p>
<p>The light faded from those eyes as his life functions failed him. Shion and Ranga had secured their victory.</p>

<p class="tx1">Seeing Rimuru apply the mask to Chronoa, Luminus all but hoped it would win the day for them. This was a risky wager. Once again, Luminus had bet everything on Rimuru, who had earned Chloe’s and Hinata’s trust.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Luminus had pretended not to know anything about him, but given everything Chloe and Hinata said about him in the past, she <a id="page-334"/>was worried. She only joined the last Walpurgis because she heard Rimuru would be there. Him becoming a demon lord wasn’t at all the story she heard. Even when discussing matters with Hinata, she continued to feign ignorance of the truth. But as Chloe’s story gradually inched closer to reality, she stopped having any doubt about it. That was why Luminus was never hostile to Rimuru from the start.</p>
<p>Still, recent events hadn’t turned out at all like how the Chloe and Hinata of the past put them. Things were starting to get inconsistent, and that scared Luminus to the core. The greater things started to diverge, the more it seemed like Chronoa, kept safe in the ark, wouldn’t be revived in the correct manner. Now that fear had come true—and unexpected events were occurring in a flurry.</p>
<p>Here, right before this musical concert she so looked forward to, her dutiful assistant Granville was turning traitor. To be exact, she knew he betrayed her well before now, but not even she expected him to march in here and so blatantly rebel against her.</p>
<p>Now Hinata was dead, Chronoa was revived, and Luminus’s best bet for dealing with these irregularities was Rimuru, whose continued survival was itself an irregularity. That was her decision, and just as she hoped, Rimuru was attempting an appeal to Chronoa’s soul.</p>
<p><em>That’s the same mask Chloe wore. There’s still hope!</em></p>
<p>Luminus internally cheered. But then Granville spoke up.</p>
<p>“You look pleased, Lady Luminus. Do you really believe that your beloved Chloe will come back?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Chronoa is a living destructive force, is she not? And without the ark to contain her, the only way to stop Chronoa is to call back Chloe’s soul. But do you really think that soul is slumbering within her?”</p>
<p>“Why do you know that?”</p>
<p>Luminus looked surprised for a moment. But come to think of it, Granville could have easily listened in on Chloe’s and her conversations over the years.</p>
<p>“…Oh. So that’s what you did…”</p>
<p><a id="page-335"/>“Yes, I’m sure it’s just as you imagined. There is no quicker and easier way to destroy this world. All I have to do is leave the matter to someone far stronger than I!”</p>
<p>Granville laughed, the madness readily visible in his dark, murky eyes.</p>
<p>“Silence! Don’t expect this to turn out how you want!”</p>
<p>“No? I suppose not. At every opportunity, this world has trampled over my wishes. And just now, my friend has passed away.”</p>
<p>It was only then that Luminus realized one of the battles was over. Rimuru’s officers had emerged triumphant. Razul was dead.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… Indeed, this world has been harsh to me.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care!” Luminus shot back, pushing him aside.</p>
<p>“…And that,” he quietly responded, “is why I hope this whole world is destroyed.”</p>
<p>“Enough with your nonsense. If you want to be hopeless, go do it by yourself!”</p>
<p>With that shout, she readied her beloved sword, named Nightrose after her original homeland. Granville responded in kind, turning toward Luminus and unsheathing Truth, his own blade from his Hero days. Both weapons were God class and boasting equal capabilities. And then:</p>
<p>“Hopeless? No, I am not hopeless. In fact, right now my heart is filled to the brim with hope!”</p>
<p>As he made the declaration, the energy being released from Razul’s body flowed its way into Granville’s. It was both his strength and his very soul. Now he had the powers of Maria, Razul, and himself pulsating within his body, creating a new hope for himself.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Confirmed. Conditions met. The unique skill Nefarious has evolved into the ultimate skill Sariel, Lord of Hope.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Granville, too, was reaching dizzying new heights in this battle—the ultimate peaks, mountaintops that only the chosen can reach.</p>
<p>The ultimate skill Sariel, Lord of Hope, much like Luminus’s Asmodeus, worked in terms of life or death. Now they were fully an even match.</p>
<p><a id="page-336"/>Standing there silently, Granville turned his dark, opaque eyes toward her.</p>
<p>“I am ready, Lady Luminus. It is time to break the cycle of fate and finish things.”</p>
<p>“…So it is. I will accept your resolve. And worry not—I promise that I will kill you!”</p>
<p>They faced each other. It was a battle between two people awoken to ultimate skills—but it ended in an instant. There was a single flash of crimson red, as Luminus’s Nightrose danced in the air. With a gloomy blue streak of flames, Granville’s Truth blade took the blow.</p>
<p>“Requiem for the Dead!!”</p>
<p>“Fortitude!!”</p>
<p>It was a head-on clash between Asmodeus and Sariel. Under matching conditions, whichever side had the stouter will would emerge victorious. Granville, the nefarious Hero, thus had no reason to lose—and yet, it was Luminus now standing.</p>

<p class="tx1">After putting the mask on Chronoa, I focused my consciousness and began diving into her spiritual realm. Not that I myself was doing this, of course; Raphael was handling all the controls for me.</p>
<p>I was expecting complete darkness, but it was actually pretty bright. There weren’t any light sources around; I was sure this was just an imaginary landscape. So I jiggled along, trying to mentally move myself forward, when I realized someone was walking alongside me.</p>
<p>“Hey there, slime. It’s been far too long. Or no, wait, it’s Satoru, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>It was Shizu. She was a nostalgic sight, but I felt a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Oh, stop,” I said, trying to joke about it. “My name’s fully Rimuru these days. I’m not abandoning my past, but it’s just awkward whenever I’m called that.”</p>
<p>It’s not that I wanted her to call me Rimuru. Absolutely not. No <a id="page-337"/>way. Still, though, having this imaginary landscape was kind of convenient. If you felt lonely, you could even have dead people drop in for a visit.</p>
<p>Shizu didn’t have a mask on. Her face was visible, all of her burns gone, and it made me realize all over again how pretty she was.</p>
<p>My own look was modeled after hers, of course, which often made people think I was this fetching young lady—and looking at her now, I guess I couldn’t blame them. As a former dude, I was still sorting my feelings out about it, but…</p>
<p class="space-break1">Having her here reassured me. I began to advance faster. She followed me, smiling.</p>
<p>Facing us up ahead was another pretty young girl. This was Chronoa, her eyes filled with hatred; she looked incredibly scary, like she was about to destroy the world. <em>First</em>, I thought, <em>we’re gonna have to talk this out</em>. Hoping she was willing to listen, I opened my mouth—but before I could:</p>
<p>“…Are you Rimuru? It’s…really you?”</p>
<p>…Well. <em>That</em> was unexpected. I was anticipating more of a, you know, hostile kind of thing.</p>
<p>“Uh, yep. The very one.”</p>
<p>I nodded, and then Chronoa embraced me—a young, ravishing woman hugging a slime. Yes, I <em>was</em> digging this, thanks for asking.</p>
<p>Shizu giggled a bit as she watched. “You really worked hard,” she said as she patted Chronoa on the head. “I wanted to see you too, Hero.”</p>
<p>Hmm… Was it really all right for this encounter to be so, like, heartwarming? I could still feel intense warfare going on outside, but right now, this was making me feel all warm and fuzzy.</p>
<p>“So um, you’re Chronoa?”</p>
<p>Looking at her, I was starting to think Chronoa was just Chloe grown up. They really <em>did</em> look alike.</p>
<p>“Yes. My name is Chronoa—an embodiment of corruption, shut inside Chloe. At the same time, I’m kind of her alternate self. If Hinata didn’t name me, though, I don’t think I would’ve had sentience like this.”</p>
