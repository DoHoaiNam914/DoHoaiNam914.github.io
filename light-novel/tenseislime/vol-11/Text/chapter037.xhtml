<p><a id="page-339"></a>Oh. I see. I had no idea what was going on, but I could tell there was a complicated backstory involved.</p>
<p>“All right. So what you’re trying to do…”</p>
<p>If she was intent on destroying the world, I’d have to stop her with everything I had. If this was Chloe’s alter ego, I needed to get Chloe in this scene and perform a bit of a switcheroo. That’s why I cut straight to the point.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I’ve had enough of that. You’re safe, after all.”</p>
<p>Chronoa was perfectly calm and casual, even though it kind of gave me the creeps. I had been through all kinds of tough scrapes by now, and I survived them all. If you wanted to put me in even <em>more</em> danger, I’d have to say no thank you to that.</p>
<p>“Well, sure. I’ve always been safe, so…”</p>
<p>“You say that, but you sacrificed yourself to save me!”</p>
<p>Now Chronoa raised her voice. Sacrificed? I wasn’t sure what set her off, but maybe I ought to just apologize.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! Sorry, sorry. I’ll be more careful next time.”</p>
<p>“Really? You promise?”</p>
<p>So I promised Chronoa I wouldn’t do anything reckless. I was totally lost here. It’s not like I was <em>trying</em> to be reckless.</p>
<p>…But hang on. If Chronoa had memories from the future, was she talking about something coming up for me?</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>…That possibility is likely.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Aw, man, <em>really</em>?! That sucks to hear… Or actually, maybe the other way around. I have to be <em>glad</em> I heard that. I swore not to pull any reckless moves, no matter what.</p>
<p>I waited a few moments for Chronoa to calm down before dropping the big question.</p>
<p>“So speaking of Chloe, do you know where she is right now?”</p>
<p>That—and was Hinata here, too? I was in a rush, but I wanted to proceed with caution. If I got on Chronoa’s bad side, I might cut off any chance at getting more info. But my worries were in vain.</p>
<p>“She went astray, into the Unlimited Imprisonment deep inside <a id="page-340"></a>my heart. I’m supposed to be the one locked in there, but two of the same being can’t exist at the same time, so we got swapped out.”</p>
<p>Judging by how forward she was, it looked like Chronoa cared a great deal about her. She seemed to see herself as a support for Chloe, the “main” personality, and I felt safe in believing that. So I moved on to the next question.</p>
<p>“And what about Hinata?”</p>
<p>“Hinata. Well…”</p>
<p>It was a shocking answer. She told me Hinata was already dead.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Luminus told me Hinata jumped back in time with you…”</p>
<p>So she should have been just fine…</p>
<p>“You have it all wrong, Rimuru. Hinata died right here. Granville’s attack can crush people’s souls as well. That’s why Chloe absorbed Hinata’s soul and jumped back into the past…but Hinata couldn’t withstand the time leap.”</p>
<p>Huh? No, but… I mean, Luminus and Hinata <em>had conversations</em>. Loads of them. And besides…</p>
<p>“…Wasn’t it Hinata who named you, Chronoa?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“So in that case…!”</p>
<p>“Hinata’s consciousness alone was stored in her unique skill—the remains of her soul. That’s why I could never take in her Measurer. If I did, her sense of self would completely vanish…”</p>
<p>The sadness behind her words showed me she was telling the truth. But hang on. Hinata’s consciousness stayed here because her skill was rooted in her soul. If you planted this skill back in Hinata’s body, wouldn’t that revive her?</p>
<p>“I understand what you mean, Rimuru. I—or Chloe—thought the same thing. But it just won’t work. Like I told you, the remains of Hinata’s soul are locked in the Unlimited Imprisonment, too. Everything in there is chaotically mixed together. I was born from that, so I hate to say this, but Hinata’s Measurer is probably already integrated with everything else…”</p>
<p>If you had a will and energy along the lines of Veldora, that’d be one thing. But while Hinata was a Saint, she was still human—and <a id="page-341"></a>as Chronoa saw it, the Unlimited Imprisonment was too much to withstand. We had Hinata’s physical body right here. If the soul was safe, we could revive her. And yet…</p>
<p>“No, it’s all right. Hinata’s a really strong woman, so I’m sure she hasn’t vanished yet. So let’s call for her together, okay?”</p>
<p>My spirits fell as Chronoa grieved for her. It was Shizu who tried to assuage us with a calm smile.</p>

<p class="tx1">My anxieties were now gone. We could grieve after we saw the results.</p>
<p>“Yeah… You’re right. Chronoa, I want to rescue Chloe and Hinata from the Unlimited Imprisonment, but is there a way we can do that?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m calmer now, so I think I can pick up on the other Chloe’s presence. But it’s gonna be hard to unlock the Unlimited Imprisonment. If we do that, I’m pretty sure that will destroy our body…”</p>
<p>When I asked what she meant, she explained that the Unlimited Imprisonment held all of their vast amounts of energy. I had forgotten that it was Chronoa here controlling the younger Chloe’s powers. If we released a quantity of energy on the level of Veldora’s, we’d probably vaporize Chloe’s body—and right now, we had no way of verifying whether Hinata’s heart was still there or not. We’ll just have to trust in Shizu’s confidence for now.</p>
<p>So if I wanted to nimbly control the Unlimited Imprisonment’s energy while extracting Chloe and Hinata from there…could I use Raphael to intervene with it, maybe? Like, just probe around inside without breaking the whole thing open?</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Negative. As it stands currently, this is not possible. We do not have access to the data particles, the smallest unit we can interact with.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Raphael could unlock the Unlimited Imprisonment as well, but since we couldn’t access the information inside, that was all it could <a id="page-342"></a>do. Veldora, who came back to life all by himself, was apparently a unique exception.</p>
<p>“All right! In that case, let me reassign that access. You have my permission to do whatever you want, Rimuru!”</p>
<p><em>…Huh?!</em></p>
<p>Just as I was pondering what to do, Chronoa gave me quite the unexpected offer.</p>
<p>These data particles were even smaller than spiritual particles, she explained, their mass about as close to zero as you could get, and they were found in everything that existed in the world. It was possible to observe data particles, although it was limited to spaces like inside my Stomach and Chronoa’s Unlimited Imprisonment. They were the units Raphael apparently worked with when organizing my skill sets.</p>
<p>Now that I had the permission of the Unlimited Imprisonment’s owner, Raphael had the right to interact with it.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Report. Consent received. Commencing intervention.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Hmm. Was it me, or did Raphael sound a little joyful? This must feel kinda similar to messing around with my own skills.</p>
<p>Things happened extremely rapidly after that. Before I could even try to stop him, Raphael was fully in his element.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Complete. The unique skills Unlimited Imprisonment and Absolute Severance will have Measurer added to them. The resulting sacrifice of energy will trigger an evolution to an ultimate skill.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Raphael kept on going, not even giving me the customary Yes/No prompt. Although maybe asking me for approval was barking up the wrong tree. These aren’t <em>my</em> skills, after all…</p>
<p>…Wait. Isn’t this kind of weird?</p>
<p>Despite my worries, Chloe’s—Chronoa’s—power was soon reborn into the ultimate skill Yog-Sothoth, Lord of Time. Even better, Chronoa—a conscious body, normally an alternate version <a id="page-343"></a>of Chloe—was optimized into an informational body known as a manas, allowing her to switch out with Chloe at any time.</p>
<p>Was it really okay to let Raphael go hog wild like this? I honestly wanted someone to say no to me, but no complaints were forthcoming.</p>
<p>“You’re always so reckless, Rimuru…but I still love you so much!”</p>
<p>Chronoa hugged me, dropping a kiss on my right cheek. And what’s more:</p>
<p>“Hey, Chronoa! You can’t just jump in front of me!!”</p>
<p>I detected something soft on the other side.</p>
<p>Chloe, just like Chronoa, hugged me close and kissed me. Even more amazing, Chloe was looking like a grown-up, too, virtually twins with Chronoa and just as stunning. I was <em>really</em> starting to love these imaginary landscapes. It’s a damn shame this wasn’t real life, but being surrounded by hotties was never a bad thing. I kind of wished I was a human, not a slime, in this vision. Maybe even the old me, back when I was a nice human-type guy. What’s the harm?</p>
<p>As I let myself bask in all these peach-colored fantasies, Shizu looked down warmly at me. And so did someone else.</p>
<p>“Well, aren’t <em>you</em> sitting pretty, Rimuru? You don’t even know whether I can come back, but I can <em>see</em> that’s not bothering you too much!”</p>
<p>It was Hinata. No, now wasn’t the time to get carried away. I cleared my throat, my blushing cheeks giving away my embarrassment.</p>
<p class="space-break1">But hey, Hinata’s still lookin’ pretty as always. Should I start by complimenting her? Although I guess I did just see her a moment ago, didn’t I? But still, no woman minds a little praise.</p>
<p>“Ah, I see you’re—”</p>
<p>“Spare me your pickup lines.”</p>
<p>“Um, okay.”</p>
<p>She saw right through me. But I still really had to say this.</p>
<p>“But… I mean, I dunno if we want to call you safe yet or not…but I’m really glad to see you again, Hinata.”</p>
<p>That much, at least, I really meant.</p>
