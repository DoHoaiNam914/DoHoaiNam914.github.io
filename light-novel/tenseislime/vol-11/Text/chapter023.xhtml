<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter022">UPHEAVAL IN THE WEST</a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page-197"></a>The demon lord Leon was in an audience with someone he had trouble dealing with—a woman with long silvery hair and uniquely long ears. She was sunk deep into an ornate chair, like a dazzling portrait come to life. It was Elmesia El-Ru Thalion, emperor of the land of Thalion, and the two of them were seated facing each other in a gazebo overlooking an elegant garden.</p>
<p>A bit of steam wafted out from the kettle on the table, the lady attendant serving them making sure to replace the water before it cooled. A sweet-smelling aroma filled the air, creating a relaxed atmosphere. The two of them watched each other for a moment, but it was Elmesia who spoke first.</p>
<p>“Taciturn as always, Leon? You have come to see me for the first time in ages, and you’re <em>that</em> bored already?”</p>
<p>Her tone of voice was kind—as it should be. Elmesia and Leon knew each other, not just as the leaders of two important trading partners but as close personal acquaintances. One could tell this from the simple fact she granted Leon this kind of audience. They had known each other since before Leon was a demon lord—back in his Hero days, when his exploits took him to Thalion. They had been friends ever since.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid now is not the time for idle laughter.”</p>
<p>“I can’t say I’ve <em>ever</em> seen you laugh a great deal.”</p>
<p><a id="page-198"></a>“Well, that doesn’t matter very much, does it? Time is of the essence right now, so let’s get down to business—”</p>
<p>“Ahhh, yes, yes. I have some pastries from Mr. Yoshida’s boutique. Would you care for a bite or two?”</p>
<p>Elmesia’s interruption stirred the attendant into action. She pushed a cart up to the table, cutting a couple slices of cake.</p>
<p>“I don’t have much of a sweet tooth.”</p>
<p>“Oh? It’s good, you know. Ah, but these cookies are made with tea leaves baked in, so they aren’t quite so sweet. Matcha cookies, I believe they’re called.”</p>
<p>“…I’ll have that, then.”</p>
<p>From past experience, Leon knew there was no talking over her. It was the same way with the demon lord Ramiris—everyone he had trouble with shared the common trait of never really listening to him in conversation. He calmed himself, already resigned to not having his way here, as he reached for a cookie.</p>
<p>“Too sweet…”</p>
<p>“Oh, you can’t even take that?”</p>
<p>“No. It’s not bad.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. You never <em>were</em> very honest with your feelings, were you? Ah well. So what brought you here today, if I may ask? Are you about to ask whether I’ve seen the children in the demon lord Rimuru’s nation?”</p>
<p>Leon sighed. <em>I can never relax around her. She’s already picked up on matters?</em> In that case, he felt, at least this would save him some time. He mentally switched gears.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I believe Rimuru has it out for me. One of my previous underlings made contact with him, filling his mind with all sorts of ideas.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Shizue Izawa, right? The Conqueror of Flames, was it? She’s a household name in this empire as well.”</p>
<p>“Why do <em>you</em> know her? Our relationship was supposed to be a well-kept secret—”</p>
<p>“Ah, how about we continue with the conversation? Time was of the essence for you, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>Leon was growing irritated. He wanted to raise his voice, shouting <a id="page-199"></a>“Who do you think is wasting <em>my</em> valuable time right now?!” but he suppressed the urge.</p>
<p>“Yes… Well, I was thinking about extending an invitation to Rimuru sooner or later. I had wanted to clear up our misunderstandings, and I find him too dangerous as an enemy anyway.”</p>
<p>Letting himself be toyed with by someone was not an experience Leon relished very much. Even dealing with Guy, he could maintain his own pace well enough, but Elmesia was simply too much for him.</p>
<p>“Oh? Don’t you think you could beat Rimuru?”</p>
<p>Elmesia seemed to take an interest. But Leon wasn’t going to accept the challenge.</p>
<p>“Whether I can beat him isn’t the issue. There’s no point in antagonizing him. I gain nothing from it and stand to lose a great deal, don’t I?”</p>
<p>Leon’s eyes said it all. <em>You made the same conclusion, didn’t you?</em> And Elmesia agreed.</p>
<p>“Indeed, indeed. And if you build a friendship, you could gain a lot from it. A change of heart in Rimuru could have some very disquieting results, but any leap forward comes with risk.”</p>
<p>That made sense to Leon, who all but assumed Elmesia shared his thoughts.</p>
<p>“Exactly. Personally, I’d welcome any demon lord who’s open to reason. I think Rimuru was smart to join hands with the demon—er, ex–demon lords Carillon and Frey. The only problem with that is—”</p>
<p>“Is the way <em>you’ve</em> been acting?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>He wanted to deny it but was in no position to. The whole reason Leon and Rimuru weren’t on good terms came down to Leon’s mishandling of Shizu.</p>
<p>“But very well. I will make some overtures along those lines for you shortly. If Tempest and El Dorado start taking potshots at each other, it would be highly annoying for us as well. But ah yes, the children. I <em>did</em> see them, actually. They seemed to enjoy the festival very much.”</p>
<p><a id="page-200"></a>“They did? So—”</p>
<p>“Now, now, not so fast. Ah, this cake is <em>so</em> lovely!”</p>
<p>Leon was normally the epitome of calmness, but he was reaching the end of his rope. <em>This</em>, he bitterly thought, <em>was exactly why I didn’t want to come here</em>. But now was no time for complaints.</p>
<p>“Among those children, was there a little girl by the name of Chloe?”</p>
<p>Asking so directly like this came with risks. There was no guarantee Elmesia wouldn’t try to deceive him, and Leon always endeavored to keep Chloe herself away from danger. But he accepted Elmesia as a friend, and in these urgent times, he didn’t want to withhold secrets from her. It was with all that in mind that Leon decided to come out with it.</p>
<p>“Ah, so you finally see fit to believe me? Very well, demon lord Leon. If you trust in me, I won’t hesitate to cooperate with you.”</p>
<p>Elmesia was signaling a change in atmosphere. She turned toward Leon. Now they were both ready to compare notes. The demon lord Rimuru was in custody of five children—Kenya Misaki, Ryota Sekiguchi, Gail Gibson, Alice Rondo, and…Chloe Aubert. The name of the girl Leon had spent his whole life searching for.</p>
<p>“…Did you know that from the start?”</p>
<p>“You know, you are far too silent for your own good. You don’t care if people misunderstand you, you never reveal your true feelings to anyone, and you try to handle everything by yourself. That is precisely why the champion Shizue Izawa never trusted you. Isn’t it, <em>ex</em>-Hero?”</p>
<p>If Leon had ever spoken honestly with Shizu, maybe their relationship could have turned out differently. Elmesia was teasing him about that. She knew Leon was a nice person, deep down—and that was why she couldn’t put up with him being reviled and feared as a demon lord now.</p>
<p>“Hmph,” he replied. “Enough with your silly suspicions. I… I’ve sacrificed a great many things. I’m willing to do anything to rescue her. No matter how bad a reputation it gives me, I’ll gladly accept it all.”</p>
<p>This was the truth. As a former Hero and protector of humankind, <a id="page-201"></a>he realized one day that strictly doing good wouldn’t be enough to reach his goals. Ever since then, he never recoiled from getting his hands dirty as he dauntlessly pursued his desires. It was too late to pretend otherwise. He wouldn’t attempt to justify his actions. That was the rule, and the faith, that he lived by.</p>
<p>“Ah, you always <em>were</em> rather inflexible. Do you want Chloe to hate your guts as well?”</p>
<p>“Silence. So Rimuru is taking good care of these children, is he? Then he must be trying to lure me into some scheme of his.”</p>
<p>“You have so far failed to eliminate the Rozzos, or Cerberus, or even the demon lord Luminus. And it’s troubling you, isn’t it, Leon?”</p>
<p>“You really know everything, don’t you?” he whispered, the strength drained from his body. It was a reminder of how extensive Elmesia’s intelligence network was and how right he was to enlist her assistance. At the same time, it also struck him with fear. He was afraid of her—not militarily, but politically—and that certainly didn’t make it any easier to deal with her.</p>
<p>“Right, well, enough picking on you for now, Leon. Based on our investigation, Tempest and Lubelius are in the clear. The demon lord Luminus truly intends to stick to her treaty with the demon lord Rimuru. That much, you know, is obvious enough from the actions of Hinata, their paladin captain. As for Cerberus, it’s a bit harder to judge them. Much about them remains a mystery, and their bosses do a poor job of working with each other—perhaps on purpose, it seems. So there’s only so much we can learn about their internals from the outside. Let me move on to the Rozzos for now. <em>They</em> are bad news. They’re doing away with all their protections in the north in order to attack Lubelius, according to my sources. Every agent in the Selt Foreign Information Bureau is being deployed, apparently, and it’s currently quite a mess over there.”</p>
<p>The northern nations to the East were lightly guarded, and battle was about to erupt in Lubelius. The news presented a serious problem to Leon.</p>
<p>“Then Guy must be making a move.”</p>
<p>And this was it. To be exact, the demon lord Guy wouldn’t lift <a id="page-202"></a>a finger—but the demons under him were bound to kick up some dirt. If Guy himself decided to join in, nobody could stop the world from being destroyed then. Even Elmesia understood that, but that didn’t make the situation any less dangerous for humankind. Certain demons in Guy’s stable—Vert and Bleu—made certain of that.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s what I’m afraid of. It’d present a serious problem for us all. Unless someone stops his underlings, that might spell the end of the Western Nations…”</p>
<p>Elmesia glanced at Leon, who appeared genuinely concerned.</p>
<p>“D-don’t look at me like that! I’m just—!!”</p>
<p>“You’re starting to sound like your old self again, Leon.”</p>
<p>“N-no, I…”</p>
<p>“No need to torture yourself. You don’t need to put on airs around me. It <em>is</em> cute, but now is no time to play with you.”</p>
<p>Even in an emergency like this, Elmesia never changed. It honestly impressed Leon.</p>
<p>“Well,” he replied, “I’m sorry, but I’m going to work toward my own goals. I’d like to make some overtures with Guy, but he’s such a contrarian. Negotiating poorly with him would have the opposite effect.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m quite aware of that. We need to show we’re making an honest effort, or that demon lord might lose all interest in the human race. If the Crusaders aren’t able to move right now, our only choice might be to deploy the Magus to the northern regions. I’ll organize a dragon transport to take you partway there.”</p>
<p>“…Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“I told you, there’s no need for panic. But time is of the essence, isn’t it? You’d better get going soon.”</p>
<p>Events were proceeding faster than Leon thought. Not even he could teleport someplace he hadn’t been before—and Lubelius was protected by a barrier anyway. If he was headed there now, air travel was the fastest way. He appreciated Elmesia’s offer a great deal.</p>
<p>“Thank you, then.”</p>
<p>“I wish you’d be that thankful more often. Oh, and I’m sure this goes without saying, but Cerberus absolutely wants to ensnare you. It’s a blatant trap; do you understand me?”</p>
<p><a id="page-203"></a>“I know,” came the terse reply.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you do,” she said with a slightly sad smile. Leon had always been that way—never showing any external sign of weakness, never giving up on his mission, no matter the danger. He never lost heart that way; a boy living like a true Hero. Even as demon lord, that still held true.</p>
<p><em>But he’s still as clumsy as always. He hasn’t changed a bit from back then…</em></p>
<p>It made Elmesia happy and sad in equal measures.</p>
<p class="space-break1">A little while later, as he boarded the dragon ship, Leon suddenly turned back toward Elmesia, as if remembering something.</p>
<p>“To repay you for your advice, I should probably tell you that Jaune has disappeared. <em>You</em> should be careful, too.”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>She reared back in genuine surprise. It made Leon chuckle a bit.</p>
<p>“Intelligence is practically your hobby, and you didn’t know that? Glad I could help, then.”</p>
<p>Then he turned back around and left, the thrill of victory echoing in his heart.</p>
<p>After he was gone:</p>
<p>“You’re kidding me. <em>Three</em> of the Primal Demons, while I have half of the Magus deployed? What kind of sick joke is this…? But I suppose it would require that much to make Leon take action, wouldn’t it? I misread him again…”</p>
<p>Thus, Elmesia was left behind, hand on her forehead, muttering about all these people selfishly ruining her plans.</p>

<p class="tx1">We had a clear sky from daybreak, a pleasant breeze heralding the start of a wonderful day. That, at least, was my expectation…</p>
<p>“R-reporting in! A group has penetrated the cathedral grounds! There’s talk of battle on the site!”</p>
<p>…but the paladin apprentice who came storming in told me just how wrong I was.</p>
<p>“Calm down. What’s their size and how much damage is there?”</p>
<p><a id="page-204"></a>Hinata, enjoying breakfast with me, kept a cool head. Again, whenever I see her like that, I feel so glad I’m not her enemy.</p>
<p>“Their numbers are unknown, my lord, but we’ve confirmed close to a hundred hostiles. Their strength is at least B-plus in rank, and they’re demonstrating a knowledge of our nation’s internal layout.”</p>
<p>Nearly a hundred B-plus fighters made for a pretty formidable force. And if they knew the city’s layout, I’d have to assume they were with Granville.</p>
<p>“…As of now, our apprentice knights have suffered extensive casualties. We have several members of the Master Rooks downed in action as well. Fortunately, no civilians have been harmed.”</p>
<p>The messenger was giving us the news straight, and it wasn’t rosy. I’d normally be losing my temper right about now, but I was a guest here, so I resisted the urge to butt in and just sat there quietly. Maybe that sounds cruel of me, but this just isn’t my turf.</p>
<p>“I see. Then I will assume our enemy is Gren, leader of the Seven Days Clergy, and the Rozzo family under him. They’re no doubt packing more force than they’re letting on right now. Send out the deployment order for all garrisoned Crusaders!”</p>
<p>It sounded like the enemy had taken even more casualties than our side, but Hinata wasn’t going to let up. I knew she wouldn’t. But something still worried me.</p>
<p>“By the way, this isn’t the same cathedral that we left our instruments in yesterday, is it?”</p>
<p>If so, that was trouble. Baton and the rest of the orchestra installed their kit there for an acoustics check. I doubted there were that many cathedrals in this nation, so I had a very bad feeling about this. And whenever I had a feeling like that…</p>
<p>“That’s the only cathedral in the country.”</p>
<p>…Yes, it usually turned out to be right. In fact, it had yet to be wrong.</p>
<p>Already dreading what was to come, I turned toward Diablo.</p>
<p class="space-break1">He just smiled back and said “Not a problem.” Apparently, he opened up a Thought Communication with Venom the moment the messenger arrived—capable as always, I see. And Venom’s response <a id="page-205"></a>was just as commendable. Baton and the orchestra were already in the cathedral for the day, but he made sure they were kept under careful guard, not letting anyone suspicious come near them. They were still making final instrument adjustments, even.</p>
<p>“They’re still at it with an army advancing on them? Man, oh man.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh-heh… Of course they are. If Venom couldn’t handle this much of a crisis, I would never have brought him in to assist.”</p>
<p>I could learn from that confidence.</p>
<p>“Well, we can’t sit around, either. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Trying to hide my feelings of inadequacy, I used Dominate Space to open a portal to the cathedral. I had begun to master this a little more; even within Lubelius, protected by its holy barrier, I had no problem launching it. I suppose that barrier didn’t interfere with internal teleportation or the like.</p>
<p>“…Phew. I can’t even give you snide comments about that anymore. I’ll join you through there.”</p>
<p>Hinata looked a tad fatigued. I was about to ask why she wasn’t looking so hot this morning but stopped myself, not wanting it to be misconstrued. See? I can learn from my mistakes. I don’t want anyone calling me inconsiderate again.</p>
<p>We were also joined by a man named Nicolaus. I thought he was a servant since he brought us breakfast, but it turns out he was a cardinal and chief counsel for the Western Holy Church. He had a fancy theologian’s robe on beneath his apron, so I guess he wasn’t lying, but why was someone that high up tending to Hinata’s meals? The plot thickens, I suppose…but that didn’t matter right now.</p>
<p>Our kids were in the cathedral as well. They were all up bright and early, so I sent them over a little while ago. Diablo said they were under full protection, but you never knew what could happen in this world. Taking a deep breath, I quickly transported myself over to the cathedral.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Once I was inside, I could hear the sounds of intense battle beyond the walls. Baton and the rest were there, looking understandably frightened, but then I heard Shion’s booming voice.</p>
<p><a id="page-206"></a>“Do not lose your composure! Have you forgotten what Sir Rimuru said? He himself told you to concentrate on your music, for you are guaranteed to be safe. So why have you stopped practicing?!”</p>
<p>Um… <em>That’s kind of an insane thing to say, isn’t it? We’re in the middle of a battlefield,</em> Shion<em>. Ordering noncombatants not to be frightened right now was really a big ask</em>, I thought…</p>
<p>“My apologies, Lady Shion. I think we were all just a little caught in the moment.”</p>
<p>…Huh? Did Shion’s scolding actually restore the focus to Baton’s eyes? And now here he was, turning back toward the performers and lifting his arms up high. They must’ve noticed me by this point, because I could feel their eyes on me. I don’t know if that was the cause, but now everyone seemed more relaxed, their tension draining. They were even smiling.</p>
<p>“Let’s continue our rehearsal!”</p>
<p>Nobody voiced any dissent. Baton, seemingly taking the orchestra’s agreement as a given, began conducting—and beautiful music filled the room, not a single note out of place. It almost seemed powerful enough to drown out the war going on outside. Listening on, I couldn’t help but be proud of everyone I brought along.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Having this battle gain a sudden musical accompaniment made it almost seem like a stage show—but of course, this was no production.</p>
<p>In another moment, I found the kids and ordered them to stay where they were. “But I wanna—” began Kumara before I shut her down. Right now, she was by herself—only one tail—and just like the other children, she was too young for actual battle yet. Calling Shion over, I ordered her to protect them with Diablo.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do, Sir Rimuru?”</p>
<p>“Me? I’m gonna squish these roaches. Whoever’s facing off against Hinata’s forces is the cause of this, and it’s time to kick ’em outta here.”</p>
<p>Normally, it’d be ill-advised for a guest like me to step into the fray. But watching Baton’s orchestra give their all like this, I wanted to do whatever I could to make tomorrow’s concert a success.</p>
<p>“…Very well,” Diablo said.</p>
<p><a id="page-207"></a>“Hmm? What’s the matter, <em>Vice</em> Secretary? It’s rare for you to actually accept an order from Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>Shion gave Diablo a surprised look. Yeah, I was kind of floored by that, too. I all but assumed Diablo would volunteer to join me, but if I wanted to keep this scene from growing any bigger, this was probably best.</p>
<p>“All right. The chamber is yours!”</p>
<p>“Best of luck to you.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Shion seemed to have her concerns, but given what she just told Diablo, she was in no position to protest now. That suited me just fine, so I flung myself outside and into battle.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Enemies and allies were scattered across the cathedral entrance. The main door was battered down, not a trace of it left, and over a hundred people were currently engaged in battle.</p>
<p>Among the standouts, certainly, was the figure Hinata was up against. He was an old man, but his back was straight as a fence post, his moves nimble and artistic. He was dressed in a fancy-looking suit, and his sharpened eyes indicated he was no one to be trifled with. He wasn’t a monster but likely not human, either—and looking at the aura around him, I could tell he was packing a formidable amount of force.</p>
<p>“Who’s that?”</p>
<p>“Granville Rozzo. Leader of the Five Elders and head of the Rozzo family.”</p>
<p>“Him…?”</p>
<p>That made sense to me.</p>
<p>“Maria,” the man said, “find Lady Luminus and bring her here. If she resists, kill her if you must.”</p>
<p>At his summons, a woman stepped in front of me. Her features reminded me of Maribel, but she was a young adult in age. I wouldn’t be surprised if they were blood relatives, but I couldn’t say if she was Maribel’s mother.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><a id="page-208"></a><em>Understood. Failed to confirm blood relation with genetic evidence.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>Whoa, you can tell just by visuals? Cool, I guess.</em></p>
<p>So if it was no coincidence that Maria looked like Maribel, that made me wonder what her strength was like. She sure didn’t <em>look</em> like she’d hold her own against Luminus. Was Granville seriously ordering her to seize that woman—a demon lord?</p>
<p>“Very well. I will begin immediately.”</p>
<p>The woman called Maria walked off, never looking my way. It was all so mechanical—all I could say was that it wasn’t like any regular human being. I couldn’t gauge her strength, but I guessed Luminus would before too much longer.</p>
<p>Me, I needed to get Granville out of here. If we could talk this over, then great. If not, I was prepared to end this quickly.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, Granville. I’m the demon lord Rimuru.”</p>
<p>Any decent conversation needed to begin with a greeting. I had a hunch our relationship wasn’t going to be too friendly, but we might as well start on the right foot, at least.</p>
<p>“You’re Rimuru? How dare you take my Maribel from me…”</p>
<p>“Whoa, whoa, she started it—”</p>
<p>Yeahhhh, I guess he’s got it in for me.</p>
<p>But Maribel’s death was an accident. It seemed unreasonable to blame me for it. I know telling him “I didn’t mean to kill her” would be a dumb excuse…but really, if Maribel didn’t start gunning for me, none of that would’ve happened. Not that I expected Granville to accept it. Yuuki said he’d try reasoning with him, but now that I no longer trusted Yuuki, I could kind of imagine what he had said about me. I doubted this was something we could iron out with words any longer.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Report. Regardless of what was said, you would likely have been in conflict with him.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Yeah, I was sure. Something told me it would be just as hard to coexist with Granville as it was with Maribel. In which case, I’d just have to overpower him.</p>
<p><a id="page-209"></a>“…But I guess it’s pointless to say that, isn’t it? Then let’s prove to each other who’s in the right.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… Say what you will. You think a demon lord upstart like you could defeat me? I’ll fight you later, so just stay there and watch as your allies are picked off, one by one.”</p>
<p>A demon lord upstart like me? Given that he used to be Luminus’s servant, this guy sure seemed to like his chances. I mean, yeah, the power of a monster depended a great deal on how old they were…but any demon lord, no matter how young, should’ve at least given him pause.</p>
<p>Guess this guy’s more confident than I thought. But now someone else was here to challenge him.</p>
<p>“There is no need for Lady Hinata or Sir Rimuru to step up. Gren of the Seven Days Clergy, your fight begins with us!”</p>
<p>It was Nicolaus who shouted this. Isn’t he way too up there in the hierarchy for this stuff? Then I remembered—Cardinal Nicolaus was the guy who set a trap and cast Disintegration on Granville. Gutsy move, definitely. He was currently accompanied by three Crusader captains—the subleader Renard, along with Arnaud and Litus. Fritz and Bacchus would’ve been training at the labyrinth right now, so they weren’t here. If <em>this</em> was gonna happen… But again, that’s not for me to judge.</p>
<p>“Behold, Lady Hinata! Watch us in action!”</p>
<p>At Nicolaus’s orders, Renard propelled himself forward. Not just him, actually—Arnaud and Litus as well, all rushing Granville at the same time. These three captains were attempting to buy enough time for Nicolaus to cast Disintegration again, I figured. A pretty grandiose strategy, but that must be how wary Nicolaus was of his foe.</p>
<p>Renard used his magnificent sword moves to keep his foe at bay. Arnaud’s keen perception let him match every move of Renard’s, as Litus provided handy backup for them both. Normally, an attack from this trio would end the battle right then—but it was well within Granville’s capabilities. Like a picture from a textbook, he engaged all three of them at once, wholly ignoring Nicolaus’s spellcasting. That creeped me out a bit, as did the serene look on his <a id="page-210"></a>face, not a single bead of sweat on his forehead. He, I felt, was simply on a different tier from them.</p>
<p>Nicolaus had only one verse left in the spell. Its effects would summon a layered magical circle, with Granville standing in the middle of its light-infused dungeon. Once the Disintegration was complete, there was no way to block its dazzling rays, as it dismantled the soul of its target at the speed of light.</p>
<p>That’s what should have happened. But now, all common sense was thrown out the window.</p>
<p>“Mm… A fine spell, there. No better way to read the flow of your magic.”</p>
<p>Granville’s voice sounded frightfully cold as he spoke, like a teacher commanding his student from high above. Hinata, hearing it, muttered a soft “No…” as the blood drained from her face. She must’ve noticed something, but there was no time to inform Nicolaus.</p>
<p>“Time to die! Disintegration!!”</p>
<p>The rays of light were cast, heading straight for Granville—and suddenly, they switched paths and were sucked straight into the sword in his hand. It happened in an instant. Even with my perception accelerated a million times over, it was difficult to pinpoint. But I recognized exactly what happened—because I had witnessed it before. It was Overblade: Meltslash, the most powerful of sword skills, just like what I saw from Hinata.</p>
<p>“…Spread out!”</p>
<p>Renard and the others instantly heeded Hinata’s order. They worked fast, true to their military precision, but not fast enough. Once Granville threw out his Meltslash, it immediately generated a fan-shaped shock wave—and in that single moment, Hinata pushed forward, came in front of Nicolaus, and stopped Granville’s sword.</p>
<p>The frontal force of the Meltslash sent Hinata flying. She bashed against Nicolaus—which kept her safe, but I’m sure Nicolaus was out of the battle. If she wasn’t wielding the Legend-class Moonlight right now, they’d both be a pile of ash. That—and even the secondary shock wave blew Renard and the other captains away. They were all on the ground, knocked out by that single blast.</p>
<p><a id="page-211"></a>“A-are you all right?!”</p>
<p>Nobody answered.</p>
<p>I could detect a twinge of panic in Hinata’s face as she glared at Granville. Even someone as cold as her didn’t expect this level of force—and now it was Granville doing the talking.</p>
<p>“Mmm, I couldn’t kill a single one of you? I must be getting rusty. You have that demon lord over there to thank.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What do you…?”</p>
<p>Hinata took a glance at me, growing calmer. Now she seemed to understand.</p>
<p>“Oh. You saved them? Thanks, Rimuru.”</p>
<p><em>You’re welcome.</em></p>
<p>I gave Hinata a light nod. Yes, Renard and the others were merely knocked out because I lent them a hand. The moment I realized this was trouble, I launched Absolute Defense—otherwise, they’d have vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>The wall that skill built was perfect, I thought, but I guess I expected too much from it. Absolute Defense—part of the ultimate skill Uriel, Lord of Vows—could block any sort of attack. There were some exceptions, such as Yuuki’s Anti-Skill, so I couldn’t rely <em>too</em> much on it, but it was always a helpful arrow in my quiver.</p>
<p>However, although it was perfect for self-defense, trying to deploy it on someone else (multiple targets, even) blunted its effects. Even if a little force got through, I could always count on Infinite Regeneration to wipe up any problems—that’s why it so perfectly defended me. But not the paladin captains. The little bit of the shock wave that penetrated the Absolute Defense pushed them to the brink of death. They really escaped disaster by a hair’s breadth.</p>
<p>“I had no idea someone besides me learned Meltslash. Color me just a little bit surprised.”</p>
<p>“Mmm… An arrogant thought, Hinata. With all the years that have passed, <em>some</em> have reached your level, you know.”</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, <em>I</em> could use it, so… (Although, admittedly, that was just Raphael doing its usual Analyze and Assess job on it.)</p>
<p>Still, to completely leverage Meltslash, you needed full, intimate knowledge of how Disintegration worked. If there was a handful of <a id="page-212"></a>people wielding that now, I guess the human race was a lot more capable than I thought. It <em>did</em> make sense, though—a human Hero once sealed Veldora away, so at least <em>some</em> of them had to be that strong. Even being a demon lord, I really couldn’t rest on my laurels.</p>
<p>But look at me. My mind was wandering, and I really couldn’t afford that.</p>
<p>“So what is <em>this</em> I see? High officers in the paladins, almost killed by something of <em>this</em> level? How worthlessly pathetic. You couldn’t even begin to compare with the sword masters of the past, to say nothing of myself.”</p>
<p>Granville seemed to believe his own claims. He honestly didn’t think Hinata would pose a challenge.</p>
<p>“That’s a funny thing to say. Care to test that out?”</p>
<p>Hinata flashed a cold smile. She was just as serious, it seemed, and I had no room to interfere…</p>
<p>Then a sudden thundering explosion by the cathedral told me how incorrect I was.</p>
<p>“Ah, Razul? I ordered him to destroy the cathedral, and it seems he’s doing a thorough job.”</p>
<p>“What did you…?”</p>
<p>The kids and the orchestra were still in there. Shion and Diablo were charged with protecting them, but if all-out war was erupting, they were bound to be caught in it. I was hoping to make short work of Granville, but at this point, maybe it was best to eliminate this uninvited guest first.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I attempted to teleport myself to the cathedral. But Granville stopped me.</p>
<p>“Demon lord Rimuru, I will let this group entertain you. Enjoy! You <em>may</em> even find some of your own kind among them!”</p>
<p>Several people stepped up at his order. Immediately, I understood what he meant. The group consisted of many races and many ages, no real theme to them, but they each had something in common—more magicules than any regular person would possess.</p>
<p>“Otherworlders? Ah. Yeah, maybe there’s one or two Japanese people in here.”</p>
<p><a id="page-213"></a>Now was not the time to act all casual about this. I had ten or so otherworlders attacking me at once. Like Glenda from the past, they seemed to be under the effects of a locking curse, robbed of their freedom of movement—and unlocking that curse wouldn’t stop them, by the looks of it.</p>
<p>Still…</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh. You intend to fight? You realize they’re only doing this because I’ve enthralled them, do you not?”</p>
<p>How treacherous of him. I’m sure he said that to make me hesitate…and I hate to admit it, but it worked.</p>
<p>“I heard how soft and weak-minded you were. Can you kill innocent human beings? Can you tell yourself this is war and step up to defend yourself? Not that I mind either way, of course.”</p>
<p>Granville only saw the summoned otherworlders as weapons, nothing more. To him, they only had value as throwaway pawns. And he was right—killing them <em>shouldn’t</em> make any difference to me. He really <em>was</em> a menace. Clearly, he had done his research. If Diablo or Shion were taking these guys on, they’d show absolutely no mercy, I’m sure. But did that make it okay, or <em>not</em> okay, for me…?</p>
<p>“Ah, dammit! What a pain in the ass!”</p>
<p>I had no time to agonize over this. The children were in danger if I didn’t do something fast, and now the damage was just gonna get worse. At this point, there was just one option to take. As annoying as it was, I’d have to unlock the curses of every one of these guys and knock them out nonlethally.</p>
<p>Thus, I was now an active participant in this battle.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">My fellow humans were closing in on me. For all I knew, maybe they were from some other planet (or dimension) besides Earth—but now my mind was wandering again. Guess I was back in my element.</p>
<p>Otherworlders were blessed with extraordinary physical skills, as well as a variety of special skills that were impossible to predict. That made them dangerous, of course, but they weren’t a threat to <a id="page-214"></a>me. Not even Glenda could hurt me, whether I put up a defense or not. That’s how all-powerful the combo of Absolute Defense and Infinite Regeneration was.</p>
<p>These foes were still a handful, but not much more than that. With enough time, I could safely neutralize all of them. I wasn’t about to go easy on them, but that was my honest assessment. Besides, I had Raphael, which meant that going easy wasn’t an option to start with.</p>
<p>So I used part of my vast computational skills to begin surveying the situation.</p>
<p class="space-break1">First, I looked at Hinata, fighting right next to me. Granville, who had mercifully shut up for me, was gracefully clashing swords with her, both of them equipped with nothing but their rapiers. They held them in their right hands, their left kept behind their backs for magic-casting purposes.</p>
<p>“<em>Tch!</em> So when you posed as Gren, you were hiding your full powers? I recall that you specialize in bare-handed close-range combat, but you’re rather handy with a sword as well.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh! I have experience with all weapons. I just never needed to use it before now.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no? Then let me strip you of your mistaken confidence.”</p>
<p>Hinata was leaving nothing on the table. That much was clear from how she used Moonlight, her sword. What I wondered about was Granville’s blade. If he could use it to keep Hinata’s at bay, it couldn’t have been any normal weapon.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Understood. Unable to determine weapon class due to interference. It is believed to be classed at Legend or higher.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Hmm. A surprising appraisal. Raphael hadn’t made any mistakes as of late, but here you go. Perhaps I underestimated Granville quite a bit.</p>
<p>I doubted it, but was Hinata in, you know, big trouble here? I mean, I didn’t think she’d lose or anything…but I couldn’t dismiss <a id="page-215"></a>the possibility, and that unnerved me. Not even Raphael had a bead on his skill level.</p>
<p>So Hinata and Granville’s duel piqued my interest, but I had even bigger fish to fry—namely, the intense battle I was sensing from the direction of the cathedral. I honed the accuracy of my Magic Sense, turning my eyes toward the fray.</p>
<p>There, I saw a man in a suit of dark armor. Amazingly, he was fighting against Shion and Diablo at once—and not giving an inch of ground. I suppose he wouldn’t. His magicule level was higher than both of them combined.</p>
<p>“Damn, you’re kidding me. You were hiding someone with power beyond a demon lord’s?”</p>
<p>“Of course. When facing the demon lords or other monsters who threaten humankind, you can never have too many aces up your sleeve.”</p>
<p>Granville must’ve picked up on my muttering if he replied to it. He was in the middle of fighting Hinata and still had the time to answer me. Wow. But hey, if he was open to chatting, we’d get some more info from him—and if it distracted him along the way, that was two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>“He has to outclass Roy, right? That demon lord stand-in? Maybe stronger than you?”</p>
<p>I worked a bit of a taunt into my question.</p>
<p>“His name is Razul. My friend for the past millennium.”</p>
<p>Glad he was nice enough to reply. Hinata was still silent; I suppose she understood my aims and chose not to interfere. So I continued.</p>
<p>“Your friend, huh? But Razul doesn’t seem human to me.”</p>
<p>“What of it?”</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure how to respond to that. I just wanted to find out what he really was. Now I knew he wasn’t human, at least, and that was a step forward, but…</p>
<p>“Well, nothing…”</p>
<p>I felt talked down to a bit, which was annoying.</p>
<p>“He comes from a long-lived race, you see. My partner during my glory years. Given how he’s got far more power than a paladin captain, I’m sure your underlings must feel overwhelmed right now.”</p>
<p><a id="page-216"></a>Granville was right. Shion and Diablo were having a hard time of it. I thought having Diablo around kept us safe, but maybe that was too optimistic?</p>
<p>…Hang on. Actually, <em>here</em> was something weird. It was like Diablo’s having trouble focusing or something.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Report. Unusual rifts in space detected. It is a sign of someone using Spatial Transport to appear.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">The warning from Raphael came all too suddenly. It almost never gave me alerts like that unless things were really serious, so I had to treat it as an emergency. No need to go easy any longer. Diablo must’ve been picking up on this anomaly, and it was keeping him from concentrating.</p>
<p>(Ranga, you there?)</p>
<p>(Yes, my master!)</p>
<p>Ah, good! He was usually curled up in my shadow these days.</p>
<p>(Back up Shion, but keep yourself concealed!)</p>
<p>(Right away!)</p>
<p>At once, he used Shadow Motion to dive into Shion’s shadow. When I saw he was ready, I gave out my next order.</p>
<p>(Diablo, is something bothering you?)</p>
<p>(My pardons, Sir Rimuru. I know my difficulties in this battle are unforgivable, but the fact is that this adversary is more powerful than I anticipated. He is a highly evolved example of the uncommon insectoid race, and to demons, they are a kind of natural enemy.)</p>
<p>Diablo described insectoids as cross-dimensional magic beasts with elemental powers. They appeared now and then in this world, but it was extremely uncommon for them to evolve into humanoid creatures. I figured Diablo could still win against him, but he wasn’t. Something far worse was troubling him—and now that this something was incoming, I wanted Diablo to address it first.</p>
<p>(Shion, you heard him. If Diablo’s making excuses, it must be something really serious.)</p>
<p>The moment I said that, I could practically feel Diablo’s discomfort from over here. He’d never resort to excuses like this usually, so <a id="page-217"></a>I immediately knew he was hiding something. And if I wanted him to retain full freedom in this battle, I needed Shion’s and Ranga’s help.</p>
<p>(Shion, I just planted Ranga in your shadow. Both of you work together to defeat Razul, that insectoid.)</p>
<p>(No need to order us!)</p>
<p>(I will live up to your expectations, Master!)</p>
<p>Looks like Shion picked up on Diablo’s difficulties as well. I’m sure she would’ve taken measures even without an order. But if she did, it would’ve been Shion alone against the mighty Razul, which would only be more dangerous. Not that I didn’t trust her, but I wanted our plans to remain as safe as possible. Maybe setting two allies against him was a cowardly move, but in an actual battle like this, guaranteed victory was always your final goal.</p>
<p>(Diablo, go take care of whatever’s bothering you. Also, try to trust and rely on your allies more.)</p>
<p>(…!! Keh-heh-heh-heh… Very well. I suppose I thought a little too much of myself today. Allow me to take care of this problem at once!)</p>
<p>Not just a “<em>little</em>,” I’d say. But at least he sounded a bit more like himself again.</p>
<p>(Right, everyone… Begin!)</p>
<p>(((Yes, my lord!)))</p>
<p>I wasn’t used to giving out orders like these, but all three gladly accepted them. Now I just had to hope for the best, as I brought my full focus back to neutralizing the otherworlders.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">“Keh-heh-heh-heh… Sir Rimuru sees everything, I suppose. I would be a fool to think otherwise.”</p>
<p>“Of course he does, Vice Secretary. Just go and deal with your problem already!”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to remind me. As I think you’ve noticed, Razul is more powerful than you. Are you sure you’ll be fine, Secretary?”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! I never thought you’d worry for me, Vice <a id="page-218"></a>Secretary…or Diablo, I should say. You’re strong, I’ll admit. Stronger than me, even. So go defeat that foe so Sir Rimuru has nothing to worry about! That’s your job, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“…!! Keh…heh-heh-heh. You called me by name…”</p>
<p>“Just go! Leave this fight to me!”</p>
<p>“I believe in you, Lady Shion. Not because Sir Rimuru ordered me to—the feeling is genuine.”</p>
<p>“Just <em>Shion</em> is fine. It’s weird, you showing me proper respect. There’s no heart in it.”</p>
<p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh… Best of luck to you, Shion.”</p>
<p>“You too, Diablo.”</p>
<p>In that short conversation, conducted without any eye contact, Shion and Diablo finally accepted each other. They both had overinflated senses of pride, perhaps, but deep down, both of them knew the extent of each other’s power.</p>
<p>Diablo walked off, not looking back as he gave orders to his staff.</p>
<p>“Venom, protect those children like your life depends on it. Or sacrifice your life for it—either way, just <em>do</em> it.”</p>
<p>Rimuru had given no orders for Diablo’s own forces. He thus saw no need to consider their feelings. All that really mattered here, he coldly reasoned, were the children and the orchestra.</p>
<p>“Oh, um, all right.”</p>
<p><em>Wish he could’ve considered us a bit more</em>, Venom thought—but he wasn’t foolish enough to say it. If he did, Diablo would’ve ended his life before any foe could.</p>
<p>Besides:</p>
<p><em>Well, looks like Lady Shion and Sir Ranga are handling the major threat. With all of us, protecting this area should be doable enough. It beats fighting Sir Diablo, at least…</em></p>
<p>That summed up Venom’s feelings on the subject.</p>
<p>“May victory be yours, Sir Diablo!”</p>
<p>“Silence. I have no interest in you worrying over me.”</p>
<p>Diablo wasted no time coldly brushing off Venom’s encouragement.</p>
<p><em>There’s the Diablo I know…</em></p>
<p>Venom’s memories of being forcibly pressed into service by him flashed through his mind. He banished them as quickly as he could. <a id="page-219"></a>If Diablo ever saw him looking disgruntled, there was no telling how he’d react.</p>
<p>As he mentally refocused on his mission, Diablo left the scene to his friends and strode off the battlefield.</p>
<p class="space-break1">He teleported to his destination, reappearing in a spot removed from the cathedral, and outside of Lubelius itself—a corner of a vast, vegetation-free plain. Awaiting him was a beautiful blue-haired woman in a dark-red maid outfit. Several paladins were on the ground at her feet—even these guardians of humanity, each one boasting the power of a thousand, were helpless against her.</p>
<p>“How nice to see you again, Noir. I was growing impatient with your lateness.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, I could feel your murderous rage from miles away, but I had some business I couldn’t extract myself from. But I’d really prefer if you called me Diablo, Bleu…or I suppose <em>you</em> had a name, too, didn’t you, Raine?”</p>
<p>Raine, the blue-haired beauty, gave this response a satisfied smile. “That’s right. The name Raine was granted to me by Rouge, the Original Red, the great Sir Guy himself, strongest of the Primal Demons. It’s not at all like being named by some mutt of a demon lord like <em>you</em> were.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Are you looking to die? Or maybe you want to be detached from this world entirely. Keh-heh-heh-heh… I’ll be happy to oblige.”</p>
<p>Diablo’s smile remained, but his gold eyes were no longer friendly. The red pupils within them narrowed as he eyed his prey.</p>
<p>“Let us battle, Diablo! Ah, I cannot wait for this. Ever since I detected you fighting Blanc over to the east, I’ve always wanted a chance at you.”</p>
<p>“Ridiculous. If you think this will be any fight at all, you are sorely mistaken.”</p>
<p>“Well, why don’t we begin and find out?!”</p>
<p>With that signal, Raine made good her question and went on the move, dropping a chop with her hand that moved beyond the speed of sound. A casual wave of Diablo’s arm deflected it. It <a id="page-220"></a>delighted Raine. The wish she kindled for many long years was finally happening.</p>
<p><em>Yes… Yes, this is it. I can’t have this end that quickly. We are both Primal, and yet you enjoy all of this freedom. No building your own factions, no undertaking someone else’s mission… All demons want nothing more than a physical body, and you laughed that off…</em></p>
<p>It was fair to say that Raine was jealous of Diablo. For someone like her, who followed the rules by the book, his behavior was inexcusable.</p>
<p><em>He fought Sir Guy to a draw, as loath as I am to admit it…and here he is now, blithely wandering around, no desire for more strength. As a demon, he needs to gain a body the right way! He needs to strive for what lies beyond his evolution!</em></p>
<p>All of Raine’s power was being thrown Diablo’s way. After stewing over these emotions for years, she was now acting on them.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Diablo—Noir, the Original Black—was a unique demon. Long, long ago, he and Rouge fought to be crowned the strongest of their kind. The match, while ending in a tie, wound up sealing both of their respective fates. Rouge manifested in the physical world, gaining untold powers, but Noir refused to change, turning down his chance at evolution.</p>
<p>The cases of Blanc, Jaune, and Violet could be understood—those three colors were all meddling with one another, preventing any evolution, creating a sort of balanced rivalry that remained to this day. But Noir, despite having no such restriction, simply remained his natural self and enjoyed life, as if he thought the other six shades were all fools. That is how things had been for tens of thousands of years.</p>
<p class="space-break1">And it was exactly why Raine could never forgive Diablo. He was so selfish, going wherever his whims took him, living in perfect freedom—and Guy, the strongest of all, recognized him as an equal.</p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! You’re right. All this dodging can hardly count as a battle. You always were good at <em>evading</em> things, if nothing else.”</p>
<p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh… I told you: Don’t get the wrong idea. I <a id="page-221"></a>simply have no need to tap my full force against the likes of you. Also, I should note that I have zero intention of avoiding you.”</p>
<p>“Making apologies already? I’m sure you’re still too new in your body to tap its full potential, but don’t expect me to accept your pathetic excuses.”</p>
<p>Raine fired a bolt of magic from her fist. Exposed to the laws of nature, it transformed into a Nuclear Cannon blast—one Raine called for with no casting time. But Diablo, naturally, had expected this, not demonstrating a moment of concern as he cast dispulsion magic to make the nuclear blast vanish. This is what battle between high-level demons is about: breaking through one another’s layers of magical barriers and counterattack spells to land a lethal blow on your enemy. Neither side had any need for time-consuming spellcasting as they threw supercharged blasts of magic at each other.</p>
<p>And as more and more time passed…</p>
<p>“I—I can’t believe it! You were drawing this while you were fighting?!”</p>
<p>“That’s right, Raine. To me, fighting you was merely busywork. One can hardly call it an engaging game if you can already see the ending.”</p>
<p>Raine was in shock. The outcome was already set in stone.</p>
<p>Surrounding Raine was a layered circle, alive and glowing with magical runes. It had appeared in the air just now at Diablo’s signal, and now that she was in it, Raine could no longer move. Whenever she tried to, even a little, Diablo could summon any magic she wanted against her.</p>
<p>It was called:</p>
<p>“A… A multilayered Disintegration…? The antithesis to all demons, a magic dangerous enough to crush us all… Why do you…?!”</p>
<p>Diablo looked coldly down upon her, a slight sense of pity in his otherwise-frozen mind, as if he couldn’t understand why she wouldn’t know.</p>
<p>“Ridiculous. As long as my faith in my master is deep enough, I can even hold sway over spiritual particles. Common sense, don’t you see?”</p>
<p><a id="page-222"></a>“Are you insane?! How could that ever be common sense…?!”</p>
<p>“But let me extend you the courtesy of ending this. You have insulted my wondrous master Sir Rimuru, and soon you will burn with regret.”</p>
<p>Seven rays of light were released. Even one of these deadly arrows held the power of absolute destruction, and now they came crashing down upon Raine…</p>

<p class="tx1">From the bottom of her heart, Luminus was irritated.</p>
<p>Right here, in the midst of the concert she invited the demon lord Rimuru to stage, she had allowed Granville to arrange an all-out rebellion. Such a dreadful error was unheard of in the history of her nation. She was taken by an urge to run to the cathedral and massacre everyone inside herself, but her sense of reason (and her instincts) restrained her. She realized that, as public of an attack as this was, it was undoubtedly a diversion.</p>
<p>Louis and Gunther, stationed by Luminus’s side, stayed silent, not willing to set her off. They said nothing—like Luminus, they were greatly disturbed but not stupid enough to prioritize the wrong thing here.</p>
<p>If Granville’s blitz was a diversion, what purpose was there to it?</p>
<p><em>I’m sure he knows about my cherished ark. That means there’s a nonzero chance he’s thinking about releasing the girl inside…</em></p>
<p>The ark was the greatest of Luminus’s secret treasures. But she had an even bigger reason to keep it absolutely safe—and she knew Granville was aware of that reason. This is why it was hard to imagine him gunning for the ark—but still, she trusted her instincts. And she was correct to do so.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Here she was, inside her innermost chamber—a burial room, one nobody was supposed to know about. It was currently playing host to an uninvited guest.</p>
<p>“Well now, guess our little home invasion got spotted, eh? Or were you just beefin’ up the security around here?”</p>
<p><a id="page-223"></a>“Hoh-hoh-hoh! A pity. But here’s a bit of prey we can have some fun with. Think it’s all right for us to raise a little hell?”</p>
<p>“Fine by me, but you better be careful. That li’l beauty over there’s a menace, through and through. You’re the demon lord Luminus, ain’t you?”</p>
<p>The two home invaders—Laplace and Footman—stepped in, acting less than polite to their host. Luminus watched them as she elegantly relaxed on a couch in front of the ark she absolutely had to protect.</p>
<p>To her, this pair didn’t even remotely seem like a challenge. But something about the atmosphere kept her on close guard.</p>
<p>Luminus took care to conceal her rage as she spoke.</p>
<p>“…I will ignore your attitudes for the moment. State your names.”</p>
<p>Laplace was the first to react. He was a bit surprised that someone expected their break-in, but Granville had mentioned the possibility. To address it, he had provided them with a guide, someone to help them traverse the multiple defense lines blocking access to the chamber.</p>
<p>“It is an honor to meet you. I am Laplace, the Wonder Jester and vice president of the Moderate Jesters—a kind of handyman outfit, know what I mean? And this here’s Footman.”</p>
<p>He deliberately took a less-than-serious approach to the greeting as he motioned toward Footman.</p>
<p>“Hoh-hoh-hoh! I am Footman, the Angry Jester. Glad to meet you…although I don’t think we’ll be staying long.”</p>
<p>Footman, to his credit, was standing strong against this demon lord. His mind worked on simple terms—if there’s an enemy, he’d crush it. Now he was just waiting for Laplace’s signal to begin.</p>
<p>“That—and we’ve got one more person here. C’mon in!”</p>
<p>Another figure emerged through the door, a blond-haired beauty.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“She’s not too talkative, mind you. I think her name was—”</p>
<p>“No. I remember her… Yes, yes. Maria Rozzo? The woman Granville loved?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Maria! That’s the name! Wow, Lady Luminus, you two knew each other?”</p>
