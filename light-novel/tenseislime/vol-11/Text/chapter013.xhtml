<p><a id="page-119"></a>And so Diablo was already beginning his boastful speech. I needed to stop it at once.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll pass on that. I’m sure they’re not here to listen to you brag at me, either, so how about we save that for another opportunity?”</p>
<p>An opportunity I was <em>pretty</em> sure would never come, of course.</p>
<p>Diablo froze, giving me a “huh?” look. The three demon girls snickered. I supposed <em>they</em> were worried he’d talk about himself for hours, too.</p>
<p>Satisfied I was in the right, I grinned. “I don’t want to keep everyone else waiting, either. Introduce them to me.”</p>
<p>“…I—I understand. In that case, allow us to relocate…”</p>
<p>He looked disappointed, but I couldn’t spoil him. I’ll admit that Diablo was a talent, but giving him preferential treatment in front of the new staff wasn’t a good idea. I’d never wanna be accused of playing favorites, so he’ll just have to put up with it. (Of course, what I <em>really</em> feared was him talking my ear off all day, but that goes without saying.)</p>

<p class="tx1">Diablo, of course, recovered quickly. As a spiritual life-form, he had real backbone. You’d think that meant he wouldn’t be swinging between joy and sadness after everything I said, but he did anyway for some reason. Very strange.</p>
<p>“Summoning them in town may cause trouble, so let’s call for them within the labyrinth.”</p>
<p>Regardless, Diablo had now matured enough that he actually cared about people and things around him a little. I was impressed…but I shouldn’t have been.</p>
<p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh… After all, if they appeared within town, they would shatter the barrier over it. You spent a lot of time and trouble on that magic spell, Sir Rimuru, so I must take consideration of that.”</p>
<p>Hearing his slightly askew observation made me realize how wrong I was.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-120"></a>But it reminded me of something else.</p>
<p>Here in Rimuru, the capital of Tempest, we already had a barrier deployed on an experimental basis. This was an enhanced version of the Holy Field, suppressing the magicules that leaked out of monsters. We had a lot of human visitors these days, and this was one measure we took for their safety. It was a bit of a burden for our monster residents, but not enough to affect their daily lives at all. Put up with that, and we could retain the city’s magicule counts to a level humans could easily abide by. The barrier also helped enforce our laws against casting certain magic spells in town, and it also kept magical beasts from entering city limits.</p>
<p>If anyone was big and mean enough to break this barrier, they’d have to be A rank and assigned some kind of disaster level—and even <em>they</em> couldn’t smash it with one hit. If anything happened to the barrier, we’d all know at once, so our sentinels would be able to swing into action. Even an A-ranked beast, of course, was nothing to fear without intelligence. With our well-honed soldiers, we’d be able to calmly take care of matters.</p>
<p>My main concern was whether there were people among these seven hundred who could break down the barrier. It’d be child’s play for the three women behind me, but were there any other menaces among them? Diablo tended to be a harsh critic, so if he described seven demons as useful, they had to be extremely dangerous.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Inside the Dungeon:</p>
<p>“I hereby permit you to show yourselves. Manifest!”</p>
<p>With Diablo’s order, seven demons appeared, seven hundred more kneeling behind them.</p>
<p>I guess…I should have expected this. Six out of the seven were Arch Demons. Magicule flow was regulated within the labyrinth, so it was easier for them to appear here than up on the surface, hence why all of them were their full, ominous selves in here.</p>
<p>These seven demons who earned Diablo’s trust, though… Now <em>these</em> guys looked like actual demons. One among them was just a Greater Demon, but a special one apparently, and no doubt pretty <a id="page-121"></a>strong, too. Strong enough to pick a fight with Diablo and get smashed up in the process, by the sound of it. He had guts, at least, although clearly he had to be an idiot. Nonetheless, Diablo saw something in this Greater Demon, and if he did, I had no complaint.</p>
<p>But enough about that. My concern was still on the first three. These three Arch Demons each had two Arch Demons of their own, essentially indicating they had some kinda special talent beyond just their magicule count.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Understood. As demons have no life span, the older they are, the more battle experience they build up. In the demon realm, there are classes of nobility they are categorized into based on that. Those in the ruling classes enjoy exclusive levels of authority and power…</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Oh?</p>
<p>Raphael told me that demons are limited in how far they can grow, Arch Demon being the very top. However, even under these same conditions, they can polish their battle skills and establish themselves as superior over others. Different demons can have different strengths, even with the same magicule count. That difference can come in knowledge, the drive for victory, the strength of their will… Put it all together, and that’s how a demon built their rep.</p>
<p>Plus:</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>…Arch Demons are further categorized by the era they were born in.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">To be exact:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bl-list">• Legends whose names have been known for over three thousand years are classified as Prehistoric.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Arch Demons at least a millennium old are Ancient.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Beings with over four hundred years of accrued knowledge are Medieval.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Demons who survived past a hundred years are Pre-Modern.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Those with more than a human life span’s worth of study are Modern.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Newborns are called Contemporary.</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break1">And at the far end of time, you had the Origin category, the very first of all demons.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>The strengths of demons are evaluated based on how long they have lived. The ruling classes of demons, the nobility ranked count or higher, are all Ancients.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Thanks for the detailed rundown, Raphael. I appreciated that bullet-point presentation. Now to use this newfound knowledge to examine the demons before me.</p>
<p>The first three were in the ruling classes, and <em>these</em> six were their subjects. I suppose this meant that the trio—and Diablo as well—were all very old demons, ranked count or higher. I may have been oblivious at the time, but I befriended some pretty notorious characters, didn’t I? It made me shiver a bit as Diablo smiled.</p>
<p>“This group, I feel, boasts <em>some</em> aspects worthy of your attention. When I regaled them with stories of your wondrous deeds, Sir Rimuru, they all broke down and begged for the chance to serve you. Thus, I decided to grant their request and let them join me.”</p>
<p>It sounded like a very moving tale, although I felt like he was making up aspects of it.</p>
<p>I took a closer look at the seven underling demons. Maybe they <em>had</em> wept, but I’m not convinced they were begging to serve under me. My evidence for this was how clearly all of them had been beaten up—with the lower-end Greater Demon in particular, I marveled at how he was even alive. Diablo really <em>was</em> making up that story, I thought. All seven of them looked like they had something to say, but none of them spoke in front of their boss. They were very well trained—or I’m sure, Diablo sternly warned them otherwise.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“From this moment, we shall ever be your faithful servants, Sir Rimuru! Please grant us your orders!”</p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-123"></a>The seven of them all bowed their heads and swore their fealty, the choir of seven hundred behind them doing the same. Seven hundred demons lying prostrate before you is quite a sight, let me tell you. Diablo observed the spectacle, smiling and nodding. He scares me. The fact that he was my ally made me breathe an internal sigh of relief. I’m <em>so</em> glad he’s on my team.</p>

<p class="tx1">As spiritual life-forms, demons must acquire physical bodies, or else they have to expend tons of magical force to manifest themselves. I didn’t want to subject them to that forever, so it’s time to get this party started.</p>
<p>The process was really simple. First, I used Belzebuth to consume the demons. Then I called upon Raphael to Combine each one with the pseudo-soul inside each incubation capsule. It worked great. Before long, all the demons had their bodies, customizing them to their liking. They’d be fully used to them in two or three days.</p>
<p>I did run into some problems with the first three, though. I didn’t want to give them the same treatment as all the demons under them. They were apparently longtime friends with Diablo, so I figured they deserved a few perks. Besides, they were beautiful, and I’m nothing if not a patron of fine beauty. If I wanted to have them drop the demon look and appear more human without affecting their appearance, that much was a snap for me. So I offered my services.</p>
<p>“Would you like me to work on your outer appearance?”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Of course I’m sure.”</p>
<p>“In that case, by all means.”</p>
<p>The white-haired beauty smiled and accepted the offer, the other two following her lead. With their consent, it was time to get started.</p>
<p>It’s tough to change someone’s appearance without adjusting their internal bone structure. My fingers were more than nimble enough <a id="page-124"></a>for the effort, and Raphael’s calculations were perfect. Forming and adjusting their looks was a cinch for me—and once their structures were set up, some magicule-flow fine-tuning should perfectly re-create their looks.</p>
<p>I also gave them a little extra, mixing gold into their magisteel skeletons to make them orichalc. If they’re friends of Diablo’s, they deserved <em>that</em> much. In this world, gold was kind of an all-purpose metal, keenly compatible with magicules and providing durability and capabilities that far surpassed magisteel.</p>
<p>They were literally beautiful down to the bone—and very appreciative.</p>
<p>“““Thank you very much, Sir Rimuru!”””</p>
<p>And if they were happy, I was just as happy.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Mission accomplished. Now we just had to wait for everyone to wake up. Oh, and it’ll be an annoyance if they don’t have names…</p>
<p>“Whoa, whoa, what are you doing in here?”</p>
<p>“Hey, hey, Rimuru! Did Diablo bring his underlings back? I wanna say hi to them— Whoa, look at <em>this</em>!”</p>
<p>Deeno, Ramiris, and Veldora had invited themselves in.</p>
<p>“Yep,” I explained to the ignorant Deeno, “Ramiris is right. Diablo’s brought his team over. They’re all demons, so I have a set of bodies for them.”</p>
<p>“No, I knew that, but…”</p>
<p>If he did, why was he acting so surprised?</p>
<p>“Well after all, if he’s gathered <em>this</em> many demons together, Diablo must be quite formidable, indeed.”</p>
<p>Oh, the numbers, huh? Yeah, there’s a lot. Veldora seemed to have a point. If I wasn’t forewarned, I probably would’ve been just as shocked.</p>
<p>“And not just that. <em>I’m</em> a little surprised, too. The three leaders over there… Is it me, or are they really, <em>really</em> old?”</p>
<p>Ramiris looked kind of put off. Deeno nodded his agreement.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said, “they’re Ancients in the ruling class, so they’ve supposedly been alive at least a thousand years.”</p>
<p><a id="page-125"></a>“Huh…?”</p>
<p>“It’s gotta be more than that, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Was it? Raphael couldn’t have made a mistake.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>…Negative. It is a difference of interpretation. With no way of knowing an exact age, estimates given are strictly estimates. If they have lived over a millennium, then it is not out of the question for them to be over 30,000 years old as well.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">I supposed that was true. Being over a thousand could potentially make you three, four, even ten thousand years old. Raphael wasn’t wrong, but it didn’t necessarily have the right estimate, either.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but it’s hard to ask a woman for her age…”</p>
<p>“Kwah-ha-ha-ha! I have learned that well. It leads to unwanted anger, to be sure.”</p>
<p>“Well, one’s age isn’t all that important anyway. If I’ve got a trio of ruling-class demons on my side, I’m not gonna ask questions.”</p>
<p>“If <em>you’re</em> fine with that, Rimuru, then so am I.”</p>
<p>“Funny way to think about it. <em>I</em> sure couldn’t do that.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh-heh… Well stated, Sir Rimuru. It is not the years in your life, but the life in your years, am I right?”</p>
<p>Um, maybe?!</p>
<p>Diablo seemed eager to close the book on the subject. As embarrassing as it was for me, I followed his lead.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Deeno and the gang had almost made me forget what I was here for, so I decided to focus on what I’d name these demons. I figured I might as well keep it simple and stick with the exotic-car theme I started with Diablo. It’s not like fighting power should be measured like the price tags of cars, but with the Ancient demons in front of me like this, I think they deserved names like that.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I boastfully stated at the three body frames in the capsules, “from now on, you three can call yourselves Testarossa, Ultima, and Carrera.”</p>
<p>The first among them had beautiful, shimmering white hair, <a id="page-126"></a>snow-like skin, and—floating amid all that blinding white—elegant, vibrant eyes and soft red lips, which reminded me of the classic Ferrari Testarossa.</p>
<p>Ultima was the perky lady with purple hair and a bubbly personality, and I thought the name perfectly suited her image. Carrera, meanwhile, was every bit a Porsche—blond locks, a cutting stare, a real leader of the pack.</p>
<p>“Wh-whoa! You can’t just name them like it’s nothing…”</p>
<p>Only Deeno voiced any concern. But the warning already came too late, so there was no point panicking about it now. Look at Ramiris and Veldora. <em>They</em> didn’t freak out about every little thing I did.</p>
<p>“Par for the course for him, I’d say.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! As if Rimuru would act any other way!”</p>
<p>There you had it.</p>
<p>As the three Arch Demons listened on, I worked them through the final stages of the body-claiming process. Muscle covered their golden frames, and in an instant, they were naked personifications of beauty. The magicules kept flowing into them, clothing their bodies. The incubation capsules shattered, unable to withstand their mystical auras. I could see why—thanks to me naming them—they had now evolved into Demon Peers, nothing like they were before. Their power was overwhelming, upgraded to a dimension beyond all common sense.</p>
<p>“Wow,” muttered Deeno. “Not even old-era demon lords like Carillon could take those guys. I couldn’t even guess how deep they go down, man. Good thing I’m not on hostile terms with Rimuru.”</p>
<p>Nobody reacted to him. Only Vester, who showed up later than the others, could be found in the corner whispering “I see nothing, ha-ha-ha, nothing. I know nothing; I’m not involved in this…” The way he was slapping himself on the head and talking incoherently made me feel a little sorry for the guy, but let’s just pretend I didn’t see that.</p>
<p class="space-break1">This wrapped up my work for the day. I didn’t want to drain my magicules all at once, so I proceeded with caution, giving names <a id="page-127"></a>only when I was confident I had the wherewithal for it. Three a day seemed like a good limit.</p>
<p>Thus, the next few days were spent on a naming spree. I gave out the following names, in order of strength:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bl-list">• Moss</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Veyron</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Agera</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Esprit</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Zonda</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Cien</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Venom</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break1">Testarossa’s underlings were Moss and Cien, Ultima had Veyron and Zonda, and Agera and Esprit worked for Carrera. Venom, meanwhile, was Diablo’s wild card favorite. Even with Testarossa and the other two alone, I held command over three Demon Peers, which was an insane amount of force. But that was only the start of it.</p>
<p>All seven evolved immediately after I named them, stepping out of their incubation capsules like everything was normal. Two of them had become Demon Peers; four others remained as Arch Demons but seemed a little different—I can’t explain how too well, but it’s like the blinders had been taken off. Venom also evolved into an Arch Demon, greatly boosting his own fighting power.</p>
<p>To me, it was so much of a surprise that my brain just shut off. I mean, Demon Peers aren’t beings you see just pop up all the time. They were legendary figures, more powerful than your average demon lord, and (counting Diablo) I currently had six of them within my borders. Now they weren’t seeming so rare to me. What was I even gonna <em>do</em> with all this force? I wanted to procure people strong in things like politics and economics. Could they handle that stuff? I sincerely doubted it, but I guessed we’d have to try it out…</p>
<p>As I pondered this, I started thinking up names for the remaining seven hundred. This was my promise to Diablo, and I wanted <a id="page-128"></a>to see it through to the end. I had, as it turned out, made some miscalculations—Raphael informed me that the magicules that had already built up in the incubation capsules would be enough to name them with. That was good news. Just the motivation I needed, in fact, because I whipped through the whole naming process in just two days.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Now these seven hundred were prostrating themselves before me. Most of them were Lesser Demons to start with, but with a name and a physical body, they had evolved into Greater Demons. As expected, they had all gained enough magicules to be firmly A-ranked territory, and now I had seven hundred of them at my beck and call.</p>
<p>Not that I’m one to talk, but something about this screamed “stat inflation” to me. Some of them even looked for all the world like Arch Demons. Did I just have another <em>oops</em> moment? It was simply astonishing. I mean, the first three alone—Testarossa, Ultima, and Carrera—were more than enough already. But it was too late to turn back now. Let’s pretend that I didn’t notice anything. That was probably the best way to preserve my sanity.</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru, I cannot contain my joy upon receiving such a wonderful name. And all this force! Please allow me to continue granting you my absolute loyalty!”</p>
<p>Testarossa spoke for everyone there when she addressed me. I nodded my approval. Sure, have a blast, guys.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, this was all Diablo’s fault, wasn’t it? All <em>I</em> did was keep my promise. <em>I’m sure he’ll educate them for me and stuff.</em> As irresponsible as it was, that’s what I wanted to think.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="image" class="ornament1" src="../Images/Art_sborn1.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">As Rimuru was attempting to escape reality…</p>
<p>“Black— Er, Diablo, I think I understand why you are so enamored of Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“Yes! Amazing, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>“He saw us for what we really were, and he concluded that we <a id="page-129"></a>were not a threat worth considering. Even that old demon lord Deeno turned white as a sheet when he saw us…”</p>
<p>Testarossa and the other two demon leaders were talking among themselves. Rimuru had no way of knowing, but this group had zero intention at all of swearing loyalty to him when they had first showed up. Their old friend Diablo had only convinced them to lend him their powers for a little while.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>They had lived a long time, becoming the strongest their world had to offer—as were the demons who served them. Two of them were even defined as Prehistoric by humankind—and over all those years, neither of those demons had tasted defeat even once.</p>
<p>This was Moss and Veyron. Moss—an archduke in the demon realms, second in power only to the Origin, a spotless battle record for tens of thousands of years. Veyron—an old, crafty marquis-class noble whose life spanned over four thousand years. He had been defeated by Moss several times before, reincarnating himself each time.</p>
<p>The other servants were no pushovers, either. Agera, a viscount and a Pre-Modern demon. Esprit, also a viscount, who boasted a streak of victories dating back over the past five hundred years. Zonda, a baron who’d been undefeated for three hundred years. Cien, another baron with a similarly long record.</p>
<p>Agera was a special case, a demon who’d been undefeated for three centuries after bowing to the force of Carrera. He preferred fighting with a sword over magic, a rarity among demons. Meanwhile, Esprit, Zonda, and Cien had (like Veyron) repeatedly resurrected themselves. They all got their starts long ago, very close to the Origin’s own family tree. Venom was another special case, a demon born with a unique skill; he hadn’t lived very long, but his growth and maturation were noteworthy.</p>
<p>Diablo had rounded up this band of standout demons for his plan—and Rimuru, oblivious to all this, just casually gave them names after a moment’s thought, an incredibly reckless move. As <a id="page-130"></a>a result, every demon reborn here had obtained power beyond the natural ways of the world. They were now an unimaginable force, a great assemblage of demons feared by all. Despite numbering less than a thousand, they were an army all by themselves.</p>
<p>They would later come to be known as the Black Corps, Tempest’s most powerful military and a horrifying symbol of fear. And the Black Corps was born the moment they were unleashed from their capsules.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There was a slight blush to Testarossa’s lily-white cheeks as she spoke in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s so fascinating. It’s far more exciting to look at him instead of going through this cycle of destroying nations or jostling for territory with both of you.”</p>
<p>Ultima nodded. “Yeah, something tells me it’ll be a lot more entertaining working in this country instead of the old grind of torturing out-of-line demons.”</p>
<p>“You’re right,” said Carrera. “Like you said, Sir Rimuru is an amazing figure. He just brushed away the Coercion I threw at him, like I was a naughty kitten! Accepting him as my lord was a truly tempting proposal—and now that I’ve accepted his name, he’s got every bit of my loyalty.”</p>
<p>“I almost killed you when you tried that, you know.”</p>
<p>Diablo was looking serious but let it slide without major comment, perhaps realizing Carrera wasn’t lying.</p>
<p>“Oh, right,” interjected Testarossa. “Diablo, I need to thank you. When you spoke to me, I really did think about killing you.”</p>
<p>“I’m aware. You always <em>were</em> that type of woman. But why did you accept my request at all? I thought you would keep challenging me until I convinced you…”</p>
<p>The Original White that Diablo knew had an intense personality. She never accepted what anyone said at face value. Battles between demons tended to focus on the knowledge and technical levels of the fighters involved, and even as a Demon Peer, Diablo <a id="page-131"></a>wasn’t completely sure he could defeat the Original White in battle. That’s why he found her behavior so fascinating.</p>
<p>“Well, we <em>are</em> strong, as you know. Did you think there was anyone in this world stronger than us demons?”</p>
<p>“No,” Diablo replied with a smile. It made Testarossa smile even wider.</p>
<p>“Right? Of course not. And that’s why, Diablo. I’ve taken an interest in this master you cherish so much, someone capable of charming one of my cohorts in strength and power. If he proved a trifle, I would have considered killing him.”</p>
<p>“As would I.”</p>
<p>“Heh. I’m not exactly itching to any longer, but I was planning to pick a fight with him first thing.”</p>
<p>Diablo rolled his eyes, a touch irritated. “I appreciate you not causing an embarrassing scene in front of Sir Rimuru for me, but if you were actually intent on trying that…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Diablo. You take pride in your name, and just like you, I am tremendously proud of the name Testarossa that Sir Rimuru gave me. By that name, I swear my loyalty to him, and I am sure Ultima and Carrera feel the same way.”</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>“Yes, as I said before.”</p>
<p>The three girls nodded in unison. Diablo shook his head, giving them a “What <em>will</em> I do with you?” look.</p>
<p>“Of course, I doubt the other rank and filers besides you three will be of much use to Sir Rimuru…but so be it. I don’t want you to cause me any more trouble, so I <em>will</em> expect you to follow Sir Rimuru’s and my orders.”</p>
<p>“So be it, indeed! I must repay you for introducing me to Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“Oh, uh, I’m in agreement, too!”</p>
<p>“If I can help out Sir Rimuru and dispense of <em>you</em> as well, all the better. Until then, I will allow you to command me.”</p>
<p>Diablo still felt irritated, but if Testarossa and the others promised to heed his orders, he felt no further need to remain. There existed in the world only a small number of people Diablo was <a id="page-132"></a>willing to put up with, and the girls’ being a part of this list demonstrated just how unique they were.</p>
<p>And so unbeknownst to Rimuru, the chain of command was set in stone.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">

<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="image" class="ornament1" src="../Images/Art_sborn1.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">…This is the sort of conversation Diablo reportedly had, or didn’t have, or whatever, as he gave me his report. I was trying to enjoy a little peace for a change, but ah well.</p>
<p>“…And that is how we worked matters out. They are now under my command, but there’s still no telling what kind of nonsense they might pull. I’m sure you have little to worry about from them, Sir Rimuru, but regardless, stay on your guard!”</p>
<p>“Um, all right…”</p>
<p>What was he going on about? <em>He’s</em> the one who brought them over here! But it was too late to rant and rave about it. I just wanted one day of peace and harmony in my life, and now it looks like I had more problems. And here I thought we had more allies now…</p>
<p>Of course, I didn’t have the slightest idea how true any of this was, and if they’re under Diablo’s command, they’re all his responsibility anyway. What? What about the guy who appointed him? Gee, I dunno, who <em>was</em> that?</p>
<p>So I decided to just toss the problem completely aside.</p>
