<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter003">OBSERVATION, RESEARCH, RESULTS</a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page-17"></a>In one corner of an opulent mansion, a shady-looking group was relaxing on sofas surrounding a table. The site was a base used by the Cerberus secret society in the West, run by Misha the Lover, one of the group’s bosses.</p>
<p>The woman attending to Misha provided tea for the guests, bowed, and left the room. That was the signal for the conference to begin.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Ah, I see. It went well, then?” Listening to the report, Yuuki Kagurazaka smiled broadly.</p>
<p>“He went exactly the way you said he would, Boss! And I thought for sure Laplace messed it up at first…”</p>
<p>“Hoh-hoh-hoh! Laplace is a careful man, but he’s not a born negotiator, after all.”</p>
<p>“Whoa, hang on! I’m better’n any of <em>you</em> guys!”</p>
<p>Teare and Footman only seemed to be on the same page when they were picking on Laplace. He complained loudly about it but wasn’t truly offended. It was just some friendly banter.</p>
<p>“Well, it all worked out, didn’t it? I’m just glad you managed to keep your cool with Leon right in front of you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. ’Cause honestly, I half expected you’d resort to violence in there.”</p>
<p><a id="page-18"></a>If it did, all it meant was cutting off ties with the demon lord Leon. Now that they had decided to lay off the Western Nations for a while, Yuuki laughed the concept off as no great shakes.</p>
<p>“He was a terrible man, I tell ya,” the dejected-looking Laplace said. “But why’d you have me tell him about the kids anyway?”</p>
<p>Yuuki shot him a half grin. “Oh, it’s nothing, really. Leon’s trying to collect ‘incomplete’ kids, and I’m all but certain that’s so he can expand his fighting power…but part of me wondered if there’s something else behind it, you know?”</p>
<p>“Ah. So you wanted to reveal to him that the demon lord Rimuru has five of them?”</p>
<p>“Not just that. We can still only guess at how Leon’s treating these kids, you know? Rimuru saved them by showing them how to handle spiritual force, but Leon doesn’t know about any of that. So I was interested to see how he’d react to these children he thinks are doomed to die pretty soon.”</p>
<p>“I see… That is a curious question, yes. And depending on his reaction, we can try predicting his next move.”</p>
<p>“Right. For now, we’ve got nothin’. We needed to jolt ’im a little, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you see? I mean, it was more out of curiosity than anything, though. That’s just how I am. I sweat the small stuff.”</p>
<p>Kagali and Laplace could appreciate that. As Yuuki said, he was worrying himself too much about this…but if they wanted to peer into Leon’s intentions, that piece of info was a useful way to do it.</p>
<p>What if the demon lord Leon took action? He wasn’t rash enough to take on Rimuru just to gain five more fighters for his side. The risk of riling him far outweighed the potential boost to his forces. Leon was smart enough to see that. Normally, then, he’d let these children be—but what if he didn’t? If he didn’t, it meant Leon had some other goal in mind.</p>
<p>“However,” Kagali said, “I doubt Leon would do anything drastic just for the sake of a few children.”</p>
<p>“You don’t think? ’Cause I leaked info on that war and got nothin’ but funny looks for it. Was I wastin’ my time?”</p>
<p>It would have been pretty interesting if Leon made a move, but <a id="page-19"></a>the chances of that were low. Kagali and Laplace saw the wit of Yuuki’s idea, but both assumed that it wouldn’t amount to much.</p>
<p>All Yuuki could do in response was grin at them. “Yeah, like I said, I’m sorry. But unless you massaged it like that, it would’ve been weird if you just talked about the kids out of nowhere. If you started with that, then with <em>your</em> acting skills, I dunno…”</p>
<p>He paused. But his intentions came across well enough to the group.</p>
<p>“I hate to say it, but it’s true. Footman’s too tongue-tied and short-tempered, Laplace is shallow and fishy-looking, and I alone could never have pulled it off.”</p>
<p>Teare, acting entirely blameless, made Laplace roll his eyes and Footman sneer at her. This, too, was often how their conversations went. But then Teare seemed to recall something.</p>
<p>“Maybe I’m overthinking it like you said, Boss, but there’s something that bothered me a little, too.”</p>
<p>“Oh? What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Well, when Footman rattled off the list of goods, Leon was all—”</p>
<p>“Leon?”</p>
<p>“He asked about the names again. When Footman said <em>Scoey Colbert</em>, he replied along the lines of ‘<em>Are you sure it’s Scoey and not Chloe?</em>’ If he claimed that the names didn’t matter, I don’t see why he would even care, but…”</p>
<p>“Ah, he’s just high-strung like that, y’know? He fusses over the details.”</p>
<p>“Hoh-hoh-hoh! So irritating, isn’t it? Maybe he was just poking some fun at my pronunciation.”</p>
<p>Laplace and Footman saw no major concern. Yuuki and Kagali, meanwhile, exchanged looks.</p>
<p>“What do you think?”</p>
<p>“I doubt he would’ve reacted if he truly didn’t care.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but really, there’s no way he… That’s just too much of a coincidence, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Well, if it’s fate we’re dealing with, there’s no such thing as never, you know…”</p>
<p><a id="page-20"></a>“So you think he really…?”</p>
<p>“It would indicate to me that yes, the demon lord Leon’s primary goal is that girl Chloe.”</p>
<p>“Seriously?”</p>
<p>Yuuki looked stunned. If that possibility was correct, it meant they had just inadvertently tossed away their upper hand against Leon. Kagali, meanwhile, was even more frustrated. The anger was written all over her face. If <em>that</em> was Leon’s goal all along, then her comrade Clayman wouldn’t have had to be killed.</p>
<p>“Um… Huh?”</p>
<p>Teare couldn’t hide her surprise at the unexpected possibilities that sprung from her observation. But it was the cold, heartless truth.</p>
<p>“Are you kidding me?”</p>
<p>“Is that what you really think?”</p>
<p>Yuuki and Kagali were born schemers; that much was true, but not even they had insight into everything. They always thought two or three steps ahead, ensuring they could handle any situation that arose after failure. Laplace knew that well, but even he thought they were overreacting this time—and Footman solemnly nodded his agreement.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s still just a possibility. Not one we can afford to ignore, but nothing’s set in stone yet.”</p>
<p>“So your curiosity didn’t cost us anything after all, huh, Boss?”</p>
<p>“Cost? Hell, it might’ve earned us a hell of a lot!”</p>
<p>“Right. I don’t want to expect too much, but if things turn out that way, wouldn’t it be pretty fun? And if we work things right, we could use this to pit a couple of annoying demon lords against each other. That’s a win-win on our end, I’d say.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s not like it matters to us who wins in that case. Let’s just frame this as more fun in the wings.”</p>
<p>“Hoh-hoh-hoh! I still think we’re overreacting, but it’s no harm done.”</p>
<p>“Well, no need to go overboard on the expectations. It’s not like everything’s gonna go the way we want it, y’know?”</p>
<p>Laplace, sensing everyone relaxing a bit on the issue, attempted <a id="page-21"></a>to sum matters up. Once the group nodded in understanding, it was time to move on to a different subject.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Misha called for her attendant and got another round of tea going.</p>
<p>“So how ’bout you update us on <em>your</em> stuff, Boss?” Laplace asked after a brief break.</p>
<p>“Yeah… I’m concerned about the Chloe thing, but we can focus more on that later. Let’s move on to the main topic.”</p>
<p>Yuuki nodded at Laplace and took a sip. Then he smiled and went over the fruits of his negotiations.</p>
<p>While Laplace and his cohorts were dealing with Leon, Yuuki’s side was involved in high-level talks of their own—with the shadowy figure that ran the Western Nations. The topic: how to clean up after the whole Maribel affair.</p>
<p>“As you all know, the cover story is that I was under Maribel’s control, so she’s taking the entire blame for this.”</p>
<p>“Ah, and now you’re workin’ to back up that story?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. I mean, if I was under her thrall, I couldn’t really head out to the Eastern Empire, could I?”</p>
<p>“No, you’re right.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“I thought that was kind of off, too.”</p>
<p>“Regarding this Avarice power, it was a toss-up whether I’d be able to grab it from her. More than that, my main aim was just to get Maribel killed—after she was, I’d be free to move around again. So once I firmed up that position for myself, I thought it was time to negotiate with the venerable Granville Rozzo.”</p>
<p>Yuuki’s sights had been aimed squarely at Maribel. He needed to distract her so he didn’t completely lose his position in the West—and eventually, that distraction led to her death. With her out of the picture, Yuuki had his free will back, and anything nefarious he did before could be framed as Maribel’s orders. And it worked. Maribel was gone, and Yuuki had obtained powers far beyond what he expected. The negotiations went similarly well—and what he heard there was the main reason why Yuuki called for this meeting.</p>
<p><a id="page-22"></a>“So if you don’t mind me starting at the conclusion, we have one more job to do before we head east.”</p>
<p>He glanced at the surprised faces surrounding him, trying to look serious.</p>
<p>“Got that? Now let me give you all the details, start to finish.”</p>
<p>With that, Yuuki began describing his conference with Granville.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">We were at peace. And in Rimuru, the capital of Tempest, every day was packed for me.</p>
<p>Once things calmed down a bit, I sent out another ruins expedition team, but they didn’t find a body or anything. Either Yuuki was telling the truth, and she blew herself up, or he’d done something with her. Regardless, any issues stemming from this incident had already been swept away. Maribel was a princess of the Kingdom of Seltrozzo, but spreading word that she attacked us in the ruins would just aggravate the situation. So I contacted Seltrozzo on the sly and had them chalk it up as an “accident,” something made possible by our mutual desires to keep it from becoming a Big Thing. Once you’re an old-enough royal family, “accidents” are just part of the package, so our arrangements went pretty smoothly.</p>
<p>Still, their king and queen just seemed so emotionless to me. Under <em>those</em> parents, I could see why she relied on her knowledge from her past life so much. Had Maribel gotten to enjoy a normal, innocent childhood in her new life, would things have turned out differently? I couldn’t help but wonder, as much of a what-if thing that was.</p>
<p>And that brings me to the Five Elders. Granville Rozzo—eldest of them all, boss of the Rozzo family—was the real puppet master pulling Maribel’s strings. I’d been steeling myself for some kind of retribution toward us, but there had been nothing. Perhaps they were admitting they were up to some no-good antics and decided not to respond as long as we kept our mouths shut. It’d been over a month, actually, and Granville had kept mum—and that was more than enough time for our needs, too.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of Soei’s information and grasping the goings-on <a id="page-23"></a>in the Western Nations underground, we were now sure there was no greater threat over there than the Rozzos. We did pick up on a few groups of interest—along the same lines as the Sons of the Veldt, that mercenary team—but it wasn’t clear whether any of them shared in our interests. If they were clearly hostile, that was another matter, but we had no reason to rile them. I didn’t want to go prodding any hornet’s nests I didn’t have to, so I decided to just keep tabs on their movements.</p>
<p>We were on good terms with the Free Guild and enjoyed the backing of the Western Holy Church. Really, I don’t think any organization was big enough by now to pick a fight with us. It was only natural, then, that Tempest was now leading the largest faction in the Council of the West.</p>
<p class="space-break1">At the start of another peaceful afternoon, we were holding our regular cabinet meeting. In what amounted to the blink of an eye, our nation had all but taken the place of the Five Elders…and maybe that’s why we had this pile of new issues to deal with.</p>
<p>The Council of the West, after all, played an enormous rule in establishing consensus among the Western Nations. Councillors voted on measures to enact, which basically meant that the more councillors you sent, the more of a say you had. Now that I had at least <em>some</em> goods on every nation in there, though, the group’s members looked upon our representatives as mediators of sorts. Our rising influence in the West thus meant the number of complaints and petitions sent our way was skyrocketing. Talk is cheap, of course, and apparently a lot of people were taking advantage of the bargain to push their pet projects.</p>
<p><em>This</em> is exactly why world domination is such a stupid idea. I don’t think you get a single chance to take it easy if you’re in a ruling position. Now I understood why the other demon lords didn’t seem to care much about lands outside their boundaries. If you wind up inadvertently taking over some destitute area or another, you’re obligated to address whatever people are dissatisfied about there. People talk about eliminating disparities like it’s easy, but from the eyes of the one doing it, it never went that way.</p>
<p><a id="page-24"></a>The <em>right</em> way, I imagine, is to take that region’s assets—their labor, their resources—cover the expenses, and redistribute the resulting profits. You want to be careful with siphoning in wealth from other regions, because you might start to have <em>real</em> inequality on your hands then. Now that our nation led the largest faction, the other nations were looking for payback. We can shut them out for now, but before very long, we’re bound to have an opposition on our hands.</p>
<p>The question now became who we’d send to the Council as our permanent representative. We needed someone smart, sociable, and possessing a certain amount of charisma. Ideally, someone with the force to talk someone into submission, but…</p>
<p>“Also, sorry, but I’m out.”</p>
<p>With this sort of thing, the first person to speak up wins. I will admit to having the gift of gab, but I had zero intention of taking on more trouble for myself.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure I can, either,” Benimaru said right after me. “The previous Council meeting taught me all too well that I don’t have the stomach for those mind games. In a battlefield with no physical combat allowed, I’m as good as useless.”</p>
<p>I felt he was being a bit modest, but he likely meant most of it. Benimaru certainly <em>would</em> have trouble against all those sly old nobles.</p>
<p>“My mission is intelligence gathering. I cannot afford to leave my position as Rimuru’s ‘eyes.’”</p>
<p>Soei was out, too. That much I expected. I didn’t want to lose him, either.</p>
<p>Geld bowed out as well. He had common sense, and I knew I could rely on him, but I had left a mountain of important work in his hands. Our construction schedule was packed, and he definitely didn’t have the time to take on more. I thought Geld would be a fine councillor, but I would have to eliminate that choice for the time being.</p>
<p>Which left…</p>
<p>“Ah, um, me?!”</p>
<p>I passed a quick glance at Gabil, quietly taking in the proceedings <a id="page-25"></a>up to now. Gabil, surprisingly enough, was a pretty sensible person, and I could, you know, <em>maybe</em> see him shining in this important post.</p>
<p>…Well, all right, there was a <em>lot</em> to be anxious about with him. But there was really no one else. Hakuro was my military adviser, charged with building up our soldiers. Shuna could be trusted for the job, but if she left for that, it’d impact work around our own nation. Rigurd and the other goblin elders were off the list for similar reasons. We had tons of thorny issues to tackle—a legal system for our new nation, negotiations with other countries, managing our growing population, and much more. They were taking the lead on all those issues, and if Shuna or Rigurd departed, it could grind the whole thing to a halt. We were training a new generation of leaders, yes, but I wanted to see them grow some more first.</p>
<p>“I—I am in the midst of a project to capture and bring back wyverns to train as mounts to improve our air offense. It requires the extensive use of a great number of types of potions, so I would like to continue recording data for this project…”</p>
<p>Ah yes. There was no doubting that Gabil was the right (lizard) man for the job. It seemed better to let him nurture our budding wyvern force than send him off to the Council against his will.</p>
<p>“All right. Gabil, keep up your current work.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir! Understood, sir!!”</p>
<p>Gabil was visibly relieved. I didn’t want to force him into anything, so this, I thought, was fine.</p>
<p>You know, maybe I’ve wound up expanding our forces in too much of a hurry. It was a poor idea to spread my hand out when I didn’t have enough trained personnel, but the workload just kept on rising. It was a problem, but ah well. Let’s see if there are any other choices.</p>
<p>…And just as I thought that, my eyes settled on Shion. She was staring at me, all asparkle.</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru, I—”</p>
<p>“Denied!”</p>
<p>I reflexively cut her off. She was volunteering, I assumed, but she was out of the question.</p>
<p><a id="page-26"></a>“Wh-why?!” she asked, surprised. The question itself was also a surprise to me.</p>
<p>“Let’s just pretend, for a moment, that you were a councillor. And let’s say there’s some pudgy, leering elderly man in front of you. Another councillor. And now this councillor’s placed his hand on your shoulder, all friendly like. How would you handle that?”</p>
<p>“It’s obvious. I would grab the man’s neck with my left hand, lift him up, and <em>punch and punch and punch</em>!!”</p>
<p><em>Bzzzzt!!</em></p>
<p>Hence why she wasn’t in the running. Shion’s grown, I’ll admit. I had no doubt about that, but there were still a lot of situations that made me anxious with her.</p>
<p>Like before, for example…</p>
<p class="space-break1">I found Shion in the dining hall. She gave me a big smile and presented the dish in her hand.</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru! I’ve been waiting for you. I’ve finally made a cake all by myself! Here you go! It tastes the same as Lady Shuna’s cooking, with several times the quantity. Please, go ahead and try it!!”</p>
<p>I was already regretting this. But Shion was proving to be a capable tea brewer…and that must’ve put me off guard.</p>
<p>“Um… Thanks. Appreciate it.”</p>
<p>Unconsciously, I accepted it. That was a mistake. A large block of something resembling opaque Jell-O was on the plate. My face fell. <em>Uh, this is</em> cake<em>?</em></p>
<p>Staring at this object, I looked around for assistance, but nobody was there. Did they all escape? No, Gobichi was at his post…sprawled out on the kitchen floor. So there’s one victim.</p>
<p>I now realized I had visited the dining hall at the worst moment possible. But it was too late.</p>
<p>“Hey…um, this is…cake, you say?”</p>
<p>“Yes! I’ve perfectly re-created the taste!”</p>
<p>The <em>taste</em> is perfect? So everything else about it is awful? Shion certainly <em>seemed</em> confident, and watching her only made more butterflies materialize in my stomach.</p>
<p><a id="page-27"></a>Regretting my carelessness, I decided to take a single bite. You could predict the results.</p>
<p>I scooped up just a bit with my spoon and brought it ever so slowly to my mouth. I thought I was going to immediately retch. It <em>felt</em> like Jell-O, but the taste was all sugary-sweet cake. It was gray in color, and the feel was decidedly gelatinous. It instantly reminded me how important the look of a cake was to the overall experience. Well, not just cake. With any kind of food, visuals are key. If you just tossed a bunch of ingredients on a plate, nobody would find that appetizing.</p>
<p>“What do you think? It’s good, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>She smirked at me. I know she wanted to say “It’s <em>perfect</em>, isn’t it?” But she just lacked the fundamentals. And by fundamentals, I meant she was tripping over the entire definition of what food is.</p>
<p>“Sit down. Sit down there, please. We need to talk!”</p>
<p>“Huh?! Wh-what’s wrong…?”</p>
<p>Shion’s smirk melted into a pair of teary eyes. Her head was already tilted downward, but I didn’t let that stop me.</p>
<p>The ensuing lecture lasted a very earnest thirty minutes, as I explained to Shion what cooking was. She seemed remorseful, at least, and she promised that next time she’d discuss things with someone else and follow their advice.</p>
<p class="space-break1">…And so forth.</p>
<p>After that lecture, I recalled that when Shion was practicing her tea service, Diablo was guiding her through it. He claimed that a mere taste test of her work upset his stomach, and such sacrifices on his part were what helped Shion grow so well. If I let her practice by herself, she’d never notice where she was going wrong. Leaving her to her own devices, then, was a mistake. No matter what the task was, Shion always relied on her innate special skills to get fast results. It’s hard to grow that way. She needed someone overseeing her.</p>
<p>Thus, there was no possible way I could name Shion as a councillor. If she caused any kind of problem in the Council, it could shatter <a id="page-28"></a>the relationship I’d taken all this effort to build with humankind. And if I wanted someone there to stop her if she flew off the handle, I had a pretty limited pool to pick from in this nation. If I <em>did</em> have someone like that, it’d be far more effective to just name <em>them</em> councillor.</p>
<p>Like Diablo, maybe.</p>
<p>“I think Diablo could handle it pretty well…”</p>
<p>I kind of let my true feelings fall from my lips. Everyone in the meeting room nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, Diablo would put us all at ease.”</p>
<p>“It’d be easy for him to cajole those nobles into doing our bidding.”</p>
<p>“And I doubt he’d ever back down against violence or take bribes.”</p>
<p>Rigurd, Benimaru, and Gabil all deeply trusted Diablo. Shuna and Shion joined them.</p>
<p>“With his brains and cleverness, I’m sure he’d make things go your way, Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“I hate to admit it, but my undersecretary is a talented man. Besides, if he can get out of my hair and go to Englesia for me, my job as <em>first</em> secretary will be more important than ever! I’m not sure you’d find anyone more qualified.”</p>
<p>They all seemed in agreement. Shion had less virtuous motives, perhaps, but there was no doubting her appreciation for his ability. Nobody voiced any objections, and there were no other brilliant proposals, so we settled on Diablo as being our top candidate.</p>
<p>But I’m sure he’ll hate it…</p>
<p>“Y’know, I get the feeling he’s going to despise doing odd-job work like that. That’s why he’s gone out to look for minions of his own, and for all I know, maybe he’ll find someone good at negotiating for me. So for now, let’s call Diablo the main candidate, subject to future changes.”</p>
<p>That seemed good for now.</p>
<p>Of course, until we actually pick someone, it’d be me showing up for Council meetings. I wanted someone else in there fast, so hopefully, I thought, Diablo would be kind enough to come back soon.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">This was an urgent issue, sure, but for the most part, it was <em>my</em> problem. Fortunately, after deciding to wait on Diablo, the conference ended without any other major hiccups.</p>
<p>Nothing beats peace. It’s a good thing, not having any problems, and it’s even better to have free time to enjoy. So I decided to pay a visit to Kurobe. Why? Because thanks to having some more time on my hands, I had discovered something I wanted to talk about.</p>
<p>I called for him upon entering his workshop.</p>
<p>“Kurobe! You got a moment?”</p>
<p>I waved at the nervous-looking apprentices as I went to the inner room. There, I found Kurobe observing a row of several swords.</p>
<p>“Ah, Sir Rimuru! Just who I wanted to see. There’s something I wanted to report to you about, actually.”</p>
<p>“Oh, to me? What’s up?”</p>
<p>If he had something to report, it was likely some new work of his. He always gave form to my ideas, working with Kaijin to develop all kinds of things, so presumably he had created some other useful item for me. And I was right.</p>
<p>“Well, regarding the thing you asked about earlier, I think I have a complete version!”</p>
<p>Kurobe pointed at the swords in front of him, in all shapes and sizes. Judging by how happy he looked, I assumed they were pretty special. But what did he mean by what <em>I’d</em> asked about earlier? I blather on about all sorts of nonsense on the regular, so I couldn’t recall exactly what he was referring to.</p>
<p>But a quick Assessment took care of that.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Understood. This weapon is a broadsword—level: Unique.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Ooh, it <em>is</em> a Unique! And if Kurobe crafted it, it’s <em>got</em> to be quality. But I didn’t think that’d be enough to make Kurobe act so self-assured around me like this.</p>
<p>With his talents, he could forge several Uniques a month. If <a id="page-30"></a>he employed his usual methods, he could finish up a blade in one day. These averaged Unique in quality; even if they were “failures,” they were still in the upper echelon of Rares. If he was more thorough with his work, that took two or three days, but it pretty much always resulted in something Unique or better. He was still far away from crafting a Legend-class weapon, it seemed, but I really believed he’d do it someday. Plus, if you had a talented fighter wielding one of his blades, that alone could progress it up to Legend, I thought.</p>
<p>He chose all his materials carefully, using only the purest of magisteel. Weapons made from that took on the will of their owner to evolve further, so I really didn’t think it was long before we’d see our first Kurobe-forged Legend-class blade. Thus, I assumed he wouldn’t go <em>this</em> far out of his way to show off some more Uniques, but…</p>
<p>I took a closer look at the broadsword. The most notable thing on it was the marble-size depressions at its base—three of them. Otherwise, nothing stood out. It was a perfectly capable sword, of course, but I wouldn’t say it stood out of the pack among Kurobe’s creations. (If one of his apprentices was behind it, that was another story.)</p>
<p>This might be a strange thing to say, but it was a completely normal Unique. There was no special inscription magic applied to it, apparently… But hang on. <em>Now</em> I saw something.</p>
<p>“What is this? It’s an impressive Unique but nothing too rare for you, is it?”</p>
<p>Hiding my excitement, I pretended not to spot it.</p>
<p>“Oh, did you forget? Heh-heh-heh-heh… This is <em>special</em>, this is. It looks like a normal weapon at first glance, and no magic’s been applied to it, but you won’t believe what it features.”</p>
<p>At this point in time, not even my—well, Raphael’s—Analyze and Assess skill could find any unusual effects to it. If it was what I thought it was, perhaps I <em>should</em> expect a lot.</p>
<p>As I stood there, heart thumping, Kurobe took out a glowing ball, then casually installed it in the hilt.</p>
<p>“Just stick it in a hole like this, and then…”</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><a id="page-31"></a><em>Report. The weapon broadsword has transformed into the magical weapon broadsword.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>Aha!</em></p>
<p>What was once a regular weapon was now a magical one. So that crazy idea of mine was finally in production?</p>
<p>“Whoa! You really completed it?”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh! So you <em>have</em> noticed, Sir Rimuru? That’s right. This is the exact mechanism you described to me!”</p>
<p>Right, right. I <em>did</em> discuss this idea with him. I knew Kurobe was always working on his research, but I had no idea he wrapped this up so quickly. It almost scared me. He was a taciturn man, never one to brag about his achievements, but his work explained with perfect eloquence how great he was. Truly, a role model for all artisans.</p>
<p>“Wow! Kurobe! I mean… <em>Kurobe!</em> This is amazing! Seriously, this is the most amazing invention ever!”</p>
<p>I was now audibly excited. Kurobe gave me a satisfied smile and a strong nod.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee… Wonderful.”</p>
<p>Now he was smirking. I had almost never seen a smirk look so natural on someone’s face before. Shion’s smirk mostly irritated me, but here, I just had to hand it to Kurobe.</p>
<p>There were several ways to craft magic weapons. In my case, I could use Raphael’s Combine/Disassemble skill to easily apply magic effects to just about anything. Kurobe could do something similar, but Kaijin and their apprentices didn’t have the ability to cheat like that.</p>
<p>What did they do, then? The most common way was to have an enchanter inscribe something on it. Dold knew how to do that, so he would come around to inscribe what this workshop finished. This “completed” the magic weapon, and then you just had to run some magic power into the inscription to trigger the designated spell. But you could only infuse a weapon with so many different spells—two was usually the limit—and once you inscribed a spell, there was no removing it.</p>
<p><a id="page-32"></a>The other method, as I think I’ve mentioned a few times before, has to do with how the weapon evolves. Once it’s exposed to the magic force of the user, weapons will often have certain extra powers applied to them. It’s tough to aim for this, and it takes a lot of time, but sometimes a weapon gains unexpected force. This method was also the subject of ongoing research toward a way to streamline weapon evolution. (By the way, I had donated part of the large cache of Unique weapons we obtained at the Amrita ruins toward this research. I wasn’t expecting it to lead to quick results, of course, but it’s important we kept up a continual effort.)</p>
<p>So what had Kurobe just made? Oh, just something that rendered everything that came before it obsolete.</p>
<p>I first brought up this idea while drinking with Kaijin and Kurobe. First, we’d take a sturdy magisteel weapon, perfect for the transmission of magic. Next, we’d create a set of magic-generating external plug-in “cores.” Then, I theorized, you could have a magic weapon that wasn’t hardwired for just one spell or the other.</p>
<p>For example, what if you placed a magical stone infused with elemental force in a sword? The answer was the blade before me. And it wasn’t just some magic stone in there—it was a high-purity jewel.</p>
<p>“What do you think, Sir Rimuru? Just like you pictured it? So here’s a sword with holes ready for magical expansions. And meanwhile, Kaijin’s succeeded in compressing magicules into these pure, refined magic crystals!”</p>
<p>Kurobe held his nose in the air. So Kaijin <em>was</em> part of this. Generally, it was Kurobe who forged the base weapon and Kaijin who put in the jewels and other final touches. It took the two of them working together to complete something as wonderful as this, I assumed.</p>
<p>“We call these element-infused magic stones ‘element cores.’ We just call ’em cores around the workshop. Gabil’s been out capturing wyverns, so since Vester had some free time, he helped with the research, too. Those two had been working on spirit cores, you know—a kind of power reactor, right? So he said they already had a way to infuse magic stones with the four primary elements of earth, water, fire, and wind.”</p>
<p><a id="page-33"></a>I recalled Ramiris lecturing me about how it was key for a spirit core to generate all the elements at the once, or something. If Kaijin’s team was working on that, making stones with just one element must’ve been simple by comparison. Beyond that, it was all about adjusting the core sizes and output levels, and there you had it—an element core composed of one of the four basic elements.</p>
<p>These were, of course, disposable items. Once the magic inside it ran out, it was just another pretty jewel. But Kurobe told me that these could be reused if brought back here.</p>
<p>“So there’s no way to recharge the energy inside?”</p>
<p>“Oh, there is. But it requires an experienced magic user infusing their own force into the core, so it’s not for laypersons.”</p>
<p>“I see. Sounds like it could create some new jobs. Like, workshops you could bring weapons to and have them charge up their magic for you.”</p>
<p>“Yep. I think, on the field, you’ll want to pack some spares with you. That could be a market of its own.”</p>
<p>True, true. I thought that maybe shops dealing in monster drops could mix in some magic-core sales, but now I figured we could have entire dedicated stores for them.</p>
<p>“But you need to be careful. This is still in the experimental stage, but depending on the combinations you try, you may wind up changing the elements.”</p>
<p>“Combinations?”</p>
<p>What did he mean? You can change elements… Wait!</p>
<p>“As you can see here, this sword has three places to insert jewels.”</p>
<p>I knew it!</p>
<p>“So if you insert two opposed elements into the same weapon, you’ll wind up with some element you didn’t expect?”</p>
<p>“You got it!”</p>
<p>Kurobe nodded at my guess. That was big news. This definitely needed some more R and D, then—not the kind of thing we could put on the market <em>that</em> fast.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Negative. All data used within the labyrinth can be collated and organized.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-34"></a>Um, right. Yeah. That’s true. It’d certainly save us some research time, so in terms of safety, the labyrinth would be ideal. In that case, maybe we ought to bring on a few labyrinth challengers and have them generate a bunch of on-the-field inspection data for us. Even if they made some amazing discovery that way, after all, the tech could still only be produced within Tempest. Maybe some of it would leak, but if we were gonna bring this to market, that’d happen sooner or later anyway. Better to have them test these weapons out in an easily controlled environment.</p>
<p>“By the way, what kind of dangers do you anticipate?”</p>
<p>“Well, you can insert as many jewels as there are holes, so if there’s just one hole, no problem there. But if you put in, say, a wind core and a fire one, that results in more force. Water and fire reduced the force, but water plus <em>two</em> fires caused the thing to explode on us. It wasn’t just three times the force—more like several dozen times. So I was just talking with Kaijin about the need for more testing.”</p>
<p>Sounded like there were some pretty dangerous combos. More experimentation was needed, yes, and we’d need to test every result. Just as Raphael suggested, putting them in the hands of labyrinth explorers was our quickest bet.</p>
<p>“Is three holes the maximum?”</p>
<p>“Yep. Three’s the best we ever managed.”</p>
<p>In fact, a three-holed weapon was apparently something they had around a one-in-one-hundred chance of forging—and that was <em>with</em> Kurobe’s full effort. Thus, they still only had this one here. Their apprentices, meanwhile, were still way too green to craft anything like this. Only four of their most advanced students successfully forged weapons with one jewel slot. (Even Kaijin only managed one with two holes, which tells you something about how tricky these are to make.)</p>
<p>“Yeah, so this is the only successful three-slot weapon we have so far. But with the right combination of cores, I think you could easily get Legend-class force from it.”</p>
<p>Kurobe sounded proud. Magic swords are already valuable enough, <a id="page-35"></a>but if one let you change its element on the fly, that just blew away all common sense. Imagine a magic weapon you could flip a switch on, so to speak, and instantly strike at your enemy’s weak element. It was amazing. I couldn’t even guess at its value, but I don’t think Kurobe was kidding when he hinted it was Legend class—and with the right configuration, it really <em>could</em> be a Legend-class force.</p>
<p>From the bottom of my heart, I had to congratulate Kurobe and his team. It was astounding.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Based on our discussions, we decided that core-compatible weapons should be sent to the labyrinth first. We’d also manufacture a large number of throwaway, non-rechargeable cores and toss ’em into the maze’s treasure chests. And once Kurobe’s apprentices could learn how to craft these weapons in bulk, I planned to make those into labyrinth boss drops ASAP. Three-slot weapons weren’t gonna be easy to make, of course, but the way I heard it, those plans were doable as long as we didn’t strive for top quality—if we cut the durability enough that the weapons dropped down in class, that ought to be doable.</p>
<p>“You see any problems with that?”</p>
<p>“Nah, I think we can make it work. They’d be pretty brittle, so I wouldn’t wanna rely on one in <em>real</em> battle, but…”</p>
<p>Kurobe seemed a little reluctant, but his stuff still oughtta hold up well enough for testing purposes. As long as we could get some data on the assorted core combinations, I was happy, so hopefully we could find a way to make lots of weapons with two or more slots and get them into labyrinth runners’ hands. Besides, serious labyrinth regulars weren’t idiots. You’d have to be a third-rate dungeon hacker to risk your life over some mystery weapon. I figured people could switch between their regular equipment and an experimental kit for this, keeping things clean. These weapons ought to be useful for parties without magic users, too.</p>
<p>Yes. Let’s make test subjects out of our customers.</p>
<p>“Rimuru, why are you grinning evilly?”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! Oh, just your imagination, Kurobe!”</p>
<p>He promised me that he’d get production of a full lineup underway <a id="page-36"></a>soon. With his consent, we now had a plan in action. We’d have to use a lot of high-quality magisteel, but it ought to provide more training for the apprentices—and it’d let us test things out and produce market-quality goods suited for on-the-field use.</p>
<p>I was already picturing these blades being part of the standard-issue uniform on anyone ranked lieutenant or above in our army. These, combined with a few cores to cover for the bearer’s weak elements, had the potential to raise the standard for all our forces.</p>
<p>“Okay. Have at it!”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>For now, it was all in Kurobe’s hands.</p>

<p class="tx1">“So, Sir Rimuru, did some kinda business bring you here today?”</p>
<p>That jogged my memory. The sudden reveal made me forget all about it, but I <em>did</em> need to speak with him.</p>
<p>“Yes, well, it’s about this sword of mine,” I said as I took out my straight sword and presented it to Kurobe.</p>
<p>“Does it have a slot in it now?”</p>
<p>“No, not that. I wouldn’t have been so surprised today otherwise.”</p>
<p>“Right, yeah…”</p>
<p>My blade was infused with my magic force and colored darker than the darkest of nights. But now, when I held it and let my magic flow into it—</p>
<p>“Wha…?! The blade—it’s glowing gold… No, it’s the entire rainbow. A whole array of colors!”</p>
<p>Kurobe stared agape at it, clearly shocked.</p>
<p>“Amazed, huh? Well, so was I, lemme tell you. So that’s why I’m here.”</p>
<p>I was in my chamber, looking at it, when all of a sudden <em>this</em> happened. It’d surprise just about anyone, this dazzling rainbow sword. We didn’t mix gold into it or anything, but now it was shining brighter than orichalc.</p>
<p>So I looked into it, and…</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><a id="page-37"></a><em>Understood. This is the divine metal Crimson Steel.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">…is what I got back. Apparently, it’s this really great metal that performs even better than the orichalc I produced, but I decided to visit Kurobe to find out for sure.</p>
<p>“What…? What could <em>this</em> be? I can’t Assess it at all…”</p>
<p>“It’s called crimson steel, apparently.”</p>
<p>“C… Crimson steel?! That actually exists? That’s a mythical ore said to retain its elemental attribute for eternity. I thought it was just a fairy tale…”</p>
<p>Kurobe was almost too excited for words. I had thought it was a pretty remarkable mutation, but I guess it was even better than I thought.</p>
<p class="space-break1">So the two of us began researching this crimson steel blade.</p>
<p>What we found was that it didn’t react to anything apart from my own magic force. When Kurobe gave it a try, it remained jet-black as usual. Metallically speaking, it just reacted like magisteel at that point, even though it was really crimson steel.</p>
<p>It’s apparently the ultimate metal, one that repels all types of wavelengths. It even fully absorbs light without reflecting it, which is why it was so dark in color. This was also why, amazingly enough, it defied all attempts to Analyze and Assess it.</p>
<p>Only when I ran my magic through it, transforming it into battle mode, did it begin to shine. I was worried it’d stand out too much if I whipped it out in public, but by now I knew that, as long as no magic was in it, it behaved. It was also way more durable than your average weapon—because it could “<em>retain its elemental attribute for eternity</em>,” that meant it was basically unbreakable. If it ever <em>did</em> break for some reason, I could just infuse some magic to repair it. It made me wonder how a fight between two crimson steel blades would turn out, but it’s not like there’s any way to test that out.</p>
<p>One thing I could say right now, however, is that this sword really <em>was</em> suited for me. Compared with anything else in the world, <a id="page-38"></a>its evolution had made it impossibly durable. Combined with my Absolute Defense, it oughtta stand up to some pretty rough use.</p>
<p>Even better: This sword wasn’t yet complete. I was planning to chisel out some slots on the hilt for cores, so I could change its element at will. Just imagining that put me in a dream state. It’s already an excellent piece, and it’ll get even better? <em>So</em> much to look forward to.</p>
<p>“What a blade that is, though. It hardly looks like I forged it any longer…”</p>
<p>“Oh, not at all, Kurobe! You did great work on this!”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Sir Rimuru. Always glad to hear that from ya!”</p>
<p>It took someone like Kurobe to birth this sword. He was endlessly modest about himself, but there was no doubt in my mind.</p>
<p>“Now I’m wondering if I could’ve beaten Hinata with this.”</p>
<p>A Kurobe masterpiece like this <em>has</em> to be equivalent to Legend class, right? But Kurobe himself surprised me even further.</p>
<p>“Against Moonlight? Her own Legend class? Hmm… Well, maybe even better than that, eh? With <em>this</em> blade, maybe we’re getting into God-class territory. Like what beat Sir Veldora himself.”</p>
<p>God class. The ultimate of lofty peaks. No weapon of that class was known to currently exist, and none were even described in legend or tradition. But here it was.</p>
<p>In fact, Milim’s Temma Sword, similarly magical, was also in this class. She showed it to me once. I couldn’t Assess it back then, but Raphael stated that it was higher quality than Hinata’s Moonlight. And now I had something that came to that point—this amazing culmination of force. Even now, Kurobe thought, it’d rank among the upper echelons of Legend-class weaponry, so I felt safe expecting it’d reach that peak in the end.</p>
<p class="space-break1">We both marveled at the sword for a while.</p>
<p>“Man, swords like this are just so cool, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>“They sure are. I don’t see patterns along the sword <em>this</em> pretty too often at all.”</p>
<p>That Japan-style <em>hamon</em> pattern, the fruits of all of Kurobe’s technical talents, dazzled the eye up and down the permanent, <a id="page-39"></a>unbending crimson steel. It seemed like a work of art as we gazed at it, sighing in reverie. It was so beautiful that I thought we could’ve stood there staring forever. Truly, the best sword in the world—and it’s still evolving. It seemed safe to say that I had a God-class blade here, and considering how low my expectations had been at first, I couldn’t be any more elated.</p>

<p class="tx1">I heard hurried footsteps coming toward us. They didn’t slow down when they reached the door to my office. Instead, the door flew open without a knock.</p>
<p>Only Milim would do this. If anyone besides Milim tried something so rude with me, they’d swiftly face a pummeling at the hands of Rigurd—or in the case of Veldora or Ramiris, no snacks for a week. Today was a special day, however, so I let it slide.</p>
<p>After all…</p>
<p>“R-Rimuru! It’s hatching! It’s about to hatch!”</p>
<p>She had taken to constantly carrying that egg around with her as of late, never letting it go. And she’d been holed up in my nation instead of her own—meaning she wanted easy access to me, in case of complications.</p>
<p>I could tell she was frantic. The avatar core—the egg nestled within the body of Milim’s lifelong friend Gaia—was now beating a rhythm with its faint glow. Clearly, it was a matter of time. Gaia was about to be born as an entirely new sort of monster.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>“Kweeeeeeeeeeee!!”</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">With a few well-placed cracks, a tiny-size dragon burst from the egg. Call it a mini-dragon, if you want—maybe about a foot and a half tall. You’d never guess this was originally a Chaos Dragon.</p>
<p>“…Is that you, Gaia?”</p>
<p><em>“Kwee, kwee!!”</em></p>
<p>Girl and dragon hugged each other tight. A tearful reunion.</p>
