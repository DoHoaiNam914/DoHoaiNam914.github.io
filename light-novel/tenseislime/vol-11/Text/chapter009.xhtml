<p class="noindent"><a id="page-79"></a>The demon trampled across the dark realm like a savage beast.</p>
<p>Beyond the Gates of Hell lay a spirit realm one could call the land of the dead, or even hell itself, and there he was annihilating demons, like a living manifestation of violence. The powerless ran screaming, the more powerful banding together to defend themselves, but to that demon, it was just helpless struggling. All foes fell to his might, and his rampage continued.</p>
<p>Demons were a kind of spiritual life-form. If you destroyed the physical body of one, it would self-regenerate over time. Perhaps he knew this, because he held nothing back, showing no mercy to anyone coming his way.</p>
<p>The name of this personification of violence was Diablo.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh… It’s been so long since my last visit. Quite a number of chumps have sprung up in the meantime, haven’t they? Assembling a group of these will accomplish nothing. I need to find my old friends.”</p>
<p>His “old friends” were those comparable to him. His mission, during this long journey, was to recruit them.</p>
<p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh… I am sure they have what it takes to make Sir Rimuru satisfied!”</p>
<p>With those words, Diablo teleported away and disappeared, <a id="page-80"></a>leaving nothing but the carcasses of those who failed to correctly gauge his might.</p>

<p class="tx1">My inspections were complete, and I had a grasp of where we currently stood.</p>
<p>I couldn’t even see the end of rail installation work yet. We were considering three lines for now—from the Dwarven Kingdom to Tempest, from Tempest to the Kingdom of Blumund, and from Blumund to the Kingdom of Farminus. There was also a route that forked south from the line to Dwargon, running past Lake Sisu (stomping grounds of the lizardmen) on its way to Eurazania. In addition, we had to build a highway from the Blumund line to Thalion, which included a tunnel through the Khusha Mountains. A railway along that route would be considered later, but I had to expect it’d come well into the future.</p>
<p>I’d really like to build a railway to the ocean somewhere soon, so we can get seafood for cheaper. Going forward, I also envisioned a trunk line between Blumund and the Kingdom of Englesia—but either way, completing this whole network would take a lot of time, and we still had more trains to develop.</p>
<p>With our test locomotive completed, we were officially over the hump. Now we just had to run that thing to the ground in a trial-and-error test process. We had the exact energy drive I wanted, but development wouldn’t end there. It had to be comfortable to ride in, and we had to eliminate noise concerns for the surrounding areas. These were already quieter than normal steam trains, but the speedier these got, the louder they’d be. A research team led by Kaijin was tackling these smaller details, digging deeper into them and working out theoretical solutions. I wanted his team to record all their proceedings, because I figured it’d help us with future developments. Of course, the magic core was the hardest part, and with that completed, I could let Kaijin handle the rest of the locomotive.</p>
<p>When this project got started, I covered all the expenses with our national budget—even giving them a little more money, as much as it made Mjöllmile’s chins jiggle. I was now an occasional visitor <a id="page-81"></a>to the project, giving me more chances to befriend the researchers and have in-depth conversations. They were interested in my otherworlder knowledge, apparently, so they’d ask for my opinions on this and that. Anything very tricky, Raphael handled for me—it worked faster than a quantum supercomputer, so any calculation was completed in an instant. No reason <em>not</em> to make use of it.</p>
<p>After work was done, it was time to socialize. Our evening haunts didn’t all have to be high-end nightclubs. If people were encountering walls in their research, we’d hit the city, debating among ourselves and forgetting our problems. I kept up with them late into the night, although I didn’t get paid any overtime, oddly enough. (I should note that our generous budget wasn’t being entirely devoted to the drink tabs. They really <em>were</em> contributing to science and technology, though, so I let it slide a bit.)</p>
<p>By the way, between Veldora, Ramiris, and me, Ramiris was earning the highest salary at the moment. Even subtracting her Dungeon maintenance fees, we were raking in a massive profit from the labyrinth, and she took twenty percent of that. Our initial goal of two gold coins a day now seemed quaint—we were making over twenty on average, the equivalent of at least twenty thousand dollars. Ramiris used her cut to pay Treyni, her sisters, and Beretta, but I reckoned she ended every month up nearly a hundred gold coins.</p>
<p>Veldora and I, meanwhile, were paid equally—one gold coin a day from the national treasury. As master of the labyrinth, Veldora also got an allowance from Ramiris, and since his magicules were a constant boon to us, the treasury sometimes awarded him special payments. Thus, he was definitely making more money than I was. Of course, I had my own hidden revenue streams and business involvements, so I wasn’t exactly destitute, either.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Inspired by everyone’s suddenly impressive work ethic, I resolved to put in more of an effort. First, it was time to get serious about the physical body vessels I promised Diablo. Ramiris was my assistant; we’d also be working on bodies for Treyni’s sisters, and I wanted to get her feedback. She kindly accepted the request, although she was already whining to me about needing more personnel.</p>
<p><a id="page-82"></a>“I really need someone to handle all the odd jobs I need, and I have a few other things I wanna ask you for, too. With Treyni and Beretta alone, I can’t quite seem to keep up with all my work…”</p>
<p>I thought she just wanted more people to brag about herself to—but recalling how busy Treyni and the others looked, I reconsidered. Plus, Ramiris wasn’t just my assistant. She had her own mission: craft a new Elemental Colossus.</p>
<p>Its heart, the core of the whole thing, was complete. I had a skeleton and framework in place, as well as a sample Elemental Colossus to work with. I figured we could just proceed based on that, but modifications always take a lot of time. Kaijin’s hands were full with the trains, and Vester was hard at work by himself, picking up his old armored-soldier project again. He was already lending a hand to Ramiris in his spare time, and I worried he was overworking himself a bit. This was going to be built into the completed magic core, so I want to get some test data—and for that, we’d need as many people as possible.</p>
<p>“What about Veldora?”</p>
<p>“Ahhh yes, what about the master, indeed? Whenever I ask him for some detailed piece of work, he disappears…”</p>
<p>I see. Maybe not worth relying upon, then. It makes sense to me. Veldora is Veldora, always busily running from one spot to the next. I thought he’d be a bother to most people, but he actually wasn’t. He was smart, despite his personality, and I suppose he really was helping out a lot. He certainly loved being the center of attention, so instead of asking him to assist Ramiris, I felt it was better to just let him do his own thing.</p>
<p>“All right. I’ll round up someone.”</p>
<p>“Great. Thanks!”</p>
<p>With that promise, I began pondering who to select.</p>

<p class="tx1">The days then proceeded by, peacefully as ever…until one day, when <em>they</em> came along.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-83"></a>Right in my office, atop my desk, was a huge pile of documents requiring my approval.</p>
<p>I couldn’t guess how long it’d usually take to process all these, but in my case, I left it to Raphael. It nimbly evaluated all the proposals, rearranging them by priority level. It approved or rejected them, and then I applied my stamp, all in a continuous flow. Maybe it wasn’t <em>that</em> taxing, but this kind of rote work was always a pain to me. Silently, I stamped away, wishing Diablo were here to handle this.</p>
<p><em>Time for a break.</em></p>
<p>Returning to slime mode, I lazed around on my sofa. This always felt great—the softness of my body and the elasticity of the cushions. Put together, it felt like a ball pit full of feathers. Now that sleeping required a trick or two for me, this was my secret little heaven right here.</p>
<p>Then I heard knocking. I wanted to keep chillaxing for a bit longer, but someone was here. Ah well. Switching to human form, I sat on my chair.</p>
<p>“Come in,” I replied, making sure my pose was just right. The door opened, revealing Shuna. She bowed at me.</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru, you have a visitor. He gave his name as Deeno, and he says you’d know who he is?”</p>
<p>Just as expected, a visitor was here. But <em>Deeno</em>, though? There was only one Deeno I could possibly know of.</p>
<p>“He’s a demon lord, isn’t he? Part of the Octagram. What’s he here for?”</p>
<p>“A demon lord? Should I ask my brother to assemble our troops, just in case?”</p>
<p>“No, that’s all right. If we come to blows, just get me Benimaru and Shion…but I doubt we will. If I had to guess, he’s come to check things out.”</p>
<p>I reassured the concerned Shuna and stood up. There seemed to be little to worry about. I think Deeno <em>did</em> say he wanted to stop by during the Walpurgis meeting, didn’t he? I kind of ignored it then, but I guess he was serious.</p>
<p><a id="page-84"></a>“…Very well. I will make the arrangements.”</p>
<p>With a nod, Shuna guided me to the room where Deeno was waiting. It’s helpful to have a lot of rooms for occasions like this; then you can choose one for the situation. Merchants and the nobility can have ornate parlors; famed monsters or suspicious people can be shown simple but solidly built rooms, if only because they might cause expensive damage otherwise. Thus, Deeno was waiting in a functional, if not very flashy-looking, chamber.</p>
<p>When I came in with Shuna, I found Deeno looking pretty, well, casual. In fact, he was sprawled out on the sofa, taking full advantage despite being a guest. He certainly didn’t care what people thought about him, for better or (likely) worse.</p>
<p>“Hey. Nice to see ya. Doing well?”</p>
<p>He greeted me from the sofa, showing no sign of getting up. Shuna wrinkled her nose but silently bowed and left the room, no doubt to fetch some tea.</p>
<p>“Great, thanks,” I said as I took a seat facing him. “I got a lot of problems to deal with, so things aren’t exactly chill, but…”</p>
<p>I took a closer look at Deeno. He looked just as blasé and unaffected as the last time I met him, but still his attitude suggested I better keep my guard up. No wonder Shuna was wary of him.</p>
<p>“You got problems? That sucks.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, kind of. I’m still pretty new to demon lord-ing, so nothing’s going easy for me yet. But what brings you here?”</p>
<p>“Oh? Me? Well, I said I’d visit you, so here I am.”</p>
<p>His reply was rather brisk—sounded like a lie to me. We both quickly fell into silence, but just then, Shuna came back with some tea and snacks, navigating the quiet chamber like nothing was amiss. Hastily laying everything out, she bowed again and left the room. She really <em>is</em> a professional.</p>
<p>I took a sip of tea and turned my eye toward Deeno. He was the first to relent.</p>
<p>“…Well, to tell you the truth, I got kicked out of Daggrull’s place.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
