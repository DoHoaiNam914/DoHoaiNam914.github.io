<p class="noindent">Long time no see, guys. This is Fuse. I know I kept you waiting awhile this time, but Volume 11 is finally here.</p>
<p>This volume, too, is an almost completely separate animal from the original web novel. At the risk of giving out spoilers, a number of characters move in wholly different directions, and with that, some of their traits have also changed. Yuuki has been altered a great deal as well, although the biggest changes lie in the world’s Hero system.</p>
<p>Thanks to the reckless abandon of my editor, Mr. I, these changes are now set in stone. What kind of reckless abandon am I talking about? To sum up:</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Wouldn’t it be kind of sad if Chloe didn’t come back as a little girl?”</p>
<p class="space-break1">At that moment, my suspicions that Mr. I harbored a certain complex began to take root. No, not a god complex—but I digress.</p>
<p>It was already tough enough juggling everything Chloe-related, but adding Mr. I’s demands on top of that left me with no shortage of headaches to deal with in this book. I do feel, however, that the results turned out really well, and hopefully you’re enjoying this light-novel version of Chloe.</p>

<p class="tx1">This volume wraps up the Western Nations story arc. Starting in the next volume, I’m planning to finally have the Eastern Empire go on the move. There’ll be new characters debuting, and I think it’ll really expand the <em>Slime</em> universe.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping you’ll keep joining me along the way!!</p>
