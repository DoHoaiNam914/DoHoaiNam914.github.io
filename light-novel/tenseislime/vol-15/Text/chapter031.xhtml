<p><a id="page-385"></a>“I dunno. But I’ll give you a warning. I know that your ability gives you absolute control over angelic skills, and that there’s no breaking Castle Guard as long as someone believes in you. Along those lines, couldn’t we take away that advantage if I burned your Empire to the ground and killed every living thing inside it?”</p>
<p>That was a total bluff. Not even I had any intention of going that far. But if I put that on the scales with having my friends be sacrificed, I’d do it without hesitation. <em>That</em> much cruelty I had resigned myself to long ago.</p>
<p>“…I suppose I’ve underestimated you as well. Perhaps I shouldn’t have been hostile to you after all.”</p>
<p>“Maybe not, no. Your lofty ideals and noble missions weren’t any of my business. I sympathize with some of your goals, too. So, you know, as long as you didn’t bother me, you could’ve done whatever you wanted.”</p>
<p>But it’s too late now. Now that Michael was running amok, he was definitely a potential disaster for us. We were good for now, but Ciel was already predicting an unavoidable conflict of interest in the future. It was my job to believe it and act accordingly.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Michael fell silent, thinking over something. So I decided to spell out my intentions.</p>
<p>“If you try to touch me or any of my people, I’ll crush you so thoroughly that you’ll never be able to try anything so stupid again.”</p>
<p>That, and I wanted to strike some fear into him. No, I had no way to break his Castle Guard right now. But I had my trusty partner Ciel helping out, and I was sure it’d figure out a way. Besides, if he touched any of my precious friends, I’d show him no mercy. No matter what it took, I swore I would defeat Michael.</p>
<p>“All right. I see. Then let’s retreat for now.”</p>
<p>“…?! Are you sure, Sir Michael?”</p>
<p>Feldway looked surprised, but Michael placidly nodded his head, indicating his intention to retreat.</p>
<p>“It is too early for us as well, after all. If we fight here, it will end badly for both of us.”</p>
<p>I agreed with that. If I followed through on my earlier threat, <a id="page-386"></a>maybe we’d have a chance of winning. But that’s against my principles. I know I was just kicking the can into the future, but I really wanted some more time to work with.</p>
<p>“Okay… Well, shall we all leave, then?”</p>
<p>“Very well. Still… Today is the day of my full revival, a day to be celebrated, and instead we’re given <em>this</em> unexpected ordeal. I thought Guy Crimson would be our biggest barrier, but instead it’s slime we dismissed as insignificant…?”</p>
<p>With those words, Michael and Feldway left. And I assumed they weren’t going back to the Empire, either. My observation magic Argos, the Eye of God, wasn’t picking anything up over there, and Moss reported nothing unusual.</p>
<p>“<em>Damn</em>, this is annoying, though. I don’t even know where they went.”</p>
<p>Benimaru smiled at my offhand remark. “But as you ordered, Sir Rimuru, all of us are safe. Why don’t we celebrate that for now and return home?”</p>
<p>Good idea.</p>
<p>“Right! Home it is, then! I’m tired out today, and I’m feeling kinda hungry, too. Why don’t we ask Shuna to prepare something nice for us all?”</p>
<p>“A feast, then?”</p>
<p>Also a good idea. I nodded back at Veldora.</p>
<p>“Okay! Let’s go back and have a blast!”</p>
<p>My words brought smiles to everyone’s faces. We had some work left to do, but at least we were all here, and well enough to celebrate our survival.</p>

<p class="tx1">Velgrynd continued her journey. Yesterday, today, and tomorrow, she walks on, never stopping.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><a id="page-387"></a>The place she flew to after leaving Rimuru was another world, in another time. Feldway had sent her Parallel Existence to the rift between this world and that one, and she safely reintegrated herself with it right there.</p>
<p>This was a planet without any land, much less an atmosphere, and Velgrynd was stranded on it without any sense of time at all. She would have died instantly if she wasn’t a True Dragon, but she had both Dominate Space and an infinite lifespan.</p>
<p>She had time to think before she found refuge. Her thinking had almost stopped entirely after all the unbelievable events that occurred to her; there was just too much information to process. But being adrift in another dimension helped her regain her composure, too.</p>
<p>So Velgrynd thought. The sheer volume of mind-blowing data had made her abandon thinking at one point, but now she thought as long as time allowed her to. Then she arrived at the most important fact of all. How did she gain her freedom against the system her brother created? That was the question, and there was only one person she could think of who could’ve made that happen. Yes—that easy-going slime. The demon lord Rimuru, her foolish brother’s ally…</p>
<p><em>No! No, it can’t be! That slime is…</em></p>
<p>…someone who freely tinkered with ultimate skills, gave Velgrynd her freedom, and massively improved her own powers, evolving them to greater heights. No regular human could possibly have done any of that.</p>
<p><em>Only my brother Veldanava could do anything so outlandish. If it were possible for anyone else at all…</em></p>
<p>Velgrynd shuddered at the impossible thought. When she turned her attention to it, her ultimate skill Cthugha, Lord of the Fire God reacted: power on an incomparable level from Raguel. But most of all, the fragments she had been taking in reacted, as if linked to Ludora’s heartbeat.</p>
<p><em>Hee-hee! Well, I don’t care what that slime really is. He’s just Rimuru. Veldora’s ally and the one I owe my life to.</em></p>
