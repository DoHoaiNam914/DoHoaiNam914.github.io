<p>“Poison Smashfist!”</p>
<p>Ultima had punched through Damrada’s chest.</p>
<p>Her hand was infused with an enormous amount of magic force as she executed an open-hand spear strike, much as Damrada had. But with the ultimate skill Samael added to the mix, she was able to control it perfectly, the Deathly Poison from Samael turning her five fingernails a dark purple. It was well beyond a lethal dose, and it crushed Damrada’s defenses.</p>
<p>“Gnnh!”</p>
<p>Damrada fell, vomiting blood.</p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Too bad, huh? I was right on target!”</p>
<p>The evil laughter echoed. Damrada tried getting up again but failed. His entire body was so drained of energy that he could barely close a fist, much less stand up. But still he gathered his strength and stared at Ultima.</p>
<p>“That is no Smashfist, you fool. It was a spear-hand strike. As if you could copy me after just one look… But the power behind it…was excellent. Call it…‘Bloody Deathhand’ instead, perhaps…”</p>
<p>Damrada gazed upward, a satisfied look on his face as he beheld the sky and remorsefully chuckled to himself. He was completely defeated. Long before he could challenge Guy to a final battle, the demon lord Rimuru’s forces had crushed him. Perhaps some of the Empire’s elites would survive, but it would be impossible to rebuild their position. Emperor Ludora has no time left to wait for the next opportunity. Before that, he needs to…</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Your Majesty,” Damrada muttered, looking back on his life.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Will you listen to me, Damrada?”</p>
<p>“What is it? If it’s more boring complaining, please save it for Lady Velgrynd. Or are you complaining at her, actually? Then <a id="page-311"></a>bring it to her, not me. I don’t want her to think <em>I</em> have a grievance with her, too.”</p>
<p>“You really are a cold person, aren’t you? …But no, this is serious.”</p>
<p>“…What is it?”</p>
<p>He didn’t want to know. He knew from the moment he looked into Ludora’s eyes that this was a serious matter—but if he heard about it, their current relationship would cease to exist, and Damrada didn’t want that.</p>
<p>“So it appears that every time I reincarnate, it wears my heart out a little bit. That or the ‘soul,’ the way Guy describes it—but either way, if this goes on long enough, I may wind up not being me any longer.”</p>
<p>The resurrections of the Hero Ludora were not magical in nature. They involved a special ritual, crafted to help the new body inherit the old one’s overblown magic force. This was the cost for becoming both a god among mankind and the owner of a force that even surpassed that of a True Dragon, the ultimate spiritual life-form. It was up to Ludora and his own skills to manage that process; Damrada had no solution for him.</p>
<p>“The wearing of the soul, you say? And it would cause Your Majesty to cease being yourself…?”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“That’s a funny joke. But I’m not so naïve as to take it seriously and reduce your workload, you know.”</p>
<p>“Eesh. Still all serious like that, huh?”</p>
<p>“I think that’s what I’m best at, yes.”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha! Maybe so, yeah. Well, forget about it. Stupid to ask anyway.”</p>
<p>“I will do just that, then.”</p>
<p>There was no forgetting. Damrada was just running away from it. He wanted to serve Ludora forever, maintaining the current relationship they had.</p>
<p>So time passed.</p>
<p>“Ah, I knew it… Every time I’m reborn, it seems, I lose something important to me, little by little. The problem is, I don’t even know what.”</p>
<p><a id="page-312"></a>“Your Majesty…”</p>
<p>“Hey, Damrada?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“This is an order. When I am no longer myself, I want you to kill me by your own hand.”</p>
<p>“Emperor Ludora!”</p>
<p>“I can’t really ask Velgrynd to do it, can I?”</p>
<p>Damrada struggled mightily to keep himself from saying he couldn’t do it, either. This was the heartfelt wish of his best friend Ludora; there was no way he could deny him.</p>
<p>“That is a terribly weak-minded thing for you to say, my liege. But should that happen, I promise you that I will settle your affairs for you. So please, I hope you can rest assured as you go about your political duties.”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee. You never change, do you? Then it’s settled.”</p>
<p>It was a promise made on a distant day.</p>
<p>And time marched on again…</p>
<p class="space-break1">“I am tired. I can only keep Michael, Lord of Justice, from going out of control for so long. Absolute justice is no better than evil, when you get down to it, for there’s no such thing as a justice that can be accepted by all.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty…”</p>
<p>“Damrada, do you remember your promise with me?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do, my liege.”</p>
<p>Ludora smiled. “Good, then.” He changed his expression, giving a stern order. “Damrada, I hereby order you… You must find someone who can overcome Michael, Lord of Justice, and defeat me, should you yourself fail at it! It pains me to ask you to do this…but while I am still myself, I need to take all possible precautions.”</p>
<p>The order was tantamount to Ludora asking Damrada to wipe him from existence. But Damrada had no choice but to nod.</p>
<p>“You have my word, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Ludora replied. “And my apologies.” His eyes pointed far away, his speech pointed toward no particular target. “This Michael was entrusted to me by a friend, but looking back, it <a id="page-313"></a>might have been too much power for me. Whether I win or lose my game against Guy, I think next time will be the last occasion I ever use it. I intend to use it well…but if you see any signs of it going out of control, please do not hesitate. Stop it, and stop me as well.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my liege.”</p>
<p>“…Please.”</p>
<p>Ludora closed his eyes, recalling the oath he had given to Veldanava the Star-King Dragon long ago and feeling frustrated at his inability to keep it. A small murmur escaped from his mouth: “If you fail at this promise…I will apologize to you in the afterlife.”</p>
<p>Damrada, pretending not to hear it, quietly left the room.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Choking on the blood seeping out from his own mouth, Damrada was brought back to reality. He seemed to have lost consciousness for a few tenths of a second.</p>
<p><em>Your Majesty, I… I owe you an apology… You gave me your orders…and I failed to fulfill them…</em></p>
<p>In his inner consciousness, already threatening to fade again, Damrada attempted to state an apology. But it was not to be. All he did was cough up blood again.</p>
<p>There was regret. But there was also relief. To Damrada, the edict to seek out someone to kill his beloved master was nothing but pain. It had made him suffer for far too long. And of course it would, because to Damrada, Emperor Ludora was every bit the brilliant hero he had always been.</p>
<p><em>How could I ever kill the one…who I value so much…?! Why did it have to be me? Couldn’t it have been someone else?! Without you, I would have no lingering regrets about this world. I would gladly join you on your journey to the afterlife…</em></p>
<p>That was what Damrada truly felt. The game between Ludora and Guy was of no importance to him. What mattered was Ludora’s will, and the way that will was reflected by the world.</p>
<p>Guy Crimson was an arrogant demon lord, but he was no tyrant who refused to listen to reason. His rule was absolute, but he still <a id="page-314"></a>worked on a proper framework of rules that he stuck to. He and Ludora had different ideals, but they weren’t incompatible with each other. From Damrada’s point of view, they could have come to a mutually acceptable agreement. Guy would never move on his own. Ludora was sure of it; that must’ve been why he issued his orders to Damrada.</p>
<p>But if they understood each other that well, why did they even bother keeping up with this game? It made Damrada wonder—but there was no way he could disobey Ludora, so in the end, he carried the order out. The journey would bring him all around the world—but after leaving the emperor’s side for many years, he found the right candidate.</p>
<p>This was Yuuki Kagurazaka, a boy who had the extremely unusual ability Anti-Skill. Even ultimate skills could be nullified by this, Damrada was overjoyed to find. He was glad to find something that could work against Michael, Lord of Justice…but the results were disastrous. Yuuki was now square in Ludora’s hands and could no longer be relied upon.</p>
<p>So Damrada lost his ace in the hole, but now another question arose.</p>
<p>“…Why did His Majesty try to rule over Yuuki?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Ultima reacted to the unintended murmuring. Damrada didn’t answer it. Ludora himself ordered Damrada to find someone who could kill him. Why would he then interfere with that effort?</p>
<p>…Or maybe Damrada just didn’t want to admit it. The signs were there from the beginning.</p>
<p>“…So it really was true… His Majesty, Emperor Ludora… He’s already…”</p>
<p>Damrada kept muttering as if suffering from a high fever.</p>
<p>“What’re you <em>talking</em> about?”</p>
<p>Ultima was sounding clearly irritated, but her voice would never reach him. He was far too absorbed in his own thoughts—a pre-death moment of clarity. His mind was sharper than ever…and now it could arrive at the truth.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-315"></a>Ludora burned with his ideals—his drive to unite the world and establish a lasting peace. He dreamed of an end to conflict and poverty, and the rise of a more developed mankind. Only when the entire world was united and at peace could everyone live as true equals.</p>
<p>Believing this, Ludora set out to establish a united nation. He believed humans have the innate ability to understand each other—and from the bottom of his heart, he knew they could all unite under one will to create a better world. So he became a Hero serving all mankind, facing great hardship as he did. He never stopped pursuing his struggle, hoping it would bring smiles to the faces of as many people as possible.</p>
<p>And Damrada loved him for it. But even now, Ludora’s ideals had ended while they were still a dream. He himself had changed too much before the day that dream came true.</p>
<p><em>The ideals we pursued were crushed long ago…</em></p>
<p>Damrada finally had to admit it. It wrapped his mind in sadness.</p>
<p>“Are you crying?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“Because you’re afraid to die?”</p>
<p>“…No. My promise…”</p>
<p>“Your promise?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>Inescapable death had Damrada in its hands, refusing to let go. He could accept that much as inevitable—yet the one thing he couldn’t stand was not being able to keep his promise to Ludora. But if Ludora’s original will was long gone, then who really <em>was</em> Ludora now? There was just one answer. It was the ultimate skill Michael, Lord of Justice, unchanged from when Veldanava the Star-King Dragon gave it to him.</p>
<p>Damrada needed to carry out Ludora’s orders before his spirit fully collapsed…but his life was running out before that could ever happen. He wanted to curse his own incompetence, but even now, he decided the situation was not at its worst. He had to stop <a id="page-316"></a>Michael at all costs, and if he failed, he needed to find someone to entrust the task to. That was Ludora’s order to him, the promise he had to keep—and he had found Yuuki for that.</p>
<p>But there was one other candidate he had in mind. Rimuru, the fearsome demon lord, his greatest enemy and also his greatest hope.</p>
<p>“I want you…to kill His Majesty… Kill Ludora for me…”</p>
<p>“Huh? Why me?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have to be you. Can you at least…relay the message…to the demon lord Rimuru for me…?”</p>
<p>“Aw, c’mon, let <em>me</em> do the honors! ’Cause I’m sure open to taking the job. I was planning to kill that Ludora guy anyway.”</p>
<p>Ultima was always up for satisfying a new whim. She wasn’t going to take this job for free, but she did have a liking for Damrada. They had fought for only a short time, but for someone with an infinite lifespan like Ultima, battle was about quality over quantity anyway. This was an intense battle, packed with ups and downs from start to finish, and after that experience, she was willing to forgive just about everything.</p>
<p>“Then let me ask you…one more favor…”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Protect him… Protect the boy Masayuki…”</p>
<p>Damrada was fully convinced. Masayuki was the one—</p>
<p>“Well, sure, I guess. But you got a reward for me, right?”</p>
<p>Demons never worked for free. That wasn’t an absolute rule; there were plenty of loopholes, but Ultima was feeling selfish. She wanted to annoy Damrada a little, so that’s the approach she took. But the question still relieved Damrada. He felt a new peace, like his heart had been freed.</p>
<p>“Your reward…is all of me. I entrust you with my soul…and all of my skills, etched deep into my body…”</p>
<p>“Mmm, that’ll work, I guess.”</p>
<p>Ultima reluctantly agreed, making Damrada break out in a smile. And then:</p>
<p>“Your Majesty… I will come to you now…”</p>
<p>Those were Damrada’s last words. He breathed his last and died, as if falling asleep. So the curtain finally came down on the long <a id="page-317"></a>life of Damrada, Lord of the Fist, former prime minister of the Kingdom of Nasca, and close personal friend of its United Emperor, Ludora Nam-ul-Nasca.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Now Ultima stood alone in the battle arena of an alternate dimension.</p>
<p>“Well, <em>that’s</em> no fun. His heart core disappeared on me. I was gonna offer it to Sir Rimuru, too…”</p>
<p>Despite that saddened muttering, Ultima still gently wrapped Damrada’s body in her twelve wings. As they agreed upon, she took all of him as her own—and that was the end of the battle between the two.</p>
<p class="space-break1">One Lord of the Fist ended his life, and a new Demon of the Fist was born.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Damrada, at the very end of his life, had given one of the worst demons in history one of the most dreadful powers known to mankind. If <em>he</em> knew about this, would it have filled him with shame? Or would he be happy to learn that his craft would be used by a third generation? Now that Damrada was gone, there was no way to know. It would be up to the survivors to carefully weigh the fallout.</p>

<p class="tx1">“Well, I suppose I’ll be dealing with you, then.”</p>
<p>Agera made the announcement to Kondo, standing in the center of the arena.</p>
<p>Kondo’s eyebrows twitched as he silently placed a hand on his sword. He didn’t answer Agera, but instead glanced over at Carrera.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll serve as an observer.”</p>
<p>“Don’t make me laugh. As if I could ever trust you.”</p>
<p>Kondo finally opened his mouth, and his words were scathing. If they were both his enemy anyway, he was saying, they might as well both tackle him at the same time. But Carrera was unaffected.</p>
<p>“No, maybe not, I suppose. I don’t see two-on-one as a coward <a id="page-318"></a>move, and nobody’s gonna go easy on you here. This time, though, it’s what Agera wished for. So please, don’t worry about me. Enjoy yourselves!”</p>
<p>Having had her say, she sat down atop the stone wall around the arena, like this was no longer any of her business.</p>
<p>Kondo shrugged. “What a farce… But I respect your spirit, at least.” Then he drew his military sword and faced up to Agera.</p>
<p>“My thanks. Now, let’s get down to—”</p>
<p>Agera was interrupted by a hollow <em>bang</em>. He fell to the ground, clutching his chest.</p>
<p>“You!”</p>
<p>Carrera, closing the distance in an instant, flew in between the pair. Kondo’s sword, which was even now about to descend upon Agera’s head, was stopped by her blade.</p>
<p>“Hmm. You were fast enough at <em>this</em> speed?”</p>
<p>Kondo, the still-smoking Nambu semiautomatic handgun in his left hand and his military-issue sword in the right, looked straight at Carrera.</p>
<p>“You thought I would, wouldn’t I? If you were serious about your business, Agera would’ve been destroyed. Am I wrong?”</p>
<p>Kondo had never explicitly stated that he would accept a match with Agera. It was Agera’s fault for failing to confirm his intentions. Besides, he made far too feeble an effort to truly finish him off—something Carrera, who parried his blade, innately understood.</p>
<p>Someone as strong as Kondo would never have lost in a head-on battle against Agera. If it were fought with swords alone, maybe they could’ve had a lively, pitched battle—but even so, Kondo’s victory was unassailable. But Kondo opted for a surprise attack instead, because he knew Carrera was waiting in the wings. It would be ridiculous to ever trust the words of a demon—and even more foolish to heed the words of a demon. That was the ironclad rule of warfare—eliminate all the uncertainties you can.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t have all day, you know. I don’t have to put up with your farcical nonsense.”</p>
<p><a id="page-319"></a>Kondo sniffed at Carrera, as if this was all below his standards.</p>
<p>“Well, if you say so. But if you’re interested, I could serve as your next opponent?”</p>
<p>“With that sword?”</p>
<p>Kondo pointed at Carrera’s blade. It had been cracked by the blow, and Carrera herself knew a few more good blows would break it entirely.</p>
<p>“Oh, of course not. I can replace it, but I have something better than that. I think you know what I’m talking about, Agera?”</p>
<p>“…Of course. A pity that I could not cross swords with a practitioner from my own school…but this, too, is following my teachings. I have no reason to complain. But I cannot say I like how you disarmed me with such obvious disdain.”</p>
<p>Agera stood up as he spoke. The hole in his chest was already closed. Kondo had shot him with an Eraser Bullet, which absorbs and eliminates the target’s energy equivalent to the amount of magic force imbued in it. If it had been a Necrosis Bullet, Agera would have great difficulty standing up right now. As Carrera correctly guessed, and as Agera realized now, Kondo clearly didn’t give him his best effort.</p>
<p>But it meant Agera could still fight.</p>
<p>“…Blade Transform.”</p>
<p>He transformed into a sword—and needless to say, it was Carrera who took it up. Her magic force filled Agera, refilling his lost energy. The blade shone, indicating that Agera’s spiritual force was back to full.</p>
<p>“A foolish move. I only let you off the hook because you lived by the sword, much as myself…”</p>
<p>“My kind love to fight, all right? The exact method is none of your business.”</p>
<p>“I see. Well, it’s not important now. That person committed the unforgivable sin of deceiving our school’s founder…and I will do everything in my power to make you pay.”</p>
<p>To Kondo, Carrera was just as guilty for holding Agera in her hands. The hostility was clear in his voice as he took his stance.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-320"></a>About an hour into the fight, Carrera was on her knees.</p>
<p>Kondo was strong, unbelievably so: truly a master. To Carrera, he was a monster beyond imagination. And she knew <em>she</em> was good—but she now understood that there was always someone better out there.</p>
<p>She might not have been able to defeat Diablo, but she knew that she’d never lose to anyone else. But Zegion had little trouble dispatching her, and during this war, she put up a pathetic performance against Velgrynd. So she wasn’t surprised that Kondo was making quick work of her. In fact, she was thrilled by it.</p>
<p>Carrera rolled on the ground, putting some distance between herself and Kondo. Then she stood up, her sword pointed straight ahead.</p>
<p>“Not bad! Agera praised my sword skills a lot, but I sure can’t hold a candle to you.”</p>
<p>“Silence. That gets on my nerves, considering you’ve been fending me off by sheer force alone.”</p>
<p>Kondo, too, had an ominous feeling about Carrera’s fighting sense. Now was no time for pussyfooting around, so he had gone all out from the beginning—not just with his sword strikes, but with a generous amount of the ultimate skill Sandalphon, Lord of Judgment, sprinkled in. But he still couldn’t fully finish off Carrera—something he inwardly found both amazing and horrifying.</p>
<p>They had both recognized each other as worthy opponents by now, and from there, the battle raged even more fiercely. Carrera struck Kondo with a forceful blow, blocking his attempted slash. Kondo lightly parried the move, aiming at Carrera with the gun in his right hand. Loaded inside was a Dispel Bullet, built to disable the target’s magic, and what Carrera did next explained why Kondo felt the need to fire it.</p>
<p>Without a moment of spellcasting time, a gravitational force field was built around the arena. Kondo had chided Carrera as nothing but “brute strength” a moment ago, but instead of taking that to heart, she just tapped her strength even more. This invocation <a id="page-321"></a>wouldn’t affect her at all, but it would do a great deal to slow Kondo’s movements…or so she hoped.</p>
<p>Anticipating this, Kondo chose to counteract it with a Dispel Bullet.</p>
<p>His strength lay very much in the versatility of his skills. The ultimate skill Sandalphon had four effects in all, and he could tap into one or the other depending on what the times called for. The Removal Bullet broke down its target’s defensive barriers; the Dispel Bullet blacked out magical effects; the Necrosis Bullet destroyed magic-based healing; and the Eraser Bullet was a highly precise magical strike, identifying the target’s essence and consuming its energy from the inside. All of these abilities could also be placed together in a single, all-powerful shot—the Judgment Bullet.</p>
<p>Up to now, Carrera was still daring enough to cast magical attacks that required spellcasting time. That was in the past now, but even so, all of her spells were being canceled out the moment the magic invoked itself. Kondo had an accurate beat on her, and he wasn’t making any mistaken choices. What’s more, he could fire any kind of bullet he wanted whenever the opportunity came up. If she couldn’t assess and deal with them, even a single one could be a painful blow to Carrera. One moment off her guard, and the duel would be over instantly.</p>
<p>Kondo was carefully analyzing this battle, not letting his emotions get the better of him. It was a mechanical approach, even—spot the enemy’s weak points, figure out the flow of magical power, and take suitable countermeasures. That was all there was to it. But by sticking to the fundamentals, Kondo had reached his position as strongest in the imperial armies. That made him the exact opposite of the emotionally driven Carrera, but still, they were also similar in some ways.</p>
<p>“You’re a pain in the ass,” Carrera said, shaking her head before asking in a friendly manner, “How do you know when I’ll cast magic?”</p>
<p>Kondo gathered his breath as he replied. “Heh… It’s simple. I just thought about what <em>I</em> would do in your situation.”</p>
<p>“Aha. A very simple explanation.”</p>
<p><a id="page-322"></a>Once again, Carrera found herself liking Kondo. But at the same time, she grew increasingly aware that this was an adversary like none other.</p>
<p><em>He’s reading the magic flow required to cast a spell, then cutting it off with complete precision. And that’s how he phrases it? Come on.</em></p>
<p>“What I would do” sounded like such a trite excuse. But even as she bitterly mused over that, she couldn’t hide the joy on her face. Having an opponent you could fight at full force against was sheer bliss. The demon lord Leon, for example, was a fighter whose strengths even Guy attested to. She expected a satisfying fight against him, but he refused to take the bait on her provocation. It was tremendously frustrating and disappointing, but if she had Kondo now, she could enjoy herself to her heart’s content. To her, after all, the process of the fight was far more important than the outcome.</p>
<p>“Well, good… Very good. Kondo was your name, right? You’re the greatest enemy I could ever want!”</p>
<p>Kondo just sniffed away the praise, preferring to express his opinions with his sword instead of his tongue. He slashed at Carrera—and even this lefthanded, single-hand strike was true. A truly beautiful demonstration from a master swordsman, and Carrera had to rely on both Agera’s skill and her own intuition to parry the barrage.</p>
<p>After a while of this, a certain habit of Kondo’s began to dawn on Carrera. His left hand held the sword; the other, his gun. That was his fighting style, but when he fired his gun, his eyes and finger muscles would involuntarily move in tandem, revealing the bullet’s trajectory. It was a tiny quirk, something only Carrera could have ever spotted, but the flaw was still fatal enough to potentially decide the fight.</p>
<p><em>Here!</em></p>
<p>With perfect timing, Carrera swung his sword away. Kondo, about to fire a gunshot, failed to immediately respond—and despite himself, he held out his gun to catch Carrera’s sword. His reaction speed was up there with the best in the world, but it wasn’t enough to stop her.</p>
<p><a id="page-323"></a>“Let’s see you pick on me now! I’ve just taken away one of your weapons!”</p>
<p>Thanks to the twisted, off-balance stance he took to stop Carrera, he couldn’t fully resist the demon’s powerful strike. It wound up costing him his gun. The Nambu semiautomatic clattered to the ground.</p>
<p>Carrera was delighted to have this bit of revenge against Kondo. But then something gave her the creeps. As soon as she felt it, Carrera followed her instincts and jumped back from the spot.</p>
<p>Kondo’s sword cleaved through the air.</p>
<p>“Tsk. Missed my chance.”</p>
<p>The next thing that fell to the ground was Carrera’s severed left arm. Not even her orichalc skeleton could resist the force behind Kondo’s blade.</p>
<p>“Youuu!!”</p>
<p>Carrera was enraged. But her heart remained calm enough to recognize the reality of this situation, even though she was trembling in humiliation.</p>
<p>Now she knew that she’d never defeat Kondo like this. And as if to prove it, Kondo was now holding his military sword with both hands. It was a complete picture of beauty; he seemed like a completely different person from before. He had no intention of relying on his gun from the beginning, and now Carrera understood that he was trying to create an opening to lure her into all along.</p>
<p>Once again, Kondo had been looking down on her the entire time. He was at least an even match for her with his blade alone, but instead he was putting on this show the whole time to hide it…</p>
<p><em>He was hoping to take me down easy with that, I’m sure…but even a master like him’s using dirty tricks instead of showing off his full talents? I find that hard to forgive.</em></p>
<p>It made Carrera let out a shout.</p>
<p>“How dare you damned human beings berate us!!”</p>
<p>In a fit of rage, Carrera took a step forward to tear Kondo to pieces. But at that moment:</p>
<p>(Lady Carrera, please wait.)</p>
<p>Agera, still transformed into a sword, spoke to her.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-324"></a>Carrera and Agera were now almost as one—connected by Thought Communication, of course, so it was possible for them to talk to each other through their minds. So, in a field of consciousness stretched a million times over by Carrera’s ability, their conversation began.</p>
<p>(What is it, Agera? I’m busy right now, you know. Get in my way, and I’ll kill you, too.)</p>
<p>(Calm down, Lady Carrera. Losing your cool is exactly what Kondo wants from you.)</p>
<p>(I know that. But he made me out to be a fool, you know. Me, an overlord! How could I ever forgive that?)</p>
<p>Agera’s chief role lately had been to stop Carrera before she got carried away. But he had never seen her this angry before. He hadn’t, but if he didn’t take measures right now, Carrera’s defeat was inevitable.</p>
<p>So, as earnestly as he could, he tried to persuade her.</p>
<p>(Listen to me. Kondo hadn’t been relying on his sword since the beginning—and not because he thought little of you, either.)</p>
<p>(Why is that? He’s clearly belittling me!)</p>
<p>(No, he is not. In fact, it is quite the opposite.)</p>
<p>(Huh?)</p>
<p>(He recognizes you as a threat, Lady Carrera, and that’s why he is trying to conceal his hand. Not everyone is born innately strong like you, do you understand me? And it is a natural thing for any warrior to consider all due measures against a strong enemy!)</p>
<p>(So what’re you saying? He recognizes me as a strong fighter, then?)</p>
<p>(Yes, exactly!)</p>
<p>Agera made the strongest argument he could. Kondo had fully mastered a complete style, making it his own, but he had still basically inherited Agera’s style. He was serious about his craft, no doubt, but that was why he didn’t break it out from the beginning, only choosing to do so now. The slight opening he revealed when firing his gun must have been caused by his nerve-wracking training; the only reason he went with that move now was that he <a id="page-325"></a>decided Carrera was formidable enough to take the risk against. He never would’ve tried anything so tricky otherwise.</p>
<p>(…I see. You have a good point, yes.)</p>
<p>After careful persuasion, Carrera finally saw things Agera’s way. He breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>(I’m sorry to worry you, Agera. I feel like my eyes have been opened.)</p>
<p>(I am glad to hear that.)</p>
<p>(Here, let me promise you that I won’t make you worry any longer. All right?)</p>
<p>With that declaration, Carrera turned toward Kondo again. Then, out of nowhere, she struck herself in the face with the back of her fist. It was a full-power blast, one that seemed to make her head explode—but, unperturbed, she flashed Kondo a smile.</p>
<p>“Oops! Did I startle you? Well, don’t worry. I wasn’t being very coolheaded about any of this. I mistakenly thought that you were looking down on me. But you humans really are amazing, aren’t you? You really <em>will</em> play all kinds of tricks to win. The idea never occurred to us, so it’s kind of surprising.”</p>
<p>She was all smiles about it, but now she realized how important it was not to underestimate your enemy. She was by no means letting her guard down, but without Agera, she would’ve been taken in by Kondo’s scheme just now. She used to allow herself to be endlessly selfish—but that past was over. She was now a loyal servant of the demon lord Rimuru, and so she acted in accordance with her orders. Defeat was one thing, but death would be unforgivable.</p>
<p>Carrera admonished herself. That’s what that blow was for—that, and it was a way to state her resolve. Carrera recognized Kondo as an adversary, one of the same rank as her. It was a very sober thought, quite unlike her typical, capricious self.</p>
<p>“Like, no way, you know? No way I would ever go all-out…against a human, you know?”</p>
<p>Knowing she was the strongest of all races made her conceited enough that she never really gave her all before. She thought that Kondo was going easy on her, and it required Agera’s intervention to put an end to that. It was a blunder, and now that she realized <a id="page-326"></a>it, she finally got serious. She flashed her horrible smile, one that looked boundlessly beautiful to Kondo.</p>
<p>“So the demon’s treating this seriously now? A rather unwelcome turn of events for a hapless human such as I.”</p>
<p>For the first time in this encounter, his expression changed. He now saw Carrera as a worthy enemy.</p>
<p>“Very well. I, too, will take this seriously.”</p>
<p>With that declaration, Kondo put on his “armor” for the first time. It wasn’t a uniform manifested by the power of his will, but a spiritual outfit of pure white, a God-class piece given to him by Ludora. It was modeled after the ceremonial uniform of the old Imperial Japanese Navy, and while it didn’t make Kondo look all that different, the aura he presented seemed like something else entirely. To Kondo, this uniform was also the garment he would have been buried in; as a lieutenant, he vowed to carry the guilt of all the men he had let die. He wanted to hold that resolve close to his heart, and so he decided to fight in this.</p>
<p>Looking at him, Carrera released the full extent of her magical force and reintroduced herself.</p>
<p>“I am Carrera, Menace Lord and faithful servant of the demon lord Sir Rimuru. By my pride, I swear I will kill you.”</p>
<p>“I am Tatsuya Kondo, former lieutenant of the Imperial Japanese Navy and current commander of the Imperial Guardians…and I hereby accept your challenge.”</p>
<p>The two warriors stared each other down, quietly building up their power. Now the real battle would begin.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Carrera picked up the fallen left arm, lightly putting it against her stump. That alone was all it took to reattach it like nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“A little unfair.”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t be that way. Sir Rimuru gave me this precious body. I can’t afford to leave even a scratch on it.”</p>
<p>The conversation was light at the moment, but both sides were <a id="page-327"></a>looking for an opening. Kondo had his reasons for letting Carrera heal her arm. Now that he had given up his sidearm, he’d be fighting exclusively with his sword—the default form for the Oboro school. On the other hand, it meant he had no other secret trick left to pull out. He was deadly serious about this, putting everything he had on the line, and now that he held his sword in both hands, he was confident that no enemy could defeat him.</p>
<p>Kondo’s unique skill Decipherer allowed him to fully grasp Carrera’s movements—every twitch of her muscles, the flow of magic force throughout her body, even the telltale signs that a spell was about to be invoked. This was linked to the ultimate skill Sandalphon, and its performance went far beyond the realm of a unique skill. That was why he didn’t miss the fact that Carrera’s power was growing at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>It was a true torrent of force, all but symbolizing the demon’s sheer tyranny. And yet there was no stagnation at all to the flow; it all moved as one, as if unified by some great will. This mighty deluge would normally have resulted in a powerful explosion, but Carrera had it fully under control. <em>What a monster</em>, Kondo thought. Not even a trace of the grievous arm wound he landed a moment ago remained—even her clothes were repaired, in what seemed to be a cruel joke. All this raging energy was concentrated on the demonic blade Agera had transformed into. Being united in mind and body with Carrera completed the cycle.</p>
<p>Kondo could barely abide by this, but now he noticed a sign that troubled him even more. Astoundingly, in the very center of Carrera’s magic, a fearsome crystal of power was about to be born. Kondo had an idea of what it was. He himself had one, so he knew—it was something seen when a living mind was materialized.</p>
<p><em>She… Ahhh, I knew it. She’s trying to obtain an ultimate skill!</em></p>
<p>The moment he realized it, Kondo went on the move. He needed to eliminate this enemy at once, no matter how powerful she was. That was why he put on his ceremonial uniform, a symbol of his dedication. There was no room for defeat—he must win, by fair means or foul, and only through victory would right and wrong be decided.</p>
<p><a id="page-328"></a>Kondo continued to inspect Carrera as he finished his preparations. His sword was all he had left; pushing all his power into it, he slashed at the demon.</p>
<p>“Good, good! That unwavering eye of yours… It sends me into ecstasy!”</p>
<p>Kondo continued to swing, not lending an ear to Carrera’s squeals of joy. His swings were parried by her demon blade, but the power of Kondo’s military sword was nonetheless massive—without Agera’s will housed within, it might have broken her weapon right there.</p>
<p>“You…?!”</p>
<p>It was a honed, heavy slash, one that made Carrera grunt out loud.</p>
<p>The secret to this military sword’s force lay in the will placed inside of it. Kondo’s ultimate skill Sandalphon worked on more than just bullets. His will—his soul—was in this sword, and only then was the true essence of his power revealed. That was Kondo’s true secret move…and when he had to fight for keeps, that’s how he did it.</p>
<p class="space-break1">So Kondo’s onslaught began, immediately putting Carrera on the defensive. He was determined to end this bout before Carrera could awaken to her ultimate power, using every trick in the book to push her into the corner. Even when she manipulated her sheer violence to fire off an attack of ponderous force, Kondo deflected it all without so much as blinking. Kondo clearly had the advantage in fighting technique; the only reason why this match kept going was because of Carrera’s huge magicule count, not to mention the skills of Agera on top of that. Without both, Carrera would have been annihilated long ago.</p>
<p>Even now, a slash imbued with the power of an Eraser Bullet cut through Carrera’s left side. She had taken many of these slashes to her limbs already, but since they had a Necrosis effect applied to them, they were wreaking havoc on her magic vessels. Even her link with Agera was now being affected.</p>
<p>“You…”</p>
<p>Carrera bared her teeth as she stared at Kondo. It was a bad idea. <a id="page-329"></a>However strong he was, she thought she could handle him if she put her mind to it—but Kondo wouldn’t be that easy on her. Even with Agera’s aid, he was superhuman, more than enough so to outclass Carrera.</p>
<p><em>This human… This damned human! Awakened to Saint or not, how can a mere human corner me like this…?</em></p>
<p>Despite her disappointment in herself, Carrera put her right hand on her left side, which was cut open and leaking magic force. She tried to heal it, but her magic vessels were too out of control for it to work well. Normally, a wound of this level could be repaired without conscious effort—but even when she actively tried to heal, it was still like this. No matter how bold and careless Carrera could be, she was fully aware that this was an awful state of affairs.</p>
<p>As Kondo knew, the strength of one’s will can also affect how superior their power is. Kondo was a man who had attained an ultimate power entirely on his own. Compared to Carrera, who had an unlimited lifespan and lived her days however she wanted, the nobility of his character was without question.</p>
<p>With the pain that was torturing her even now, Carrera understood the difference. A skill is meaningless if it is just given to you; only when you wish to acquire it can you make the most of its essence. Carrera was superior to Agera in all respects—species, physical prowess, vitality, everything. Thanks to Agera’s aid, she was equal with her opponent…but she couldn’t win. In fact, they were on the verge of defeat.</p>
<p><em>If this keeps up, will we lose? Will I be destroyed…killed? Me, one of the overlords of the all-powerful demons…?!</em></p>
<p>It was absolutely unacceptable. Carrera’s pride would never allow it, and more than anything else, it’d be against the orders of Rimuru, her beloved demon lord. If it ever happened, she feared, it’d be such a blunder that he might kill her a million times and still not feel sated. She might have been fearless in all other ways, but not being able to follow Rimuru’s orders terrified her.</p>
<p>“I could never allow it!”</p>
<p>As soon as she shouted that, Carrera’s bloodshot eyes ogled Kondo. Forcefully regenerating her body to heal the wound, she <a id="page-330"></a>readied herself. Deeper and stronger than ever, she made a wish—a wish to beat the man before her.</p>
<p>Until now, she had only been fighting with her all-dominant demon force. But it wasn’t enough. Those who dwelt in the ranks of the ultimate were untouchable to her—as true for Diablo as it was for Kondo. She knew now that anyone who awakened an ultimate power was impossible for her to defeat—and if they were, she was no match at all for Guy Crimson, who stood at the very pinnacle of the world. Simply boosting her power wasn’t enough. No matter how hard she struggled, she’d only be cannon fodder for the more powerful.</p>
<p>Now that she was fully cornered, it finally dawned on Carrera. If she wanted to fight the <em>truly</em> powerful, she needed to understand herself more deeply—and what she needed the most for that was a strong will. And that was the moment when Carrera, a spiritual life-form, sought the power of will, the very essence of it all.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>In that case, let me help you a little.</em></span></p>
<p>She thought she heard a voice—and the next moment, Carrera felt something that had been nagging her in the back of her mind take shape. She turned her attention to it—this manifestation of her wish, her determination. Until now, it was just pure power raging inside of her, something she controlled and tapped into as necessary. Now, however, it was time to recognize that power as her own…and release it.</p>
<p>But any ultimate power needs a name.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>…My power… Let me give you a name. You will become my skill, and further release your force in order to fulfill the role Sir Rimuru gave me. Your name…is the ultimate skill Abaddon, Lord of Destruction!</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Abaddon. The destroyer, the one who destroys—and the king of the abyss. For the Menace Lord, no power could have been more appropriate. Now she finally had it. The absolute, undeniable power to destroy everything.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-331"></a>The ultimate skill Abaddon, Lord of Destruction.</p>
<p class="space-break1">It was the embodiment of all Carrera’s desires. A fearsome power that, once released, would bring certain destruction to its opponents. It took encountering a truly powerful enemy for Carrera to desire power for the first time—and now, that encounter was about to come to an end.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><em>This isn’t funny</em>, Kondo thought.</p>
<p>Just when he was about to finish her off, Carrera had awakened to her ultimate power right before his eyes. He wished he could tell her to stop with that nonsense, but it was too late now.</p>
<p>He had tried to deliver a fatal blow to her on several occasions, but no matter how many times Carrera fell, she kept getting back up. He used a Removal Bullet to slash through her barriers, then a Necrosis Bullet to disrupt the magical flow within her. Then, once she had accumulated enough damage, the power of the Eraser Bullet ability took center stage.</p>
<p>This should have been settled long ago. And yet, despite all his earnestness, Kondo was unable to defeat Carrera—and now her power was awakened. It was, as he was keenly aware, a terrible mistake.</p>
<p><em>Well, wonderful. If only I had any Judgment Bullets left…</em></p>
<p>Perhaps it was Kondo’s nascent timidity that made the thought come to his mind. A Judgment Bullet was a true joker card, something he could only produce once per day, the strongest blow he could muster. But he had used one not that long ago to bring Veldora to his knees. Begging for something he didn’t have in a life-or-death battle was the height of foolishness, something very unlike Kondo. Here she was, this formidable foe before her who had just gained an unknown power. The mere thought put him in a somber mood.</p>
<p>But he could still rally himself. Now that he had his ceremonial uniform on, it was his duty to fight through the battle, never <a id="page-332"></a>wavering in his resolve. But as he took up that duty, he spoke to Carrera, revealing his personal feelings for the first time.</p>
<p>“You are all so unfair.”</p>
<p>She laughed at mankind as feeble, and rightly so. In terms of species, the difference in “status” was like a chasm, impossible to fill. Even Kondo felt justified in complaining about it a bit.</p>
<p>Carrera gave this a satisfied nod. “Yes, of course it is. We are the strongest species, after all. But I think <em>you’re</em> being rather unfair, too, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>It was the greatest compliment Carrera could give, in her own way. She had already recognized him as her equal, and thus, with the utmost respect, she was ready to challenge him full bore.</p>
<p>Pointing her sword at him, she assumed a fighting stance, making sure her guard was up. Abaddon, Lord of Destruction, activated itself in both of her hands, a massive force circulating through them. The space between her and Kondo was filled with black and white light as a huge amount of magicules transformed into energy, the shock waves alone threatening to blow them away. Carrera could control it all through conscious focus alone.</p>
<p>“Allow me to show you everything.”</p>
<p>“…I’d appreciate it if you didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee! Don’t be such a stick in the mud. I have recognized you as my equal, and I will show you the best magic I’ve got!”</p>
<p>Kondo had a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>But Carrera was a demon who cared very little about the feelings of other people. That gave the demon lord Leon a hard time as well, although Carrera was just playing around at the time. It was a nasty thing to think, but from Kondo’s point of view, Leon had it easy. He didn’t have to deal with Carrera when she was truly serious, but Kondo did.</p>
<p>Among the four Devil Lords (including Diablo), Carrera now boasted the largest magicule count. She hadn’t been able to fully control it before, but with Abaddon, that shortcoming was a thing of the past. The current Carrera, in fact, could manipulate magic to an extent that rivaled Velgrynd.</p>
<p><a id="page-333"></a>“Let me grant you perdition. Vanish before me! Abyss Annihilation!!”</p>
<p>This was an ultimate magic, surpassing even Gravity Collapse—the greatest and most powerful attack magic—and Carrera’s ideals in action. It worked by adding matter from the lowest of hellish abysses into a collapsed gravitational force field, generating an unfathomable torrent of extreme energy. It was, needless to say, extremely difficult to even point this energy at something, much less control it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t even meant to be invoked while standing on a planetary surface, but Carrera didn’t hesitate to whip it out. One mistake controlling it could wipe out an entire planet, in fact. She had never successfully pulled it off during her practice sessions in the underworld, and this was the first time she ever tried it in the material world. It had never worked before, but she still didn’t hesitate.</p>
<p>If the other demonesses were here, they would’ve stopped her at any cost—but Carrera wasn’t about to be held down now. Agera was there, but telling Carrera to quit now would have been far too much to ask. If anything, the most frightened person in the arena was Agera, not Kondo, because he knew exactly how dangerous this magic was.</p>
<p>Kondo, meanwhile, detected the danger once Carrera began to invoke the skill, deploying Sandalphon before she made her final declaration. That quick assessment was Kondo’s forte, but this time, he had messed with the wrong opponent. Abyss Annihilation was an extremely large spell, one that could only work using Carrera’s absurd magic force, and its range was just as gigantic. If this weren’t another dimension, there was no telling how much damage it would cause. Kondo wondered if it could even destroy this entire dimension. If so—and if it was aimed at him, like it was now—anything in the line of fire would be obliterated.</p>
<p>That was Kondo’s conclusion. And if this dimension was destroyed, it could even harm Emperor Ludora. His defenses were sound enough, yes, but this was an unprecedented attack.</p>
<p>And that wasn’t all. Now Kondo became aware of an even more troubling fact. Looking at Carrera’s posture, even <em>this</em> vicious magic <a id="page-334"></a>was just a decoy. Should he somehow survive this, he would likely then be struck by her <em>real</em> ace in the hole—a downward slash from her demon blade. If so, there was no way to counter it. The only way to survive was to brave every sacrifice and out-slash the enemy.</p>
<p>So Kondo made up his mind. Sheathing his beloved sword, he waited for the moment to come. Then, as soon as Carrera activated her magic, he made his move.</p>
<p>Risking it all, he drew his sword.</p>
<p>“Multilayered…Blossom Flash…”</p>
<p>And then, right there, he reproduced the technique that Hakuro had shown him. The power imbued into it was that of a Judgment Bullet, one he was only allowed to use once per day—but he had to exceed the limit here, or else only destruction awaited. So he gambled on his own potential, firmly believing he could do it.</p>
<p>The power of the soul shone brightly in the arena. Did it belong to Kondo, or to Carrera? That would remain forever unknown, but one thing was clear—both sides were giving everything they had.</p>
<p>Kondo’s blade slashed through the torrent of frantic energy generated by Abyss Annihilation. It made Carrera’s eyes widen, but there was a smile on her lips. Intense pain racked his body. Even this God-class ceremonial robe, the best protection he could hope for, was unable to resist the power of destruction.</p>
<p>But he didn’t let this intimidate him. His faith unwavering, he aimed at Carrera’s head and unleashed the “eight blossom” slashes that gave Hakuro’s move its name.</p>
<p>Carrera went above him.</p>
<p>“Nice try. Now let me show you my greatest technique, for I have made Agera’s experience my own!”</p>
<p>It was both spoken and not spoken. In a single moment of time, Carrera had communicated her will to Kondo, in the form of a hundred sword flashes, all transcending his speed. This was the move Crestwater Hundred Flower Bloom, and its unbearable violence promptly shattered Kondo’s sword—and immediately after, Carrera’s final blow made a diagonal slash across his body.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p><a id="page-335"></a>…</p>
<p>Kondo could feel the strength draining from his entire body. He had exceeded his limits long ago, and knowing this, he closed his eyes and fell on his back. The end of his life was near.</p>
<p><em>How incomplete…</em></p>
<p>He laughed at himself as he thought this. In the end, he could do nothing—neither protect his nation nor keep his promise to Ludora.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>Be my friend, Tatsuya.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>Ah, I… I couldn’t even keep my promise to you.</em></p>
<p>Kondo’s heart was filled with regret, the thought of the unfulfilled promise making him feel ready to burst.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>“Tatsuya, may I ask you a favor?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes. Anything. I will do whatever I can to help as a friend.”</em></p>
<p><em>Right. I wanted to return the favor. I wanted to thank Ludora for calling me a friend—for giving me a reason to live in this world. But even so, that wish was such a cruel one…</em></p>
<p><em>“Long ago, I asked Damrada for a favor. I told him that should I ever lose sight of my ideals, I wanted him, my friend, to stop me. But I have now lived far too long, and Damrada is too kind a person to take my life with his own hands. I truly regret asking him for such a terrible favor.”</em></p>
<p><em>“So…”</em></p>
<p><em>“Tatsuya… I know you will be able to reason through it calmly. You will be able to kill me, won’t you? So please—you must interfere with Damrada’s efforts, and stop me with your own hands.”</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">He didn’t want to. He wanted Ludora to live as much as anyone. He was an intelligent man, reasonable and always keeping his eyes on the prize. He was like an idol to Kondo, a lord he could always strive to emulate but never equal. He was the one who stopped Kondo before he could turn the blade upon himself, despondent after failing to protect his home country. Emperor Ludora, the great hero.</p>
<p><a id="page-336"></a>But he still nodded, for he knew of Ludora’s suffering. His body—his shining soul—had long since reached its limit. He had reincarnated himself many, many times in his quest to control his special skill Michael, Lord of Justice. Thanks to Decipherer, his own unique skill, Kondo felt he understood that better than anyone else—even more than Velgrynd, in all likelihood. Velgrynd had grown blinded by her love for Ludora, so much so that if she knew the favors he asked Damrada and Kondo for, she’d likely be furious.</p>
<p>In a sense, it was only natural that Ludora would ask this favor of Kondo. He had nodded at his emperor, and so he had to keep the promise. That’s what making a promise meant, after all. But that time was far away. Ludora was still alive and well, in full control of his faculties.</p>
<p>…Or was that really the case? Looking back, there were a few irregularities he could’ve picked up on—the cold eyes he’d reveal at times, the occasionally heartless decisions he’d hand down. That was the only Ludora Kondo knew, but he could understand how it must have tormented Damrada. If Ludora was alive, he thought, why should Damrada be so distressed about it? Looking back, it was a pretty silly thought to have.</p>
<p><em>When did it begin?</em></p>
<p>When did Damrada begin to make serious moves toward this effort?</p>
<p><em>Did I overlook something important, perhaps?</em></p>
<p>He had interfered with Damrada as ordered, but perhaps that was a serious mistake. When they first met, Ludora was absolutely a shining presence—but Kondo had missed his transformation.</p>
<p>As soon as Kondo realized this, he felt the gloom in his heart clear out, as if the shackles had finally been undone.</p>
<p><em>Yes… I suppose I was long ago under Michael’s influence as well…</em></p>
<p>How pathetic, he thought. And it was. Right when Damrada was about to murder Ludora, he should have acted first instead of interfering. Perhaps he would have been able to stop Ludora then.</p>
<p><em>What a mistake…</em></p>
<p><a id="page-337"></a>There was no taking that back now.</p>
<p>Kondo didn’t know why he had been freed from Michael’s control—but at this point, he could no longer move a finger. All that remained was to wait for his body to rot away.</p>
<p><em>My liege, I am useless. I couldn’t bear your suffering alongside you…nor could I do anything to alleviate it. And even that promise to free you…</em></p>
<p>His role was to stop Ludora, but there was no carrying that out now. His life would surely end in regret…</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Hey, why’re you sleeping down there? Let’s keep going!”</p>
<p>He heard a voice speaking to him, rousing him from his sleep. Opening his eyes a little, he saw his enemy, the one who fought him to the death, pouting and looking straight at him. She was a demon with shining blond hair and a dazzling smile—truly beautiful.</p>
<p><em>…Don’t be ridiculous. I am already near death. There is no way I could fight.</em></p>
<p>“Huh? But we haven’t settled this yet. You can’t do that!”</p>
<p><em>Heh…heh-heh… Settle this? Yes…indeed. In the end… You are so unfair…</em></p>
<p>He doubted it was coming across, but Kondo still smiled faintly at Carrera’s words. Carrera herself would already be out of energy, just a few steps away from losing her physical body—and the thought made him smile.</p>
<p>He tried to lift his body up and failed. It was so shameful.</p>
<p><em>So I can’t do anything after all…</em></p>
<p>And meanwhile, the demon before him was so free, so pure…</p>
<p><em>I truly do envy you.</em></p>
<p>It was an honest, sincere thought. It drove Kondo to say things he didn’t even understand the meaning of.</p>
<p>“I… I have a favor. Use my—my gun, to kill His Majesty…”</p>
<p>He was about to entrust his one and only role to his mortal enemy.</p>
<p><em>What am I doing? What a stupid thing to ask the demon I was just fighting against…</em></p>
<p><a id="page-338"></a>The wishes of the defeated were doomed to always be laughed at. He truly thought so, but for some reason, he still said it.</p>
<p>So Carrera picked up the Nambu semiautomatic on the ground.</p>
<p>“You mean this? It’s broken.”</p>
<p><em>Ah, yes, it probably is</em>, Kondo thought as his consciousness faded. Perhaps asking for this wish was a little naïve of him. No demon would be that kind to him. That’s the harsh reality of it, and Kondo knew it well.</p>
<p>He was fading fast. He had become a Saint, but he was still a human being. If his soul was broken, revival would be impossible. Carrera’s blow had inflicted a fatal wound on him, and he could tell he was disintegrating from the far edges inward. By now, reversal was impossible.</p>
<p>“Pfft! So you’re going to give up just because you broke your toy here? After all the suffering you put me through, that’s pretty weak. It was such a nice battle, too! What a disappointment.”</p>
<p>Carrera, his former enemy, was giving him encouragement. He didn’t expect that. So, with his last ounce of energy, he smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>“Heh…heh-heh… Yes. Hilarious. My own worthlessness is but a joke…”</p>
<p>With that, he tried to let go of his consciousness. But:</p>
<p>“Wait. Don’t go on me yet. Maybe I’m willing to kill this emperor for you, huh?”</p>
<p><em>…?</em></p>
<p>“Ugh! You’re <em>so</em> slow on the uptake! What do I get out of it? Everybody knows that if you want a demon to work for you, you need an agreement!”</p>
<p>Carrera, by her nature, was not at all the type of demon you could negotiate with. But, for some reason, she felt like doing Kondo a favor. That didn’t mean she’d do it for free, though.</p>
<p>Kondo couldn’t help but smile at the flustered Carrera. It was growing more amusing by the moment. This devil, his enemy, acting all shy and confused. It was soothing.</p>
<p><em>You will get everything I have…even my soul. So please…</em></p>
<p>The words were no longer audible. Kondo opened his eyes with the <a id="page-339"></a>last of his strength and gave Carrera an iron-willed look. Believing in a demon was beyond laughable—but, her beauty burned into his mind, he made a wish. Perhaps it was his own selfish delusions telling him that she’d get the message. But even so, he placed his final hopes on it, if only to save himself from eternal disappointment.</p>
<p>But the voiceless request reached Carrera.</p>
<p>“Your wish has been heard. By my name as Carrera the Menace Lord, our contract is complete! Your wish shall be granted.”</p>
<p>Kondo smiled at these solemn words. Moving his powerless hand toward Carrera by sheer force of will, his fingertips touched the gun that she had assured him was broken. The moment his finger touched it, the Nambu semiautomatic glowed a golden shade. His power had transformed it, and it was reborn as a God-class weapon—and through it, Kondo’s soul passed over to Carrera.</p>
<p>But it did not include his heart core. Carrera expected this. The heart core of someone who had attained enlightenment and absolved himself of all sin could never be reborn, even if bound down. It was released from the wheel of reincarnation for good, with no restrictions placed upon it, and then it would travel to the promised land. Liberation.</p>
<p>It made Carrera a little sad.</p>
<p>“Pfft. This isn’t funny. It’s been a long time since I had an opponent with some actual backbone…”</p>
<p>And as she muttered that:</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>In that case, let’s merge the ultimate skill Abaddon, Lord of Destruction, with Sandalphon, Lord of Judgment.</em></span></p>
<p>She felt like she heard a voice. Hurriedly, Carrera turned her attention back to the gun in her hand.</p>
<p>Its golden glow seemed to brighten further, as if to tell her she’d no longer be alone. It was something to remember Kondo by…and now, it was Carrera’s new partner.</p>
<p>“Oh… So you’re with me now.”</p>
<p>When she spoke, the light from the gun seemed to blink for a moment—and as it did, she began to feel the power flowing into her.</p>
