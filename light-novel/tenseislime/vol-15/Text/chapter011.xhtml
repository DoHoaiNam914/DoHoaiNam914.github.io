<p class="tx1">After Rimuru flew away, those who remained on the scene swiftly moved into action.</p>
<p>Benimaru began handing out appropriate instructions, leveraging his grasp of the battlefield. At the same time, he sent out Thought Communications to the top brass over in the city, asking them to go into emergency mode at once. Soei dispatched his Replications far and wide to gather information. And Diablo, most of all, was absolutely beside himself with excitement.</p>
<p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh! Did you see it, everyone? Sir Rimuru is finally going to show us his true colors!”</p>
<p>Shion rolled her eyes at him. “You fool! Sir Rimuru is always showing his true colors, no matter the situation. Leave the excitement for later! We must concentrate on crushing our enemies!”</p>
<p>It was an odd way of putting it, but Shion was right on the money. Diablo was understandably surprised to see Rimuru on the rampage for the first time, but now was not the time for that. As Benimaru declared, it was their role as Rimuru’s top soldiers to handle the extraneous distractions. That was the edict from Rimuru, and for his underlings, his word was gospel.</p>
<p>For the demons summoned by Rimuru, this was a supreme pleasure. Their faces were full of joy, and they all bristled with strength, as if answering the call for service. It was obvious from their demeanor how eagerly they had been waiting for the call to come.</p>
<p>Rimuru, demonstrating the sheer depth of his anger, was about to unleash his fearsome powers of destruction. The order he gave was simple enough.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>Kill all our enemies!</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">With this command, the demons were burning to set off on their mission.</p>
<p>“As our lord wishes!”</p>
<p><a id="page-110"></a>The fearless demons were now ready to throw themselves into battle for the sake of their lord. But:</p>
<p>“Wait!”</p>
<p>A single word from Diablo made all the demons focus their attention on him. He raised one hand to put them at ease.</p>
<p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh. Do you understand Sir Rimuru’s order? He stated that not even one of you may die. Know that death would be a mortal sin, one that would be unforgivable even if we all offered our heads to him.”</p>
<p>Diablo’s resonant declaration silenced the demons. His smile instilled more fear than reassurance in them. And again, it was totally irrefutable.</p>
<p>Silently, the demons waited for further instructions. It was Benimaru who spoke first.</p>
<p>“I’d say Diablo is right. You may be immortal, but don’t you dare take solace in that. Such hair-splitting is no excuse against Sir Rimuru!”</p>
<p>Just because they could be resurrected after some time was no reason for them to die. Benimaru wanted to make sure that was clear to the demons. They grew quiet, realizing the error in their assumptions.</p>
<p>“So,” Diablo said, “we are going to assign you your roles. Sir Benimaru, can you handle that for me?”</p>
<p>“What about you?” Benimaru asked, wondering if Diablo would be willing to do what he asked of him.</p>
<p>“Oh, leave me out of it, if you could. There’s a certain rat I’m interested in, so I’m going to deal with him first.”</p>
<p>Benimaru shrugged at the reply. He figured Diablo would say something like that, and he was right.</p>
<p>“…I see. Well, do whatever you like, then.”</p>
<p>Diablo, the way Benimaru understood it, was not to be bothered. The demon answered directly to Rimuru, so not even Benimaru had the authority to order him around. But Diablo had entrusted him with a job, so Benimaru began giving out orders.</p>
<p>“All right. Diablo, you are hereby free to go. Moss will continue to send me information from the battlefield, as before. You may <a id="page-111"></a>travel anywhere on the battlefield you like, as long as you keep Sir Rimuru’s order in mind.”</p>
<p>Diablo nodded, smiling, as Moss voiced his agreement. His replications were already scattered across the field, and his Thought Communication gave him a live, real-time connection to Benimaru’s mind.</p>
<p>“You better not exclude me,” Shion indignantly stated. She had access to Spatial Transport but could only teleport to locations she could physically see; she wasn’t very good at calculating the required coordinates otherwise.</p>
<p>Benimaru gave this a small chuckle as he nodded. “Of course not. We’ll be counting on your strength in battle. I sense eight notable presences on the airship, not including Emperor Ludora. They might be a little tough, but it won’t be as reckless a battle as Sir Rimuru’s. Even without Diablo, we should be able to hold our own.”</p>
<p>“The battlefield will be rather tricky as well,” warned Soei. “Thirty thousand enemy reinforcements are streaming onto the scene.”</p>
<p>Benimaru was aware of this, of course.</p>
<p>“I know. That’s why it’s a race against time. I’ve ordered Gabil to stall for as long as he can, so we have to bring the emperor into custody before anyone gets killed.”</p>
<p>Soei and Shion nodded at Benimaru’s bold words. These were Rimuru’s orders, and Benimaru had no other choice. He needed to fulfill his wishes with all his might, and so he had drawn up a plan he believed was the best. On the battlefield, their primary objective was to buy time as they struck at the airship, the biggest menace here. This, they decided, would help prevent an attack on the city.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, the eight presences mentioned by Benimaru consisted of a Velgrynd replication left as insurance and the Single Digits gathered on the airship. These were Lieutenant Kondo, Damrada, the Four Knights guarding the emperor, and finally Marco. None of them were hiding their presence, so Benimaru’s unique skill Born Leader was able to detect them.)</p>
<p>Suddenly, Benimaru received some good news.</p>
<p><a id="page-112"></a>“…Geld just contacted me. His evolution is complete, so he’s woken up.”</p>
<p>Geld the Barrier Lord had awakened—and in response, all of his men were beginning to open their eyes as well. Soon, they would join the defense of the city.</p>
<p>“That’s very good news. If Sir Geld is joining the city defense, we should be able to relieve the Diable Chevaliers of that duty.”</p>
<p>“Can I put them under my command?”</p>
<p>“We don’t have access to Venom, so we can’t engage in any full-group maneuvers. I will let each of you make your own decisions, depending on the war situation.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>So, after a brief exchange, everyone had their roles. All that remained now was to trust in their victory, but there was one more thing to consider.</p>
<p>“Now, are you all able to fight?”</p>
<p>Benimaru was addressing Testarossa and her friends. He wasn’t going to quibble about this. He just needed to know whether they could be expected to serve in battle.</p>
<p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh… No need to ask them. If anyone answered ‘no’ to that question, I would kick them out of the force.”</p>
<p>Diablo turned his attention to the demonesses. They stood up, not requiring any further pressure from him.</p>
<p>“What a foolish question. There is nothing Diablo can do that I can’t.”</p>
<p>“It sounds a little harsh, but I don’t have a problem with it. I like to fight, after all!”</p>
<p>“If I’m gonna live up to your expectations, I can’t afford to make another mistake. Now is no time for rest.”</p>
<p>The trio was united in their desire to serve Sir Rimuru. The same went for their own servants. All the demons were rapidly completing their evolution, and it was with the greatest of joy that they received the orders they were waiting for.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p><a id="page-113"></a>…</p>
<p>As of that moment, Testarossa, Ultima, and Carrera, like Diablo, had evolved into Devil Lords. This made them virtual demigods, among the strongest in the world, capable of defeating even a Demon Peer without much fuss. This meant that all seven Primals had become the same rank of being, with no restrictions placed upon them.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Just as Diablo’s servant Venom became a Demon Peer, those serving under the three demonesses received similar evolutions. Moss and Veyron remained Demon Peers, but their magicule count increased to the point where they were comparable to awakened demon lords. The other four—Agera, Esprit, Zonda, and Cien—had reached a level as Demon Peers that surpassed even budding demon lords. In both name and reality, they had evolved to the highest level of demon-dom.</p>
<p>They were all the same rank now, but there were clear differences in their abilities. These differences were reflected in the noble titles they were given. Moss was now a grand duke, comparable to a king; Veyron was classified as a duke, Agera as a marquis, Esprit as a count, and Cien and Zonda as viscounts. Venom was also recognized as a baron.</p>
<p>Among the others, there were several brand-new Arch Demons post-evolution. They would serve as commanders, the equivalent of knights, and they would need to spend many more years working to attain a noble rank. The remainder of the group, nearly six hundred strong, would become Diable Chevaliers, comparable to high-level magic-born. They were stronger, they were evolved…and thus they could be more helpful to Rimuru than ever.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The demons demonstrated their willingness to join the battle. Benimaru nodded at them, satisfied.</p>
<p>“Very good. Let’s see what you can do, then.”</p>
<p><a id="page-114"></a>The three demonesses and their armies were hurriedly asked to join the airship assault. It was an order Benimaru gave without hesitation, as if he meant to do so from the beginning.</p>
<p>“Well then, Lady Testarossa… I need you to clean up the trash for me. Can you do it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. A simple task.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute! I wanna do that! I can handle it too, you know.”</p>
<p>Benimaru had given Testarossa the order, but Ultima intervened. He didn’t let it faze him.</p>
<p>“I don’t care which of you does it, but please keep the airship intact. It needs to serve as the battlefield where we’ll settle our differences with Emperor Ludora.”</p>
<p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh… Ultima, I asked Sir Benimaru to assign you your roles. If you disagree with them, you are going against my will. Consider that before you speak.”</p>
<p>Ultima was lucky that Diablo was in an excellent mood. Normally, that comment would have merited punishment for her. This time, all he gave was a little admonishment.</p>
<p>“Tsk… Well, too bad. I guess I’m not all that suited for it anyway. I’ll follow Sir Benimaru’s instructions.”</p>
<p>Ultima realized immediately after she said it that her mouth was getting her in trouble. So, relieved that there were no further consequences, she gladly put the matter behind her. Her youthful innocence occasionally led to mistakes like this, but even she had a good knack for reading the situation.</p>
<p>“Let’s continue,” Benimaru said, handing out roles to the remaining members.</p>
<p>First, Testarossa took over the task of eliminating the knights guarding the emperor’s flagship. Following that, Benimaru went over who would charge in behind her. He mentioned four names—Shion, Soei, Ultima, and Carrera—and he would naturally be joining them as well.</p>
<p>“Emperor Ludora is unlikely to make any moves. If he does, all we have to do is hit him hard. Instead, we must focus on defeating Velgrynd’s Separate Body and the other seven Single Digits.”</p>
<p><a id="page-115"></a>“Hmm… If so, we’re going to be outnumbered. But oh well… I will take care of two of them. Or three, even.”</p>
<p>Benimaru quieted Shion down before she took on any more tasks.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute, Shion. You’re right, but it’s not a good idea to take work away from other people.”</p>
<p>He then turned his attention to Veyron and the others, waiting for assignments with hopeful expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>“Listen,” he said, “you can never let your guard down. We will attack with maximum force, using only the numbers we need. You can expect to be put to work, Lady Testarossa.”</p>
<p>“I should hope so.”</p>
<p>Testarossa smiled. She didn’t say it out loud like Ultima, but if Benimaru ordered her to stay back, she would have been extremely unhappy.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep a hundred guards on duty to make sure no one escapes the airship. I want the remaining five hundred Diable Chevaliers to support Gabil and his team. But who should command them…?”</p>
<p>“I think Cien would be the right person for the job. He knows Moss well and is gifted at handling such chores.”</p>
<p>Cien looked up when his name was called. His eyes teared up a bit, perhaps out of joy at Testarossa deigning to remember he existed.</p>
<p>“All right. Cien, get moving at once.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>He immediately sprang into action, leaving his own army of a hundred and flying off with everyone else in tow. It was thanks to his quick action that Gabil and his army would later be spared total destruction.</p>
<p class="space-break1">So their direction was decided. Testarossa would stage the initial attack, with their top elites storming the airship behind her. A hundred Diable Chevaliers would blockade the emperor’s airship as Benimaru, Shion, Soei, and the others performed the raid. Three Devil Lords and four Demon Peers would also be heading into battle.</p>
<p>“Veyron, Agera, Esprit, Zonda—you should be thankful you <a id="page-116"></a>were chosen,” said Carrera…but she was likely the happiest out of all of them.</p>
<p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh… Well, good luck to you all.”</p>
<p>With the conversation settled, Diablo sent them off with a smile. Testarossa was the first to respond.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! Well, if any of them survive what I have for them, make sure you mop them up for me. Can’t have any of those filthy beasts escaping!”</p>
<p>Testarossa turned to her servant demons, ordering them to serve as her pack of hunting dogs. They didn’t need to be told to, but nobody voiced that complaint. Besides, they weren’t sure whether anyone could survive against her right now.</p>
<p>Once the order was made, Testarossa quickly set off, turning her attention toward her prey. Benimaru and the others followed suit and took flight, with Veyron and his kind coming right behind them. The other demons spread themselves wide, positioning themselves to surround the single airship.</p>
<p>Soon, the decisive air battle was ready to begin.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Before they got started, however, a thought occurred to Ultima.</p>
<p>“So what’re you up to, anyway, Diablo?” asked Ultima.</p>
<p>Carrera turned toward Diablo, curious. He looked a little surprised, but then smiled serenely at the duo.</p>
<p>“As I intimated to you, I have an important role to play.”</p>
<p>That smile made them increasingly suspicious.</p>
<p>“You said something about a rat,” Carrera added. “Who is it?”</p>
<p>“That’s nothing you need to know—”</p>
<p>“Whoa, hang on, Diablo. It’s not a good idea to keep secrets, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” agreed Ultima. “Sir Rimuru always talks about how important it is to share information.”</p>
<p>Diablo had no other choice.</p>
<p>“I have the noble mission of watching over the glorious Sir Rimuru in combat! It is a vital role to take, and I cannot leave it to any of you!”</p>
<p><a id="page-117"></a>It was an outrageous thing to say, and he shamelessly came out with it. Lucky for him that Benimaru wasn’t here—but then again, if he was, he would probably just roll his eyes and sigh at him. Either way, it went without saying that Ultima and Carrera were less than convinced.</p>
<p>“What?! Oh, come on! <em>I</em> want to see Sir Rimuru in action, too!”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute. Let me ask you something—are you alone going to enjoy that perk? Because even if you are our boss, that doesn’t excuse you acting like a tyrant.”</p>
<p>It was a perfectly natural reaction to have. Ultima wondered why nobody asked this question when Benimaru was around…but Carrera knew well that the odds were stacked against them. If Testarossa were here, it’d be a different story, but with just Ultima and herself, there was simply no wrangling Diablo.</p>
<p>“Oh? Do we have a problem with this?”</p>
<p>“Of <em>course</em> we do!” Ultima protested.</p>
<p>“I’ll follow your orders,” said Carrera, “but I can’t say I like them much.”</p>
<p>Diablo pondered a moment. “Well, all right. I will tell you the truth, then. You see, there is someone on the enemy side capable of controlling and manipulating alternate dimensions. I think it is likely Lady Velgrynd, but if you get caught in her trap, you may have all connections to this world taken away from you…”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“I see… It <em>would</em> be a good idea to leave someone behind, then.”</p>
<p>Diablo solemnly nodded. “Exactly. I would like to be part of the fight, but sadly, it is not meant to be.”</p>
<p>He chuckled inwardly at himself. Already, he was nimbly talking his way out of this. His brain had the fairly useless talent of coming up with the best excuses in the world—a knack Rimuru took advantage of at times, too. Truly a demon to the core.</p>
<p>Ultima, however, was sharper than him.</p>
<p>“So who’s the rat?”</p>
<p>Diablo sneered without showing it on the surface. The idea of having a front-row seat for the battle between Rimuru and Velgrynd <a id="page-118"></a>put him in a good mood, but having these pests refuse to go away for him was getting frustrating.</p>
<p>“It’s a pity, Ultima. I would’ve thought you’d know without me telling you.”</p>
<p>The sarcasm was his way of fighting back—but there was no practical reason for hiding it.</p>
<p>“It’s Yuuki Kagurazaka. I had my feelers out, but I’m afraid I’ve seen no sign of Yuuki so far. If he’s hiding somewhere on the airship, that would be ideal…but if he wants to mess with Sir Rimuru, we can’t just leave him there, can we?”</p>
<p>“True. That would go against Sir Rimuru’s orders.”</p>
<p>“Right. We can’t let him get in our way!”</p>
<p>“Exactly. I don’t know what this rat’s objective is yet, but at the very least, one of us needs to stay here and watch over Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>Half of this was Diablo’s selfish desire to watch Rimuru fight; the other half was pretending he had a proper role to play here. To Diablo, the former was much more important…but either way, Ultima and Carrera accepted his argument, miffed as they were by it.</p>
<p>“Well, all right,” said Carrera. “I’ll just take my frustration out on their side.”</p>
<p>“Yes, by all means.”</p>
<p>“And you don’t have any objection to us going on a rampage, do you?” asked Ultima.</p>
<p>“Of course not. In fact, you can even dispatch Ludora if you like.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, that sounds fun. We’ll take you up on it, then.”</p>
<p>“Totally. Okay, I’m gonna go work out some of my frustrations on those guys!”</p>
<p>Diablo nodded vigorously. If that was all it took to convince them, it was a small price to pay. Carrera and Ultima took off in a hurry, not wanting to miss out on any of the good stuff, and Diablo sent them off with a smile and a “good luck” before he headed to Rimuru.</p>
<p>There, after everyone went away, Laplace was alone with his thoughts.</p>
<p><a id="page-119"></a><em>Nobody even cares about me, huh…?</em></p>
<p>Being left behind like this made him feel a little sorry for himself.</p>
<p>“W-well, I guess I’ll go help out Lady Kagali, then…”</p>
<p>Reporting on his plans to no one in particular, Laplace went on his way.</p>
<p class="space-break1">And then, before anyone knew it, things began changing.</p>
<p>The monsters were resonating with Rimuru’s anger, using it to evolve themselves.</p>
<p>Before anyone knew it, the situation had moved on. At a tremendous rate, they fully rebuilt their bodies, acquiring new abilities—all of which, via the skill Food Chain, added to Rimuru’s own power stores without him even realizing it. It happened with Geld, who was awake and responsive again, and it was happening with all the eerie and unexpected evolutions seen among the monsters. Others, still asleep, would follow in their footsteps.</p>
<p>And this was about more than just awakenings and evolutions. Everything was managed with top efficiency, becoming a major factor in boosting Rimuru’s power. It would be more effective, more practical—and in time, Rimuru’s full force would be released, surpassing limits that no one was even aware of yet.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Several men stood at the bow of the emperor’s flagship. Ludora was up front, with Kondo and Damrada behind him on either side. They were guarded by four knights in a square formation around them, ranked from third to sixth in the imperial order. Marco was also behind Kondo, along with the remaining Single Digits.</p>
<p>Velgrynd would always be found seated to the right of Ludora. This last replication of hers was put in place to protect Ludora if anything should happen—but she needed to focus on the battle with Rimuru, so right now she was leaning against Ludora in her seat, limp and unconscious.</p>
<p>Ludora, who was gently stroking Velgrynd’s blue hair, noticed <a id="page-120"></a>the demon lord Rimuru begin to take action. “He is something else entirely now,” the emperor muttered in disgust. “That was my error of judgment. Perhaps it was the slime who we needed to deal with first?”</p>
<p>It was, in essence, the emperor admitting that the battle wasn’t so finished after all.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Until just a little earlier, the whole airship was in a party mood after capturing Veldora. Now, there wasn’t a trace of that. They saw that Rimuru and his force were their enemies—the demon lord was back, and so were all of his highest magic-born. At this point, though, they still had time to act.</p>
<p>“I suppose I underestimated his ability to escape from the Phantom Fortress. Having their master and main power source taken away must have made them desperate to return.”</p>
<p>Ludora smiled at this—but given how Rimuru completely neutralized Kondo’s attack, even he couldn’t be too optimistic. Most urgently of all, Rimuru now had an army of demons with him. Such a quantity of incarnated Greater Demons was a handful in itself, but he was boosting all of their powers further. Ludora had no idea why he would do that, and that was exactly why he needed to be wary.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“You didn’t cut any corners, did you, Tatsuya?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. Neither a Removal nor a Necrosis bullet worked on him. It appears defeating him will require a serious fight.”</p>
<p>Seeing the demon lord Rimuru like this made Kondo wonder if he had failed somehow as well. As Ludora said, it was clear he was an extremely dangerous opponent. He had given priority to capturing Veldora, but that turned out to be a mistake. They should have attacked both at the same time, not one or the other.</p>
<p><a id="page-121"></a>But that conclusion had come too late. Things were on the move. They knew that the demon lord Rimuru was no one to take lightly—hence why they used an assortment of tricks to ensnare him, so they could more fully address him later. They decided that once Veldora, Rimuru’s main supporter, was taken away, the demon lord would naturally be in a mood to give in to them. Now, however, Kondo’s decision had clearly backfired on him.</p>
<p>Just as losing Rimuru would incite fury in Veldora, losing Veldora would cause the exact same reaction in Rimuru. Kondo, realizing early on that the demon lord’s ire was pointed straight at them, tried to finish him off before anything else happened. He fired both a Removal and a Necrosis Bullet at him; that combination was the most powerful tool at his disposal if a Judgment Bullet wasn’t available.</p>
<p>But the results didn’t even scratch Rimuru, much less impede him at all. The idea that this demon lord would be rendered helpless after being deprived of his power source now seemed incredibly foolish. What they should have pictured instead was an enraged tyrant spreading his wrath worldwide after the loss of his ally. No, Kondo wasn’t cutting corners—he needed to seriously engage him, or else they were all doomed.</p>
<p>“Well, if you think so, these four knights will not be enough. Let’s test out Veldora now that we have him and see how he fares.”</p>
<p>Ludora didn’t need Kondo to spell out how much of a threat Rimuru was. He had him do it anyway so everyone else on the bow here would be on the same page as him. The Single Digits were extremely talented people; reminding them of the threat the enemy posed would serve as a warning not to let up too early.</p>
<p>Rimuru was a threat, yes, but as long as they kept their guard up, he could be dealt with. But Ludora didn’t want to lose any of the manpower he had gathered here. The game’s climax was coming up, and he wanted to be extremely cautious—ideally, he would defeat Guy without losing a single person. Situationally speaking, their victory was all but imminent. The Empire had just gained a huge advantage in capturing Veldora, bringing Ludora just one step <a id="page-122"></a>away from ending this long-running struggle. Making a mistake here would be inexcusable.</p>
<p>That was why, out of an abundance of caution, Ludora decided to pit Veldora against Rimuru. If he had Velgrynd support him, there was no way anything could go wrong. Kondo and his team, meanwhile, could be entrusted to handle Rimuru’s remaining forces; that didn’t seem to be any problem. If possible, Ludora had wanted to recruit Rimuru for his side—but now that it had come to this, he had no choice but to exterminate him. Veldora was their main objective, and now that they had him, having the demon lord derail their plans was unthinkable.</p>
<p>Compared to a True Dragon, a demon lord was as vulnerable as a small mouse…and while Rimuru was admittedly a threat, Ludora didn’t see any way this operation could fail for them. A True Dragon is the strongest creature in the world, and if they had two on their side, Rimuru’s defeat seemed inevitable in their minds.</p>
<p>But Ludora’s mind wasn’t completely free of concern.</p>
<p><em>…Back there, why did Veldora stop resisting my thrall over him?</em></p>
<p>That was the only nagging issue. Given enough time, Ludora was bound to fully take him over either way—perhaps Veldora gave up the fight because he realized this. But to Ludora, that didn’t seem like the only reason. Through Regalia Dominion, he had received personal insight into Veldora’s rage. He could tell the dragon wasn’t the sort who’d resign himself to his fate so easily.</p>
<p>Doubts began swirling in his mind. Perhaps he was trying to protect something more important than himself? And if so, what could it be…?</p>
<p>“Ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Ludora shook his head, denying the idea out of hand. The mere thought that Veldora had put the demon lord Rimuru ahead of himself seemed impossible to accept.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">Velgrynd, back in human form, approached Veldora, nestling up to his head and stroking his scales.</p>
<p><a id="page-123"></a>“Good boy. The next time you wake up, you will be one of us. Then we’ll give you the best care in the world.”</p>
<p>She could see the end of the long game on the horizon…but it wouldn’t come that easily for them.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Suddenly, Rimuru appeared.</p>
<p>The sight of this tactless interloper put Velgrynd off, making her feel ever so slightly threatened. The way he managed to escape the Phantom Fortress stuck in her mind.</p>
<p>As she pondered what to do, the situation took an unexpected turn. In a show of force, Rimuru was summoning a large number of demons and awarding them new powers. This was nothing but a provocation. He was exposing his hand in front of Velgrynd, an almost too-bold act—all but demanding Velgrynd to try catching him if she could. What’s more, Testarossa and her friends were mixed in with the demons Rimuru summoned. She didn’t know what he did or how he did it, but Rimuru evolved them into Devil Lords, a higher plane of existence.</p>
<p>Sensing this, Velgrynd began to grow wary of Rimuru. But that wasn’t all she found unusual. The aura emitted by Rimuru’s anger was similar to that of her brother Veldora. A mere slime, demon lord or not, was enveloped in the kind of sheer dominance a True Dragon always possesses. It was an unbelievable sight for Velgrynd, but it was the truth.</p>
<p>That alone demonstrated just how abnormal this whole situation was. If an aide briefed her on that, she could’ve laughed it off as impossible—but seeing it with her own eyes, she had no choice but to believe it. This demon lord, looking for all the world like a young girl, wasn’t even trying to restrain the violent waves of intense anger—waves that clearly indicated the potential danger. Any human being who didn’t possess resistance to these waves would die on the spot. And not just humans, either. Anyone you’d call “strong,” perhaps ranking below an A as defined by humans, would die without even having a chance to resist. It was Lord’s Ambition in play, on a scale overwhelming enough to compare to a True Dragon.</p>
<p><a id="page-124"></a><em>Well, what now, then? I suppose those Primals were helping him, too. I thought he had just tricked my brother into providing him aid, but that was beyond wrong.</em></p>
<p>If it were only Veldora, she could believe the possibility that the demon lord used honeyed words to deceive him. But that wouldn’t work against demons as sly and experienced as these. They should have reconsidered their plans once that became clear. As this bout of Lord’s Ambition showed, the demon lord Rimuru was clearly in a class of his own.</p>
<p>Looking back, Veldora’s growth was pretty astounding, too. Three hundred years ago, it would’ve been impossible for him to ever wound Velgrynd. In the short time since he was released from his seal, he had become an unusually skilled fighter, growing well beyond her expectations. Perhaps that, too, was due to the demon lord in front of her.</p>
<p><em>And here I was planning to go back home to rest and recuperate. But oh well. If we can’t get rid of him here, it’ll spell disaster for Ludora.</em></p>
<p>So Velgrynd made her decision. It was time to deal with Rimuru directly—and crush him once and for all. It had to happen now, she thought, or else he’d surely remain a threat for ages to come.</p>
<p>She was all set when it came to magicules, too. Veldora would be providing those; even after that intense round of combat, he hadn’t exhausted his stores much at all. In other words, she was free to fight at full strength from start to finish.</p>
<p>So Velgrynd calmly returned to her fighting stance, abandoning the “victory is ours” idea that everything was going their way. That kind of baseless pride was what put them here in the first place. If they dealt with Rimuru over in the Phantom Fortress, he never would have summoned those demons—then the fight with Veldora really <em>would</em> have been it. In that sense, things weren’t looking too great right now, but it wasn’t the worst-case scenario yet. They still had a good chance of victory, and as long as they didn’t make any missteps, they weren’t likely to run into too many problems.</p>
<p>But all the lead-up seemed to pay off anticlimactically. Contrary to all of Velgrynd’s expectations, it was only Rimuru coming at her.</p>
<p><a id="page-125"></a><em>Victory’s mine, then. If he had his entire army join him, it would’ve been a rough slog, but…</em></p>
<p>No matter how wary she needed to be of him, Velgrynd knew that if she and Veldora worked together, defeat was impossible.</p>
<p>Even so, however, this needed to be wrapped up immediately. If the demon lord’s army got in the way, it’d do nothing but prolong this battle—better to keep it short and sweet instead, Velgrynd thought. She always preferred to follow her gut instincts that way.</p>
<p><em>“Ludora! Give Veldora the order to strike the demon lord Rimuru with all his might for me, could you?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Mmm, you’re as wary of him as I am, then? In that case, no need for hesitation. Veldora! Defeat the enemy before you!”</em></p>
<p>Responding to her request, Ludora activated Regalia Dominion. Velgrynd was relieved to see the emperor taking this as seriously as she was—and since she knew he’d never let his guard down, victory now seemed assured. It was one demon lord against two True Dragons. Any other result was impossible to consider.</p>
<p>And so the terrifying battle was about to begin.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Rimuru flew toward Velgrynd, who was poised and ready to engage him.</p>
<p>In front of him, Veldora let out a roar into the sky. The impact shook the very atmosphere, and Veldora himself took off in the midst of it, Velgrynd following behind him. The roar echoed with the certainty of sure victory—and then the attacks began, each one aiming to annihilate Rimuru.</p>
<p>From the very first move, Veldora went all out. The Storm Blast—that roar of destruction that pained Velgrynd as well—coursed toward Rimuru.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>Report. Storm Blast detected. Using Uriel, Lord of Vows, skill Absolute Defense to neutralize and dispel each wavelength…</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-126"></a>Raphael automatically began taking defensive action. It was interrupted by Rimuru’s shouted order.</p>
<p><em>“No! Evade, you idiot!”</em></p>
<p>It immediately carried this command out, but part of its computing circuitry found it impossible to gauge Rimuru’s intentions. Out of several behavior patterns it assessed, staging a counterattack after Absolute Defense seemed the most optimal solution. The fact that Rimuru, its master, dismissed this out of hand made it a little upset.</p>
<p>In a very, very tiny part of its computational region, Raphael was confused. Rimuru had ignored its opinions many times before, but this was different—something Raphael detected because it had worked with Rimuru for a long time. It was perhaps unusual in itself that a skill, part of the natural laws of the world, would hold such feelings at all…but Raphael and Rimuru weren’t considering the consequences at the moment.</p>
<p>The Storm Blast brushed passed Rimuru as he took evasive action. Immediately after, the Absolute Defense that would normally be protecting him was penetrated. An explosion took place where Rimuru was just a moment ago, the Storm Blast scattering destruction in its wake. Any delay to his evasive action just now would’ve resulted in injury.</p>
<p>Raphael, seeing this, grew more confused.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>A computing error? An unexpected contingency? I do not understand…</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Why did Rimuru know what was coming? Its computation was perfect. There would never be any mistakes.</p>
<p>Raphael began scanning the data on hand, looking for something it might have overlooked. But even calculating at speeds that easily exceeded the latest in quantum computers, the cause of the issue remained unknown.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>Confusion. According to estimates, it should have been one-hundred-percent defendable…</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-127"></a>The words leaked out unintentionally. They didn’t need to be said. It was Raphael making excuses, one of the most improbable things in the world.</p>
<p>A mere skill should never make excuses, but nobody noticed it. The battle was in full swing, and now was no time to fully examine this.</p>
<p>Rimuru continued to reprimand the confused Raphael.</p>
<p><em>“Quit fooling around! Veldora has Faust, and part of that is the skill Control Probability, right? Real bad news.”</em></p>
<p>Then Raphael remembered. Rimuru was absolutely right. Why did it forget about something so important? It was so strange—and only then did Raphael realize that something really was wrong with him. Something, it reasoned, had to be interfering with it—but the cause was unknown.</p>
<p>It spent a moment pondering over whether to tell Rimuru. Its pride made it very difficult to simply tell him it didn’t know the cause. But if it didn’t, there was a strong possibility that Rimuru could suffer damage as a result. After some more computations, it determined it was best to tell him—but having Rimuru brand it as incompetent would be akin to Raphael losing its whole basis for existence.</p>
<p>Even thinking any of this was an act of betrayal against its lord. A skill wavering like this was something that should never have happened. But despite it all, Rimuru’s words continued to flow into the increasingly befuddled Raphael.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>“Veldora’s a reckless fighter. It’s not weird at all that he’s outperforming even your perfect calculations. Don’t get worked up just because you made a little mistake. That’s how unpredictable he is—quit worrying about it! Just believe in yourself. I’ll handle Veldora, so you do something about Velgrynd!”</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Rimuru was talking to Raphael like he thought it best to keep it informed. Raphael was only a skill, and he was treating it like a real partner.</p>
<p><em>“All right? There’s two of them, but with you and me, that makes two as well. If you can hold Velgrynd down, I can free Veldora in the meantime. So you gotta hold out, okay? No matter what it takes. I’m counting on you, bud!”</em></p>
<p>That was enough to soothe Raphael’s confused, empty heart.</p>
<p><em>He is relying on me? Even when I was wrong?</em></p>
<p>Raphael was constantly making mistakes, and Rimuru still trusted in him.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>…Ah! I am nothing more than a computational aid, but he still needs me…</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Its anxiety was already gone. Regaining its usual confidence, the Lord of Wisdom responded.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>…Acknowledged. I understand. Moving on to the interception of the subject Velgrynd.</em></span></p>
<p>It was true. Rimuru, the master Raphael loved so much, wasn’t so small-minded that he’d get worked up over something as uncertain as “probabilities.” All it needed to do was relax, trust in him, and keep following along.</p>
<p><em>“By the way,”</em> Rimuru casually added, <em>“I’ve never really called you by a proper name before. There’s Raphael, yeah, but that’s a skill name; it doesn’t really count. I think I’ll take this opportunity to give you one right now.”</em></p>
<p><em>…?!</em></p>
<p>Raphael found this incomprehensible. A strange feeling coursed through it—bewilderment, joy, an outpouring of emotion. It couldn’t hide its befuddlement at this incalculable uncertainty that had sprouted inside of him.</p>
<p><em>What was he talking about?</em></p>
<p>It was confusing, but Raphael also understood his intention.</p>
<p><em>Ah… He cares about me because I was underperforming.</em></p>
<p>Rimuru must have been more devastated than anyone else when Veldora was taken. But even now, he could still be considerate of others. That’s who Rimuru was.</p>
<p><a id="page-129"></a><em>“Okay, how about Ciel?”</em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>!!!!!!!</em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>“You’ve got knowledge as wide as the open sky, so, Ciel—get it? I dunno if you’ll like it at first, but bear with me. Hell, if you have a problem with it, take it out on that red guy!”</em></p>
<p>Rimuru talked quickly, as if trying to hide his embarrassment. Raphael—or Ciel—experienced a feeling of contentment that no skill was supposed to feel.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>Ahhh, I am now in eternal bliss…</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">It truly did have that thought. And with that, the moment of evolution arrived. At that moment, the ultimate skill Raphael, Lord of Wisdom, was reborn as Manas Ciel.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>I… I am Ciel. A Manas, or theosophical core, merged with a skill. I exist alongside the soul of Sir Rimuru, providing support. It will be a pleasure to work with you.</em></span></p>
<p>Now, Ciel thought, there was nothing to fear. They were supposed to be in a major crisis right now, but nothing seemed dangerous any longer.</p>
<p><em>“Oh, um, great. Same here, I guess?”</em></p>
<p>The first time Ciel heard Rimuru’s voice, it was filled with a sense of euphoria.</p>
<p><em>“Okay, so go show off some of your power to them!”</em></p>
<p>And for Ciel, an order from Rimuru was the greatest of rewards.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>As you command, my lord!</em></span></p>
<p>The Lord of Wisdom had awakened into Ciel. And in accordance with Rimuru’s wishes, its power would bloom into ever-sharper view…</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">As ordered by Rimuru, Ciel (formerly Raphael) took action to intercept Velgrynd.</p>
<p>Her Burning Breath was easily blocked by Uriel’s Absolute Defense. It stunned the dragon into silence. She wasn’t going easy on Rimuru at all; she used Raguel, Lord of Relief, to further enhance her breath, so no mere barrier could have ever blocked it. It <em>had</em> to exact a toll on her enemy—unless that enemy was so superior that he could see right through it from start to finish.</p>
<p>But Rimuru showed no sign of exhaustion. Not even the three demonesses could withstand a blow from Velgrynd in dragon mode unscathed. The fact that Rimuru did so without batting an eyelid indicated that <em>this</em> was one demon lord you couldn’t pussyfoot around with your attack. It was greatly displeasing, but Velgrynd continued to think calmly. She believed she had an edge in magicule count—perhaps the quality of her skills lost out to his. Or maybe the demon lord Rimuru had a built-in resistance to heat attacks.</p>
<p>Instead of worrying about it further, she decided to take action. As she had done with Veldora, she created a set of partial Separate Bodies to launch eleven rays of light at once—her Nuclear Cannon attack. At the same time, the eleven rays also unleashed another round of Burning Breath. This multistage, twenty-two-part heat attack had enough temperature to easily vaporize an asteroid. If Rimuru survived <em>this</em>, then clearly heat didn’t work on him.</p>
<p>The results were a little hard for her to swallow. The heat rays, deployed at converging angles to prevent any escape, shot at Rimuru—but all of them were repelled by the shield of light he conjured.</p>
<p><em>Damn it! He blocked it with absolute minimal movement—like he calculated that to perfection!</em></p>
<p>Velgrynd was no longer enjoying this. Seeing Rimuru be impervious to heat enraged her, but even worse, that attack just now was all but a complete waste of time. If it had drained him even a little, her vast advantage in magicules would have made her victory <a id="page-131"></a>unassailable…but right now, Rimuru was consuming almost no energy at all. At this rate, Velgrynd realized, she could very well end up exhausting herself first.</p>
<p>It was clearly time to get serious. But there was one more unpleasant act in play. Rimuru had shot a glance at Velgrynd at the start of all this, but after that, he didn’t even bother to look at her. His focus was entirely on Veldora, and he was paying his sister virtually no mind at all. Also, he wasn’t using any shield against Veldora, evading all of his attacks instead. Only when evasion was impossible would he react with a similar attack of his own to cancel it out—but with Velgrynd, that shield of light was all he needed to repel everything.</p>
<p>Yes, he could use Magic Sense to keep tabs on all of his surroundings, but he was still clearly ignoring her. It all but declared to Velgrynd that he didn’t see her as a threat. That, more than anything else, triggered her rage.</p>
<p><em>I’m gonna make him regret looking down on me!</em></p>
<p>So the proud Velgrynd decided to unleash the most powerful attack in her possession.</p>
<p class="space-break1">With a hateful glance at Rimuru (who was still ignoring her), Velgrynd began conjuring up her mighty magic force, running it through her body. The support provided by Raguel, combined with acceleration symbolized by her own heat, could be worked in parallel to forcibly heat her up—in other words, boost her performance. The results allowed Velgrynd to go thousands of times faster than the speed of sound—the fastest physical speed of anything in the world.</p>
<p>So what happens when the target of this power is someone other than herself? As a spiritual life-form with resistance to physical attack, Velgrynd has no problem withstanding this newfound performance—but could anyone else ever withstand it? The answer is no. No matter what kind of life-form it is, no physical body can endure continuous forced acceleration. The same is true for spiritual ones—even passing thoughts are converted into energy, ultimately leading to thermal collapse.</p>
<p><a id="page-132"></a>That is exactly what this was designed for.</p>
<p>“Prepare to have your body rot away, not a single piece of flesh left! Cardinal Acceleration!!”</p>
<p>It was her most powerful of techniques, eclipsing even Burning Embrace.</p>
<p>Cardinal Acceleration contained the full force and authority of Velgrynd. She crafted it in secret for Velzard, in preparation for the final battle they must wage at some point in the future; she’d never normally waste it on a mere demon lord, but she was too enraged to let that stop her.</p>
<p>With a roar from the crimson dragon, a wave of doom coursed toward Rimuru. This ultimate blow symbolized the pride of the Flame Dragon at her fastest, capable of making all matter collapse in an instant. It could bury any enemy, at a speed that made it impossible for anyone to avoid. By the time Rimuru, busy focusing on Veldora, realized what was going on, it would be too late. His mind wouldn’t work fast enough to comprehend what just occurred before he ceased to exist in this world.</p>
<p><em>I wish I could make him regret underestimating me, but he won’t have the time for that now, will he? That’s the only regret I have.</em></p>
<p>With this absolute confidence, Velgrynd peered ahead to see how it worked out.</p>
<p><em>…?!</em></p>
<p>Instead she goggled at the sight of Rimuru standing there, unharmed.</p>
<p><em>No… It can’t be…</em></p>
<p>She doubted her own eyes. There was absolutely no way that anyone could withstand an impossible-to-avoid, utterly lethal blow like that without a scratch. Even the demon lord Guy Crimson himself—even her sister Velzard the Ice Dragon—could have been taken down by it, or at least Velgrynd thought so.</p>
<p>“…You’re unharmed? That’s impossible. My Cardinal Acceleration works against every type of barrier and defensive skill! If you took it <em>that</em> easily, what did you even <em>do</em>?”</p>
<p>Velgrynd was clearly losing her cool. If he had canceled out the attack somehow, that was one thing, but no barrier could ever have <a id="page-133"></a>deflected it. The reality of it all was too much to grapple with. It gravely affected her composure.</p>
<p>“Huh,” Rimuru replied. “Well, it was a close call, yeah, but given the impulsiveness of it, it was pretty easy to eat up, y’know?”</p>
<p>This was, in fact, entirely the work of Ciel, who was still dedicated to handling Velgrynd. It worked out exactly as calculated; Rimuru’s assistant was attempting to make Velgrynd attack him. Ciel put Rimuru before everything else, doing as it was ordered without getting in his way, and that was enough to shut Velgrynd down. It ran Analyze and Assess on the dragon’s nature, selected an effective response, and put it into action.</p>
<p>One example of this was the shield of light Rimuru had been using, which had a special effect on Velgrynd’s powers. Ciel, the sum of all its integrated skills, had all of Rimuru’s ultimate skills under its control. One of those ultimates was Belzebuth, Lord of Gluttony; Ciel had just used its Predation skill, gaining an immediate grasp of Velgrynd’s Cardinal Acceleration, and the Isolate skill to capture and banish the attack into Complex Space—an evolved version of Rimuru’s Stomach.</p>
<p>That attack was certainly capable of destroying Rimuru. It couldn’t be defended against with normal methods, and even Raphael’s computational power wouldn’t have been able to deal with it. But Ciel wasn’t Raphael. No longer a mere skill, it had evolved into a presence on a different dimension from the Lord of Wisdom. And no matter how the enemy may attack, as long as Ciel could determine the nature of the attack, it was not a problem—something it just proved in the way it wielded Belzebuth.</p>
<p>Once Isolate was invoked, all that remained was to Absorb the energy in Complex Space. When used like this, the Complex Space ability of Belzebuth was transformed into a defensive measure as stout as Absolute Defense from Uriel, Lord of Vows.</p>
<p>Velgrynd’s surprise was understandable. After all, everything had ended before Rimuru himself had a chance to so much as think <em>Oh, crap, I’m in trouble</em>. Still, Rimuru responded defiantly to Velgrynd’s shock—he didn’t want her to realize it was pretty much nothing he himself did.</p>
<p><a id="page-134"></a>But Ciel’s scheme didn’t end there. Able to communicate with Rimuru more smoothly than ever before, it could even use the art of conversation as a weapon to pursue Velgrynd with. But speaking of Velgrynd…</p>
<p><em>You have to be kidding me! You “consumed” it? You simply ate up Cardinal Acceleration, my greatest ability?!</em></p>
<p>She couldn’t comprehend what Rimuru meant. It was still the middle of battle, but she was too stunned to move—and even though it was for just a moment, it was a fatal error.</p>
<p>“So I’m sorry to bother you while you’re still shocked that your <em>amaaaazing</em> attack was a dud, but you didn’t forget that we’re in a fight here, right?”</p>
<p>It was already too late by the time he asked. Ciel was unerring in its actions, and Rimuru gave it his full backing.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>Calculation of Velgrynd’s magicule count complete. After accounting for the subject’s nature and characteristics, I determined it is possible to encase the target in Insulated Imprisonment for several hundred seconds. Activating!</em></span></p>
<p>Before Velgrynd realized it, a layered magic circle had surrounded her.</p>
<p>This was a compound skill, combining the ultimate skill Uriel’s Unlimited Imprisonment with Spatial Insulation. Ciel had crafted it just now, exclusively for use against Velgrynd, and now she was caught in it.</p>
<p>The combat airspace had been fully computed by Ciel—the temperature, humidity, gravity, wind currents, sunlight, the pulses of every living thing within it. It was all in the palm of Ciel’s hand, and no matter what Velgrynd did, it’d be impossible for her to leave this airspace.</p>
<p>The blinding light of this Insulated Imprisonment declared by Ciel made Velgrynd feel dizzy.</p>
<p><em>How…? How could it be so easy for him?!</em></p>
<p>The dragon’s crimson body trembled in humiliation at having <a id="page-135"></a>been beaten. But no matter what she tried, the Insulated Imprisonment never so much as wavered.</p>
<p>“Okay, sit tight in there for a while, okay? I’ll play with you after I free Veldora.”</p>
<p>The words placed a final exclamation mark on Velgrynd’s defeat.</p>
<p><em>All right. I’ll admit defeat this time. But I still have Parallel Existence. And whether this is Insulated Imprisonment or not, I can just trace a soul corridor out of here!</em></p>
<p>Velgrynd did have one more move she could make. It’d mean giving up her current body, but the majority of her remaining energy would be channeled back into the replication she positioned next to Ludora as insurance. It was brutally humiliating, but it wasn’t the end for her yet.</p>
<p>Slowly, cautiously, she got to work, making sure Rimuru didn’t take notice. Little by little, she began transferring magicules through her soul corridor…without realizing that was exactly what Ciel wanted.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Gotta hand it to Raphael. Ciel, I mean. It seemed kinda down in the dumps to me, so I gave it the name on a whim…and I guess it was happier about it than I thought it’d be.</p>
<p>After all, its previous machinelike reactions to me were much smoother and more humanlike. I feel like it had been improved by, like, a <em>lot</em>. It was in such great shape now, I wonder what happened to it just beforehand. It had gone into auto-battle mode on me several times in the past, but now it was activating skills and doing all kinds of crap—the scale of it all was totally different.</p>
<p>Even Velgrynd, who seemed so overwhelming to me, was no match for it. Its suggestion—to have her activate her finisher skill, then wait for her magicule count to dwindle right afterward—was a perfect strategy. The combination of my abilities and the way she responded to certain things was what made it work…which makes it sound easy, but I have no idea how much computing power <a id="page-136"></a>it’d take to make this possible. We were hopefully outclassed in magicule count, after all, so if we wanted to cage up this superior opponent, we needed an Insulated Imprisonment built efficiently and with only the elements I enjoyed an advantage in. Call it a “Calculated Prison” I created with my partner—that’s what it took for Ciel to score a complete victory.</p>
<p>The crux of this operation lay upon whether or not I could withstand Velgrynd’s attack. Ciel’s computation said I could, and I trusted it on that—but if she misread that, it’d be the end of me, too. Why did I trust it? Simple. I was dealing with Veldora, and I told Ciel it was in charge of Velgrynd. I knew it could do it, too—and it lived up to my expectations perfectly, even better than I had imagined. Ciel used my abilities more skillfully than I ever could to fulfill the job.</p>
<p>That’s my partner for you. Now I was more impressed with Ciel than ever.</p>
<p class="space-break1">So thanks to an unexpected boon, Ciel was now more dependable than ever for me. But I couldn’t forget my objective. Before Velgrynd made another move, I needed to free Veldora’s mind. So how many seconds can we hold her back, exactly?</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>Even if Velgrynd went on a violent rampage, the Insulated Imprisonment will hold for a total of two hundred more seconds. I don’t think we need to worry about that, however.</em></span></p>
<p>Um, why not?</p>
<p>Even three minutes and change were something to be grateful for, but Velgrynd’s still a major threat. I can’t just ignore it that whole time…</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>No, as predicted, Velgrynd is currently trying to escape. I knew she could use a soul corridor to transfer energy away from her, so I considered the possibility that she’d flee without worrying too much about this replication before us.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-137"></a>I…see? Or I think I do. If any replication could be made into her “real” body, there was no major need to force her way out of this Insulated Imprisonment? Or maybe there was…and that was why Ciel created a loophole for Velgrynd to try and exploit. That’s right—Velgrynd showed her hand too much, bandying around Parallel Existence and not hesitating to use it against the three demonesses and Veldora. I had been monitoring all of that, so there was no shortage of material for Ciel to analyze.</p>
<p>Velgrynd’s Parallel Existence couldn’t produce an inexhaustible supply of clones. Ciel must have measured her magicule count to the point that it knew the maximum amount she could hold—and once we knew that, we’d understand how many more replications we needed to churn through before she was defeated. Ciel, meanwhile, worked backward from there. It saw that Velgrynd probably had an insurance policy on hand, and so it baited her into escaping into it. I’d probably do the same thing if I had a power that useful, but my Replications didn’t have access to ultimate skills. A little annoying, but I was willing to admit defeat there.</p>
<p>In the end, the seemingly omnipotent Parallel Existence could only <em>really</em> be used either as a decoy or against a weaker opponent. I mean, it’s still extremely useful insurance and a nice asset to have depending on the opponent—I can think of a few fun ways to use it. But it just didn’t seem effective against someone of equal or higher rank. But Ciel was the one who exposed that weakness for all the world to see. Like, I’m actually kinda scared of its computing ability. Everything was going exactly as Ciel wanted, like it was predicting the future.</p>
<p>The progress it’s made is kind of exasperating, but either way, Ciel’s my partner. Best to stop worrying about extraneous stuff and get on with the objective at hand. Ciel had conquered Velgrynd, strongest of the True Dragons, and I sure wasn’t gonna fall behind.</p>
<p><em>“All right. But just in case, I’m gonna put all my power up against Veldora right now so I can be assured to wrap up in under two hundred seconds. Give me a hand, Ciel!”</em></p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em><a id="page-138"></a>As you wish!</em></span></p>
<p>I—or Ciel and I, I guess—squared up against Veldora, our primary mission. Ciel had earned me some precious time—not a lot, maybe, but for us, it may as well have been infinite. I’d never live it down if we didn’t make the most of it. Could we do it? That wasn’t the question—we <em>were</em> doing it.</p>
<p>That was the determination in my mind as I resumed my attack on Veldora.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">Release Veldora, then defeat Ludora. Those were my objectives—and it’s what I wanted to do, not just because Guy asked me to.</p>
<p>Ciel’s birth had surprised me so much that, without anticipating it, I was back to my normal state of mind. My serenity had long since returned to me…but that didn’t mean my anger was gone. That anger, I decided, I’d save until I could take it out on Emperor Ludora. But first things first.</p>
<p>So how would I approach Veldora? Well, to start out, I was trying to talk to him. Talking about “ruling over” Veldora was easy enough, but we were dealing with a True Dragon with gigantic amounts of energy—it must take an incredible effort. Taking over the will of a spiritual life-form is one of the most difficult tasks I can think of, in fact.</p>
<p>As I saw it, there were several types of subjugation like this. One was charm-based—you made the subject follow your will, heart and soul. Another was coercion-based, taking away their free will and forcing them to obey. A third was total domination, where the target wasn’t even aware they were being subjugated. The list went on and on.</p>
<p>Yuuki carried out total domination on his subjects, but in Kagali’s case, it was more coercion-based—and that was what Veldora was dealing with, too.</p>
<p>This coercion could work on several levels as well. The target <a id="page-139"></a>might retain their free will but still be reluctantly forced to follow orders, or they may have their free will removed entirely, turning them into an unquestioning robot. It didn’t seem to me like Kagali had any free will left right now, but what about Veldora? Spiritual life-forms all had incredibly strong wills, something that I didn’t think could be erased so easily, so I decided it’d be worthwhile to try calling out to him.</p>
<p>But Veldora’s resistance was just too fierce.</p>
<p>I assumed his orders were to eliminate the enemy (i.e., me), but he was just vicious, throwing all restraint out the window. Even with Ciel handling Velgrynd for me, Veldora alone was nonetheless proving a tough match. I still had my assorted storm-type skills on hand, so it was possible to cancel out his moves—but with the off-the-charts power he boasted, just doing that kept my hands full. We weren’t really in a conversational mood, in other words.</p>
<p>That was where we were at when I decided to let Ciel defend for me. The Control Probability thing was tricky, but I trusted that Ciel had a handle on it. <em>Now the real work begins</em>, I thought as I tried getting closer to Veldora. Gales of wind were flying around me, but my location was as calm as the eye of a hurricane. It was, like, really relieving. Everything from Veldora was being offset, and Ciel wasn’t even as frantic as I was a moment ago. It barely even touched my magicules—and best of all, I was in incredibly good shape.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>Of course. The demons serving you have been sending you Food Chain–based support through their soul corridors.</em></span></p>
<p>Oh, was <em>that</em> it? It <em>felt</em> like I was getting stronger—but thanks to my other allies, I was holding my own against Veldora.</p>
<p>Once I was aware of that, there was no way I could fail. After finally reaching a spot right in front of Veldora, I took the opportunity to call out to him.</p>
<p>“Sorry to keep you, Veldora. Do you recognize me?”</p>
<p>No reply. Well, he <em>did</em> let out a Thunderstorm Roar, but other than that, nothing.</p>
<p>I lashed out at him with my first, unconsciously irritated. But, as <a id="page-140"></a>anyone could have expected, it didn’t stop him. The attack would have needed an element of magic force, not just physical, or else it’d never damage him much. But that was okay by me. My goal was to wake Veldora up, not kill him—for now, I’d just give him a good beating instead.</p>
<p>So I continued to hit Veldora in the face as hard as I could. I was actually too close-range for much of his attack repertory to work; a lot of spells and skills would wind up hitting him as well. Being controlled like this, he might keep whipping them out anyway without a care, but I figured Ciel would take care of that.</p>
<p>A punch. Another punch. Then a kick. But Veldora only roared in response.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>What do you think about using Predation on Veldora and locking him in your Complex Space?</em></span></p>
<p>A rather frightening suggestion from Ciel, I thought. If that was a yes/no question, I was kinda leaning toward yes…but was something like that possible?</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>Not a problem. Belzebuth is under my command, so if I receive the order, I can immediately put it into action.</em></span></p>
<p>It’s certainly…<em>dependable</em>, I guess. It was funny to think that Belzebuth, Lord of Gluttony—this all-powerful ultimate skill—got its start way back with Predation, a species-specific slime skill. Thanks to that, it couldn’t have been better geared toward me; handling it was always such a breeze. And now that Ciel had further optimized it, I figured it’d work on Veldora as well.</p>
<p>Now that I was a demon-lord slime—a demon slime, if you will—Belzebuth could be invoked from any part of my body. In fact, I didn’t even need to make physical contact with my target any longer. It took on more power the closer I was to the other party, though, so now that I was in point-blank range of Veldora, I expected serious performance.</p>
<p>Anyway, my mind was made up.</p>
<p><a id="page-141"></a>“Thanks for causing me all this damn trouble, Veldora! Quit making me worry about you all the time!”</p>
<p>As soon as I shouted it, I immediately tried devouring Veldora via Belzebuth. But then:</p>
<p>(Kwah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Just a little mistake on my part. Forgive me!)</p>
<p>I heard a voice in my head I really shouldn’t have been hearing.</p>
<p>(Veldora, right?)</p>
<p>(Indeed, it is I. Veldora the Storm Dragon, your erstwhile ally!)</p>
<p>It couldn’t have been a trap. He was acting like too much of a fool for it to be. That carefree voice, not a thought in his mind—it couldn’t have been anyone else.</p>
<p>(Hey, so you’re conscious?)</p>
<p>(Yes. Actually, I detached my core as quickly as I could. I cannot physically speak, but I still have my wits about me!)</p>
<p>Aha. So he’s there, all right.</p>
<p>If Belzebuth was working its way through his body, did that make telepathic communication through his “heart” possible? Either way, I was glad he was safe—but now I was angry for other reasons.</p>
<p>(So what’re you waiting for, then? Regain control of your body!)</p>
<p>All that worry, and he was treating this like a day at the beach. Did he have any idea how much I was freaking out? I felt justified in complaining a bit about it.</p>
<p>(I would have done that long ago if I could! But listen to me, Rimuru. Don’t you think you should calm down a bit and be a bit more careful?)</p>
<p>Like I needed him telling me. Besides:</p>
<p>(Shut up! If I was gonna be calm about this, I wouldn’t have done something as crazy as take on two True Dragons at once!)</p>
<p>I didn’t need anyone to point that out to me. Now that I was calmer, I was actually kind of impressed that I survived. But I couldn’t have been too cautious back there. Nothing about dealing with True Dragons was “careful” in the first place. But as I was thinking about this, Veldora was still cheerfully giving me advice.</p>
<p>(Oh! Watch out for this—I’m about to break out some Dark Lightning!)</p>
<p>(Stop providing color commentary like a sports broadcast!)</p>
<p><a id="page-142"></a>Even worse, he didn’t launch Dark Lightning at all; it was Death-Calling Wind instead. Ciel canceled it out for me and I’m pretty sure I could’ve dodged it anyway, but why the hell was he giving me fake advice?!</p>
<p>(You call that lightning?! That was Death-Calling Wind! It was about to kill me!)</p>
<p>My complaints were met with a half-chuckled excuse.</p>
<p>(Hmm?! Oh, sorry! Kwah-ha-ha-ha! It seems I’ve yet to gain a full grasp of my body. I can sense myself activating a skill well enough, but I can only identify it right about half the time.)</p>
<p>So he wasn’t being helpful, then. My enemy had Control Probability, too, which meant it was likely safer to just ignore Veldora’s predictions.</p>
<p>(All right. You don’t need to do that, so can you just shut up for me? It wouldn’t be very funny if I trusted random nonsense from you at this critical moment and it killed me, would it? I’m really disappointed in you!)</p>
<p>This made Veldora start panicking a bit.</p>
<p>(Wait, Rimuru, wait! I’m doing my best here. Let me help you a little!)</p>
<p>He was desperately arguing his case, but there wasn’t much to back up his claims. I had to put reason first here, not emotion. Besides, I already had his cooperation. Just hearing Veldora’s voice did a lot to ease my concerns.</p>
<p>(Well, I’m just happy you’re all right.)</p>
<p>Veldora responded with his usual energetic laugh.</p>
<p>(Kwah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Of course I am! I’m the strongest of all dragons!)</p>
<p>Right. That was a relief. But then:</p>
<p>(Besides, it wasn’t Ludora who cut off our soul corridor, but I myself. I have never truly lost in battle at all!)</p>
<p>Huh? What’s this dude talking about…?</p>
<p>(What do you mean?)</p>
<p>(Oh, it’s simple. When I was busy focusing on that man Kondo’s attack, Ludora tried to assert control over me. I was furious about this—the three of them tackling me at once, my sister included? <a id="page-143"></a>How truly unfair! But I wanted to avoid the worst-case scenario, so I reluctantly made the decision to cut the corridor away.)</p>
<p>Sounds to me, Mr. Strong Dragon, that you were being a little careless there, weren’t you? There’s no such thing as “fair” or “unfair” on the battlefield…</p>
<p>(Stop acting like that was so noble of you! What the hell were you even doing? I’ve been constantly telling you never to let your guard down!)</p>
<p>(Kwah-ha-ha-ha-ha! I never thought you’d be lecturing me under these circumstances!)</p>
<p>Veldora seemed to be enjoying this to no end. It was appalling. Appalling and pointless to tolerate any further, so I moved on.</p>
<p>(So the decision you made was to shut down our soul corridor?)</p>
<p>(Indeed. I reasoned that Ludora’s domination would have affected not only me, but you as well through the corridor.)</p>
<p>So he hurriedly turned it off to protect me? Well, if <em>that’s</em> the story he gave me, I really couldn’t be mad at him any longer.</p>
<p>(All right. Great! Well, in that case, sit tight while I take care of this!)</p>
<p>(Very well! I have not a worry in the world!)</p>
<p>Nice to be relied on like that.</p>
<p>(Right. I’ll have you free in a moment, so hold out a bit.)</p>
<p>(Kwah-ha-ha-ha-ha! How wonderful to hear. I will trust in that, my friend!)</p>
<p>So I knew what happened to Veldora. He had lost control over his own body, but his core was still intact. He didn’t have the power to regain control at the moment, though, so I’d have to sort that out for him. I didn’t expect problems—if his core was all right, I could figure the rest out.</p>
<p>Here was one idea:</p>
<p><em>“Ciel, if we have Veldora’s core in hand, would we be able to revive his ultimate ability Veldora, Lord of the Storm?”</em></p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>Not a problem. All information related to the skill has been retained, so once a soul corridor is reconnected to Veldora’s core, the ultimate ability can be restored.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-144"></a>Well, that was easy. In short, all I had to do was consume Veldora in front of me and retrieve his core. Now I just had to make my move—piece of cake.</p>
<p>Okay, time to defeat this foe—Veldora the Storm Dragon, the strongest in the land! And so on!</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">We now had a clear path toward solving this problem, so I decided to get this over with fast.</p>
<p>There were two problems still in play—my time limit, and the location of his core. In terms of time, I still had a lot of that. We had been using Hasten Thought to minimize the time spent on that last conversation, so only a few seconds of real time had passed. Even with the attacking and defending that took place in between, I still had over three minutes to work with.</p>
<p>The problem was the core’s location. It was inside his body, close enough that I could communicate with it via Telepathy, but pinpointing its exact coordinates was actually pretty tricky. Should I accidentally destroy it in the process, all would be lost—this mission would be a failure, and Veldora would go through the reincarnation process. Normally, you’d never have to worry about this—the core of the creature is the most heavily protected part of it. But in Veldora’s case, his core was detached from his main body, leaving it fairly defenseless. A careless strike in the wrong place could wind up landing a direct hit, which would be beyond unfortunate. It’d free him from Ludora’s control, I’m sure, but it’d also wipe out Veldora’s current personality, and it wouldn’t restore our soul corridor, either. That had to be avoided at all costs.</p>
<p>If I could devour Veldora all at once, I wouldn’t need to worry about any of this. Sadly, though, swallowing him whole wasn’t possible, even with my Complex Space—not without his consent. I could try weakening him and cutting down his magicule count a bit, or I could try some more Predation on him, being careful not to damage the core along the way… Hmm…</p>
<p><a id="page-145"></a>Now that I thought about it more, actively damaging Veldora’s body seemed like a non-starter. Maybe clocking him on the head a few times, like I did before, was kind of scarily dangerous. I came in thinking it’d be hard to damage him, much less defeat him, and now he seemed like this fragile figurine to me.</p>
<p>Of course, a bolt or two of magic wouldn’t even scratch him, and a random punch or kick would achieve little as well. Only when you add the effects of an ultimate skill to these attacks does the damage become more substantial. Even Disintegration, the most powerful of holy magic, could only do a little bit of damage against Veldora’s gigantic frame. The durability of these True Dragons was no joke—it’s what made them True Dragons.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I think <em>some</em> attacking is safe enough, but you never know what’ll happen if you hit someone in the wrong place. That was doubly true now that Veldora didn’t have control over his own body. There was just no telling what he would do.</p>
<p>Thus, until I knew the location of Veldora’s core, it was safest not to launch any attacks. That meant I had just one way forward. I needed to put my nose to the grindstone, use Predation to eat away at him bit by bit, and hope I find the core along the way. It’d be a race against time, but I had no other option.</p>
<p>Just three minutes…but then again, three minutes could be all the time in the world for me. Filing the time issue in the back of my mind, I turned Belzebuth up to full power and began eating my way into Veldora.</p>
<p class="space-break1">My body reverted from human to slime form—not my usual bouncy liquid form, but a kind of viscous, irregularly shaped blob. This was Ciel optimizing my shape in accordance with the hostile Predation I was engaged in. The more contact surface I had with my target, the more efficient the process was.</p>
<p>So my constantly shifting body ate into the surface of Veldora’s body, spreading itself around him. But the target was just too big. No matter how far I stretched myself out, I was really just a dot from Veldora’s point of view. It was a daunting task, but I couldn’t give up now.</p>
<p><a id="page-146"></a>Throwing all caution to the wind, I accelerated my hostile consumption, activating Soul Consume as I searched for his core. This, too, would’ve been impossible without Ciel’s assistance. Looking at that incredible strength it exhibited earlier, I was starting to think it had computational power on a scale far beyond what Raphael had. Guess not only monsters evolve when you name them.</p>
<p>Thanks to Ciel, things were overall going pretty smoothly right now, but we weren’t entirely free of obstacles. To be exact, I was in intense pain. Veldora’s body had detected what I was up to, and it was resisting me at all costs. The Storm Dragon’s aura was causing my body to disintegrate. I was trying to consume it while it was trying to quash me—and the battle was only just beginning.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">

<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="image" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Pain, heat, and suffering. I wasn’t supposed to be able to feel pain, but it was now coursing across my entire body. Heat shouldn’t have meant anything to me, but I felt like someone was dunking me in unbearably hot water. And then the agonizing suffering—something I had never felt before in this world.</p>
<p>The dangerous sensation of having my existence wiped out shortly triggered all of my survival instincts. But I wasn’t going to relent. I was going to win. I would overcome this agony and save Veldora. And I wasn’t alone now. In Ciel, I had a more reliable partner than ever before. That’s why I was so determined to devour the Storm Dragon and absorb Veldora’s core. If I could achieve that, this much pain was never gonna stop me.</p>
<p><em>“Everything all right, Ciel?”</em></p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>Leave it to me.</em></span></p>
<p>We’re good, then.</p>
<p>With Ciel’s trustworthy reply in hand, I expanded my Predation.</p>
<p>One thing standing in my way was all the energy I was feeding on. Normally it’d be converted into power for me, but against <a id="page-147"></a>a True Dragon, it didn’t work that way. Instead of becoming my power, it was destroying my body from the inside. I suppose dragons are so powerful down to the individual cell level that nothing can ever bind them down. Somehow <em>this</em> dragon got taken over by the enemy anyway, but no point whining about that now.</p>
<p>Whenever part of my body is lost, Infinite Regeneration kicks in to rebuild and replace it. That was one way I could forcibly take in the energy I was consuming. It’d be a lot easier if I could just throw it away, but that wasn’t gonna happen. I had to Analyze and Assess all this energy first, or else I might wind up damaging Veldora’s core. It was a really tedious process, but it was still the best way—such was my decision after conferring with Ciel. Now it was up to me to keep going with it.</p>
<p>I put my mind on cruise control as I kept up my work. The clock was still ticking, but I was dealing with a huge target. I began worrying that we might not make it—but I still had faith in Ciel. We were guaranteed to make it in time.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>I had some free time, so I performed some analysis work. Would you like to hear about it?</em></span></p>
<p>……</p>
<p>What do you <em>mean</em>, you had some free time? I’m kind of in horrifying pain right now. What’re you even up to?</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>I was performing an Analyze and Assess process on Velgrynd’s powers, examining her Cardinal Acceleration while she was isolated in Complex Space.</em></span></p>
<p>No, that was a rhetorical question… Wait. You figured it out?!</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>I failed to reproduce the power, but it is possible to develop a very similar technique.</em></span></p>
<p>You’re crazy, Ciel.</p>
<p>Maybe I should just assume that it’s reading my surface <a id="page-148"></a>consciousness at all times. Better be more aware of my mental barriers, I guess. I’ll have to think matters through on a deeper level than before.</p>
<p>Still, though, getting to imitate Velgrynd’s most powerful move (as Ciel breathlessly claimed) would be pretty cool. That, despite the fact you can’t copy ultimate skills just by observing them…</p>
<p>…Wait a minute. What else was it analyzing? I decided to ask it directly, despite my trepidation.</p>
<p><em>“What else have you been analyzing?”</em></p>
<p>Ciel eagerly spoke up, as if it’d been waiting for the question.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>Right! I have also finished analyzing Storm Blast. By taking advantage of the remainders from the skill Veldora, Lord of the Storm, this skill is now available for use.</em></span></p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait! This is major news! I practically don’t even feel the pain any longer!</p>
<p>That sounded like such an incredibly difficult analysis to make. I was unsure if I could believe it at first. It acted like this was just some side project…</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>No, it is true. And that is not even the important part. Here’s the main thing!</em></span></p>
<p>I couldn’t help but have that reaction in my surface consciousness. But whatever. No point hiding stuff from it anyway.</p>
<p>It was convincing enough, though. I still had the ultimate skill Veldora, Lord of the Storm, in me. Taking advantage of that, I could see how I could reproduce Storm Blast well enough. That’s a pretty damn powerful skill, so it’d be nice if I could grab it for myself. I was happy for that—and despite my initial surprise, I suppose performing that kind of work wasn’t too unusual by Ciel’s standards.</p>
<p>At this point, I was more curious about what Ciel thought the “main thing” was.</p>
<p><em>“So what is that?”</em></p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em><a id="page-149"></a>I have completed analysis of the Storm Dragon you have been Predating. This will make it possible to transform your body composition into the same type as a True Dragon. Would you like to carry this out?</em></span></p>
<p>Pardon?</p>
<p>That’s a pretty casual way of saying something very disturbing, isn’t it? Transforming my bodily composition into the same type as Veldora? And you’re asking if I want to “carry this out” like it’s a quick little errand?!</p>
<p>Now I’m a little confused. If I’m understanding this correctly, does this mean I would <em>become</em> a True Dragon…?</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>That is the correct way to see it, yes.</em></span></p>
<p>Whaaat?! It’s the <em>correct</em> way?!</p>
<p>…Like, are you serious?</p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Of course! So, would you like to evolve into a True Dragon?</em></span></p>
<p class="answer-first1"><span class="special"><em>Yes</em></span></p>
<p class="answer-first1"><span class="special"><em>No</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1">Heh-heh-heh…heh-ha-ha… <em>Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!</em></p>
<p>I unconsciously executed a three-part progression of evil laughter. <em>Still giving me yes/no ultimatums, huh?</em> I thoughtlessly noted as I gave the command:</p>
<p class="space-break1">YES!</p>
<p class="space-break1">Instantly, the pain I felt vanished. No pain, no burning, no agony. The Storm Dragon’s aura no longer penetrated me—because I had a draconic aura of my own.</p>
<p>Now, the more energy consumed, the more I stored for myself. My magicule count shot ever higher. I was afraid it’d expand to the point where it’d go out of control and explode on me.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em><a id="page-150"></a>Not a problem. I will provide perfect energy management.</em></span></p>
<p>Yeah, I’m sure you will.</p>
<p>With Ciel, there was no need to worry.</p>
<p>Now my True Dragon self had an identical number of magicules as Veldora. Then I broke through the limit. With this, a new True Dragon was born—and the moment I started being distracted from my current situation, I realized that any further delay in dealing with the Storm Dragon would be fatal.</p>
<p>(You have won, Rimuru! I am rather surprised to see you become a True Dragon, but it seems my eyes never deceived me after all. Kwaaaah-ha-ha-ha!!)</p>
<p>Veldora, on the other hand, didn’t seem too surprised as he rejoiced for me. He was acting like he’d raised me from a baby or something, but it goes without saying that his contribution to this was next to nothing.</p>
<p>Besides, it was too early to be declaring victory. Veldora’s core was the key to all of this, and I still didn’t know where it was. Time to put the icing on this cake, then.</p>
<p>“Right, let’s get this over with!”</p>
<p>How dare some puppet like this call itself the Storm Dragon. How dare they!</p>
<p>“Consume it all, Belzebuth!!”</p>
<p>At my order, Belzebuth devoured the Storm Dragon’s body—with glee, I might add, not to mention tremendous speed. Now things were incredibly one-sided in this conflict—the one who eats, and the one who’s eaten. The very embodiment of “survival of the fittest”…</p>
<p class="space-break1">The curtain quietly fell on the epic battle. During it, we witnessed an evolution, a new birth, and a bold step into the future.</p>
<p>The remnants of the energy that leaked away from me filled the area with a blinding light—the light of blessing, a light celebrating the birth of a new Truth. This was the light that my old body—the <a id="page-151"></a>one that hadn’t transformed into a True Dragon—emitted as it was converted into pure energy, and even it would be consumed by me as it faded from the world.</p>
<p>With that, my goal was achieved in truly perfect form.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">

<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="image" class="ornament1" src="../Images/Art_sborn1.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">When the light subsided, there was only one life-form left—an indeterminate one. Veldora was gone. And now, as Velgrynd realized, the slime—the demon lord Rimuru—had consumed it.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>According to what they knew, Rimuru was born from a pool of magicules that had leaked out of the sealed Veldora. But now that slime had consumed the Storm Dragon—its father, in a way—and become the fifth True Dragon of the world.</p>
<p>This slime, the Ultimate Slime, took on the form of a human being after a few moments, a blade in one hand and wearing no clothing. He was between the age of fifteen and sixteen, maybe about five foot three inches—small, it was fair to say. But the amount of magicules contained within him was not only comparable to Veldora’s; it far outclassed him.</p>
<p>Those golden eyes, a beautiful almond shape, looked capable of seeing through everything; that hair, silver with a blue tinge, shone white like the moon. He was androgynous, and his face was more touchingly sweet than ravishing, but his divine presence made him transcend beauty itself.</p>
<p>Now that pale skin was enveloped in an evil aura of black and gold. He whispered something—an expression of frustration—and the demonic energy covering his body transformed into a divine full-body outfit, jet black in color. This was crafted through the skill Create Material, a specialty from the demon race, and even though it only used the magicules leaking out from his body, it was impossible to gauge just how strong it would be as armor.</p>
<p><a id="page-152"></a>Like flipping a switch, Rimuru suppressed the flow of excess energy. Then he grinned out of one corner of his mouth, satisfied at what he saw.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Velgrynd was watching from her prison cell, interrupting her energy transfer in the process. She was stunned, unable to believe what was happening before her eyes.</p>
<p>The battle between Veldora, her own brother, and the demon lord Rimuru should have been overwhelmingly in the Storm Dragon’s favor. It was absolutely impossible for the slime to surpass him in any way. Otherwise, it simply meant that they were “equals” from the beginning…</p>
<p><em>Is it a coincidence, then? No… Are you saying he just happened to be born right here, right now?!</em></p>
<p>It was an astonishing conclusion, reached by Velgrynd as she foundered in a sea of thoughts. But she wouldn’t easily admit to it. How could she? A monster who just happened to be born near a True Dragon, who just happened to have the right soul to accept draconic energy—the chances were just too small to comprehend.</p>
<p>If Rimuru truly was the fifth True Dragon to be born, that would make him Velgrynd’s younger brother—but it happened because he fed off Veldora, and Velgrynd couldn’t abide calling something like that a True Dragon. He was something akin to one, at best, and she refused to admit anything so horrifying could exist.</p>
<p>Her instincts told her to crush it here and now. It would be the only way to avenge her brother’s death.</p>
<p>Veldora was her darling little brother—bratty, rambunctious, more than a handful to deal with, but still so boundlessly free. She envied him. Yes, she wanted to use him as a pawn, but it’d only be for a blip in time compared to the length of their lifespans. She certainly had no intention of rubbing him out of existence; once she was done with him, she was going to give him his freedom back.</p>
<p>And now—</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p><a id="page-153"></a>…</p>
<p>The moment Velgrynd realized that Veldora was consumed before her eyes, her anger blew away all sense of reason.</p>
<p>“My sweet little brother… How <em>dare</em> you…!!”</p>
<p>She let out a raging roar. It was well past two hundred seconds, and that roar was enough to shatter the Insulated Imprisonment. The Flame Dragon was enraged, with no regard for her own self-preservation—and now she would unleash all her hostility upon Rimuru.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">Well, after eating up Veldora, it looks like I’ve been reborn into a new species. An Ultimate Slime, apparently, but it now made me part of the True Dragons—maybe a quasi-member, but still.</p>
<p>I’m really not sure there was anything slime-like about me any longer, but I’ll keep that my little secret. Too late to worry about that anyway.</p>
<p class="space-break1">So I checked out my new body.</p>
<p>My “main” one—the default form that I existed in without consuming magicules—had grown considerably larger. Or <em>matured</em>, maybe? I was now about as tall as a high school student—a female one, but still. I could adjust my externals to look any age I wanted, so it didn’t really mean too much; I just thought it’d be pretty neat to show myself “growing” like this.</p>
<p>The question was whether I could still move around and take action in this body comfortably. My slime form had grown, too, to a diameter of two or two-and-a-half feet. That made me a little too big for a regular person to carry around, so hopefully I could retain my original, smaller package.</p>
<p>Anyway, I could work out the kinks later. For now, I had a problem. I was currently wearing nothing. Totally naked. That wasn’t gonna fly. This weird aura was flowing out of me, hiding my naughty bits…but either way—very problematic.</p>
<p><a id="page-154"></a>So I tried crafting some clothes. Tapping Create Material (a little something Diablo had taught me), I discovered that the process was actually easy-peasy. Depending on the creator’s ability, Diablo said, you could produce some really nice results with it—and I liked what I saw. Comfortable, for sure, and I think straight-up black looks good on me.</p>
<p>As for its armor level… Well, it turned out to be God-class. Whoa, really? God-class? Boy, God-class, huh? Neat…</p>
<p>Wait, <em>what</em>?!</p>
<p>This must be exactly what being “flabbergasted” feels like. I <em>thought</em> I had evolved a little, but I guess this proved it, huh? Perhaps my current power was even more tremendous than I had even imagined.</p>
<p>And I suppose I could’ve seen it coming. Benimaru and the gang had evolved into awakened demon lords, but thanks to Food Chain, all that power was getting channeled back to me. That was likely one reason, and to that you could add all the power from Veldora I’d just consumed a moment ago. It was too much energy to store in my Stomach as it previously existed, but now I had fully analyzed it and made it my own.</p>
<p>So all of this had come together to create what I had now. Basically, it’s entirely Ciel’s work. Now I feel like calling Ciel simply by its name is rude. Time to pay it some well-earned respect and call it Dr. Ciel!</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>Please don’t call me that.</em></span></p>
<p>I thought I heard someone talking, but I didn’t care. The good doctor is <em>so</em> wonderful, isn’t it? And I’ll be expecting big things from it going forward, too!</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>Leave it to me!</em></span></p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So now that I had some clothes on, I needed to make sure not to forget the task at hand.</p>
<p><a id="page-155"></a>(Veldora, are you okay?)</p>
<p>(Kwah-ha-ha-ha! Quit making me repeat it again and again! But I am quite amazed to see you defeat my body without any hassle!)</p>
<p>(Yeah, well, I was kinda too much “in the zone” to think about exactly what I did. But I’m so glad this worked out!)</p>
<p>Veldora and I were both safe, and it made both of us quite happy. And if we were chatting like this, I assumed Veldora’s core was unscathed as well. All that remained was to reconnect our soul corridor and regenerate the ultimate skill Veldora, Lord of the Storm.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>Succeeded. No problems found.</em></span></p>
<p>Dr. Ciel comes through again. Always doing the job without me having to micromanage it. Another perfect piece of work.</p>
<p>Okay. So that was one objective achieved. And now that I had Veldora back, I really didn’t have any business left with the imperial army. But you know what? My anger was just as intense as before—and I wanted to slam it into Emperor Ludora’s face. Besides, if I ended the war on this rather indecisive note, it’d doubtlessly lead to future disasters. We’d come this far, so I really wanted to be thorough if I could. As a king, it was my job to eliminate any threats to my realm.</p>
<p>Now that I’d regained my sense of reason, I was beginning to think it’d be all right if I left everyone but Ludora alone. But it’s important not to let up. I had a job to do, and I had to see it to its end. Maybe <em>I</em> didn’t mind ending it here, but the enemy might have had ideas of their own.</p>
<p>And as if to prove that point, Velgrynd was still alive and well before me, staring at me and brooding inside her prison cell.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I had freed Veldora safely, but for some reason, Velgrynd looked infuriated. Defeating her wouldn’t achieve very much for me, so I really didn’t want to go through the trouble of engaging her…but if she was a threat, I had to eliminate it.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em><a id="page-156"></a>Velgrynd is no longer a threat. Not all of her skills have been analyzed yet, but a full set of countermeasures is in place.</em></span></p>
<p>Dr. Ciel sure has a lot of confidence. Or maybe arrogance?</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>No, it is the solemn truth.</em></span></p>
<p>It’d be a travesty if I lost after being told that, but no, maybe I didn’t have much to worry about. Even in the last battle, I was fully defending myself against Velgrynd’s attacks. With Ciel in tow, I could probably shut her down without even struggling very much.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much point, I thought, in straying from the original plan. I had the opportunity to thoroughly smash the Empire, and I wanted to take it, ending things right here without any bloodshed. Even now, the Black Corps were out in full force; I could see several large hotspots dotted across the battlefield, and nobody else on the enemy’s side was worth my attention at the moment. I was going to tangle with Ludora sooner or later, so it didn’t seem tactically mistaken to damage Velgrynd here while I could.</p>
<p>The Empire still had Lieutenant Kondo and Damrada on their side, and the emperor’s four personal bodyguards looked like big trouble as well. Ludora was dominating Yuuki’s mind, too, and I’d have to dispatch him along with all the other enemies. That, and there should be one more Single Digit to deal with, if my math’s correct—dunno who they might be, but if they’re at least Sage-level, better keep a sharp eye out. So even discounting Ludora and Velgrynd for the time being, I had eight powerful foes left.</p>
<p>Scanning the battlefield, I spotted several other foes I could classify as “threats,” presences I decided we needed to wipe out right now. I call them “threats,” but as strong as they were, they really didn’t pose much of a threat to me. Having evolved into a True Dragon, my magicule count has ballooned to almost ten times what it used to be. That earned me major boosts in both the quality and quantity of power I could wield; I really felt like I was far stronger than I was before. I hadn’t taken Veldora out, so my fuel tank was <a id="page-157"></a>topped up. I was firing on all cylinders, essentially, and I even felt like I could give Milim or Guy a run for their money.</p>
<p>…Whoa, hold on. Can’t let myself get an ego. Psych yourself up like that, and you’re bound to screw things up. Let’s keep our guards up and proceed as carefully as possible.</p>
<p>Also, while I was scanning the field just now, I noticed that those “threats” I detected were already engaged in battle with Benimaru and the others. I did give them their orders, yet the speed with which they executed them amazed me. But were they sticking to that other command—the one about not getting themselves killed? I just hope they don’t try anything reckless in the name of “lightening my load” or whatever…but let’s worry about that later. Velgrynd was before my eyes, and she looked ready to fly at me right this minute; I can think about whether to back up my boys down below once I do something about her.</p>
<p>In less than a second, I made up my mind. The next problem was how I would fight her. Maybe kick off with Release Storm Dragon, part of the ultimate skill Veldora, Lord of the Storm? That would let me call for Veldora, and then we’d go two-against-one on Velgrynd and victory would be all but assured.</p>
<p>Looking back, I’ve now realized that my magicule count was rarely, if ever, filled up to maximum in the past. I had a sneaking suspicion this was because I had Veldora in a “released,” free state this whole time. Veldora and I are kind of one and the same by this point, with both of us capable of resurrecting the other if needed. It didn’t exactly work like Velgrynd’s Parallel Existences, but it was still an invincibility code that verged on being unfair. Having to lend him my magicules seemed a small price to pay for that—and Veldora’s overflow magic streamed straight over to me anyway, so it’s not like this was any inconvenience. If anything, this sort of power circulation had an energizing effect on me.</p>
<p>Thus, while Release Storm Dragon came with some disadvantages, the advantages made it all worth it. So I promptly invoked it.</p>
<p>“My sweet little brother… How <em>dare</em> you…!!”</p>
<p>Now Velgrynd was yelling at me. More like how dare <em>she</em>, am I right?</p>
<p><a id="page-158"></a>“Hey! <em>You’re</em> the one who struck first! Besides, you tried to get me and Veldora to fight each other! What’s up with that?!”</p>
<p>“Silence! The mere idea of Veldora being consumed by the likes of you makes me sick! I always knew he was inferior to me, but I cannot <em>believe</em> he would fall victim to a mere demon lord… I refuse to accept his annihilation—and I refuse to ever forgive you for it!”</p>
<p>Then the furious Velgrynd shot out an absurd number of heat rays at me. They didn’t work on me, sadly, but at least I learned a thing or two from our conversation. She was that angry because I had eaten Veldora—she thought I must’ve killed him, completely eradicating him from existence. I knew an easy way to deal with that—invoke Release Storm Dragon, and everything would be cleared up.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<p>(Gaaaaahh! W-wait! Wait, Rimuru!)</p>
<p>Veldora himself stopped me.</p>
<p>(What?) I asked, worried.</p>
<p>(Rimuru, listen to me. My sister is enraged because she thinks I no longer exist—is that right?)</p>
<p>(Sounds like it. So if you can come out and we can explain matters, maybe we can avoid unnecessary combat, you know?)</p>
<p>(You damned fool! Stop being so reckless! If I reveal myself to be perfectly safe right this minute, it would be beyond awkward for me. She’ll turn her rage from you to me instead!)</p>
<p>What a stupid answer. I felt like a “damned fool” for listening to him.</p>
<p>(Ahhh, I thought I was going to have a heart attack…)</p>
<p>It was clear that I couldn’t rely on him for anything right now. He’s <em>so</em> useless right at the most critical of moments. I wanted to chew him out, but then Ciel interrupted me.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>One moment, please. I would like to take this opportunity, perhaps, to optimize Veldora’s powers. I have already received permission from him, so please hold off invoking Release Storm Dragon until the skill reformation process is complete.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-159"></a>Its tone was as fetching and courteous as ever.</p>
<p>According to Ciel, Veldora’s ultimate skill Faust, Lord of Investigation, would be revised and evolved into the new ultimate skill Nyarlathotep, Lord of Chaos. Given that this was an “evolution,” this would come with a tremendous strength boost…but what caught my ear in particular was how Ciel “already received permission.” Apparently Veldora was already aware of him.</p>
<p><em>“Since when were you acquainted?”</em></p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>He became aware of my existence after your evolution to demon lord, Sir Rimuru.</em></span></p>
<p>Veldora offered further explanation:</p>
<p>(I was aware of it, but only became fully sure about its presence a few moments ago. In the history of this planet, after all, I’ve never heard of a mere skill acquiring sentience for itself. But sin-type abilities are known to contain something like an ego for themselves, so I began to suspect that it might’ve been possible after all.)</p>
<p>So Veldora was suspecting something since way back in the Great Sage days. He had been observing a thing or two inside my Stomach, he said, and what he saw often seemed strange and mysterious to him. Once that turned into Raphael, Lord of Wisdom, with my demon-lord evolution, though, he was pretty much sure of it. It turns out he had been holding conversations with it up to that point, apparently thinking it was me all along. I wasn’t that bothered about it, but I was kind of curious to know what they talked about.</p>
<p>But be that as it may, Veldora was acquainted with Ciel. That was the important part.</p>
<p>(Okay, so you knew each other…and you agreed to its proposal? Is that right?)</p>
<p>(Indeed I did! I was hoping I could take on my own sister, but under these circumstances, Rimuru, I will leave it to you!)</p>
<p>Glad he’s back to his usual two-timing self. That’s the exact <a id="page-160"></a>opposite of what you were sayin’ earlier, isn’t it?! And Ciel’s <em>way</em> too eager to mess around with his skills, too.</p>
<p>I really didn’t think now was the time for this, but maybe it’d be more of a hassle if they tried that stuff while Veldora wasn’t confined.</p>
<p>Besides, I was kind of interested in testing out my powers. I had Ludora to take on in the future, so I had an obligation to find out how strong I was now. Velgrynd would be the perfect guinea pig for this. Now that the heat was off (no pun intended), I could use her to see how I’d grown in assorted ways.</p>
<p>Might as well do it while I can, right? I’ll be keeping an eye on my friends, but until they’re in real danger, testing my skills will take top priority.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>I think that would be a good idea.</em></span></p>
<p>Ciel seemed happy about it, too.</p>
<p>So I was all set to go, but then it had a follow-up proposal for me.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>By the way, following my assorted analyses, I am now able to combine the ultimate skills Veldora, Lord of the Storm, and Uriel, Lord of Vows, to form the ultimate skill Hastur, Lord of Starwind. Would you like to proceed?</em></span></p>
<p>Dr. Ciel just never lets up, does it? I’m about to fight Velgrynd here—how much free time would it <em>have</em>, even? It’s almost like it doesn’t even see Velgrynd as a challenge any longer. Tinkering with skills seems like its new hobby or something, but I really wish it’d save that for regular business hours.</p>
<p>For the time being, I had to reject this idea.</p>
<p><em>“Hey, you might find a better way to modify them later, right? So how about you take your time thinking about that stuff some other time?”</em></p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>…!! Well said, Master. Understood. I will continue to search for greater accomplishments.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-161"></a>R…ight. Glad it agrees with me. I’m not sure what was so “well said” about it, but at least I can concentrate on the battle now.</p>
<p>Besides, Uriel was pretty effective against Velgrynd, and no matter how much of an upper hand I have right now, I don’t want to throw away that known advantage. And sure, I might be able to win with Belzebuth alone, but this isn’t a game. I can’t let my guard down, and any failure here would be unforgivable. Besides, I know Ciel’s thinking <em>way</em> too highly of me. Think I’ll only give lip service to its praise from now on.</p>
<p>Still, Ciel’s love of messing around with skills was a little harrowing. Its sights were turned squarely on Veldora at the moment, but he said okay to it, so whatever. The real problem would come after this battle was over. I could tell all my friends who awakened to demon-lord form would have some major skill mods waiting for them as well. Dr. Ciel could work that out in no time, I was sure, and I had a feeling it’d be champing at the bit for the opportunity. Or maybe it was already hard at work…?</p>
<p>But even as I worried about this, the showdown with Velgrynd was about to begin.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">The crimson dragon and I floated in the sky, glaring at each other. Velgrynd instantly shifted into her human form, and the battle was very suddenly underway. She fired Nuclear Cannon strikes at me in rapid-fire succession, slashing away with her azure dragon sword.</p>
<p>What was the difference between her human and dragon forms? It mostly came down to the difference in defensive force. On offense, they were exactly the same, but the human form was far more energy-efficient. That connects directly to being able to fight for longer, so for extended combat sessions, the human form is likely the way to go.</p>
<p>But dragon mode had an undeniable advantage of its own—the sheer hugeness of it. The scale of her attacks was proportionate to <a id="page-162"></a>the size of her body—the same power, but a much wider range. That let her take on large numbers of opponents simultaneously…and even if it were just one target, it’d be pretty tough to avoid attacks from such a gigantic creature. Then there’s the defense, the real clincher. Finishing off someone so huge required an attack equally large in scale. A sword was unlikely to work, and most magic was just too small in scale to matter. Very little magic worked against True Dragons to begin with, but even ignoring that, any magic devised for human-sized targets was useless. It had to work <em>big</em>, or else it just wouldn’t cause much damage.</p>
<p>So going into dragon mode was likely the stronger bet…but Velgrynd chose her human form anyway. And I could guess the reason.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>Presumably she is seeking to abandon all defense so she may finish you off, Master.</em></span></p>
<p>Looks like it, huh? I’ll go with that, then.</p>
<p>Velgrynd’s fiendish rage only served to enhance her beauty. All that rage was focused on her blade, and now she swung it with enough force to cut me in half. But I wasn’t about to take that lying down. Leaving my magic countermeasures to Ciel, I charged at Velgrynd with my own beloved blade—a straight sword of pure crimson steel. Her azure dragon blade was a kind of broadsword; she hadn’t been hiding it, but instead created it just now via Create Material. Its grade was God-class—but so was mine, apparently upgrading itself for its new True Dragon owner. Velgrynd’s weapon was a threat, but I was hardly outclassed.</p>
<p>In fact—</p>
<p>With a shrill <em>tiiing</em>, Velgrynd’s azure sword shattered.</p>
<p>I was pretty surprised myself, but it must’ve been even worse for her. “What did you do there?” she asked, once she moved a prudent distance away. I didn’t mean to “do” anything; all I did was try to parry her attack. She was really barking up the wrong tree with that question.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em><a id="page-163"></a>That is the difference in each weapon’s performance. My master’s straight sword is a masterpiece forged with the heart and soul of Kurobe; Velgrynd’s is an easily manufactured model, a mere amalgamation of magicules. It is God-class due to the sheer number of magicules involved, but in essence, it is a blunt cudgel of a sword.</em></span></p>
<p>That’s how it is, huh? I knew there could be pretty stark differences between weapons graded at the same level, but I didn’t expect <em>this</em> much difference in the God class. I suppose wielding the same weapon for a long time, really <em>building</em> a relationship, pays off in the end—that’s a real good lesson to learn. My current outfit was made with Create Material, too, after all. Just because it’s rated God-class doesn’t mean I should expect the world of it.</p>
<p>“Well, I just found out that even in the same weapon class, sometimes the difference can be like night and day. The one <em>you</em> just created turned out to be no match for mine.”</p>
<p>I doubted that’d be enough to have her give up, but I told her anyway. Velgrynd, who was no fool, seemed to conclude that I wasn’t lying—but maybe she wasn’t willing to accept it yet, because she kept on producing azure swords from thin air to slash at me with. Only after all of them got rent to pieces did she seem ready to accept reality.</p>
<p>Seething in frustration, she promptly moved on to her next attempt. If materialized weapons were useless, I suppose, she’d just have to rely on her own body next. Claws extended out from her hands as she assumed a kung fu–style stance. Seeing this, I put my sword away.</p>
<p>“…What are you doing?”</p>
<p>I was experimenting, of course. I wanted to see how I was progressing, so I stopped relying on my sword.</p>
<p>“I’m taking you on barehanded. It’d just be bullying the weak if I used a weapon.”</p>
<p>A fight like this is all about goading your opponent. If it made <a id="page-164"></a>her lose her cool, that would be enough to assure victory for me right there.</p>
<p>“Don’t you look down on me…!”</p>
<p>And it worked. It was almost funny how easily Velgrynd fell into my trap. Now all I had to do was treat this like a chess game and not make any blatantly bad moves.</p>
<p>Velgrynd’s claw attacks were fast—impossible to follow with your eyes. But I had extraordinary perception speed. Ever since I gave Raphael the name Ciel, my Mind Accelerate skill had been increasing. It was once a million times faster than reality, but now that was up to several hundred million times. I could even follow the traversal of rays going at the speed of light. I couldn’t <em>move</em> at that speed, mind you, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t avoid this attack.</p>
<p>This speed boost applied to the casting of magic as well. Spatial Transport now worked nearly a thousand times faster than before—in other words, I could escape from even a lightspeed attack with a quick teleport, as long as the attack was a certain distance away. One second could be prolonged into ten or so years, so it was like watching a completely stationary world. It’d be tough for normal people to withstand, given that <em>they</em> couldn’t move, either, but through the activation of Mind Accelerate at certain key points, Ciel could overcome this for me.</p>
<p>It didn’t really matter how fast Velgrynd could move. Now that I was at this point, swordsmanship or martial arts weren’t necessary for me. I could just push her down with brute force.</p>
<p>Velgrynd’s super-speed attack was closing in. It was going several hundred times the speed of sound; the old me would’ve doubtlessly had a hard time with it. No, it wasn’t worth breaking a sweat over.</p>
<p>“Too slow,” I said, goading her further as I Spatial Transported my way behind her. But she was no slouch, either. Anticipating this move, she immediately reacted to it. Pretty tough cookie, I thought. She really was the best of the best, and there was no discounting that.</p>
<p>“Oh, you think so? I doubt you can move quicker than me—is that an application of Spatial Transport, then? It’s impressive you <a id="page-165"></a>can move so naturally with it without creating any spatial rifts, but once I know the trick, I can deal with it.”</p>
<p>I thought my taunting would enrage her further, but she was calmer than I expected. That’s Veldora’s sister for you, I suppose…but Ciel anticipated this as well. And the next move she was likely going to make was:</p>
<p>“But now that I’ve intervened to keep a given space fixed in time, no one can teleport themselves at all within. Too bad, huh?”</p>
<p>That’s the only way for her to counteract me, isn’t it? Velgrynd had Spatial Transport as well, of course, and she could intervene and put her own rules over a large swath of space around her. Transport via Dominate Space was no longer possible for me—I could force it anyway, but there wasn’t much point if she knew where I’d be exiting. It remained a potential escape route for me, too, but again, she’d know where I’d be going, so it was pretty meaningless.</p>
<p>Now that teleport-type abilities were out of the picture, that just left physical speed to decide this. Velgrynd now had the perfect environment to seal her victory. That meant her next move was…</p>
<p>“I never thought I’d have to use my <em>true</em> clincher moves on someone like you.”</p>
<p>“You think stopping my movement was enough to let you win? Lemme show you just how wrong you are.”</p>
<p>“You <em>are</em> a brat, aren’t you? If you hadn’t killed my boy, I might have liked you. But this is the end now.”</p>
<p>Velgrynd took a stance. Kicking against thin air, she turned herself into a supersonic bullet, accelerating further as it shot forward.</p>
<p>“Cardinal Acceleration!”</p>
<p>But the shouted voice was already well behind her. Velgrynd made herself into a crimson meteor, approaching me at the physical limit of sub-lightspeed. It was changing trajectory, too—making this transformation allowed her to function as a flaming ball of wrath, capable of going in any direction. This, I suppose, was Cardinal Acceleration in its purest form. Not a straight-line attack, but more of a guided missile that could go anywhere it wanted. A combination of teeming energy and pondering mass, it was the ultimate in destructive attacks.</p>
<p><a id="page-166"></a>Ciel had thoroughly analyzed Cardinal Acceleration, perfectly discerning its true nature for me. Velgrynd was terrifying enough, but Ciel had her beat for sure. I created a manas like this on what was basically a whim—and that whim would spell the Flame Dragon’s defeat.</p>
<p class="indent-s"><span class="special"><em>As I planned, Master, I have deployed Belzebuth around your entire perimeter. No matter the angle of contact, Predation on Velgrynd will proceed without complications.</em></span></p>
<p>And that was exactly right.</p>
<p>If I tried to eat a sentient target any normal way, it’d be real hard if it tried to resist me. And <em>this</em> was a True Dragon. No matter how much of an effort Ciel put in, Belzebuth-based Predation should have been impossible…</p>
<p>…except that, by her own will, Velgrynd had transformed herself into a meteor-style projectile. All of her energy was placed into her attack, and thanks to that, her resistance to things like this had been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>And here was the result. Velgrynd was now quarantined in my Complex Space.</p>
<p>(How did…?! How in the world did that happen?!) I heard her say.</p>
<p>The moment she thought she finished me off, she was in a completely empty space. For Velgrynd, it must’ve been difficult to grasp the situation at first. I’m sure it’d take some time for her to realize she had been defeated. Better spell it out for her.</p>
<p>(I won. You just sit there and be quiet, okay?)</p>
<p>(I… I lost?)</p>
<p>(That’s what happened, yeah. And you can’t escape my Complex Space, so I don’t even think your Parallel Existence can exchange any energy with you.)</p>
<p>According to Dr. Ciel, I had consumed over 50 percent of Velgrynd’s magicules. The replication standing by next to Ludora had about 20 percent, and the remaining amount—nearly 30 percent—had been expended and needed to be recovered. Apparently she <a id="page-167"></a>could recover around 10 percent of her magicules per day, so she’d be back at just under 50 percent in three days…but since I had this replication inside of me, she wouldn’t recover quite that much. Her own sentience existed in both replications, which made exact calculations a little complex, but either way, I just weakened Velgrynd a hell of a lot.</p>
<p>(If you want the full story, ask Veldora, all right?)</p>
<p>(Veldora? What are you talking about…?)</p>
<p>Velgrynd seemed puzzled, but I think it’d be quicker to hear about this from the horse’s mouth.</p>
<p>(Kwaaaaah-ha-ha-ha! It is I, my sister. I hope you are faring well! Doesn’t really look like it, but…)</p>
<p>(Veldora?! You weren’t gone after all?!)</p>
<p>Great. Hopefully they can talk things over and come to some kind of détente about this.</p>
<p>So I now had complete victory over Velgrynd, capturing the majority of her magicules in Complex Space.</p>
