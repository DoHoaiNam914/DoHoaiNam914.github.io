<p class="noindent">Once again I was able to deliver Volume 15 to you without any trip-ups.</p>
<p>When I went over the deadline last volume, I might’ve said to myself something like “better be a little more careful next time,” but unfortunately, I was late by around ten days this time as well. I really want to reflect more on that—and next time, I’ll try to be just a little bit <em>more</em> careful than that!</p>
<p>In fact, however, I had actually discussed this issue with my editor, I, from pretty early on.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“I think it might be a little tight.”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s do our best!”</p>
<p>“We can’t make it a ‘to be continued’ thing?”</p>
<p>“That’s pretty much how the last volume was, so I’d like things to wrap up more nicely this time.”</p>
<p>“True. But the page count is kind of…”</p>
<p>“That’s all right! I’ve decided that I no longer care how many pages it is!”</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>That’s not what I meant!</em> I said to myself at the time, inwardly shrugging.</p>
<p>This volume has the largest cast of characters yet, several of <a id="page-392"></a>whom are making their first appearance. I know I’m bucking the rules of good storytelling, but I can’t help it, so I just let it slide. That’s why I had to write so much more text for each scene, so I really wanted to break it up in the middle and end it in the next volume…but that got rejected.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“All right. Well, if that’s the case, would you mind considering delaying the release date by a month?”</p>
<p>“Hmm… Well, let’s keep plugging away till the last minute!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">So neither side gave any concessions, and time continued to pass by. I was writing with a lot of energy now, and the word count was already past Volume 14’s.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“How’s it going?”</p>
<p>“Mmm, it really is gonna be tight. At the rate I’m going, I’m probably gonna overshoot the deadline by around ten days.”</p>
<p>“All right. In that case, I’ve made up my mind here.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you mean you’ll delay it to October?”</p>
<p>“No. If we can keep it to ten days, we’ll work it out somehow, so it’ll be released in September still!”</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>Are you serious?</em> I honestly thought. Like, <em>that’s</em> what you made up your mind about? There was no guarantee that even ten days were enough, but I’s determination was unwavering.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“I think the page count’s going to set another new record…”</p>
<p>“No need to worry about that! Just do your best to make the deadline!”</p>
<p>“…Roger.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">And so, fully defeated, I somehow managed to make it on time. Thanks to that, this is the largest volume yet.</p>

<p class="tx1"><a id="page-393"></a>So that’s how we were able to get this out, but I’m anxious to see how people react to it. If you like it, nothing could make me happier.</p>
<p>The content of this book series has now diverged so drastically from the original web novel that it’s no longer an exaggeration to call it a separate work. I’m busy brainstorming for the next volume right now, so keep an eye out for it!</p>
<p>I’d like to express my utmost gratitude to everybody who’s supported and been involved with <em>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</em>. I hope that I’ll get to see you all again in the next volume!</p>
