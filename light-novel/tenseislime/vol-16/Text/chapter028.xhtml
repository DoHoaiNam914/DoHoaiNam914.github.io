<p><a id="page-271"></a>“Heh! I don’t need any help—I’m the strongest there is. Let’s fight a one-on-one duel, demon lord! Fair and square!”</p>
<p>Ludora was a handsome young man, but something about his smile was a little vulgar. His goals were tilted a bit more toward robbing Guy of his treasure than defeating him, it felt like. But that, too, was so cutely humanlike of him, Guy thought. People didn’t take action unless they were driven by desire. They studied hard and worked hard because they wanted a better life. Ludora was absolutely human—a human with the sweet emotions Guy adored.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha! Try to resist me!”</p>
<p>And so the battle began.</p>
<p class="space-break">Guy observed Ludora as he lunged at him. It was a sharp, quick attack, but there was no gravity behind it. Once Guy realized that, he grew frustrated that Ludora was holding back, not giving his all.</p>
<p>Ludora was protected by an intricately crafted set of full-body magic armor. It looked pretty valuable, so Guy decided to destroy it first. Apparently, this upstart was obsessed with money; he’d hate it if his belongings were all broken up. Guy was toying with him, in other words.</p>
<p>Easily dodging Ludora’s sword, Guy segued into a punishing knee—but it was a feint. Instead, he executed a side kick. Ludora was trying to dodge it within a hairbreadth, so he couldn’t adapt to the sudden change. The kick hit home, shattering his armor.</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaaahh?! This armor is worth our nation’s budget for the entire year!”</p>
<p>“Are you all right, my brother?!”</p>
<p>“You are <em>such</em> an idiot, Ludora. If we all fought together from the start, you wouldn’t have a broken set of armor right now.”</p>
<p>“Shut up! Th-this is a necessary outlay, all right?!”</p>
<p>Ludora was on the brink of tears. The kick must’ve worked better than Guy thought. Realizing this, he grinned.</p>
<p><em>Now I’ll bend up his sword and make him cry for good.</em></p>
<p>He observed the trio again. But just then:</p>
<p>“At least let me cast some support magic, my brother… Holy Blade!!”</p>
<p>The girl with the platinum pink hair—the one Guy marked as the least threat of all—invoked an unbelievable magic spell. The sword <a id="page-272"></a>in Ludora’s hand glowed. It was an evil-dispelling light, a dazzling, divine aura that smote the darkness.</p>
<p><em>That’s not good. That light has the power to cut through my barrier, I think.</em></p>
<p>He should have stopped the spell before it was cast, but Guy was enjoying the battle too much. It’d be boorish of him to impede a good time.</p>
<p>“Heh! I’ll allow this—it’s just my little sister cheering me on, after all. But don’t give me any more help, Lushia!”</p>
<p>Ludora was the type to be more interested in results than personal pride. Having his own sister help him out wasn’t about to damage his ego at all.</p>
<p><em>I’m liking this guy’s personality</em>.</p>
<p>He wasn’t in any real danger, but things were looking worse for Guy. But, for whatever reason, he was enjoying this.</p>
<p>“That much isn’t even a handicap for me. In fact, all three of you can fight me at once!”</p>
<p>“Nonsense! Now I’m getting serious. Prepare to die!!”</p>
<p>It might have been a fairly generic thing to say in battle, but Ludora really was hiding a secret power. His sword sped up in the air, advancing upon Guy. However, Guy was expecting this. He smiled, wanting to keep it fun, then reached for Temma, his own blade.</p>
<p>“Wha—?! A demon lord using a weapon? That’s dirty!”</p>
<p>“Huh? I don’t care what <em>you</em> think about it. But congratulations on making me unsheathe my sword.”</p>
<p>Ludora had a vibrant, dazzling manner with his sword. It could also wound Guy if it hit him, so of course Guy would resort to weaponry. He was a proud demon lord, but he wasn’t foolish enough to go too easy on a foe and lose.</p>
<p>“Ha! Like I’d ever want praise from a demon lord!”</p>
<p>“No? Then I take it back.”</p>
<p>“…Wait. If you <em>want</em> to praise me, go ahead.”</p>
<p>Ludora was actually happy about it.</p>
<p>“Well, I could probably count the number of people who <em>crossed</em> swords with me on one hand. Ludora, was it? I’ve noted your name now. You should be proud.”</p>
<p><a id="page-273"></a>Guy, in a jovial mood, fulfilled Ludora’s wish. Ludora replied with an earnest smile.</p>
<p>“<em>You’re</em> pretty impressive, too, y’know. I didn’t think a demon lord could parry an evil-smiting blade like this so easily. I owe you one for recalling my name. Let me hear yours before I destroy you.”</p>
<p>“Pretty cocky for a human, eh? But all right—I like you, so I’ll tell you. When you reach the underworld, state my name. I am Guy. This man screamed, <em>‘Gi-yaaaaah!!’</em> at me before I killed him, and I use an abbreviated version of it as my name.”</p>
<p>Ludora gave Guy a funny look. Then he snapped out of it. “…Wait a minute!” he shouted. “That’s not a name. It’s <em>not a name</em>! Nobody’s gonna be impressed at all if I defeat a demon lord with <em>that</em> kind of name. I want a cooler name than <em>that</em> to be written in all my legends!”</p>
<p>“Huh? Why’s a name matter so much to you?”</p>
<p>“It matters a <em>lot</em>! All right, then. One second—let’s call a time-out. I’ll think of a better name for you.”</p>
<p>Ludora withdrew his sword. Guy had no reason to agree to this, but he wasn’t about to kill this intruder when he was doing such a good job staving off his boredom. He wanted to enjoy this all the way, so he agreed to Ludora’s offer. Besides, he was a little curious.</p>
<p>So Ludora’s party formed a huddle and began talking to one another.</p>
<p>“He’s got pretty hair. Bright red and all.”</p>
<p>“Wait. They already call me cardinal aura, you know. I don’t wanna give <em>that</em> up.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know! You get so worked up over the dumbest things. Your hair isn’t even red. It’s blue.”</p>
<p>“<em>You’re</em> the one who started calling me that!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, I know.”</p>
<p>“You’re so bad at dealing with women, my brother. I bet Gryn’s going to dump you before much longer.”</p>
<p>“What? No way!”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! Don’t worry, Ludora. I might do a lot of things, but I’ll <em>never</em> abandon you.”</p>
<p>“Right? Yeah. Good to hear. So let’s give him something else… Crimson! How’s that? You won’t say no to <em>that</em>, will you?”</p>
<p>“I like that as well, yes.”</p>
<p><a id="page-274"></a>“I have no complaints, no, but are you sure? A Hero naming a demon lord… If you build too much of a friendship with him, you’re gonna make people pretty nervous, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s all right! Nobody’s watching us. If we don’t tell anyone, nobody will ever know!”</p>
<p>Not that Guy was one to complain, but Ludora felt like a pretty irresponsible guy to him. That much was clear from this exchange. It honestly worried him a bit.</p>
<p>“Have you decided?”</p>
<p>“Yep! Sorry it took so long. From now on, your name is Guy Crimson!”</p>
<p>So began the reign of the demon lord Guy Crimson.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Ludora lost consciousness the moment he gave the name. Giving names to monsters was a taboo in the human world, but Ludora had the rather wishful thought that it’d be okay because his enemy was a demon lord. Instead of magicules, he was drained of holy force, walking the line between life and death. After he woke up, of course, he was practically lectured to death by his sister Lushia and his lover, Velgrynd the Flame Dragon.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, the final duel between him and Guy got postponed…but that, of all things, was how their strange relationship began.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

</div>
<p class="tx1">So Guy waited for Ludora to recover, and then they held their promised duel. The results were inconclusive, so they fought again many more times.</p>
<p>Ludora, as befitting his title of Hero, was strong. He was an awakened Hero, and Guy was an awakened demon lord. He had mastered his technique in battle, while Guy fought only with brute strength and talent. They fought evenly with each other, but Guy slowly gained an edge over time, a natural result of his superior stamina.</p>
<p>Three women watched these proceedings—Lushia, Velgrynd, and Velzard the Ice Dragon. Velzard wasn’t too interested at first, but as the battle heated up, she grew to enjoy the action.</p>
<p>“My, I see Guy’s become stronger again.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, my sister. But Ludora’s no slouch, either.”</p>
<p><a id="page-275"></a>“It looks that way. I almost wonder if he’s human at all.”</p>
<p>“No doubt. And of <em>course</em> he’s strong. Ludora’s become my brother’s apprentice, and he’s been given some of his ‘ultimate’ force as well. He’s gonna get stronger—trust me.”</p>
<p>“Oh? It makes sense, then.”</p>
<p>“I’d prefer if nobody got hurt, though…”</p>
<p>The audience got along well with one another.</p>
<p>“I have some tea ready.”</p>
<p>“We have enough for Sir Guy and Sir Ludora as well, since it looks like their battle’s about to end.”</p>
<p>Mizeri and the demons under her were providing the tea service.</p>
<p>This had become an almost daily occurrence as time went on. That, or sometimes the sisters would bicker with each other so much that nobody even wanted to fight. Velzard and Velgrynd got along with each other, but apparently they had their differences about education practices. Veldora the Storm Dragon, their newborn younger brother, was a selfish brat, storming around like a spoiled toddler.</p>
<p>Why was that?</p>
<p>“Because you’re way too hard on him, my sister! Why can’t you give him a little love for a change?”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t be silly! I love Veldora so much! I play with him all the time! That’s why I keep on replacing his heart so he’ll have a more serious-minded personality!”</p>
<p>By <em>“replacing his heart,”</em> Velzard was talking about physically destroying Veldora and resurrecting him—a rather heavy-handed approach to child-rearing—and Velgrynd wasn’t a fan.</p>
<p>“I’m saying that you shouldn’t do that. Reach out to him with words, not violence. If you <em>have</em> to get rough, then so be it, but I know he’ll understand if you talk with him.”</p>
<p>“You’re <em>so</em> easy on him, Velgrynd! In that case, next time I won’t beat him to death, all right? I’ll just beat him <em>most</em> of the way there and put some obedience in his brain!”</p>
<p>“I’m not talking about that. Just…hug him a bit more. Show him the ropes. Bring him to town and let him see how to go around in human form. Or how to defeat enemies. That sort of thing.”</p>
<p>“Velgrynd… You just like spoiling children, don’t you? Spare the <a id="page-276"></a>rod and spoil the child, as they say. At this rate, Ludora over there’s gonna be ruined, too, you know.”</p>
<p>“No he won’t! Ludora and I are the best partners ever. If <em>I</em> could educate Veldora, I know he’d grow into a wonderful, respectful little brother. So can you leave this to me, please?”</p>
<p>“Huh? No way. I can train him a lot better. In fact, I’ll take care of him for as long as he needs!”</p>
<p>“Oh, who’s the one giving him too much attention now? Come on! It’s my turn!”</p>
<p>And so they kept laying the blame on each other—Velzard was too harsh, Velgrynd was too easy on him, that sort of thing. To Guy, it was all the same.</p>
<p><em>You need a balance of both. The problem with these True Dragon sisters is that they don’t know how to level it off at all…</em></p>
<p>He was exasperated with them, although he’d never say it out loud.</p>
<p>“Whoa, whoa, we can’t fight like this.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Better not bother them when they’re trying to claim Veldora for themselves.”</p>
<p>Guy and Ludora got as far away as they could from them. The dragons put up a barrier for them during battle, but if they were too busy bickering, Guy and Ludora had to do it instead. Otherwise they’d sink the entire continent.</p>
<p>They were all used to it by that point, but even so, Guy wished the sisters would argue someplace where they wouldn’t bother everyone else. One man’s fault is another man’s lesson, as they say, but Guy and Ludora weren’t getting any lessons from them at all.</p>
<p class="space-break">One day:</p>
<p>“Dammit, you’re back again?!”</p>
<p>“Shut up! This battle isn’t over until I win!”</p>
<p>Fighting was now the way Guy and Ludora said hello to each other. They started going at it like usual, and they’d keep going until they were exhausted. It’d always end in a draw, and then their usual arguing would start up after that.</p>
<p>“You keep talking about keeping it fair and square, but you fight pretty dirty, don’t you?”</p>
<p><a id="page-277"></a>Guy was right. Throwing sand into his opponent’s eyes was a given. The moment Ludora began fighting, he’d always put up a Holy Barrier to reduce Guy’s force. Guy didn’t bother checking for traps before the fight began, and Ludora knew that, so he tried to break out every type he could think of.</p>
<p>Even his excuses were just awful.</p>
<p>“Look, if I win, that means I’m right, okay? Or more like if I <em>don’t</em> win, then I’ll <em>never</em> be on the side of justice! That’s why I have to win, no matter what!”</p>
<p>As he proudly declared, a win was a win, no matter how it looked.</p>
<p>“Don’t give me that crap! Do whatever you want, but at least stop calling it <em>‘fair and square’</em> all the damn time!”</p>
<p>Guy had a valid point. But Ludora just snorted at him.</p>
<p>“<em>‘Don’t give me that crap’</em>? Don’t give <em>me</em> that crap, man! That move you tried: I used it on you last time, didn’t I? How many years did you think I spent mastering that, huh?!”</p>
<p>Changing the subject—Ludora’s secret skill. Nudging the conversation off the rails was how he kept Guy from putting him in a corner all the time. Ludora had received a royal education, so he had a knack for verbal gymnastics like this.</p>
<p>“Years? More like three weeks, if I recall.”</p>
<p>“Right. Sir Veldanava was very impressed.”</p>
<p>The commentary from the audience made Guy roll his eyes. This move that was supposedly Ludora’s life’s work was nothing very intricate at all. He shot a look at Ludora and sighed.</p>
<p class="space-break">“Stealing people’s moves… <em>You’re</em> the dirty one here!”</p>
<p>Ludora was still airing his grievances, but he had his own reasons, too. His arguing resulted from a certain panic in his mind. They were still equal in terms of raw power, but lately, he could feel himself being pushed around a little. Ludora could sense it most of all, and he knew that this couldn’t go on.</p>
<p><em>If I could fight fair and square and win, you know I would, man!</em></p>
<p>He wanted to scream that out loud. But now, despite the lofty ideals he kept spouting, he was forced to use whatever trick he could to eke out victory.</p>
