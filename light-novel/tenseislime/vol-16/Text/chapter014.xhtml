<p><a id="page-108"></a>“What?”</p>
<p>“…Well, no point keeping you in suspense. Let me sum it up for you. It’s because there isn’t even any need for me to show up.”</p>
<p>“…What are you getting at?”</p>
<p>Adalmann, the undead in the mage’s robe, flashed an evil grin. Zarario was getting peeved.</p>
<p><em>Hold on. There was no need for him to show up? Cornu was supposed to be invading that floor. Did something happen to him?</em></p>
<p>There was no need to ask. Zarario quickly deducted the truth. But since Adalmann was here to divert Zarario from his mission, he said it out loud anyway.</p>
<p>“The foolish intruder has been eliminated by Lady Velgrynd. That’s why I came here without a trace of concern in my mind!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Zarario wasn’t dumb enough to doubt his foe’s words. Working on the assumption that Cornu was defeated, he probed further about their number one aim.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… I see. I’m sure Cornu was defenseless against Velgrynd, then. It seems some strange events have been taking place, but enough about that for now. So is this pittance of a force all that remains from your side?”</p>
<p>Why wasn’t Velgrynd here? Probably because of Masayuki, Zarario figured. Masayuki must have inherited Ludora’s soul after all. Feldway, poring over the Imperial Information Bureau’s records, had ordered Masayuki killed in order to eliminate the possibility…but now the possibility was the truth, and Velgrynd must have realized it.</p>
<p><em>Bad luck for Cornu, then. This wouldn’t have happened, either, if we hadn’t swapped roles as planned. But Velgrynd can be safely ignored. As long as Sir Michael is with us, it’ll be easy to rule over her. Right now…</em></p>
<p>Right now, Deeno was the key factor.</p>
<p>“You seem undisturbed. Well, perhaps you were strong enough to take on Lady Velgrynd if needed, then? We really <em>have</em> been underestimated, haven’t we?”</p>
<p>“Heavens, we could have taken you on en masse and lost, even.”</p>
<p>Charys and Adalmann were being clever for a reason. Based on Zarario’s attitude, they could tell he was hiding some great, unknown <a id="page-109"></a>power. Despite that, however, the advantage was still with their team, as Adalmann was about to explain.</p>
<p>“I think I understand the reason for your question. Your true aim is Lady Ramiris, is it not? Our standing orders always tell us to place Lady Ramiris’s safety above all other concerns.”</p>
<p>When he woke up, checking on Ramiris was the first thing Adalmann did. As long as she was safe, everything else could work itself out. Besides, it was Rimuru’s supreme order. They were all floor guardians tasked with guarding the labyrinth, and that meant keeping Ramiris safe.</p>
<p>“So is Lady Ramiris safe?”</p>
<p>“Of course, Lady Treyni. Sir Zegion came to her aid, and I’m sure he won’t let anyone touch Lady Ramiris.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Quite a relief, then.”</p>
<p>Treyni smiled. The rest of the group looked just as relieved. Now they could focus entirely on the enemy right here.</p>
<p>For Zarario, meanwhile, the mention of Zegion’s name made him fear the worst about Deeno.</p>
<p><em>Zegion can cast Distortion Field, as far as I recall. If Deeno got serious… No, there’s no point expecting that much from him. He was never too enthusiastic about this to start. By now, I’m sure he’s…</em></p>
<p>He had a notably accurate picture of matters. And it was at that moment when Deeno sent him a Thought Communication.</p>
<p>(Hey, Zarario, you hearing this? The mission’s a failure. Velgrynd got into the battle, and Cornu screwed the pooch, I guess. I’m running into some serious hombres here, too, so I’m splitting. You better run before the labyrinth closes up. See you around!)</p>
<p>It was all so one-sided, Zarario couldn’t help but chuckle at it. <em>How very Deeno-like of him</em>, he thought. But the time to retreat was here. Winning this battle would be pointless, and he had a reason to avoid pointless maneuvers.</p>
<p>“I have to say, I’ve never been so humiliated before. Look at me, forced to retreat against this rabble I could knock over with a flick of my finger… It won’t be the case next time. Remember that.”</p>
<p>After matter-of-factly playing the sore loser, Zarario took his team and teleported out of the scene. The group he left behind was filled not <a id="page-110"></a>with the glory of victory but a sense of sheer relief. They had kept the labyrinth safe.</p>

<p class="tx1">Now all threats were gone from the labyrinth.</p>
<p>Zegion turned off his Fantastical World ability, then faced Beretta, who had just finished laying Ramiris out on a couch.</p>
<p>“Did we let Sir Deeno get away?”</p>
<p>“Looks that way.”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee! No need to put it like that. Lady Ramiris was merciful enough to allow Sir Deeno to leave.”</p>
<p>Beretta was right. Zegion had noticed that Deeno was wearing a Resurrection Bracelet, but he still let him go. It was a sort of experiment—would Ramiris’s protection work against someone openly hostile to her?—and the results were now clear. Deeno placed his bet, it paid off, and he was alive.</p>
<p>To Zegion, it was the same thing either way. Carrying out this experiment was a pleasant bonus, but his victory condition here was to keep Ramiris safe, and that was now complete.</p>
<p>“If Lady Ramiris wills it, I have no objection.”</p>
<p>Beretta nodded. If they had fended off the enemy, there was no need for further bloodshed. If the enemy couldn’t realize what a merciful act this was, though, next time would be different.</p>
<p>Depending on how Deeno reacted, Zegion was prepared to pursue him. He was prepared to kill him if he didn’t get the hint and run away, but that no longer seemed necessary. Deeno was now convincing his allies to retreat, and two of them had accepted the invitation and left the area.</p>
<p>“So what about this Zarario?”</p>
<p>“Sir Adalmann is dealing with him. His presence has disappeared, so presumably he gave up and left.”</p>
<p>Adalmann and his cohorts were awake and back in action, and that was apparently enough to dissuade the remaining enemies.</p>
<p>“Excellent news.”</p>
<p>“Yes. And we would’ve easily lost if Lady Ramiris wasn’t here.”</p>
<p><a id="page-111"></a>“Indeed. Even if we didn’t, we likely would have lost many—and that’s as good as defeat to us.”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>Zegion and Beretta exchanged nods, agreeing to consider ways to beef up their security measures later.</p>
<p>With this, the continued safety of the labyrinth was assured. Checking one more time to ensure Ramiris was safe, Zegion returned to his usual domain.</p>
