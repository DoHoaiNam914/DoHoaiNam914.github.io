<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter026">GUY CRIMSON</a></h1>
<p class="noindent">He had been willed into life eons ago, before heaven and earth were created. It was a simple coincidence. When Veldanava the Creator built seven seraphim out of the great elemental spirit of light, that also gave birth to those associated with the shadows behind them. Those were the Devil Lords, the seven Primal Demons derived from the great elemental spirit of darkness—and he was the first, the king of the underworld, the core realm of darkness.</p>
<p>He was an absolute ruler, darkness personified, from the moment he was born, an arrogant king who forced all other demons to do his bidding. His brothers and sisters, to him, were no different from the many other clans that existed. They fought for supremacy, jostled one another for position; two of the Primals even joined hands to challenge him. But he made them all bend to his will without experiencing a moment of pain.</p>
<p>It was like child’s play to him, but through it all, he discovered one thing. The Primal Demons were immortal…but if their heart cores could be crushed, they would be forced to serve the victor when they revived. As spiritual life-forms, they’d be subservient to those they lost to.</p>
<p>Once that truth was discovered, the remaining four independent Primals fell into a stalemate. Not all of them, however. A lone holdout continued to trouble the king, but now that he had been called to the surface, his fate was separate from the others. Was this summoning <a id="page-258"></a>a mere coincidence, or…? There was no way to tell now—but in fact, that event would change the king’s fate enormously.</p>
<p class="space-break">Called forth, he looked at his surroundings. He had grown lazy in the peace of the underworld, oblivious to the passage of time on the surface.</p>
<p>The world—likely just created—already had civilization developing on it. Instantly, he understood that he had been summoned. This was magic, the ability to rewrite the laws of the world.</p>
<p>The powers he enjoyed in the underworld were now limited; he could only produce the force of a newborn Arch Demon. That was enough for him, but lacking a body was tremendously inconvenient. He thought over why this had happened and quickly came up with an answer. He was in the demi-material world, not the realm of spiritual life-forms. The space around him wasn’t infused with magicules; simply being here consumed his at a ferocious rate.</p>
<p>He had no relationship with the Creator. He didn’t understand what changes had happened to the world. It was fascinating, he thought. But he did find the presence wailing about something in front of him displeasing. Back when he was the strongest demon in the underworld, nobody would dare try something so reckless and foolish. So he held out for a bit to see what this was about.</p>
<p>The wizard who called for him gave him a long-winded speech. He was speaking in the First Language, a magical tongue, so he had no trouble comprehending it.</p>
<p>Deigning to hear this wizard out, he found the speech to be quite interesting. The world now had nations, all fighting one another for dominance. A variety of species had been born—the elves, the dwarves, the beastmen, the vampires, the humans—and all of them were fighting for survival. This wizard was known as a High Human.</p>
<p><em>“You have become my servant,”</em> the arrogant man told him. <em>“You will follow the rules of this world and carry out my orders.”</em></p>
<p>The man commanded him to destroy the nations that competed for supremacy with the Supreme Magic Empire, a nation attempting to unify the world under its rule. That, to him, was a simple task. The war had raged for more than a hundred years, but with his arrival, it came to an end.</p>
<p><a id="page-259"></a>All he did was carry out a single magic spell—the forbidden nuclear magic Death Streak. The fury of this large-scale magic, destructive enough to even destroy souls, turned the largest of the rival nations and its population of more than one million into a city of death.</p>
<p>It was simply the way things were to him, and it didn’t pain him at all. But there was one fascinating change. Earning the souls of all these humans, he realized he had been awakened. As a result, he successfully used these million corpses to obtain his own physical body.</p>
<p>This vessel felt so comfortable to him. Even drowsiness, experienced by him for the first time, was blissful, and he loved trying to resist it. This was the birth of the first true demon lord in the world.</p>
<p>Earning this power, he now realized he was freed from the magic that once held him down. It was a simple curse, one he easily could’ve torn down, but merely flying off without doing anything else would just make things boring. It appeared now that gathering ten thousand human souls had kicked off his awakening. The seal on his species was released, and he became a Demon Peer.</p>
<p>This still gave him less than 10 percent of the powers he had on hand in the underworld, but on the surface world, he was unparalleled in strength. Then he wondered. What if he gathered an even larger number of souls?</p>
<p>He knew the perfect person to experiment with. The man who had asked him for all those petty favors earlier. He had the perfect way to pay him back for that.</p>
<p>Returning to the original city, he killed anyone who crossed his path, avoiding any mass-destruction magic so his target wouldn’t be caught in it. He could feel the screams, the wailings, of the soon-to-be-dead carving themselves into his soul. <em>“Gi-yaaaaahh!!”</em> they screamed.</p>
<p>Then he thought:</p>
<p><em>Yes… That may just be perfect for my “name.”</em></p>
<p>The change was dramatic. His name was now Guy, and he evolved even further, becoming a Devil Lord and finally regaining the full power he had enjoyed in the underworld. The souls he obtained gave Guy more power, his greatly expanded vessel filled to the brim, and his magicule count was what it used to be again.</p>
<p>But the transformation ended there. As a result, there was no reason for Guy to continue his work.</p>
<p><a id="page-260"></a>He summoned the two demons that served him, giving them his orders. Now that he had awakened to Devil Lord status and gained a name for himself, he was in a much more generous mood. Enough so that he erased the memory of that piddling wizard from his memory. He wasn’t even worth tormenting any longer.</p>
<p><em>“N-no! How did you ever escape my secret restraint?!”</em></p>
<p>Guy paid no attention to this fool wailing in his presence. That was, perhaps, a lucky break for the wizard, but he was killed by the demons before recognizing it as such.</p>
<p>On that day, several tens of millennia ago, the largest, most powerful nation in human history was born, putting an end to the divisions among the race for good. It was all so simple.</p>
<p class="space-break">The two demons Guy summoned had deteriorated to Arch Demons as well. Those were the rules of the world; in the transition from the underworld to the demi-material one, they both lost most of their power. It was a simple matter for spiritual life-forms to travel across worlds, but in <em>this</em> one, simply staying alive cost them so much energy.</p>
<p>They needed physical bodies, for only when they found one and evolved could they become permanent residents of this world. Realizing that, Guy waited for his servants to evolve. But, strangely enough, no matter how many human souls they gathered, the two of them never changed at all. So he gave them two corpses—and with them, the honor of becoming physical. That, more than anything else, proved just how good a mood Guy was in.</p>
<p>These two demons were Vert and Bleu, and the forms they took were both beautiful women. Guy looked at them as they kneeled before him, pondering to himself. If they would grow no stronger than this, he thought, there was no point in giving them physical bodies at all. He could assign menial tasks to them, perhaps, but their power just seemed far too weak to him. So, generous as he was, he granted them names. Recalling how receiving a name caused himself to evolve, he reasoned he could repeat the process with this pair as well.</p>
<p>“I’m going to give names to both of you. My pride refuses to allow those serving me to remain this weak.”</p>
<p>Guy made his declaration. For Vert, he would give the name Mizeri, <a id="page-261"></a>styled after the misery expressed by the pained wailing of the downtrodden. For Bleu, he would give the name Raine, for the rain that was falling on that day.</p>
<p>Just as Guy hoped, the two of them evolved to Demon Peers. That was the beginning—the first day Guy and his servants left their mark on human history.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">The days wore on—fun enough, but still boring.</p>
<p>Guy wandered across the world, enjoying whatever he ran into. There was ample hardship as well, but it didn’t bother him at all. Mizeri and Raine were his constant companions, always poking their noses into his business.</p>
<p>“You know you’re free to live whatever lives you want, right?”</p>
<p>He constantly told them that. But their responses were always the same.</p>
<p>“No, our duty is to be of use to you.”</p>
<p>“Precisely. You are our king. We are your subjects. That is the eternal, unrelenting truth.”</p>
<p>So the trio’s journey continued.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mizeri and Raine summoned their own tribes, secretly building up their spheres of influence so they could provide all the riches and entertainment of the world to Guy, its ruler. Unlike life in the underworld, which was devoted entirely to battle and refining the strength of their souls, this world was full of exciting things to do. Nothing remained stagnant; everything was constantly growing. Cuisine, music, theater, dance, art, and so much more—Guy and his servants never grew tired of it.</p>
<p>“Hey, this is pretty fun, too, isn’t it?!” Guy shouted out as he was joining in a dance, part of a festival held by a minority clan in a small settlement.</p>
<p>He smiled at Mizeri and Raine, a rare sight for his servants that gave them paroxysms of delight.</p>
<p>“How wonderful. I thought these humans were frail and useless, but they have their value after all, don’t they?”</p>
<p><a id="page-262"></a>“Everything in the world belongs to Lord Guy…and a tool only has meaning when you put it to full use.”</p>
<p>Mizeri and Raine were sure of it all over again. To keep Guy happy with them, they learned a wealth of things in the places they visited. Their experiences lived on in their cooking, cleaning, song, dance, and music—the foundation of their roles as all-purpose maids, enabling them to grow and develop further.</p>
<p>In the underworld, the weak were ruthlessly weeded out. Non-demons were exterminated; only those with utility as slaves were put to work. But in this world, even the weak had value—and once they realized that, it seemed like such a waste to destroy this world.</p>
<p>“Humans are truly the cutest little things,” Guy said. “Foolish, yes, but I could never bring myself to hate them.”</p>
<p>Some were foolish, indeed, but some were truly wondrous. Their uglier emotions inspired hate among the demons, yet the more beautiful ones were a delicious sight to behold, the greatest meal Guy’s band could ever hope to enjoy. The difference from one extreme to the other was so intense, Guy began to think that calling all of them “humans” was a tad slapdash.</p>
<p>Guy was very kind to humans. If a fearsome magic beast threatened the countryside settlements, he’d eradicate it. When evil mysticists (believed to be survivors from the Supreme Magic Empire) reared their ugly heads, he destroyed them. His deeds were celebrated, passed across generations, and over time became the stuff of mythology and legend.</p>
<p class="space-break">And then he met him.</p>
<p class="space-break">The creator of the world. Its supreme master and most powerful presence.</p>
<p>Guy was making the most of these calm, peaceful days, but his senses were constantly sharpened. That’s why he knew. This figure before him was Veldanava the Star-King Dragon, the Creator.</p>
<p>“If you’re a <em>real</em> god, you bastard, then use your power to <em>show</em> it to me!”</p>
<p>Guy boldly laughed at him. He was sure he was the strongest, and so he taunted Veldanava like it was his right. The results weren’t <a id="page-263"></a>even close. Guy couldn’t land a single blow against him before being smashed into the ground.</p>
<p>At that moment, the pride he kept as the unbeatable strongman of the world was shattered into a million pieces. So, following the rule that defeat meant servitude, Guy would now be Veldanava’s slave—but shattered though it was, his pride refused to allow that.</p>
<p>“Kill me if you want. I’m satisfied with that. Now I understand—in life, there is always someone better than you out there. There is no limit to this totem pole of strength, for I, too, must exist amid this unbroken rule of law. O great being, I take real pride in losing to thee.”</p>
<p>Guy sounded almost triumphant. But Veldanava just laughed back.</p>
<p>“Little man, I love all the things I have created. This world was once boring, but now it’s growing more bountiful by the moment. Intelligent beings inhabit it, evolving to where they can communicate with me. And now there are powerful men like you, strong enough to withstand combat against me.”</p>
<p>“Ha! You call that withstanding? I landed nothing on you, and then you did <em>this</em> to me with one swipe.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh… But you withstood it, didn’t you? Millions of people would never even try to take me on, but you did. That alone makes me more than happy enough.”</p>
<p>“Sure. We’ll leave it at that.”</p>
<p>“If you could, please. Also, I need to ask you a favor.”</p>
<p>“A favor?”</p>
<p>A comfortable sort of satisfaction now filled Guy’s mind. He found himself willing to listen to Veldanava.</p>
<p>“Yes. If the world keeps growing at this rate of speed, it will likely be destroyed within a few millennia. Humans get so carried away with their mistakes, you see. Sometimes doing the right thing isn’t true justice, and doing the evil thing can save the world on occasion. They are imperfect, and that’s why they’re so lovable. It is not my desire to see them meet their doom.”</p>
<p>Veldanava was asking him to help prevent the world’s destruction. It made Guy recall the Supreme Magic Empire he’d torn apart, a nation driven by lust for power and authority to war against their own kind.</p>
<p><a id="page-264"></a><em>I see… Yeah, that was pretty awful. If I’d let that nation survive, maybe they would’ve destroyed the world long ago.</em></p>
<p>Guy was sure about it. But one question remained.</p>
<p>“Hmm… Your prediction is much the same as my own. But something doesn’t add up.”</p>
<p>“What doesn’t?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t <em>you</em> the Creator? If you’re the god who created us, you oughtta be able to guide the world the way you want it. Why do you need to ask someone like me?”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! Well, because I’m not omnipotent. When I was born, all that existed was my will. It was complete, fully, not a piece missing to it—a flawless existence, where all was one and one was all. I was the only thing in the world. Doesn’t that sound boring to you?”</p>
<p>It made sense to Guy. It took someone like Guy to understand. Veldanava had deliberately cast away his own omnipotence.</p>
<p><em>I’ll bet he did. If he could see how everything would turn out, it’d be the most boring thing ever</em>.</p>
<p>Based on his own experiences, he knew that fighting nothing but battles he knew he could win got old after a while. Everyone in the underworld (except one person) feared Guy. It had been ages upon ages since any of the other demons challenged him. All that, and not even <em>he</em> was any challenge to Veldanava. Guy could see why he had thrown out his omnipotence.</p>
<p>“Yeah… I don’t hate this world at all, either. I’ll help you.”</p>
<p>He didn’t waver for a moment. Guy liked this world as well. And whether he was now a slave or not, Guy truly wanted to lend a hand.</p>
<p>Veldanava nodded happily at him. “Thank you. You will become an Arbitrator, my representative. I want you to watch the world for me.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Your representative? You don’t need to order me around?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. I told you I hate forcing things on people.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah? So what should I do?”</p>
<p>“Whatever you want. You can keep wandering around the world, or you could build a citadel to rule from. As long as you remind mankind that threats continue to exist so they don’t get arrogant, anything works.”</p>
<p>Arrogant. Hearing that word made Guy realize just how suited he was for this job.</p>
<p><a id="page-265"></a>“Right… Then I will rule over the humans as a fearsome demon lord. If they have an absolute enemy to contend with, they won’t have the time to squabble with one another.”</p>
<p>“I like that! My apologies for giving you such a tough job, but thanks for picking it up.”</p>
<p>“Sure. Not a problem.”</p>
<p>It was at that moment when the shape of Guy’s mind took on a new embodiment—the unique skill Pride.</p>
<p>“As the demon lord of this world,” he proclaimed, “if mankind grows arrogant, I will judge them in your place!”</p>
<p>Having his own pride crushed only served to deepen it. Thus was born a demon lord with powers equivalent to a god.</p>
<p>Veldanava smiled. “Glad to hear it. Let us continue working on this…as friends!”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’m gonna have a lot of fun.”</p>
<p>So Guy and Veldanava acknowledged each other as equals, becoming friends beyond their social positions.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">As he promised, Guy lived life as a demon lord.</p>
<p>To allay his boredom, he monitored the larger settlements that appeared across the land. Over time, they became villages, and then the villages grouped together and grew into nations. It was all crude compared to the supercivilizations of the past, but the magic and technology quietly passed down manifested itself again, and things grew at a fairly decent clip.</p>
<p>Watching mankind go about its business was fun. And over time, multiple nations took shape—and once again, small-scale conflict began to break out.</p>
<p><em>Should I do something?</em> Guy wondered. But he was always one to prefer taking action over stewing in thought. So he destroyed one nation that had his attention, partly as a warning.</p>
<p>Mankind feared Guy as a demon lord, this visible threat to them. In order to face up to this threat, they fostered a desire to unite.</p>
<p><em>Perfect. As long as they don’t rile me, I’m not gonna destroy anyone.</em></p>
<p>Guy was an Arbitrator, and he enjoyed his work.</p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-266"></a>As time went on, Mizeri and Raine used their respective underlings to rule over a large domain. They defeated the local gods, monsters, and magic-born in the area, helping their reputation grow.</p>
<p>Mizeri was even using her underlings as spies, having them infiltrate human society. She’d pore over the intelligence they brought back in order to expose those who needed purging. Her mission: give humans just the right amount of terror so they’d stay on their toes.</p>
<p>The demon-lord system was now firmly established, and when it was, Guy didn’t have much to do. He wandered around the world, enjoying battle whenever he felt an urge to fight. Once he laid waste to an army of giants that caused trouble even to the Seven Primordials, Veldanava’s servants. Veldanava also asked Guy to fight Ivalage, the World-Destroyer Dragon, and that was a pretty fun experience. The dragon had an instinct for battle, something Guy loved to see.</p>
<p>But there were problems as well. This foe was too good an opponent for Guy. He wound up fighting against it for three months, and then he let it flee over to another world. The fallout caused substantial damage to the land, turning it into a waste as far as the eye could see. It was a hard but useful lesson for him. From now on, when he got serious, he’d have to choose his battlefields carefully.</p>
<p class="space-break">Guy looked down at the land from above. There, he discovered a familiar-looking castle. It was the imperial palace of the Supreme Magic Empire, the place from which he had been summoned to this world.</p>
<p>Sensing fate at work, Guy designated it his own domain. Raine quickly put her servants to work, making the place livable again. With the right magic, the castle was rebuilt in a flash.</p>
<p>It was around then when a white dragon challenged Guy—a beautiful one, with blue-diamond eyes. Guy didn’t know what her problem was, but she was itching for battle from the moment she opened her mouth. “My brother may accept you,” she stormed, “but I won’t!”</p>
<p>Based on the previous lessons he’d learned, Guy wanted to select a battlefield befitting his opponent’s abilities. But this dragon was blowing sheets of ice and snow at his castle from above. At this rate, he <a id="page-267"></a>couldn’t afford to worry about the damage. Anyone still alive had long since evacuated anyway, and the castle could always be rebuilt. It’d put Raine and her underlings through some hardship, but that didn’t matter to Guy. Besides, after letting the World-Destroyer Dragon get away, Guy was eager for some action—and the sight of a new challenger made his heart soar.</p>
<p><em>May as well enjoy this</em>, he thought, and so he brought out his full force against her. But even when both sides fought all out, neither of them could seize victory.</p>
<p>This was Velzard the Ice Dragon, Veldanava’s younger sister and the oldest of the female True Dragons. Only Veldanava outclassed her in magicule count, and even Guy couldn’t fully defeat her.</p>
<p>But from Velzard’s perspective, it was Guy who was the anomaly. Guy, after all, boasted nothing but a single unique skill. Velzard had Gabriel, Lord of Endurance, an angel-type ultimate skill that Veldanava had granted her, and finishing a battle in a draw against Guy was unfathomable.</p>
<p>“Why are you equal to me when you’re only at the unique level?”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha! Because I’m strong is why.”</p>
<p>“Don’t give me that! My brother lent <em>me</em> this power, not you. It proves that he sees <em>me</em> as far more useful than you! So why?!”</p>
<p>“Uh-uh. He offered to give me some power, too, but I refused. If we had a master-servant thing going, I would’ve said yes, but he wants us to remain equals. So instead…”</p>
<p>Velzard had attacked Guy out of jealousy, so her brother would approve of her. Now, before her eyes, Guy was transforming his power. Seeing Veldanava’s force gave him the inspiration—and through his battle with Velzard, Guy came to understand exactly what an ultimate skill was.</p>
<p>“…I figured I’d reach the ultimate level with my own power.”</p>
<p>Then, in the next instant, the unique skill Pride evolved into the ultimate skill Lucifer, Lord of Arrogance. It stunned Velzard into silence.</p>
<p>“Oh… No wonder my brother took a liking to you. Then let me see how far you can project yourself…to the bitter end.”</p>
<p>Velzard’s true goal was apparently to test Guy. Whether he passed <a id="page-268"></a>the test or not is unknown, but from there on, the two walked hand in hand with each other. That was how Guy and Velzard met.</p>
<p class="space-break">The battle, which lasted three days and three nights, altered the very axis of the world. But this time, it was all a careful adjustment on Guy’s part. The icy, uninhabitable tundra turned into a land of eternal spring—and the land Guy defined as his own became a frozen wasteland instead.</p>
<p>“Well…this oughtta work.”</p>
<p>“How wonderful, Lord Guy!” cried Raine. “You’ve done it again!”</p>
<p>“I doubt it will be a problem,” said Mizeri. “There was some damage to humanity, but all the nations in the world are joining hands to deal with this upheaval, so casualties are being kept to a minimum.”</p>
<p>To the residents of this world, it was a disaster. To Guy, it was just a funny story. And as long as Guy was happy, so were Raine and Mizeri. The side effects of his recent battle had encased his citadel in ice, which actually made it more beautiful.</p>
<p>“Well, why don’t we keep it this way? We’ll preserve it as a memorial.”</p>
<p>“Allow me to do that. I can help with this much.”</p>
<p>Velzard’s <em>“help”</em> involved plunging the castle’s surroundings in frigid temperatures. Ever since, the citadel was off-limits forever to the weak.</p>
<p class="space-break">Living in this castle would be inconvenient for Velzard in dragon form. When Guy pointed that out, Velzard instantly took human shape instead. In her adult form, she could fully control her aura, but she kept herself just a little younger than that. The slight aura leakage that resulted turned into a chill that perfected the castle’s defenses. In this arctic land that no human or monster could ever survive in, nobody would even think about invading Guy’s domain.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<p>“How does this look to you?”</p>
<p>“Well, fine…but it’s not really my thing, you know?”</p>
<p>“You are <em>so</em> mean sometimes, you know that?”</p>
<p>Velzard was griping at Guy, but deep down, she rather liked him. Deep in her heart, she secretly swore to herself that she’d win his heart someday.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">Several hundred years passed. Not much changed from day to day, and this particular day was just the same as every one before it.</p>
<p>Guy, bored beyond belief, had guests—a party of three. They had breezily made their way through this forbidding land and walked right into the castle. Guy watched them intently, his interest piqued.</p>
<p>Then the blond, blue-eyed young man leading the party screamed out.</p>
<p>“I am Ludora! Ludora Nasca, crown prince of the Kingdom of Nasca and Hero bearing the hopes of humanity! Evil demon lord, prepare to taste my blade and the destruction it will bestow upon you! And give me all the treasure you’re supposed to be hoarding, too!!”</p>
<p>It wasn’t the noblest of declarations. But that pure, refreshing ambition of Ludora’s charmed Guy.</p>
<p>“Ludora, my brother! You’re sounding every bit the demon lord <em>he</em> is!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re useless. It’s all greed with you, isn’t it? If you wanted money, I can make all the money you want.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on, Gryn! Stop spoiling my brother like that, please. At this rate, we’re bound to lose, and <em>then</em> what will happen to us?!”</p>
<p>Guy watched as they talked to one another. They were certainly daring, or at least foolish. But one thing was sure. If they stood before Guy now, it meant they had defeated Mizeri and Raine. This funny trio must’ve been far more powerful than they looked. And now Guy could see that one out of the three was the same kind of existence as his own friends and partners. He could no longer blame Mizeri and Raine for losing to them. It was the correct way of things—the laws of nature in action.</p>
<p>But right now:</p>
<p><em>A</em> “Hero,” <em>he said? What is that?</em></p>
<p>It was the first time he had heard that term. It had a sweet ring to it. Something that could keep his days from being so boring from now on.</p>
<p>Excited, he faced up to the man called Ludora.</p>
<p>“Huh, I like it. Let’s see what this Hero power of yours is like!”</p>
<p>Guy accepted Ludora’s challenge.</p>
