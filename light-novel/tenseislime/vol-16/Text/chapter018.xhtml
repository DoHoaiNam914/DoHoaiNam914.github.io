<p class="space-break"><em>…There it is.</em></p>
<p>Beretta’s body had also transformed into Crimson Steel, the divine metal, equivalent to God-class equipment. That explained the huge leap in EP, and it resulted from his adamantite body absorbing the massive number of magicules pouring out of him. (“EP,” by the way, stood for “existence points,” not “energy points,” for reasons I wasn’t let in on.)</p>
<p>Beyond that, the biggest shift was giving up the unique skill Reverser for the ultimate skill Deus Ex Machina. This skill encompassed the abilities Hasten Thought, Universal Detect, Lord’s Ambition, Mineral Domination, Control Earth Attribute, Inverse Fusion, Control Space, and Multilayer Barrier.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>I worked hard on that!</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, I’m sure you did. Good job.</em></p>
<p><em>You certainly don’t hold back when someone grabs your interest, do you? My skills are important and all, but your hobby’s never far from your mind, I suppose. You’ve been messing around with</em> this <em>skill set, too, I see… It’s very like Ciel, I suppose.</em></p>
<p>But enough about that. Look at Beretta! Combining Mineral Domination with Control Earth Attribute let him freely control and manipulate any kind of mineral. He’d need some materials to work with, but there was a storehouse of magisteel in the labyrinth that was also connected to the surface world, so we should be able to spot him some. This ability was a side effect of evolving his body into Crimson Steel, it seemed.</p>
<p>So it was kind of like control over the earth element, then? It let him transform metal into any shape he wanted, no matter how tough it was. Any weapons that hadn’t been enhanced with magic or an aura hardly mattered to Beretta any longer.</p>
<p><a id="page-138"></a>But even more vicious than that was how it allowed Beretta to freely make his body any shape he wanted. He could give himself an invincible body of liquid metal, like the bad guy in a classic action movie, impervious to pretty much any type of weapon. Sneaking up on foes like a slime, enveloping them, suffocating them to death… Just thinking of the possibilities made me shudder. He’d normally keep his usual form—that moving work of art, ball joints and all—but that was no longer what he looked like, so you had to be careful.</p>
<p>Thus, Beretta was now a kind of derivative spiritual life-form. Call it a metallic life-form, if you want.</p>
<p class="space-break">It was actually a pretty moving moment, wasn’t it? Seeing this doll I made on a whim evolve to this level. Looking at him, letting my emotions swell, I realized Beretta was now kneeling before me.</p>
<p>“I will never forget the great gift you have given me, Sir Rimuru. By my very life, I promise I will carry out the mission you have granted me!”</p>
<p>He was ready to go. I wanted to tell him not to push it too much, but with the dangers facing Ramiris, he may not have a choice. He’d have some tough battles ahead of him, no doubt, but I was sure he’d live up to my expectations. His protection, after all, was what let me sleep at night.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said, nodding at Beretta. Now he was no longer troubled. My job was done, so I told him to return to his station and concentrate on recuperating for the time being.</p>

<p class="tx1">As I waited for my next interviewee, I thought about skills for a moment. Between the evolution festival I’d held earlier and the information I gained fighting the Empire’s best, a couple of questions had formed in my mind.</p>
<p>Skills were a type of power that took root in one’s soul, following the rules this world worked under. One could also receive them from the World Language after training hard enough or performing an impressive feat. I never gave them much deep thought, but really, it <a id="page-139"></a>was an odd phenomenon. I’d just written it off as “that sort of thing” before…but during all this, I now had a question I couldn’t ignore any longer.</p>
<p>Basically:</p>
<p class="space-break">What was the <em>true nature</em> of skills?</p>
<p class="space-break">I’d had possession of a unique skill from virtually the moment I came to this world. In fact, I heard the World Language in my mind just before I died in my old world, which showed that skills weren’t exclusive to this one. That supposition only added to the questions…but now I couldn’t stop wondering if people over in my <em>other</em> world could use skills, too.</p>
<p>Unique skills were something that only heroes, or champions, could ever obtain. As “unique” as they were, their effects ran the gamut, but they were all extremely powerful. They were physical manifestations of the user’s desires, unleashing their effects based on what the caster wanted. In my case, I started out with Predator and Great Sage, the latter of which I never even asked for, which was funny.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>How rude. I very much was desired by you, Sir Rimuru!</em></p>
<p><em>Huh…?</em></p>
<p>No, I think it was mainly because I was a virgin who wanted— Ah, never mind. Out of my mind with it! If that’s what Ciel claimed, maybe that’s what I hoped for, deep in my subconscious. Any further investigation would be dangerous, so let’s leave it at that.</p>
<p>But back to the topic.</p>
<p>Skills latched on to people’s souls, but that hadn’t always been the case. Those obtained by pushing the physical envelope with your body could be etched into your body, not your soul. That’s often what happened when a skill was obtained from monsters—sometimes you gained a skill just by consuming them. These were called race-intrinsic skills, possessed by all members of a race and passed down across generations.</p>
<p>If you wanted to earn a skill through hard training, the best you <a id="page-140"></a>could hope for was an “extra” one. What mattered more came after acquiring it. If you could boost your mastery of that skill, or perhaps combine it with your sword talents to create original moves, you could have a powerful force in your hands. Magic, too, was a kind of skill, as proven by all the spells I had consumed and learned.</p>
<p>So there were many things that the term <em>skill</em> could cover, but the most important among them were unique skills. These were abilities created strictly within individual people, and each one was different. Some unique-skill families were like each other, but it’s believed that no two unique skills were exactly alike.</p>
<p>They <em>would</em> sometimes be repeated over great lengths of time, but that was a special exception. Ravenous, the unique skill possessed by the orc lord that had attacked us, was one of those. It’s a race-intrinsic skill passed to awakened members of the race, something that existed only within certain bloodlines. Ravenous was also attached to its owner’s physical body, so other races likely could not handle it. I had combined it with Predator immediately upon ingesting it, so I never had to worry about any of those issues.</p>
<p>Shizu’s unique skill Deviant was believed to be derived from her soul. She’d entrusted it to me, and that’s why I became able to use it, but otherwise I wasn’t sure I would’ve been able to get it at all. I had the impression by now that soul-derived skills were the stronger kind.</p>
<p>By the way, the ultimate enchantment Alternative that Ludora gave me was, as you’d expect, rooted in the body. You needed to be at least a Saint to have the energy required to work it, so unless you created that ability yourself, it’d be pretty inefficient to use. Maybe that’s what gave you a chance to defend against even powerful unique skills.</p>
<p>Jiwu and Bernie had ultimate skills, but Diablo had defeated them anyway, which was normally unheard of. Unique skills didn’t work on ultimate skills; only other ultimate skills did. There were exceptions—Chloe’s Unlimited Imprisonment and Absolute Severance, along with Masayuki’s Chosen One—but trying to beat an ultimate skill–wielder with just a unique was insanely reckless. Even uniques could vary widely in power, but when stacked up against an ultimate, the difference was like heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Someone who gained an ultimate had gained a new insight into the <a id="page-141"></a>world. It therefore existed on a higher plane than magic based on the world’s rules. Resisting it would require something like Disintegration, the most powerful of all holy magic, or the kinds of ultimates the Primal Demons threw around.</p>
<p>That’s why I thought Diablo might’ve beaten them with an ultimate of his own, but something told me that was wrong. I mean, he probably could’ve just steamrollered straight through all that and won anyway. It proves there are no absolute locks in the world, I suppose…but regardless, under the right conditions, it was possible for someone without an ultimate skill to defeat an ultimate user. Someone with completely mastered Arts could do it—maybe holy-level sword moves were stronger than your average skill in the end. Still, if you wanted to take on ultimate force, the best way was definitely to have an ultimate force of your own.</p>
<p class="space-break">To sum up:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bl-list">• Skills may be etched into your soul or stored in your body. Unique skills, based on my experience, could be awarded when you have a strong desire or craving for one. This process is more about compatibility than talent; no matter how much you want one, you won’t earn it if your EP count isn’t high enough. Wishing really hard wouldn’t work alone; only when overcoming challenges and obstacles in your way could you earn one. Skills are stronger when you earn them for yourself, rather than being awarded them by someone else. Skills that manifest themselves within one’s soul also outclass ones that take residence in the body.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• No two skills are identical. Even skills with the same name are likely to be different in terms of capability or rules of operation. They evolve based on the user’s wishes, so they may change in many unpredictable ways depending on that.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• The difference between unique and ultimate skills isn’t necessarily insurmountable. The strength of a skill is easily swayed by the owner’s mind; it likely took a stronger will to extract better effects from them. Skills are, at the core, the ability to affect the laws of <a id="page-142"></a>the world simply by wishing it were so. Activating such power, the kind that impacts the very root of the world, is impossible without a steel will.</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">It’s clear how important the power of one’s will is. That, and the ability to size up a skill and work out how to use it correctly.</p>
<p>I’d had Raphael with me, always ready to explain how to use a skill the best way. Other people may use their skill incorrectly and fail to get the most from it, even if the skill was born from their own wishes.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Hee-hee-hee! Among more recent examples, Deeno certainly made some amusing mistakes with his.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh?</em></p>
<p>I asked for more details, and Ciel was excited to offer some.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Deeno’s skill evolved itself mid-battle, as I stated earlier. Sloth, the sin-based skill that’s among the strongest of uniques, had turned into the ultimate skill Belphegor, Lord of Sloth. This would normally be a truly fearsome force to reckon with, but Zegion still thoroughly thrashed him. Zegion’s overwhelming strength was one reason, I’m sure, but there was another, more fundamental issue at hand: Deeno wasn’t using Belphegor correctly. (He was using it for disguise purposes, though, so maybe he didn’t try to fully examine it at all.)</p>
<p>Belphegor—evolved from Sloth, itself the result of Deeno’s lazy personality—had the trait of growing weaker the more its owner moved around. It was thus meant more for supporting the user’s friends and underlings. It was a skill that could’ve granted the power Deeno stored inside himself to his companions, and that would’ve been the most useful way to use Belphegor.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This all happened while we were gone, but video from the entire <a id="page-143"></a>battle was stored in the labyrinth archives. Analyzing it was part of Ciel’s hobby, and now it was kind enough to report the results to me.</p>
<p>Guy definitely wouldn’t have made that mistake. He’d grasp the essence of the skill and use it correctly each time. But someone as lazy as Deeno would judge the book by its cover and never notice what was really lurking inside.</p>
<p>If anything, the biggest mistake our enemy made this time was making Deeno do actual work. If they had let him goof off all day like usual and made his friends Pico and Garasha do all the work instead, Geld and Kumara might’ve gotten into real trouble.</p>
<p>Maybe we were lucky that way. My giving Deeno work and helping him see that labor can be satisfying might’ve been the break that led to our victory in a way. But if he got a rep for screwing up more often as he worked, it’d be awful for his future, so if we ever bury the hatchet, I better explain all of this to him.</p>
<p class="space-break">So gaining a correct grasp of your skills can be far from straightforward. Sometimes they triggered without your even wanting them to, like with Masayuki. Skills like that were frustratingly difficult to control and even harder to fully master. Understanding and mastering the essence of a skill was really the same thing as grasping your own mind. It was tricky, something you had to dedicate yourself to your whole life.</p>
<p>If you just saw a skill as a handy weapon, you’d never extract the true worth from it.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>You are exactly right. So face up to me more and treat me nicer, please.</em></p>
<p><em>Hmm…</em></p>
<p>I felt like this was the wrong interpretation, but I decided not to dwell on it.</p>

<p class="tx1">Right when I was reaching this conclusion, I heard a knock on the door. Benimaru came in, guided by Shuna.</p>
<p><a id="page-144"></a>“You called for me? I understand this is a one-on-one interview, but what did you want to ask me?”</p>
<p>He spoke up the moment he sat down on the sofa facing me. Perhaps he thought this was some sort of classified conversation, but it wasn’t.</p>
<p>“Oh, I apologize; this is just kind of a whim on my part.”</p>
<p>“A whim?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. All of us gained a lot more power in this war, didn’t we? We can measure people’s existence points in the labyrinth, so I thought we’d take a moment to grasp exactly how much war power all of us have.”</p>
<p>“I see. Yes, that <em>is</em> important!”</p>
<p>Benimaru’s face brightened up. I guess he was prepared for a grilling about life as a newlywed.</p>
<p>“Well, no, I mean, I <em>am</em> curious about that stuff, too, but it’d be abusing my authority if I asked you point-blank, wouldn’t it?”</p>
<p>“It would? Because Soei is all like, <em>‘Ha-ha, if you evolved that well, you must be taking care of business at home; you’re such a late bloomer that I thought I’d need to give you some help’</em> and so on—”</p>
<p>“Big brother?”</p>
<p>Shuna interrupted us with a smile and a tray with some slices of cake. The sheer impact sent shivers down my spine.</p>
<p>“Are you speaking untowardly to Sir Rimuru?”</p>
<p>“S-sorry…”</p>
<p>Even the tough-as-nails Benimaru couldn’t beat Shuna.</p>
<p>“And look at you, too, Sir Rimuru. You need to rebuke my brother, not play along with his silly talk.”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah, uh, okay. I’ll be sure to.”</p>
<p>Firing back would achieve nothing. Understanding that, I waited for Shuna to get in a better mood.</p>
<p class="space-break">The cake was nice and all, but thanks to how anxious we were, I could barely taste it. The moment Shuna took the tray away and left, Benimaru and I both let out a mighty sigh.</p>
<p>“Phew… <em>That</em> was a mistake.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Next time we talk about things like that, let’s make sure it’s the right time and place.”</p>
<p><a id="page-145"></a>“Roger that. I was <em>trying</em> to say that I didn’t like that talk, either. Why’d it turn out like this…?”</p>
<p>True. Although the way he was phrasing it, it was sounding dangerously close to bragging. But we could go in-depth on that later. For now, as we planned, I wanted to examine Benimaru’s current state.</p>
<div class="top-1">
<p class="ul-list">Name: Benimaru (EP: 4,397,778 + 1.14 million for Guren)</p>
<p class="ul-list">Race: God-ogre; high-level chaos elemental Flamesoul Ogre</p>
<p class="ul-list">Protection: Rimuru’s protection</p>
<p class="ul-list">Title: Flare Lord</p>
<p class="ul-list">Magic: Flamesoul magic</p>
<p class="ul-list">Ability: Ultimate skill Amaterasu, Lord of Shimmering Flame</p>
<p class="ul-list">Tolerances: Cancel Melee Attack, Cancel Natural Elements, Cancel Ailments, Resist Spiritual Attack, Resist Chaos Attack</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">…That’s how things turned out.</p>
<p><em>Damn</em>, he’s strong! The ultimate skill Amaterasu was obtained in exchange for giving up the unique skill Born Leader. It included the abilities Hasten Thought, Universal Detect, Lord’s Ambition, Regulate Thought, Dominate Heat, Dominate Space, Multilayer Barrier, and more. Some of Velgrynd’s abilities were reflected in this list, Ciel told me, but Benimaru was also very close to getting an ultimate skill by his own power. Ciel just gave him a <em>little</em> nudge in that direction, it claimed.</p>
<p>Still, if Benimaru’s EP count was more than four million, and <em>that</em> got bumped up another million when he had Guren out, wouldn’t that make him stronger than Luminus by now…?</p>
<p class="space-break">I should note here that you (probably) couldn’t fake your EP. Or, to put it more accurately, the existence points of someone in the labyrinth could be measured to a high level of accuracy. If you wanted to try faking it, you’d need to do something like carry a concealed God-class weapon on you or keep a Separate Body elsewhere like Velgrynd. A mere Replication would produce much smaller EP counts, so it’d <a id="page-146"></a>be spotted as a fake pretty quickly. Outside the labyrinth, there were lots of ways you could fake EP, but trying to bring that game into the Dungeon was like trying to sneak up on someone in a swimming pool by keeping your head underwater. Ramiris’s appraisal skills would easily spot it.</p>
<p>She was good at detail-oriented work like that, despite all her many other shortcomings. Unfortunately, she didn’t really understand what she could and couldn’t do. We could only perform these exact measurements because someone had mentioned in idle conversation, <em>“Boy, it’d be nice if we could get more accurate with people’s EP counts.”</em> I think it was Shinji, but anyway, Ramiris replied, <em>“Oh, we can!”</em> The scene was pretty awkward after that, I was told. I’m sure everyone was like, <em>Why didn’t she tell us sooner?</em> Then we would’ve been able to measure Luminus, and Guy and Velzard, too.</p>
<p>Hell, if we’d gotten stats for Deeno instead of skipping them because he was a trusted guest, we would’ve realized just how much stronger he was than he looked. Of course, even if we knew, it wouldn’t mean much unless we were sure he’d betray us. We should’ve been more on alert overall, but I don’t think we could’ve avoided how this turned out.</p>
<p>Anyway, although they were just reference figures, EP was a useful yardstick for measuring someone’s strength.</p>
<p class="space-break">I was now certain that Benimaru, at least, could hold his own against Deeno or the Three Mystic Leaders. He was near the top of the Million Class, and I couldn’t be gladder to have him at my side. But there was one thing bothering me.</p>
<p>“Hey, so don’t monsters get weaker when they conceive children?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Your magicule count goes down, generally.”</p>
<p>“So why did <em>you</em> get stronger?”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! That <em>is</em> strange, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Huh. What a breezy smile on him. He might’ve been trying to laugh it off, but I wasn’t about to let him.</p>
<p>“No, man, what’s going on with you?!”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, either! Soei’s been hounding me about it, too, asking why all the time. It’s a real pain.”</p>
<p><a id="page-147"></a>So I wasn’t the only one interested. If we could find an answer to this question, it’d be great news for monsters. I mean, a lot of hobgoblins get married and none of <em>them</em> complain about getting weaker…but the impact’s bigger the more high-level you are, so I wanted to search for a solution eventually.</p>
<p>“Well, if you see something, let me know, okay?”</p>
<p>“All right. I’ll go call Soei in, then.”</p>
<p>With that last doubt, I wrapped up the interview.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Soei came in right after Benimaru left. The moment he sat in front of me, I voiced my complaint to him.</p>
<p>“Okay, first off, can you not pick on Benimaru so much, please?”</p>
<p>“Heh… Well, he’s always been such a late bloomer in so many ways. You have to light a fire under him or he’ll just sit on his hands forever, I thought.”</p>
<p>Hmmmm, he might have a point. Benimaru had said something about having to conceive a successor before he could evolve, so I could understand Soei’s concern.</p>
<p>“All right. Let’s leave it at that. Now, about your evolution…”</p>
<p>Soei had been affected by Benimaru’s own evolution.</p>
<div class="top-1">
<p class="ul-list">Name: Soei (EP: 1,281,162)</p>
<p class="ul-list">Race: God-ogre; mid-level chaos elemental Darksoul Ogre</p>
<p class="ul-list">Protection: Flare Lord’s shadow</p>
<p class="ul-list">Title: Dark Shadow</p>
<p class="ul-list">Magic: Darksoul magic</p>
<p class="ul-list">Ability: Ultimate skill Tsukuyomi, Lord of Moonshade</p>
<p class="ul-list">Tolerances: Cancel Melee Attack, Cancel Natural Elements, Cancel Ailments, Cancel Spiritual Attack</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">Mmmm. Pretty strong. And pretty resistant, too. Defeating Soei would require some sort of ultimate-level attack, maybe chaotic- or sword-based in nature.</p>
<p>Ciel had awarded him the ultimate skill Tsukuyomi, and it came <a id="page-148"></a>with quite a list of abilities: Hasten Thought, Universal Detect, Eye of the Moon, Insta-Kill, Ultraspeed Action, Spiritual Control, Parallel Existence, Control Space, Multilayer Barrier, and so on.</p>
<p>“Whoa! You can use Parallel Existence now?”</p>
<p>I blurted out the question, much to my surprise.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Soei casually replied. “I cannot control multiple selves simultaneously like Lady Velgrynd, but even if it’s just one existence, I’m certain that it’s still a useful skill.”</p>
<p>Yeah, I’d be pretty certain, too. Now Soei was another step closer to de facto immortality…but maybe Eye of the Moon was even more worth diving into. It let him control shadows in any way he wanted, allowing him to do many things without being spotted by a target. It was notable for its broad effective range—it could cover an entire town, even. Nothing was better for intelligence gathering, not to mention assassination missions.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Soei’s skill is quite an achievement. I packed it full of things he wanted in order to re-create the ninja in my master’s memories.</em></p>
<p>I <em>thought</em> it was a pretty big heap of abilities. That was the reason, huh?</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>One impressive aspect of Eye of the Moon is that Soei’s Replication can use it as well. He could send Replications across the land, share information among them with Eye of the Moon, then use Thought Communication to spread this intelligence worldwide!</em></p>
<p>I could tell Ciel was proud of it. The more I heard about this skill, the more amazing it sounded.</p>
<p>Basically, it was an upgraded version of Argos, my surveillance magic. He could monitor the situation in locations worldwide, then capture it in video (with sound, even). Now I could rely on Soei for just about anything, and he definitely had a job leading our intelligence for as long as he wanted it.</p>
<p>“Okay! I’m going to give you a new title while I’m at it—you will now be known as the Darkness Seer. I hope you’ll continue to lead Team Kurayami and serve our nation!”</p>
<p><a id="page-149"></a>“Yes, my lord! I’ll do everything I can for you, Sir Rimuru!”</p>
<p><em>No, do it for my</em> nation<em>, not me. But whatever.</em></p>
<p>“Great. I appreciate it.”</p>
<p>I offered Soei my heartfelt thanks.</p>
<p>We spent the next hour or two discussing an assortment of things—his grievances, how Soka and the gang were doing, that kind of thing. He told me that his team of five, Soka included, had grown to attain an average EP of just under 200,000. Soka herself was at 261,898—quite high. Once upon a time, that’d make you the adjutant to a demon lord; even now, you could fight off some pretty high-level foes.</p>
<p>She must have grown her force a lot in this war. “There is no better training than war,” Soei told me, a line I thought I’d heard somewhere before. But I wanted to remind him not to assume someone could do something just because he could. Everyone is different, with their own talents and things they’re not so good at. I knew all about Soei’s talents, but I didn’t want him putting a similar workload on his troops. Do that, and we risked losing some real talented personnel.</p>
<p>“But isn’t it natural for us all to make every effort possible for you, Sir Rimuru?”</p>
<p><em>…Well, no, it’s not.</em></p>
<p>“I mean, if you stick to that way of thinking, you’re gonna lose followers eventually, you know? You need to value your troops more than that. Consider ways they can find their work more fun and stick to it for longer. That’s the job of a boss, after all.”</p>
<p>I always think people will follow you if you give them real motivation to. This is work, of course, so just having it be fun won’t be enough—but I think offering some sense of achievement is important. If you’re constantly struggling under an impossible workload, you’ll never get the joy of achievement. And when someone achieves something, giving them even more work after that is a definite no-no. I know that’d piss <em>me</em> off. <em>You do it</em>, I’d say…but with Soei, he’d actually do it all, which would lead to self-loathing and a lot of mental stress. That was my concern.</p>
<p>“You need to treat your tools well, in other words?”</p>
<p>“Stop calling your coworkers <em>‘tools.’</em> Look, it’s great to take pride in your work, but it’s nothing that’s forced on you, okay? As their boss, <a id="page-150"></a>you gotta recognize people for their achievements. They’ll be happier that way!”</p>
<p>“…I see. Indeed, receiving praise from you provides me the ultimate in joy, Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p><em>Hmm. He’s pretty serious-minded, too. Or maybe just tiresome.</em></p>
<p>“Anyway, why don’t you take this opportunity to hold a little get-together with your troops?”</p>
<p>“Understood. As the boss, it’s my job to grasp my staff’s mental state. I will endeavor to provide more care for them.”</p>
<p>“Don’t go overboard.”</p>
<p>Well, I’d expressed my concern to him, at least.</p>
<p class="space-break">A few days later, Soka and the gang sent me a letter of thanks. It was literally stained with tears of joy, so I patted myself on the back for that. Job well done!</p>

<p class="tx1">My next interview was with Gabil, who arrived after dinner.</p>
<p>“Gwah-ha-ha-ha-ha! I, Gabil, have come at the bidding of my master, Sir Rimuru!”</p>
<p>Today (or tonight), as always, Gabil was in high spirits. I invited him to sit, reminding him to keep it down in the evening like this. Once Shuna provided some tea, I got straight to business.</p>
<p>“You certainly performed well this time. Everyone got back alive because of your hard work. Great job holding out until the end! I wanted to personally thank you for that!”</p>
<p>I was grateful to Gabil on a personal level, not as leader of Tempest. If he had given up at any point, we definitely would’ve lost some people.</p>
<p>“S-Sir Rimuru! Even those words are enough to move me to great heights!!”</p>
<p>Gabil sobbed. I waited for him to calm down, not wanting to ruin his reverie.</p>
<p>“The fact that we survived this war, much less emerged victorious, is all because of you, Sir Rimuru. That voice—I was sure of it when I heard Lord Gadora’s whispering, but that was your voice, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p><a id="page-151"></a>Oh, did he pick up on Ciel’s voice?</p>
<p>“Mm? Uh, kind of.”</p>
<p>It’d be a long story to explain to him, but really, Ciel was my joker card. I didn’t want to use it for no reason, so I played along with Gabil’s confusion.</p>
<p>“Aha! I knew it! And if that wasn’t around to give me the strength to soldier on, I know the battle would’ve been impossible to win. I am constantly told by my peers not to get carried away, so I absolutely refuse to lay exclusive claim to this victory!”</p>
<p>Now Gabil was composed. It showed me he meant what he said.</p>
<p>“You’ve sure grown.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord! Hearing those words from you, Sir Rimuru, I’m just so <em>thankful</em>, so <em>inspired</em>…”</p>
<p>He broke down in tears again, just like before. His handkerchief wasn’t going to cut it, so I handed him a towel.</p>
<p>But his stats really <em>did</em> impress me.</p>
<div class="top-1">
<p class="ul-list">Name: Gabil (EP: 1,263,824)</p>
<p class="ul-list">Race: Dragonewt; mid-level chaos elemental Waterspirit Dragon</p>
<p class="ul-list">Protection: Rimuru’s protection</p>
<p class="ul-list">Title: Dracolord</p>
<p class="ul-list">Ability: Ultimate gift Moodmaker</p>
<p class="ul-list">Intrinsic skills: Magic Sense, Keen Sense, Dragonskin, Flame Breath, Thunder Breath</p>
<p class="ul-list">Tolerances: Cancel Pain, Resist Ailments, Resist Natural Elements, Resist Melee Attack, Resist Spiritual Attack, Resist Chaos Attack</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">While I wasn’t paying attention, he had grown about as strong as Soei.</p>
<p>Gabil’s ultimate gift Moodmaker was another masterpiece from Ciel. He hadn’t earned it by himself, but I wouldn’t hate on it for that. He got it only because it was such a perfect match for him. It included five main abilities—Hasten Thought, Alter Destiny, Control Unforeseen, Control Space, and Multilayer Barrier—but if he could learn <a id="page-152"></a>how to fully control the aura that leaked out of him, he’d also gain Lord’s Ambition in time.</p>
<p>Alter Destiny was the real killer among them; it could be invoked only once per day, but it could completely turn the tables in battle, even against foes who outclassed him. What would’ve happened if someone besides Gabil got this? If someone like Diablo had Alter Destiny, he could’ve been the strongest dude on the planet.</p>
<p>Gabil really <em>was</em> an amazing person that way. What impresses me the most, however, is his performance in battle. He bragged about this to me for a bit after he finally wiped away all his tears.</p>
<p>“Yes, the enemy’s spear was coming at me with screaming force. But I just grinned a little and used my lance to deflect it!”</p>
<p>That’s the thing. Gabil wielded the Vortex Spear, a Unique-class magical weapon. It was once the secret treasure of the lizardman race, he told me, and while it was strictly Unique in quality, it had deflected away the God-class Azure Dragon Spear, which I thought must have been a joke.</p>
<p>“It’s not just difference in ability that decides the fate of a battle, eh? Gwah-ha-ha-ha!”</p>
<p>He was laughing about it, but I thought that decided a <em>lot</em> of it, no? If Gabil deflected a Legend-class weapon, I’d concede that <em>maybe</em>, one in a thousand times or something, that would be possible. But <em>God</em>-class? Impossible.</p>
<p>The only real explanation I could think of was:</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Gabil likely has full unconscious control of his skill, effectively upgrading the Vortex Spear. Being protected by an Ultimate-level ability is believed to be why the spear survived without being shattered.</em></p>
<p>I suppose so, yeah. Another reason Gabil really impressed me sometimes. He was dedicated to hard work, too, something that his usual behavior didn’t make very clear. Between research and battle, he was capable of just about everything. I bet we could expect a lot from him in the future.</p>
<p>“Hey, speaking of that, do you mind if I keep your Vortex Spear for a bit? I wanted to ask Kurobe to give it a new birth, so to speak.”</p>
<p><a id="page-153"></a>“What?!”</p>
<p>“Right, he’d craft it again and transfer the old weapon’s experience into the new one. I’m planning to provide some Crimson Steel for the materials, so I bet he could evolve it into a God-class weapon, y’know?”</p>
<p>Crimson Steel was still a rare commodity, but I wasn’t gonna cheap out with Gabil. I really did want to upgrade his weapon, too—as a reward and to prepare for the grueling battles of an age to come. If he was reluctant to let go of a weapon passed down by his family, I’d do something else for him instead.</p>
<p>“Yes! Yes, please, I beg you to do that for me!!”</p>
<p>He was bawling yet again as he handed the spear over to me.</p>
<p class="space-break">With this God-class weapon in hand, I was sure Gabil would grow even stronger in time. If it recognized and accepted Gabil as its master, that would boost his existence points as well. He could even become a half-spiritual life-form, which would do a lot for his resistances. Also, the Heaven Fliers that had served under Gabil in the previous battle boasted an average EP of over 120,000, with the best of them surpassing 200,000. I sincerely hoped that they continued giving Gabil their support.</p>
<p>So our interview came to a close, although Gabil practically cried the entire way through it.</p>

<p class="tx1">Late that night, I was in a private room within a certain exclusive, members-only club. Normally, a beautiful elf would share a seat with me, but I turned them all down this time. Tonight, it was just Geld and me, sitting face-to-face.</p>
<p>“How are you feeling?”</p>
<p>“Just fine. I’ve grown used to this power, so I shouldn’t be breaking any more glasses.”</p>
<p>Geld smiled and nimbly emptied his drink. A normal-size glass looked like a child’s paper cup in his hands.</p>
<p>“Now, I wanted to see you so we could drink the night away—and also to formally recognize you for your services.”</p>
<p><a id="page-154"></a>“I’m honored, Sir Rimuru. Simply hearing those words from you couldn’t make me happier.”</p>
<p>He usually acted so cool and unaffected, but I could tell he meant those words from the heart. I nodded back and shared a toast with him. We then spent a little bit talking about Geld’s work and life issues before tackling serious business.</p>
<p>“So I wanted to talk about something that I’m afraid might offend you a little—is that okay?” I asked him.</p>
<p>“Go right ahead. I would consider nothing you do offensive.”</p>
<p>No, like, I can be pretty insensitive to people sometimes, so I wanted him to cut me off if he didn’t like it. I’m the sort who gets pretty cutting with his joking around without meaning anything by it, so if I went too far, I hoped he’d stop me.</p>
<p>I’d always had the gift of gab like that. This one time in grade school, I went to this girl and— Actually, never mind. It’s beyond embarrassing, and we’ve both long since moved on. I’m aware that I’m lacking in tact even now, but I’m trying to improve on that, avoiding any witty rejoinders that bring people down. Whether I’m succeeding or not is another thing, but if Geld’s all for it, let’s press on.</p>
<p>“All right. I’ll say it, then, but if it doesn’t sound like something you like, don’t be afraid to say no, okay?”</p>
<p>With that preface, I made the proposal. It was, of course, an offer to accept a round of Ciel’s Ability Adjust—but I was hiding Ciel from everyone, so I framed it with Geld more like, “Mind if I futz around with your skills a bit?”</p>
<p>But Geld immediately told me to go ahead. “Perhaps,” he said, “my weakness has caused some concern? If this will strengthen me, there is no need to ask permission. I look forward to it.”</p>
<p>He stressed his point by emptying his drink. He didn’t seem too resigned about this; rather, he was showing his resolve in his own way, like it was natural to accept this whether or not he liked it. I gave him an approving nod as I refilled his glass.</p>
<div class="top-1">
<p class="ul-list">Name: Geld (EP: 2,378,749)</p>
<p class="ul-list">Race: Boar-god; high-level chaos elemental Earthsoul Boar</p>
<p class="ul-list">Protection: Rimuru’s protection</p>
<p class="ul-list"><a id="page-155"></a>Title: Barrier Lord</p>
<p class="ul-list">Magic: Recovery magic</p>
<p class="ul-list">Ability: Ultimate gift Belzebuth, Lord of Gluttony</p>
<p class="ul-list">Tolerances: Cancel Pain, Cancel Ailments, Resist Natural Elements, Resist Melee Attack, Resist Spiritual Attack, Resist Chaos Attack</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">The moment Geld accepted my offer, Ciel swooped into action, going crazy without waiting another moment.</p>
<p>Geld had obtained the ultimate skill Belzebuth, which included a wide variety of abilities—Hasten Thought, Magic Sense, Lord’s Ambition, Ultraspeed Regeneration, Predation, Stomach, Isolate, Demand, Provide, Rot, Iron Wall, Grant Protection, Stand-in, Control Space, Multilayer Barrier, Keen Smell, and Armorize Body. It was a slightly inferior version of my Belzebuth with a lot of other stuff thrown in.</p>
<p>Using Grant Protection on his troops would provide a full layer of defense for them, and Geld himself could use Iron Wall and Stand-in to take damage in place of his companions. Rot was both offense and defense; it wasn’t just a straight-up wall but could put up a much-appreciated attack as well. Perfect for someone as defense-oriented as Geld, and I was sure he’d master it shortly.</p>
<p>What’s worth noting here is that Geld himself is an amazing fighter; it’s definitely not just his skills at work. His armor was now God-class, practically a part of his physical body; it worked the same as the clothing on demons, summonable whenever he willed it. His Meat Cleaver was similar as well; he could create a new one whenever it broke, and the next time we had Kurobe work on it, it’d stay in that condition whenever summoned. It honestly felt like cheating a little.</p>
<p>Either way, Geld’s EP went up with this gear on, but his core stats were just fine as well. With Belzebuth now in the picture, his strength could easily overwhelm Soei or Gabil. He should be able to hold his own against those Three Mystic Leaders, even, or stall for time at least. Defeating Geld when he was 100 percent devoted to defense would be tough without one serious attack.</p>
<p><a id="page-156"></a>“Now I can rely on you more than ever, huh?”</p>
<p>“I am glad to hear that. I swear to you I’ll exert myself as best I can to protect everyone!”</p>
<p>We smiled at each other. He’d be an integral part of my scheme for a while to come.</p>

<p class="tx1">I was at my private residence, in my usual chambers, thinking over the interviews I had planned for tomorrow.</p>
<p>I didn’t begin this day’s round until evening, so I only got to five people. We were all busy at the moment, so I couldn’t devote whole days to this. We had nine out of the Twelve Lordly Guardians to go, not to mention a few other people I hoped to talk to. At the very least, Dr. Ciel wanted an audience with Apito; I guess it was eager to tinker with her skills, too. I wasn’t sure if being so devoted to its own desires was such a good thing, but I couldn’t deny that it’d probably help us all out.</p>
<p>There was no reason to say no, so I’d be pretty occupied tomorrow. Ciel wanted to do the same with Shuna, so we arranged for that. I told Diablo and Shion that I’d see them later, so hopefully I could be efficient with things the next day.</p>
<p>Masayuki and his friends were a concern of mine, but it sounded like they were kind of caught up in lengthy meetings as well. I received a terse report from them, and honestly, I wasn’t sure if I should intervene. Until Masayuki and the Empire officials talked things over, at least, I would merely observe instead of butting in.</p>
<p>Of course, I was also having trouble relaxing because Velgrynd was still around. Floor 70 was a little hard for most people to set foot in these days. Veldora had quickly fled into his own chambers, too, which made me nervous. She and I hadn’t been separate for that long, yet I couldn’t help but wonder what kind of experience she was getting down there…but I’d have to wait for her to reach out.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I had to do what I was capable of.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt someone’s presence. Ranga was watching me, his head fully popped out from my shadow.</p>
<p>“Whoa! You scared me! Great to see you woke up, Ranga!”</p>
<p><a id="page-157"></a>I was happy enough that I switched to human form and gave him some scratches on his head and ears. He responded with a happy, yet saddened sort of look, ears kept down.</p>
<p>“What’s up? Not feeling well?”</p>
<p>I worried that the evolution had gone awry somehow. But it wasn’t that.</p>
<p>“My master, I fear I have overslept and missed the entire war…”</p>
<p>Ah. He was just moping, then.</p>
<p>“Oh, is <em>that</em> it? It’s no big deal!”</p>
<p>“You say that, master, but thanks to me, Gobta and the others lost their chance to contribute as well, did they not?”</p>
<p>He was right, but what do you want? If he was safely through his evolution, he could kick ass for us later on and it’d all be good.</p>
<p>“Gobta and his team were helping serve tables and entertain people at the parties. Nobody voiced a word of complaint about you, Ranga. So don’t worry about it!”</p>
<p>“It is deeply touching to hear that from you, my master.”</p>
<p>With a whine, Ranga extracted himself fully from my shadow and rubbed up against me. I gave him some more scratches; it was my first chance to experience all his fluff in a while, and I was happy for it.</p>
<p>But back to business. Since he’s here, let’s check him out.</p>
<div class="top-1">
<p class="ul-list">Name: Ranga (EP: 4,340,084)</p>
<p class="ul-list">Race: God-wolf; high-level chaos elemental Windsoul Wolf</p>
<p class="ul-list">Protection: Rimuru’s protection</p>
<p class="ul-list">Title: Star Lord</p>
<p class="ul-list">Magic: Windsoul magic</p>
<p class="ul-list">Ability: Ultimate skill Hastur, Lord of Starwind</p>
<p class="ul-list">Tolerances: Cancel Melee Attack, Cancel Natural Elements, Cancel Ailments, Resist Spiritual Attack, Resist Chaos Attack</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">Oh, Ranga’s race went all divine, too, huh? And, like, he looked a lot stronger than, say, a local god worshipped by some tiny backwater. This wasn’t a problem, was it? I suppose Soei would be treated as a kind of supporting god to Benimaru, but I guess once your EP passes two million, you take on divine properties. I couldn’t be sure of it, but that’s what it felt like.</p>
