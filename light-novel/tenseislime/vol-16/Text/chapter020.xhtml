<p class="space-break1s0"><em><a id="page-159"></a>We will need to collect more sample data, but it seems like a valid assumption.</em></p>
<p>Right. You become a Saint upon reaching one million, so maybe two million was the magic number for demigod-hood? Taking on divinity didn’t make you a de facto “god,” really. You weren’t omnipotent or anything, but you’d be seen as a symbol of strength, at least.</p>
<p>And, sheesh, Ranga was past <em>four</em> million. That was, like, equivalent to a swordless Benimaru. What a fearsome evolution he’d had.</p>
<p>“Wow, Ranga! Great job!”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! It is all thanks to you, my master!”</p>
<p>He chalked it up to constantly being in the presence of my aura. Staying in my shadow and absorbing all those magicules must have streamlined the evolution one heck of a lot.</p>
<p>And look at all the amazing abilities he got out of nowhere! The ultimate skill Hastur wound up being scored by Ranga in the end, not Veldora. And if I had to guess…</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Correct. I lent a little bit of a hand.</em></p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a “gift,” so I understood that Ranga had earned it himself, but there was no way Ciel didn’t offer a helping hand. The ability suited him fine, at least, so I had no complaints.</p>
<p>This skill included seven abilities: Hasten Thought, Universal Detect, Lord’s Ambition, Dominate Weather, Dominate Sound &amp; Wind, Dominate Space, and Multilayer Barrier. Being able to control weather itself said everything you needed to know about how amazing this was, I thought. Truly a skill befitting Ranga. Now my only worry was whether Gobta could make full use out of the guy.</p>

<p class="tx1">It was time to go back to work. I spent the night hanging out and playing with Ranga, but I was feeling just fine.</p>
<p><a id="page-160"></a>My first visitor was Kumara, and these were her first words after we said hello:</p>
<p>“I heard you were making adjustments to our skills? Sir Ranga was bragging about it to me earlier. If you have new abilities to provide me, I’d love to have them!”</p>
<p>She was in her little-girl form, looking as cute as possible while wheedling me. Ranga had earned his skill himself, but I guess he was aggrandizing my role in it. I really thought he should be more proud of himself than me, but for reasons I didn’t quite understand, Ranga emphasized my involvement in it most of all. It was all Ciel, actually, but that was a secret, so I just gave Kumara a vague nod.</p>
<p>So now what?</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>I’ll allow it.</em></p>
<p>I thought it’d say that. Ciel had no interest in holding back, I knew, and I hated to leave everything to it…but I knew we still had enemies in this world, and we needed to get as prepared as we could.</p>
<p>“All right. A lot of it will depend on you, but let’s see what we have here.”</p>
<p>Ciel couldn’t make the impossible possible, after all. If there wasn’t a skill compatible with her, I’d have nothing to provide. Once I made that clear with her and she agreed to it, I passed the baton over to Ciel.</p>
<div class="top-1">
<p class="ul-list">Name: Kumara (EP: 1,899,944)</p>
<p class="ul-list">Race: Nine-tail; high-level chaos elemental Earthsoul Beast</p>
<p class="ul-list">Protection: Rimuru’s protection</p>
<p class="ul-list">Title: Chimera Lord</p>
<p class="ul-list">Magic: Earthsoul magic</p>
<p class="ul-list">Ability: Ultimate gift Bahamut, Lord of Fantastic Beasts</p>
<p class="ul-list">Intrinsic skills: Dominate Beast, Unite Beast</p>
<p class="ul-list">Tolerances: Cancel Melee Attack, Cancel Ailments, Resist Natural Elements, Resist Spiritual Attack, Resist Chaos Attack</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">It took some time, but we were successful.</p>
<p>Kumara obtained the ultimate gift Bahamut, Lord of Fantastic <a id="page-161"></a>Beasts. This includes six abilities: Hasten Thought, Universal Detect, Lord’s Ambition, Dominate Gravity, Dominate Space, and Multilayer Barrier. That let her interact with the planets themselves, giving her control of gravity over a wide range.</p>
<p>And Kumara herself had changed races from Nine-Head to nine-tail. It sounded kind of like a downgrade, but it wasn’t. She previously held sway over eight magical beasts, but now there was only one head controlling them—she held complete command over the menagerie. As before, eight out of her nine tails contained the will of a beast, so Kumara could also order them to act freely as well.</p>
<p>Once she did, they would separate from her. Each of them had an EP count of around 200,000, but Kumara still kept her count at more than a million afterward. This wasn’t a miscalculation; it just kind of worked this way. They were more than doubling their EP once they separated from her, which was clearly a pretty beefy upgrade.</p>
<p>Kumara’s new race didn’t have divine elements to it, but her EP was close to two million with no extra gear, so I bet she could make the leap before too long. Her element was earth, like Geld, and she was a half-spiritual Earthsoul Beast, so gravity was a good match for her.</p>
<p class="space-break">Looking solely at the stats, Kumara—when combined with all her beasts—was close to the upper echelon of the Twelve Lordly Guardians. Sadly, however, she continued to lack experience. Soei would still beat her, but maybe she stood a chance against Adalmann or Gabil? She clearly had some disturbing potential, though, making her one of our best prospects. She was still young, after all. <em>Let’s see how she grows.</em></p>

<p class="tx1">My next visitors were Apito and Zegion, arriving as a pair. Apito came into my chamber first, leaving Zegion waiting in the hallway. I didn’t mind having both of them in at once, but they were all about sticking to the “one-on-one interview” script, so I respected Zegion’s wishes.</p>
<p><a id="page-162"></a>The moment we were seated, Apito gave me a small gift-wrapped box. “I have some freshly harvested honey for you, Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“Oh, how kind! Thanks!”</p>
<p>I smiled warmly. <em>Her</em> honey was a panacea, and even better, it tasted astonishingly good. The way I had immediately brought Milim under my thumb with just one taste was now a famous story among my companions. Real popular stuff. I was laughing heartily over the memory as I put the box in my pocket. I can’t be bought with a bribe, mind you, but I <em>did</em> want to pay Apito back for the favor.</p>
<p>Speaking of Apito, here was her current status:</p>
<div class="top-1">
<p class="ul-list">Name: Apito (EP: 775,537)</p>
<p class="ul-list">Race: Star wasp; mid-level chaos elemental Windsoul Wasp</p>
<p class="ul-list">Protection: Zegion’s protection</p>
<p class="ul-list">Title: Insect Queen</p>
<p class="ul-list">Ability: Unique skill Motherly Queen</p>
<p class="ul-list">Tolerances: Cancel Pain, Resist Melee Attack, Resist Natural Elements, Resist Ailments, Resist Spiritual Attack</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">If you asked a typical adventurer to take down a bug like this, they’d think you were stark raving mad.</p>
<p>Apito’s on-the-field strength was well beyond that of the old-school demon lords. She couldn’t quite reach the Special S ranking we defined here in Tempest, but she seemed stronger than the pseudo-awakened Clayman I saw. What’s more, Apito claimed that Motherly Queen allowed her to give birth to a total of nine insectors. They were still in pupae form at the moment, but it looked like they’d be pretty powerful magic-born once they matured.</p>
<p>“Well, we should hold a celebration for them, then!”</p>
<p>“I would be happy to attend! And I hope you will bestow names upon them as well.”</p>
<p><em>Names, huh? Hmm.</em></p>
<p>“Mm, yes…”</p>
<p>I tried to change the subject, not wanting to commit myself to anything yet. A name could be a dangerous thing for me to give…</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em><a id="page-163"></a>That will not be a problem. I have gained the ability to fully control the procedure with no danger to you.</em></p>
<p>You <em>“gained”</em> it…? Well, I guess that was how it worked with Charys, so whatever. I was hoping to avoid having to name nine at once, but if that’s the way it is…</p>
<p>“Okay, how about…Zero-One, Reiji, Remi, Reyon, Rego, Remu, Rena, Reppa, and Rekku?”</p>
<p>Please don’t accuse me of laziness here. I knew this was little more than starting with “re,” then going down the Japanese names for numbers, but she’d have to be satisfied with that. I didn’t even know what gender they’d be yet. Once they were born, I’d pass out the names as appropriate, I suppose.</p>
<p>“Goodness! My children can feel the affection you have for them already. They’re all delighted!”</p>
<p>“Um, they are?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. My children and I are linked in our minds by powerful bonds.”</p>
<p>This was Dominate Insect in action, the skill that let Apito give orders to the children she produced, and the speed of these transmissions was apparently instantaneous. Unlike the more general-purpose Thought Communication, the links also made it clear who was giving the orders and who was taking them.</p>
<p>That sounded neat to me…but Ciel sure had been griping at me a lot the past few moments. What was up with that?</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>How upsetting. All I’m asking for is permission to run Ability Adjust.</em></p>
<p>You guessed it—Ciel was itching to dive into Apito’s skill set, too. I was sure it could just do it anyway without my or Apito’s permission, though. If I was connected to someone via a soul corridor, I kept the right to as leader, after all. But this wasn’t some kind of urgent crisis. We were at peace, and Dr. Ciel was kind enough not to act out of line without my okay. (Apito was also in Zegion’s family <a id="page-164"></a>line, which made me more of a distant relation by comparison. I figured getting her position would make things easier, given our weaker link.)</p>
<p>So, knowing full well what the answer would be, I posed the question.</p>
<p>“By the way, Apito, if you’re interested, I’d like to readjust the future direction of your skills, but what do you think?”</p>
<p>“How do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well, I was told that—er, I <em>mean</em>, I can see that your skill set has the potential to be further evolved. You could become a commander type, leading the insects as you do now and directing your clan in battle…or you could become a champion type, leading them yourself into the fray. The difference between the two is simply that you can continue spawning new follower insects as a commander, but not as a champion. On the other hand, being a champion would boost your physical abilities, and your skills would be geared more toward battle as well.”</p>
<p>I parroted out everything Dr. Ciel had told me. That’s when I realized why Ciel didn’t just do it—there were two distinct possibilities to choose from, and Apito had the choice. If it wasn’t her call, her skills would never unlock their full potential.</p>
<p>“That,” I added, “and you have the option to stay as you are, of course.”</p>
<p>“If I chose champion-type,” Apito immediately responded, “that means I would never bear children again?”</p>
<p><em>Does it?</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>The Birth Insect ability of Motherly Queen would be lost, but her non-skill-based reproductive ability would be retained. She could still give birth to successors.</em></p>
<p>“No, I think you’d be able to have kids like normal. You’ll just have to do it the traditional, no-skill way.”</p>
<p>“I see… In that case, I have nothing to worry about. My children have obtained the Birth Kinfolk skill, so as queen of my army, I can have them create as many troops as I desire.”</p>
<p>Ah, so Apito’s already given part of her skills to her kin? In that case…</p>
<p><a id="page-165"></a>“Therefore, I think I would like to stand on the front lines myself!”</p>
<p>She made exactly the declaration I’d thought she would. And Ciel, eagerly awaiting this moment, sprang into action.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Apito’s Ability Adjust is successful. Her unique skill Motherly Queen is being evolved into the ultimate skill Proserpine.</em></p>
<p>It was over in a moment. The whole thing didn’t take a second—I guess Ciel had everything analyzed in advance.</p>
<p>“Okay, it’s fine. Now your job’s to check over everything and make sure you can use it to the hilt.”</p>
<p>The ultimate skill Proserpine featured abilities like Hasten Thought, Magic Sense, Keen Sense, Dominate Insect, Army Command, Ultraspeed Action, Lethal Attack, Control Space, and Multilayer Barrier. These were just boosted versions of powers she already had, so I was sure Apito was comfortable with them. I was sure she’d train all of them without my ordering her to, but I gave her that piece of advice anyway.</p>
<p>“I am filled with elation and gratitude. With this sheer joy in my heart, I once again declare my exclusive loyalty to you, Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>Apito kneeled on the floor. I gave her the most fatherly nod I could, and our interview came to a close.</p>

<p class="tx1">So she left, and Zegion came in. He humbly picked a wooden chair to sit on, rather than my guest sofa. The strongest dude in the whole labyrinth, but he was so polite and thoughtful as well—I guess his exoskeleton would scratch up the leather, so that’s why he’d made that move. How refined.</p>
<p>I have to say, though, Zegion did an incredible job for us. Powerful beyond measure, he could’ve formed a twin barrier with Diablo even before being evolved. He was already a level above the rest of the Twelve Lordly Guardians, and this new evolution only added to that. In fact, looking at the labyrinth archives, he’d defeated Deeno without even revealing his full abilities. Scary kid. Honestly, I’m glad he’s on our side.</p>
<p><a id="page-166"></a>“Zegion, you performed brilliantly for us. If you hadn’t woken up in time, I’m not sure how it would’ve turned out.”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t be silly. You no doubt calculated the exact time I would awaken, didn’t you, Sir Rimuru?”</p>
<p><em>Yeah, sure I did!</em></p>
<p>“Not really, no. I did suspect Deeno of wrongdoing, yes, but I didn’t think he’d take action just when we were the most lightly guarded.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… And that’s why you had me wake up exactly when things would come to a head, then?”</p>
<p>No, man, I didn’t think <em>any</em> of that would happen! Like, I didn’t even know Velgrynd was there—like, I <em>did</em>, but I wasn’t expecting her to enter the scene the way she did. If I knew <em>that</em>, I never would’ve thought about taking my inner circle to go talk with the emperor. That choice had us playing catch-up this entire war, and we emerged with the win only because luck was on our side. But no matter how I explained matters to him, Zegion thought everything was part of my so-called brilliant plan.</p>
<p>I quickly gave up on convincing him otherwise.</p>
<p>“Either way, thanks for being there. You helped a lot.”</p>
<p>“No, no, I still have so far to go. I am sure, Sir Rimuru, you could have finished Deeno with a single trans-dimensional attack without my entering the scene at all. But you provided me with a stage to perform on nonetheless, and I answered the call for you.”</p>
<p><em>What are you</em> talking <em>about?</em> “Trans-dimensional”<em>? What? I can’t do</em> that<em>, dude… I mean, what kind of monster am I in his mind anyway?</em></p>
<p>“Uh, sure. Yeah…um, maybe I could have, yes.”</p>
<p>“Ha! It would have been child’s play for you, I am sure.”</p>
<p>Zegion eagerly agreed with my half-hearted reply. I felt like he looked at me with much more than mere respect—to him, it was like getting a personal audience with his god. Not that I could really tell, given his compound eyes and all, but it was easy to imagine.</p>
<p>Gathering myself, I continued with Zegion’s interview. He gave me his interpretation of the fight against Deeno, and while I thought Deeno had gotten away scot-free from them, it turned out that wasn’t the case. Zegion assumed he’d try to flee, and so he placed a curse on <a id="page-167"></a>him—a scary curse, one that had life-and-death power over the guy. So <em>that’s</em> what Zegion could do now? How did he evolve, exactly?</p>
<div class="top-1">
<p class="ul-list">Name: Zegion (EP: 4,988,856)</p>
<p class="ul-list">Race: Micro-god; high-level chaos elemental Watersoul Insect</p>
<p class="ul-list">Protection: Rimuru’s protection</p>
<p class="ul-list">Title: Mist Lord</p>
<p class="ul-list">Magic: Watersoul magic</p>
<p class="ul-list">Ability: Ultimate skill Mephisto, Lord of Illusion</p>
<p class="ul-list">Tolerances: Cancel Melee Attack, Cancel Ailments, Cancel Spiritual Attack, Cancel Natural Elements, Resist Chaos Attack</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break"><em>Hwuh?!</em></p>
<p>I kept myself from yelping out loud.</p>
<p>The stats Ciel read out for me were far beyond my imagination. Zegion was now divine in nature, and I could see why. His existence points were a hair away from five million, a shocking figure second only to Benimaru. His element was water, but Ciel informed me he could wield the “space” element as well. As a half-spiritual life-form, he had every resistance you could think of; I saw zero weak points, and he was high-level in all of them as well. A real powerhouse.</p>
<p>It seemed that Zegion could construct a placeholder body for himself by gathering and condensing the water particles in the air. The magisteel I gave him had evolved to adamantite, then Crimson Steel, and it was that fantastical metal that had let him pull off that trick. I’m sure he stuck to his exoskeleton by default because that’s the form I crafted for him. Otherwise, he might’ve shown it off long ago and ascended to a completely spiritual life-form.</p>
<p>He obviously had a great fondness for his current body, and I couldn’t be happier to see that. Plus, given how he was geared for close-quarters combat, he was more than strong enough as he stood now. After all, that combat style wouldn’t work if he went fully spiritual and shed his physical body. In fact, his current form was about as complete as it needed to be, wasn’t it?</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em><a id="page-168"></a>Exactly! This Zegion is our greatest masterpiece, as crafted by myself and my master! I allowed Veldora to lead the project, but I guided him with my knowledge in key sections, so there is nothing to worry about.</em></p>
<p>Um? I’m not sure I understood all of that. Not that Ciel cared, bragging away as it was.</p>
<p>Zegion held rule over water, which meant he boasted unparalleled strength wherever water was present. This included the water vapor in the atmosphere, which meant he held a battle advantage well near anywhere on the planet that contained air. Water composes a hefty percentage of most living creatures, too, and Zegion could freely manipulate that as well. I thought that made it clear how much of a bad dude he was now. The human body’s around 65 percent water, in fact, and any human trying to take Zegion on was basically committing suicide.</p>
<p>But that was only the beginning of the danger he posed. Zegion’s ultimate skill Mephisto included a wealth of high-level skills, such as Hasten Thought, Universal Detect, Lord’s Ambition, Dominate Water &amp; Lightning, Dominate Dimensions, Multidimensional Barrier, All of Creation, Spiritual Domination, and Fantastical World.</p>
<p>Quite a few of those were fearsomely lethal, but nothing on that list had caused the curse placed on Deeno. That was the work of something called Dream End—the curse was an Art woven by Zegion himself, not any skill. That meant it’d even work against Yuuki’s Anti-Skill. Fending it off required a powerful will, and I doubted anyone could out-will Zegion right now.</p>
<p>Anti-Skill, after all, was a technique driven by three separate abilities—Dominate Water &amp; Lightning, Dominate Spirit, and Fantastical World. He’d use Fantastical World to create an environment favorable to him, a place where he was all but invincible. This was a world-type ability, Ciel told me, and those were exceedingly rare. Not even I had one, and I bet they’re pretty neat things to have.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Would you like me to set one up?</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-169"></a>…</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what the correct answer was, so I pretended not to hear it.</p>
<p>But back to Dream End. This move made it possible for the caster to immediately snuff out the life of the target whenever they did something the caster didn’t want. It couldn’t forcibly restrict the target’s movements, however, so it wouldn’t take effect until their behavior triggered it. In this case, Deeno was free to do whatever, as long as he didn’t defy Zegion’s will.</p>
<p>“So how do you trigger this curse?”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t have to do anything. The moment Deeno takes a certain predefined action, it will automatically go off.”</p>
<p>Zegion’s curse was the automatic type, requiring no supervision. If triggered, he’d be made aware of it, but otherwise he never even had to think about it. The key to it all lay in what Deeno did. What was the trigger? Basically, if he ever showed the intent to kill any of my companions, the curse would go off. The moment he committed to murdering any of them, it would destroy his very heart core, and not even a spiritual life-form could escape that trap.</p>
<p>Now, this wasn’t foolproof. It wasn’t like I remembered the name and face of every single citizen of Tempest. But if he tried some large-scale, indiscriminate attack on the city, that’d be treated as “murderous intent,” and I think that worked well enough as a check on Deeno. I was amazed we could restrain someone with an ultimate skill like that.</p>
<p>“Wonderful work, Zegion. Anything that reduces the threat to our nation is more than welcome.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate the compliment, my lord. I still have much to learn, but nothing warms my soul more than receiving such kind words from you.”</p>
<p>Geez. So <em>serious</em>. Him, Charys, Geld, and Soei. Beretta too, I suppose. I guess I had a lot of all-business types in my crew, but Geld and Zegion really took the cake. Guys with so much talent like that, never resting on their laurels, constantly putting in hard effort…and that’s why they became such a threat with every new breakthrough <a id="page-170"></a>they made. I hoped they’d continue that pursuit for a long while to come.</p>
<p class="space-break">So, to sum up, Mephisto was one firecracker of an ultimate skill.</p>
<p>Deeno had no way to undo the curse on himself, I was assured, but you could never say never in this world. Maybe he had some unknown ability that’d let him slip out of it like a loosely knotted rope. But even if he did, that wouldn’t harm Zegion’s rep at all—it’d just mean we were dealing with a shrewd enemy.</p>
<p>Because, honestly, Zegion was the best all-around package I could think of. He took advantage of the brief moment Deeno was dead to place that curse on him, and I thought that was where his <em>real</em> scary genius lay. Having fancy-pants skills isn’t a threat—being able to fully leverage them is, and along those lines, I didn’t think anyone was better geared for battle and more attuned to his skills than Zegion.</p>
<p>Maybe call it covering all the bases? Many people in this world boasted skills that boosted their already extensive abilities, but Zegion’s skill set was more about covering for what he wasn’t intrinsically good at. He could use all of them well, even working them into new, original moves. Amazing. What else could I say? The battle sense he had and the level of training it took. He could bust out Fantastical World, create an advantage, and expand his tactical edge rather than boost what he was already great at. Truly top-class among my companions.</p>
<p>I realized now that not even a so-called fighting race like the Primal Demons could beat Zegion. He was just so <em>fearsome</em>. No wonder Ciel called this its masterpiece. Even the strength he showed off up to now was no doubt just a tiny glimpse into everything he had. I suppose it’s a little unfair of me, though, getting to check on all my team’s stats and abilities, but still.</p>
<p>I had given Zegion the fairly generic name “Mist Lord,” but now I could see a double meaning there. Besides “mist,” there was also quite a bit “mysterious” about the depth of his abilities. Or maybe Zegion took “mist” literally and steered his skills in that water-oriented direction? No way. Dr. Ciel would’ve said so if he did. Right?</p>
<p class="space-break1s">…Of course!</p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-171"></a><em>Oh, great!</em></p>
<p>That slight delay in the response worried me a lot.</p>

<p class="tx1">Hiding the concerns in my mind that Ciel was going off-kilter on me, I waited for my next interviewee. Adalmann was the next person in my chamber.</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru, I hope you are well. And let me tell you that I, Adalmann, am cherishing every moment of this private audience with you already!”</p>
<p>Adalmann was something beyond serious. I just nodded and motioned him toward my sofa. If I didn’t make him wrap up his spiel fast, he’d be at it all day, so I sat him down as quickly as I could.</p>
<p>“So how are you feeling now that you’re awake?”</p>
<p>“Excellent, sir! My spirit feels enriched, and I can feel holy force penetrating every pore of my body.”</p>

<p class="space-break">Thought so. Here he was, this servant of the dead, and he’d gone all in on the <em>light</em> element. If I had to name the one person on my team who looked the most like a demon lord, it’d have to be Adalmann. Seeing him boast the light element was almost too sweetly ironic. Still, given that he could use Holy-Evil Inversion to twist his elements any way he wanted, maybe it wasn’t worth being surprised about at <a id="page-172"></a>that point. It felt like the exact opposite from the element he <em>should</em> have, but no point fretting about it.</p>
<p>There was a lot of other stuff about him to occupy my attention anyway. He had the existence points of an awakened demon lord; his stats were so ridiculous that I was getting a headache just looking at them. But the biggest issue was Necronomicon, his ultimate skill. Where did it even <em>come</em> from?</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>I gave it to him.</em></p>
<p>I didn’t need to ask. I couldn’t think of any other explanation, but yes, Ciel was fiddling around again.</p>
<p>“And the best thing of all is Necronomicon, this power you gave me,” Adalmann happily noted. “It is a font of knowledge for me, the very root of my newfound strength.”</p>
<p>Necronomicon included a bevy of abilities—Hasten Thought, Universal Detect, Lord’s Ambition, Cast Cancel, Analyze and Assess, All of Creation, Mental Strike, Holy-Evil Inversion, and Dominate Dead. In addition to things he already had, he could now also invoke necromancy and holy magic with no casting time required. In addition, his rule and protection over the dead had been boosted, giving his armies a jolt of additional force.</p>
<p>Adalmann was gleefully explaining all of this to me now, and if he was happy about it, so was I. I didn’t want to rain on his parade.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>By the way, Necronomicon is in the same family as Grimoire, the skill I gave to Gadora. I removed the items unsuited for Adalmann from Grimoire and added abilities he would find more useful.</em></p>
<p>Ciel sounded like it was fishing for compliments. That was the first I’d heard about it giving Gadora any new abilities. Amazing, certainly, but I wasn’t sure I welcomed this news.</p>
<p>Clearing my mind for a moment, though, I recalled that Adalmann and Gadora were both researcher types. They were close friends as well, I’d heard, and they’d often go diving into magic tomes together. They were magic-obsessed maniacs, really, but they weren’t hurting <a id="page-173"></a>anyone, so I let them do as they pleased. They might discover the meaning of life or something for all I knew, and devoting yourself to your passions is never a bad thing.</p>
<p>As Ciel put it, Necronomicon and Grimoire were natural complements to each other. They certainly seemed to suit those two well, and yeah, I guess this was the right move to make.</p>
<p class="space-break">That was the end of Adalmann’s interview, and now I was headed down to see how Alberto and Venti were doing. They were so awed by the idea of meeting with me that they’d initially turned down the request—apparently they needed to prove themselves more in battle before they’d feel deserving of the chance. It was beyond dedicated of them; in fact, I couldn’t understand the logic at all. Who did they think I was anyway?</p>
<p>Still, I had to check up on the people serving me. Alberto was Adalmann’s dedicated servant, and so was Venti—or call her Adalmann’s pet, if you like. If their master ever died, they’d probably take the ride with him—but as long as Adalmann was all right, they were immortal.</p>
<p>That, Ciel told me, was why it had granted both of them an ultimate skill.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>It took a lot of work.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m sure it did. But it’s your hobby, right?</em></p>
<p>No doubt this was just Ciel’s gentle personality manifesting itself.</p>
<p>Trusting in that, I looked over the stat reports.</p>
<div class="top-1">
<p class="ul-list">Name: Alberto (EP: 682,639 + 600,000 for his Spirit Sword)</p>
<p class="ul-list">Race: Wight; mid-level chaos elemental Flamesoul Man</p>
<p class="ul-list">Protection: Rimuru’s protection</p>
<p class="ul-list">Title: Gehenna Paladin</p>
<p class="ul-list">Ability: Ultimate gift Immortality</p>
<p class="ul-list">Tolerances: Cancel Melee Attack, Cancel Spiritual Attack, Cancel Ailments, Cancel Natural Elements, Resist Chaos Attack</p>
</div>
<div class="top-1">
<p class="ul-list"><a id="page-174"></a>Name: Venti (EP: 984,142)</p>
<p class="ul-list">Race: Gehenna Dragon</p>
<p class="ul-list">Protection: Rimuru’s protection</p>
<p class="ul-list">Title: Dragon Lord of the Underworld</p>
<p class="ul-list">Ability: Ultimate gift Eternality</p>
<p class="ul-list">Tolerances: Cancel Melee Attack, Cancel Spiritual Attack, Cancel Ailments, Cancel Natural Elements, Resist Chaos Attack</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">The effects of their evolutions certainly goosed their EP. They also canceled a lot of attacks now; their resistances were looking real sharp. It worked that way for Adalmann as well, so I guess dying once could earn you a bunch of those.</p>
<p>The ultimate gifts they had were largely identical, despite having different names. It included the three abilities Hasten Thought, Full Reincarnation, and Servant Immortality—there was room for more, but Ciel told me it was still considering the options. I still wasn’t completely thrilled about giving Ciel carte blanche, but I was reasonably certain it wasn’t the wrong move to make.</p>
<p>Alberto’s and Venti’s bodies would never perish, because their souls were in Adalmann’s possession. I’d had a hunch they’d kick it if Adalmann did, and I was right—but given Adalmann’s undead status, they all seemed pretty invincible to me. I couldn’t help but wonder how unfair a team I had.</p>
<p>Alberto, by the way, still had a lot of room to grow. A weapon that broke a million EP was firmly in the God class, so if Alberto’s own EP kept rising, that’d open him up to more capabilities. Given how handy he was with a blade, I didn’t think we’d have to wait too long—and it was with great anticipation for the future that I saw Adalmann off.</p>

<p class="tx1">After lunch, I went back to the interviews. At long last, it was Shion’s turn.</p>
<p>“Finally, Sir Rimuru, I am here! I am sorry it took this long!”</p>
<p>“Right,” I said, nodding. I wasn’t really waiting for her with bated breath, but I’d better not say that.</p>
<div class="top-1">
<p class="ul-list"><a id="page-175"></a>Name: Shion (EP: 4,229,140 + 1.08 million for her Goriki-maru Divine)</p>
<p class="ul-list">Race: Battle-god; high-level chaos elemental Battlesoul Ogre</p>
<p class="ul-list">Protection: Rimuru’s protection</p>
<p class="ul-list">Title: War Lord</p>
<p class="ul-list">Magic: Divine Battlewill</p>
<p class="ul-list">Ability: Unique skill Master Chef</p>
<p class="ul-list">Tolerances: Cancel Melee Attack, Cancel Ailments, Cancel Spiritual Attack, Cancel Natural Elements, Resist Chaos Attack</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">She proudly went over her new powers. Ciel was providing me a running explanation as well, but the two of them rarely agreed with each other.</p>
<p>Shion’s strength didn’t rely on skills. Her weapon was God-class, so she didn’t need an ultimate skill to hold her own against someone who did. Her body itself was a threat, and with Infinite Regeneration, that threat became a nightmare. You could try to drain her energy in a fight, but her EP was as out-of-the-park as Benimaru’s; that meant a huge number of magicules, so attempting to exhaust her was a bad idea. Her resistances were perfect as well, making a frontal onslaught your only option—and if <em>that’s</em> all her opponents could try, I really sympathized with them.</p>
<p>“You’ve gotten stronger, huh?”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee! I’m humbled to see you think so!”</p>
<p><em>“Humbled”</em> wasn’t the way I’d describe her abject joy. But it was the truth. Just one thing—considering all the ultimates my crew had now, I was kind of surprised Shion still had nothing but a unique skill.</p>
<p><em>Did she turn you down or something, Ciel?</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>No. Shion is still packed with untold potential, so I am carefully observing her for the time being. The unique skill Master Chef is incomparably powerful as it stands now, so there is no special need to do anything else right away.</em></p>
<p><em>Hmm, yeah, no doubt about that…</em></p>
<p>Lately, I thought I’d grown adept at reading Ciel’s emotions. It was <a id="page-176"></a>just a gut feeling, but it turned out accurate pretty often—and if I was reading Ciel correctly right now, I’d say it was hesitant about messing with Shion’s skills.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>…That is correct.</em></p>
<p>Wonders never cease around here.</p>
<p>I asked why, and Ciel reluctantly gave me the answer. Amazingly enough, if Shion’s skill was boosted any further, she might obtain abilities capable of killing even me. Ciel, seeing that as something to avoid, opted to shut off any further skill evolution on her instead. If a skill freak like Ciel opted for that, well, I guess this was no joke.</p>
<p>It was hard to picture Shion ever trying to hurt me, but giving her skills <em>that</em> scary gave me pause as well. I didn’t want to be saddled with problems like that, so I supported Ciel’s decision.</p>
<p class="space-break">After her stat check, I enjoyed chatting with Shion a while longer, listening to all her bragging and politely throwing in a “yes?” or “oh, neat” now and then. Shion had put in a stellar effort during our war against the imperial forces, and I thought it was nice to sit down from time to time and talk about things like this.</p>
<p>Looking back, I realized I was either angry or exasperated with Shion a lot of the time. I knew full well that she was always working hard, and the fruits of all that effort were starting to show up, but she really <em>did</em> have a penchant for going way overboard, so I couldn’t help but poke at her all the time. That’s why an occasional calm, pleasant conversation like this was nice, I thought.</p>
<p>So there I was, playing the father figure to Shion, when:</p>
<p>“…Oh, right! I had forgotten to mention this in my report, but I ran into Masayuki at the dining hall just now. He was looking rather downtrodden—”</p>
<p><em>…?!</em></p>
<p>“—and given how troubled he seemed, I advised him to talk things over with you soon, Sir Rimuru!”</p>
<p><em>Don’t act all smug about that, Shion!</em> There she goes, acting out of line <a id="page-177"></a>again…and if Masayuki was in trouble, I knew I didn’t want to get too involved with it, either…</p>
<p>But this was exactly it! She was always butting in where she shouldn’t, and I paid for it in the end. I <em>hated</em> being dragged into stuff like this. Like, Velgrynd showing up here after she vanished was enough of a surprise, but really, if you sat down and thought about it, she had no reason to be there, did she? She was just crossing dimensions in pursuit of Ludora—she had only one person waiting for her.</p>
<p><em>And, ugh, Masayuki looks identical to Ludora, too…</em></p>
<p>It didn’t take a genius to connect the dots at this point. But even though I had, I couldn’t betray the trust Shion had in me.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to work out a time, then.”</p>
<p>I was just delaying the inevitable, but I said it anyway.</p>
<p>“Oh, all set there,” Shion told me matter-of-factly. “I set up a meeting first thing tomorrow morning!”</p>
<p><em>Well,</em> I’m <em>not all set in the slightest! You want to stage a full meeting before we’ve even prepared for it?</em></p>
<p>Now this was getting blown way out of proportion. These sorts of problems always happened when Shion played intermediary. You could never let your guard down around her.</p>
<p>But who was even gonna join this meeting? I was in the midst of my man-to-man interviews, and <em>now</em> look at what had happened. I still had all the demons to meet with; if I didn’t finish things up today, we’d have to postpone it for some other day that may never come. Would that anger them? Or drive them to violence? I just didn’t know.</p>
<p>“All right. In that case, tell Rigurd and Benimaru to be fully prepared for the meeting!”</p>
<p>“Very well. I’ll be on my way, then!”</p>
<p>Shion all but skipped out of my chambers. Bringing a head to my hand, I hurriedly called for Diablo and his cohorts.</p>

<p class="tx1">The last people on the interview list were Diablo, Testarossa, Carrera, Ultima, and their underlings. I wasn’t sure I’d get to them all, so I wanted to speed things up—but this turned out to be dangerous.</p>
<p><a id="page-178"></a>“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh… I’m finally up, am I? You have no idea how long this wait has felt to me.”</p>
<p><em>Way to exaggerate.</em> I had booted him out of my office yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>“Quit acting stupid, Diablo! We still haven’t settled our score, so it oughtta be fine for me to see Sir Rimuru first!”</p>
<p>Carrera, looking pretty beaten up and ragged, was at Diablo’s throat, with Ultima not far behind.</p>
<p>“She’s right! I haven’t thrown in the towel yet, either, y’know. Don’t think you can weasel your way out of this!”</p>
<p>Ultima, too, was so hurt that I was amazed she could stand up. Wasn’t their clothing part of their bodies, technically? If they were <em>this</em> ripped up and they didn’t have the energy to restore them, it had to be a pretty serious injury, right? But they were still cheerfully bickering with one another. Demons really <em>are</em> built tough.</p>
<p>“Enough of this. Arguing in front of Sir Rimuru is simply rude.”</p>
<p>Testarossa finally intervened, bringing some much-needed quiet to the room. She acted so elegantly, ignoring the three quarreling demons and even providing some tea for me. Her outfit was in perfect order as well, presenting a kind of dignity that was otherwise absent.</p>
<p>“Now, Sir Rimuru, we were told that you’d fire Diablo and name one of us as your second secretary…but sadly, we have not completed the selection process yet. What do you think we should do?”</p>
<p>I <em>really</em> don’t think I said that. Maybe leaving the demons for last was an error on my part. I now had extra work coming up thanks to Shion, but even before that, I still needed to report to King Gazel. Looking back, I should’ve tackled my thorniest problems first, but it was far too late now. I was short on time, so let’s exercise some of my soft power to get through this.</p>
<p>“Well, I hate to say this, but I’ve run out of time for a long conversation with you guys. I gotta call all your servants in, too—”</p>
<p>“No need for that, my lord.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I don’t think you have to. It’d just go to waste on them.”</p>
<p>“Right? If you want information about our underlings, I’ll give you whatever you need!”</p>
<p>“Exactly. And no servant of <em>mine</em> is foolish enough to try butting into the precious time you’ve devoted to us, Sir Rimuru.”</p>
