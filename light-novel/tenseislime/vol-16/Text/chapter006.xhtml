<p>But even so…</p>
<p>Deeno casually brought his sword down in an arc. Beretta immediately crouched forward to dodge it. Being unnamed wasn’t a disadvantage per se, but in this battle, it perhaps wasn’t the best bet for him. His EP was a bit over 400,000, which <em>would</em> have made him even with Deeno at one point, but if his opponent had a God-class weapon, he was hopelessly outclassed.</p>
<p>So the empty-handed Beretta focused on dodging, avoiding Deeno’s frontal sword attacks. If he took the brunt of that blade, he would instantly be destroyed. And if worse came to worst…</p>
<p>“Sir Deeno’s existence points have ballooned from four hundred thousand to two million! The combined total is three million… It’s overwhelming…!”</p>
<p>Alpha sounded like all hope was lost. But Beretta wasn’t shaken. Neither was Ramiris, who acted like this much was obvious.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how you did it, but you’re tricking the EP measuring device, huh? Guess there’s still some work left to be done on it. Regardless, Alpha, you don’t have to go calling Deeno ‘sir,’ treating him like royalty or anything.”</p>
<p>“What? Hey! I <em>am</em> a demon lord, aren’t I?”</p>
<p>“Oh, shut it! Beretta, no need to hold anything back—give ’im a dose of your full powers and grant him the divine punishment he so desperately yearns for!”</p>
<p>“I don’t have the power to give divine justice, but if those are your orders, I will fulfill them as best I can.”</p>
<p><em>Long-suffering</em> couldn’t even begin to describe Beretta by this point. One’s existence point count was just a yardstick, but facing down someone whose EP was seven times yours wasn’t exactly reassuring. He thought to himself how ridiculous this was as he sized up Deeno, figuring out a way he could satisfy his master.</p>
<p>“You got it tough, too, huh?”</p>
<p>“I don’t enjoy hearing that from my enemy, but I will not deny it, no.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Beretta danced around Deeno, evading any advance. His lack of defense wouldn’t matter if Deeno couldn’t hit him. It all came to how you thought about it, and Beretta was a living weapon, <a id="page-58"></a>head to toe. Fighting barehanded wasn’t a hindrance—in fact, it opened a variety of attack approaches to him. Deeno, meanwhile, was just lightly equipped, and only his large sword required any major attention. It’d pack a wallop if it hit him, but the same was true for anything Beretta unleashed. Thus, he had every opportunity to win—such were his thoughts as he awaited his chance.</p>
<p>As a chaos golem, transforming the elements he attacked with was child’s play to Beretta. He used the unique skill Reverser to constantly switch them around as he searched for a weak point on Deeno, calculating every move he made in order to secure an advantage. But Deeno wasn’t about to take this barrage sitting down.</p>
<p>“<em>Tsh</em>… Right, right, you come from the ‘dirty’ school of battle, don’t you? I heard no one was a tougher fighter once you got on your opponent’s nerves, and I gotta say, they’re right.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate the compliment.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t complimenting you!”</p>
<p>Beretta was even using conversation as a weapon as he attempted to turn the tables on his disadvantage. He had no time to waste. He may not have been panicking, but as things stood, it took everything he had to just barely maintain this détente.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">Deeno, meanwhile, had correctly surmised that he no longer held any great advantage. His attempted ambush had failed, and now he was paying for it with this pointless round of combat, completely wrecking his plans.</p>
<p>Beretta and Deeno were miles apart in terms of ability, but in terms of combat skill level, the difference wasn’t all that wide. Despite that, though, it was clear Beretta was near his limits. Here in Ramiris’s labyrinth, he could be resurrected as often as needed; he didn’t have to worry about running out of energy, and overloading himself power-wise wouldn’t cause him any damage. He could constantly fight all out with no restrictions, and that was the sole reason he could hold his own against Deeno. His environment was also protecting him, but that had its limits—he simply lacked the power needed to find a decisive edge.</p>
<p><a id="page-59"></a><em>Impressive, though</em>, Deeno thought. <em>No wonder he’s part of the black tribe. I didn’t think he would hold out this much.</em></p>
<p>Deeno had to revise his opinion of Beretta. If Charys and Treyni had stayed in this room, the battle would’ve ended with a lot less trouble—not that either of them were pushovers, but angels held an overwhelming advantage against spirits by default. Besides, the two sides’ battle experience were incomparable. As befitting his membership in the black tribe, Beretta had top-tier fighting skills—enough to take on Deeno, even. Beretta would die instantly if he took a hit, but he still had the courage to calmly handle Deeno’s strikes.</p>
<p>Not only had Beretta not given up on winning, he even seemed to enjoy this, in a way. Whenever Deeno deliberately let his guard down a bit, Beretta didn’t react at all. That was praiseworthy, but the fact that Beretta landed a cut or two on him with his occasional counterattacks was a major surprise. As a “fallen,” he was weak against the holy element, but that wasn’t a fatal flaw to him. And yet Beretta’s attacks were dealing actual damage. He was mixing the dark and holy elements with each other, transforming his attacks to where Deeno’s defensive barrier couldn’t block them fully. They were, Deeno realized, impossible to defend. Much like spirit-based attacks, they would always deal damage unless one could repel them spiritually.</p>
<p>Deeno was a former seraphim. He knew how things worked with this world. That’s why a mere unique skill causing damage to him was such a shock—and it was Beretta’s stunning sense for battle that deserved the most praise of all.</p>
<p>But now Deeno was growing used to those moves. His sword swings were leaving him more open than necessary, but he would accept that. The way Beretta was attacking every weakness he showed was unexpected but still within what he could handle. While it may have looked like Beretta was pushing him around—none of Deeno’s strikes was even scratching him—the Fangsmasher could easily slice through even an adamantite body. One clean hit would turn the tide, so to Deeno, this was no major concern whatsoever.</p>
<p>Beretta, perhaps realizing this, was focused entirely on stretching this out as long as possible. He was beefing up his defenses, apparently concluding that the “death by a thousand cuts” approach wouldn’t work.</p>
<p><a id="page-60"></a><em>He’s choosing the right tactic, though. After all, if Beretta keeps Ramiris protected, he wins.</em></p>
<p>Deeno was no fool. He could see how Beretta’s mind was working. As long as Ramiris survived, nobody inside the labyrinth would ever die—but if she died, it was game over for everything. The labyrinth couldn’t be guaranteed safe if she was kidnapped, either, so it was obvious why Beretta was trying to bank as much time as possible.</p>
<p>As things stood, Beretta was getting everything he wanted. But it wouldn’t stay that way. Unfortunately for him, Deeno still had one last trick up his sleeve. He was only putting up with Beretta’s stalling because he needed to neutralize him right here, right now.</p>
<p>Fighting a foe who could resurrect himself infinitely was such a pain that way. If Deeno could capture Ramiris before Beretta revived himself, then all was well, but everyone else in the room was certain to dogpile on him then…and if he started aiming to kill everybody in the Control Center, Ramiris was likely to get caught in the crossfire. Deeno said he didn’t intend to kill her, and that was the truth—the truth, and also a pair of shackles holding him down.</p>
<p><em>This is soooo annoying. I can’t believe merely neutralizing Beretta is taking this much work. It’d be easy to just kill him, but…well, all the prep work’s done, so it no longer matters.</em></p>
<p>“Beretta, you’ve done well. Take a nap. Fallen Hypno!!”</p>
<p>So he unleashed his power. This was Fallen Hypno, a nonlethal, broad-range neutralizing attack derived from his unique skill Sloth. It lured any living creature into a sleep from which they would never awaken until the caster removed the curse. Attempting to mentally resist it was pointless. It was a deadly sin of a move, at the top levels of power…but as the word <em>Sloth</em> would suggest, it took quite a long time to trigger, a painful weakness. Still, despite that time lag, one needed to have an ultimate skill on hand to even think about resisting it. It was a truly fearsome attack, one that fully deserved to be called the strongest of unique skill-driven moves.</p>
<p>Deeno wanted to neutralize Beretta and the others as quietly and peacefully as he could. He truly had no desire to harm anyone else in the Control Center—Shinji, his friends, the dryads—even if they stepped up to protect Ramiris.</p>
<p>Even Vester, the first target he’d put to sleep, was someone he <a id="page-61"></a>respected as a boss. Shinji’s gang were acquaintances of his; there were even the buds of friendship sprouting. He really didn’t want to do anything to betray them like this, but Feldway’s orders were as absolute as they were incontrovertible.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe how much work this is. Don’t hate me for this, okay? I’ll try asking Feldway to let you guys in here go, so…”</p>
<p>Deeno muttered to no one in particular once he saw Beretta collapsing to the floor. Taking a glance at the sprawled-out and snoring Ramiris, Deeno extended a hand, assuming his mission was complete—</p>
<p>“Not so fast.”</p>
<p>But he was stopped by an icy voice.</p>
<p>“Are you kidding me…?”</p>
<p>Deeno turned around to find her standing there. Her cilia were shining in yellow and silver, the exoskeleton protecting more vulnerable sections of her body made of glossy black adamantite. Her wings, gleaming blue like an exotic butterfly’s, comprised two pairs; they were the same color as the compound eyes on her forehead, giving her an otherworldly charm.</p>
<p>This was Apito, freshly awoken from her evolutionary slumber, and while her colors had changed appreciably compared to before, she still looked largely the same. If anything, though, her beyond-human beauty was even further polished—there was an air of authority to her aura, like she had reached even greater heights as Insect Queen.</p>
<p>“…Apito? Perfect. Can you destroy my chaos core for me?”</p>
<p>Since demons had zero need for sleep, Beretta was just barely able to resist Fallen Hypno. He was conscious enough only to ask Apito for the favor before descending into sleep mode.</p>
<p>“Sir Beretta…”</p>
<p>“You’re still conscious?! But you can’t move!”</p>
<p>Deeno’s shock caused him to react a beat late…and that made him miss Apito’s next move. Without asking why he made that request, Apito shot out a poison stinger and broke Beretta’s chaos core to pieces. The Osiris Rapier, a self-regenerating weapon she was justly proud of, easily penetrated through the thick adamantite. She could produce this rapier within her own body, creating as many of them as she pleased. Without this evolution, though, there was no way she could have done the job.</p>
<p>Beretta laughed.</p>
<p><a id="page-62"></a>“Heh…heh-heh-heh. Impressive. Now I will die, only to be reborn in perfect condition. I must ask you to hold down the fort for a little while, Apito.”</p>
<p>He had stepped down as leader of the Ten Dungeon Marvels, but he remained Ramiris’s personal aide, and thus he had the authority to give orders to the other Marvels.</p>
<p>“Very well. Sadly, I fear I cannot defeat this adversary alone, so I hope you will return shortly.”</p>
<p>Despite her words, Apito’s voice lent credence to the idea that she was sure she’d win. Deeno, apparently sensing this, scowled.</p>
<p>“Come on… What a decision. You didn’t even give me a moment to intervene.”</p>
<p>He was right.</p>
<p>Leaving him to Apito, Beretta disappeared into a swarm of light particles. Then Apito sprang forth at light speed—and the battle inside the Control Center grew even more intense.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1"><em>This really sucks.</em></p>
<p>That was Deeno’s unadorned impression of the situation. Apito was no sweat as an opponent…but in the labyrinth, he just couldn’t kill her.</p>
<p>He wanted to finish her and secure Ramiris ASAP, but Apito was leveraging her speed to constantly get in his way. She didn’t try to seriously engage Deeno at all, preferring a stick-and-move approach. In her evolved form, she had perhaps grown more specialized for speed-based tactics, and she fully understood what made her unique. There was no waste to her moves at all; her EP was probably around 700,000, but in speed, at least, she was easily Deeno’s equal.</p>
<p>Even worse, once Deeno finally thought he killed her, Beretta would be revived by then. It hadn’t even been a minute yet, and already he had teleported himself back in. Apito was doing a perfectly fine job buying time for Beretta, because even against someone as overwhelming as Deeno, she didn’t need to stall ten seconds.</p>
<p>At this point, Deeno had nothing left to work with. His best bet was to put Beretta and Apito to sleep simultaneously. Calming himself, he <a id="page-63"></a>tried breaking out the unique skill Sloth once more. Whether against one target or many, Sloth took its time before it deployed.</p>
<p>Deeno stopped panicking and gauged the current situation, remarkably calm for someone in the middle of combat. The first thing he noticed was the image on the Control Center’s screen, depicting Rimuru fighting Velgrynd after she defeated her brother in the <em>kaiju</em> battle.</p>
<p><em>Dude, how the hell did he escape?! And, like, he’s an even match for Velgrynd?!</em></p>
<p>This was the biggest surprise of the day. The way Feldway put it, the demon lord Rimuru and his generals were all locked away in an alternate dimension of Velgrynd’s creation. The escape was actually pretty simple—Rimuru used the soul corridor with his friends to determine his physical location, and that was all it took—but Deeno, not aware of that, was absolutely dumbfounded. The even greater surprise, however, was Rimuru’s strength. Velgrynd seemed all but invincible, and Rimuru even seemed to push her around a bit.</p>
<p>Concern crossed Deeno’s mind. <em>We’re gonna be in big trouble unless I make some progress soon, maybe.</em></p>
<p>His attention tuned toward the others. Capturing Ramiris first was the main keystone of Feldway’s plan. Deeno was stationed in the labyrinth because Guy had ordered him in there; that was a total coincidence, and unfortunately for Deeno, it attracted Feldway’s attention. Deeno couldn’t be more reluctant about it, but he was the only ally who had free access to the highly secured Control Center. It was simply the hand he was dealt, and he accepted it.</p>
<p>Feldway had put together a grandiose plan to secure an invasion pathway for him and his minions. He had goaded Velgrynd into destroying the labyrinth so Veldora would come out from hiding. That worked brilliantly, much to Deeno’s surprise, and now Feldway himself was taking the lead to carry out this invasion.</p>
<p>Feldway was accompanied by two of the Three Mystic Leaders, along with five generals Zarario took along with him. They were eight people in all, and deploying not one but two of his highest officers for the job was nothing short of lavish. Only Obela, the last remaining Mystic Leader, was left, and she was presumably handling guard duties over at the Mystic Palace deep in the other world. Hearing this <a id="page-64"></a>plan, Deeno could only conclude that Feldway wanted this thing to succeed at all costs.</p>
<p>But Deeno wasn’t the only Primordial Angel on this planet who had been contacted about the project. Two others, living undercover in human civilization, had also been called up. They technically worked under Deeno, but Feldway didn’t bother going through him for this. Their job was to keep the destroyed labyrinth going—a safety valve just in case Deeno somehow failed in his mission. It took only a passing thought from Ramiris to turn this labyrinth into a prison, and then getting out of here would be a huge undertaking that Feldway wanted to avoid.</p>
<p>These were the two people Deeno was most concerned about at the moment. He scanned the screen for them.</p>
<p><em>Oh, for… Come on! They’re in an even bout with Pico and Garasha…?</em></p>
<p>Pico was a tiny young woman, Garasha a much more imposing warrior type.</p>
<p>With Velgrynd victorious over Veldora, the city that had been isolated in the labyrinth was now back on the surface. Geld had stepped up to defend it, but he never expected Geld would be asked to fight the likes of Pico and Garasha.</p>
<p><em>Geld the Barrier Lord…and Kumara the Chimera Lord? Wait, Kumara’s a cryptid, isn’t she? She’s not descended from Ivalage, the World-Destroyer Dragon, is she? Nah, no way…</em></p>
<p>Deeno quickly banished the ghastly idea his imagination gave him. <em>They call ’em the Twelve Lordly Guardians for a reason, I guess</em>, he thought to himself as he checked on the other battlefields. There he saw Zarario, another one of the Three Mystic Leaders.</p>
<p><em>Wow, Zarario’s kicking ass like usual, huh? He doesn’t even seem to take this seriously, either. Way to make it look easy against Charys and Treyni.</em></p>
<p>His old partner, Zarario, was as strong as ever. It always struck Deeno that he had this creepy underside he never revealed in public, but clearly he’d been improving himself over the past few millennia. Concluding he was in no trouble at all, Deeno moved on.</p>
<p><em>And here’s…Cornu? I heard he screwed up the invasion a few decades ago big-time. Maybe that’s why he looks so distressed?</em></p>
<p>As Deeno keenly observed, Cornu seemed to be panicking, and it was clear why. That previous mistake had cost him his entire army and <a id="page-65"></a>injured him so badly that he needed several decades to fully recover. If he blew it again this time, Feldway was likely going to do away with him entirely. Even worse, if all was going to plan, Feldway was traveling alongside Cornu incognito as well. The pressure must be so intense, Deeno reasoned, that it kept him from exercising his full powers.</p>
<p><em>He’s got bad luck is all. But Masayuki’s a wimp in real life, and I don’t think anyone else opposing him is a challenge, either. Venom’s membership in the black tribe is a concern, but I guess he came on the scene way later than Beretta. He’ll probably be okay.</em></p>
<p>Deeno wasn’t too concerned, in part because he wasn’t that friendly with Cornu to start with. If he messed this up, Feldway would probably step up to wipe his ass. Things were still going to plan.</p>
<p>It was perhaps this sense of relief that caused Deeno’s lazy mind to play tricks on him.</p>
<p><em>Hmm… It’s odd, though. Why am I here worrying about if this operation will work? Like, what’s gotten into me?</em></p>
<p>A pretty important question. Something bothered Deeno about this whole plan, something he couldn’t get out of his mind. He couldn’t put it into words, exactly, which irritated him, but he figured he’d put his finger on it before long.</p>
<p>Unfortunately:</p>
<p><em>“Why are you playing around, Deeno? I am going on the move shortly. Carry out your mission at once.”</em></p>
<p>The calmer part of Deeno’s day had come to a close.</p>
<p><em>Pfft… I really hate working…</em></p>
<p>Deeno had no argument with Beretta or Apito. In fact, he liked them. That’s why he resented these orders so much…but there was no defying them. <em>Ah, well</em>, he said to himself as he decided to get serious about this.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Feldway, fresh from reminding Deeno about his orders, was in hiding as he watched Cornu fight.</p>
<p>Cornu tended to be overconfident in his abilities, but he was still a reliable ally. He had received his name from Veldanava, just like Feldway had, and Feldway considered Cornu a valuable asset. But Cornu <a id="page-66"></a>had put in a terrible showing last time, losing a third of the entire army despite possessing overwhelming power against the piddling planet they invaded.</p>
<p>That was more than enough reason for Feldway to forsake him, and Cornu knew that full well—clearly he was fighting for keeps right now, not toying with his foe like he usually did. It wasn’t a sight Feldway welcomed. The Three Mystic Leaders were expected to be all-powerful dominators in battle, not people to be toyed with by far weaker enemies. These were enemies Cornu should finish off in one blow, and instead he was letting them run all over him. He had completely fallen for the enemy’s trap, not even realizing that Masayuki had been replaced with an impostor.</p>
<p>It was beyond exasperating at this point—it almost made Feldway want to kill him, in fact. But he somehow contained himself. Then, ignoring Cornu entirely, he stepped up to take out Masayuki.</p>
<p class="space-break">Meanwhile, Masayuki left the scene with languid steps. The idea of fleeing the battle alone didn’t sit well with him.</p>
<p>He was, of course, quite scared, but the idea of abandoning his friends was even scarier. If something happened to him, he’d spend the rest of his life beating himself up over it.</p>
<p>Masayuki stopped for a moment and turned around. From far away, he could see his friends fighting for their lives. Minitz was keeping the enemy contained, the vampires were capitalizing on their immortality to divert their attention, and Caligulio and Venom were attacking whenever they found a hole to exploit. Jiwu, in particular, was putting on a masterful show, setting herself up in just the right place to prevent Cornu from uncorking any super-destructive attacks. For such a hastily assembled crew, they were showing real teamwork—but if they lost even one person, the whole thing was likely to crumble.</p>
<p>“Hey, Masayuki…”</p>
<p>“Bernie, I gotta head back. Like, I never really talked about this because I didn’t wanna blow my cover, but—really, I wish I coulda gotten friendlier with all you guys. I know I’m a coward, but I don’t want to be a backstabber, too, you know?”</p>
<p>Then, with that admission of the truth, the World Language spoke up in Masayuki’s brain.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em><a id="page-67"></a>The heroic trait of “courageously refusing to run” has been detected. Now that all three conditions have been met, a hidden power of the unique skill Chosen One has been unlocked. Invoke?</em></span></p>
<p class="answer-first1"><span class="special"><em>Yes</em></span></p>
<p class="answer-first1"><span class="special"><em>No</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Huh?</em> thought Masayuki. He was afraid he had gone and screwed up yet again, sighing in relief when he realized he hadn’t. He didn’t really care about any more “hidden powers” within him, but there wasn’t much point in turning back on this whole thing now. So Masayuki agreed to it.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Confirmed. New power added to Chosen One… Successful. Heroic Recourse is now permanently activated.</em></p>
<p>A long, complicated description flashed across his mind. It gave him an ache of nostalgia as he marveled at it, gradually grasping his new ability.</p>
<p>He was already in possession of Heroic Aura, which awed his targets into submission; Heroic Compensation, which offered near-impossible levels of luck; Heroic Charm, which granted courage to his companions; and Heroic Action, which was still kind of a mystery but seemed to massage events so they always worked out to his benefit in the end. Heroic Recourse, the recent addition, apparently made him into a kind of magnet for Heroes.</p>
<p><em>Um… Guide the souls of the dead? I became a “vessel”? What’s up with that? I don’t really need that skill if it requires all my friends to die…</em></p>
<p>Masayuki saw it coming. Yet another totally useless skill in his quiver. He hadn’t expected much in the first place, so it was no genuine disappointment. As long as it didn’t actively make things worse, that was enough.</p>
<p>“Masayuki, you…”</p>
<p>“So c’mon, Bernie, how about we go back?”</p>
<p>Returning to the subject at hand: This new ability of his was already lost to the ether.</p>
<p>“All right. If that’s what you want, I’ll join you.”</p>
<p><a id="page-68"></a>Bernie scratched his head in defeat. Then, sharing a grin with each other, they turned around—and things kicked into high gear.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="image" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Feldway was on the move. Bernie meant nothing to him, but he was blocking him from taking Masayuki away. His fighting stance was full of holes; Feldway could off him with one swing. Or, really, Bernie’s actual ability didn’t matter. He was just garbage in Feldway’s mind.</p>
<p>Without so much as a breeze, without even revealing his presence, Feldway attempted to decapitate Bernie with his drawn sword. But all that resulted in was a sharp, echoing sound—blade clanging against blade.</p>
<p>“You’re stopping <em>me</em>?! Who are you? What’re you doing?”</p>
<p>For an instant, it surprised Feldway. He was answered by a young girl in a mask.</p>
<p>“I am Chronoa…and what I’m <em>doing</em> is being a Hero.”</p>
<p>A moment of silence. Then Feldway’s burst of laughter.</p>
<p>“Look at this! A Hero gracing us with her presence. Let me give you my name, then. I am Feldway, the Mystic Lord!”</p>
<p>The name didn’t faze Chronoa. Her mind was now in perfect sync with Chloe’s, and she was a cold steel machine of warfare.</p>
<p>“Mystic Lord? Hmm. So you’re the boss of these magic-born? I came out because I couldn’t let this injustice go on in front of me, but if you’re a threat to humanity as well, I’ll just eliminate you here.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… Pretty brave talk. Let me put you in your place, fool!”</p>
<p>The moment he stopped speaking, Feldway—dressed in his scarlet-red uniform—took action. Chronoa, in her white-themed Holy Spirit Armor, also disappeared. Flashes of red and white light streaked before the eyes of Masayuki and his friends. They had all but gone invisible to them, but the sounds were deafening. There were no shock waves, however, not even a slight breeze. The battle was taking place on a dimension beyond anyone’s comprehension.</p>
<p>This masked girl had come to Masayuki’s aid once before, and now she was doing it again. He understood that, but as he was now, he doubted there was much he could do to help this girl.</p>
