<p>But…</p>
<p>Masayuki was shocked. Amazingly, the figure took Venom’s kick without defending—not because he couldn’t react in time, either. Almost as if he didn’t see the need to at all.</p>
<p>“Pfft. Garbage like you doesn’t deserve to live. You damn demon races have been meddling with us since time immemorial. I am Cornu, one of the Three Mystic Leaders, and you have just deeply offended me! You will know your place soon…in the grave!”</p>
<p>The man called Cornu casually swung an arm toward Venom. The next moment, a wave of compressed magic force was unleashed, gouging into Venom at an unavoidable speed. Masayuki was wondering why Cornu had bothered with the high-handed self-introduction, but only for a moment, as he hurriedly went over to Venom’s side.</p>
<p>“A-are you okay?”</p>
<p>Venom was alive. He had reacted just in time to deflect the magic bolt with his left arm. But the damage was staggering. His entire left arm was now gone, and there was a large hole in his left side as well.</p>
<p>“…Not really, no. I hardly believe it, much less want to admit it, but it looks like that bastard’s way stronger than I am. But don’t worry. I promise I’m gonna protect you.”</p>
<p>With that, Venom casually stood up. He was nowhere near unhurt, but he was far from out of the battle, either.</p>
<p>“Oh, great. We’ve got an obstinate little bug here, don’t we? This is why I hate garbage so much. They waste everyone’s time with their pointless resistance.”</p>
<p>Watching Cornu moan about this made Masayuki want to tell him off. He didn’t know why it was so important that he be killed, and he felt entirely responsible for Venom getting hurt as well.</p>
<p>“Venom…”</p>
<p>“I guess that guy’s going after you, huh?”</p>
<p>“You knew from the start?”</p>
<p>“I had a hunch once Lady Ramiris contacted me. But it’s okay. I may not beat him, but I’ll buy us some time.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“He probably hasn’t killed you yet because of your bracelet. If he <a id="page-39"></a>does, you’ll just get resurrected somewhere else. He’s afraid of that, so he’s trying to bring you out of the labyrinth alive. I don’t think he’ll throw us any attacks that might fall within range of you!”</p>
<p>Venom smiled defiantly. And he was right. Masayuki’s resurrection point was set to the Control Center; that way, no one would see where he went. Knowing that emboldened him.</p>
<p>Cornu, meanwhile, was annoyed that his motives had been exposed. He had good reason not to make any more mistakes, a reason that went back several decades. During an attempted invasion of another planet besides this one, he’d screwed everything up just one step before completion. Exactly what had happened was unclear, but a field of blazing fire had reduced the army he led to cinders. Thanks to that, Cornu—despite retaining his Mystic Leader title—no longer had any subordinates assigned to him. And while his wounds had healed, his mind still bore the sadness and despair he could never fully wipe away.</p>
<p>Thus, despite the overwhelming advantage he had in this matchup, Cornu still felt like he was dancing on a cliff. Unfortunately for him, it didn’t escape his adversary’s notice.</p>
<p>“I’ll admit it. If this wasn’t Ramiris’s world, I never would’ve had to be here. It would be child’s play to bury both of you, but while I’m at it, I think I’ll let you taste genuine despair. Behold my true powers…and prepare to set off for the afterlife!”</p>
<p>Cornu wasn’t the type of fool to let his guard down. He realized Venom would be no pushover, and now he broke out his full force so he could handle whatever may or may not come.</p>
<p>Over his body, a suit of armor formed itself, emitting beams of black and golden light. This was the ultimate in God-class gear, the same type Zarario boasted, and it was available only to the Three Mystic Leaders. Venom, now facing a fully armed Cornu, had no moves left to make. No attack would even scratch him, and all that remained was for Venom to be tormented to death.</p>
<p>“<em>Tsh</em>… Dammit…!”</p>
<p>Venom winced at the impossible difference in power. Running, he assumed, would be pointless—and once he was gone, Masayuki would doubtlessly be taken away and executed. Venom himself would be resurrected within this labyrinth as well, but if he failed to protect Masayuki, it’d be Diablo’s violent purge waiting for him next.</p>
<p><a id="page-40"></a><em>I’m screwed, aren’t I…?</em></p>
<p>Venom thought hard, almost ready to cry. There was only one option left—kill Masayuki himself so he’d be sent to a safe spot.</p>
<p>“So be it—”</p>
<p>But just when Venom was about to commit to it:</p>
<p>“Hey, do we have some trouble over here? Mind if we lend a hand?”</p>
<p>Two men stepped forward, shielding Masayuki.</p>
<p>“Are you Sir Minitz?! And Sir Caligulio, too?!”</p>
<p>The timid Masayuki recognized them, having met them both a couple of times before. He recalled how nervous he had been, given how high in Empire society they both were.</p>
<p>“Sir Masayuki, you may feel free to simply call me Minitz. Having His Majesty the Emperor’s spitting image call me ‘sir’ makes me feel <em>so</em> self-conscious.”</p>
<p>“B-but…”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! He’s right, I think. Seeing you here, Sir Masayuki, makes me feel like my heart is soaring, as if His Majesty himself is witnessing my exploits. I feel more powerful than ever now!”</p>
<p>The foppish Minitz—along with Caligulio, his stern countenance obscured by a patch over his left eye—smiled at Masayuki, trying to calm him.</p>
<p>“Venom, right? Allow us to back you up.”</p>
<p>Minitz turned toward Cornu. An invisible force field deployed itself, slowing Cornu’s movements. It was the effect of Oppressor, the unique skill Minitz had supposedly lost earlier.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you lose your powers, Minitz?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did,” came the blunt reply. “But once you get something the first time, the second time onward is far easier, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Caligulio gave that a half smile. “I’m envious. I lost <em>my</em> omnipotence, so… But at least I can still easily store magicules in my empty body.”</p>
<p>As if to prove it, Caligulio’s body was clearly teeming with power. He was well beyond the point of losing control, and blood was seeping out from his pores. His life would be in danger before long, but that mattered little in the labyrinth—he was equipped with an unlimited-use Resurrection Bracelet he had procured from parts unknown, so he didn’t care about the effect on his body.</p>
<p>“You sure get carried away, don’t you?”</p>
<p><a id="page-41"></a>“I couldn’t face up to my dead soldiers if I didn’t do <em>this</em> much.”</p>
<p>Venom saw his last hope in the two of them. And they weren’t alone. Several other men had joined them, volunteering to assist the demon. He recognized who they were immediately, and without a moment’s hesitation, he agreed to the offer.</p>
<p>“Thanks, guys. Don’t worry about killing this one or anything—just stop him!”</p>
<p>“Understood!”</p>
<p>“This ought to be fun.”</p>
<p>“As long as I’m on the scene, there’s nothing left to fear!”</p>
<p>These were three overcomers—rehabilitated vampires—who had joined in out of curiosity.</p>
<p>“I’ll give the orders. All of you, get moving!”</p>
<p>It was Caligulio declaring his authority, and no one objected. Now five people were supporting Venom, going on the attack against Cornu.</p>
<p>“Stupid garbage! Don’t act like you can beat me!”</p>
<p>Cornu was enraged, but he still hadn’t lost his cool. He set out to eliminate each of them one by one, while taking pains not to let Masayuki escape. But, surprisingly enough, this hastily assembled team worked amazingly well together. Between the overcomers’ immortality and Cornu being unable to deploy wide-range destructive attacks, Caligulio had a plan in mind to win this battle with minimal damage. Using quick-wittedness and bravery to overcome the impossible difference in power, Venom and the others backed one another up to successfully stall for time.</p>
<p>And as they did:</p>
<p>“Masayuki! Over here!”</p>
<p>“Hurry up and get out of there. If you reach the lab, you can travel to other floors from there, right?”</p>
<p>Bernie and Jiwu had called out to him.</p>
<p>“Y-you guys!”</p>
<p>“Sorry. I wanted to more formally apologize, but now’s not the time for that. Just follow me.”</p>
<p>“Huh?! Wait a second. What’re you doing, Jiwu?”</p>
<p>Bernie seemed ready to serve as Masayuki’s bodyguard. Jiwu, however, stood frozen on the spot, apparently casting a magic spell.</p>
<p>“Ah, don’t worry about me. I’ll just pretend to be you to confuse him.”</p>
<p><a id="page-42"></a>By the time Jiwu turned toward Masayuki to respond, she looked exactly like him.</p>
<p>“Come on! I guess he’s holding back his attack on you, and Jiwu can defend herself well enough. We gotta get out while we have a chance!”</p>
<p>That was apparently the plan they had come up with on the way here. The rest of the team endeavored to keep Jiwu out of Cornu’s sight as she transformed. Masayuki hesitated…but only for a moment.</p>
<p>“Okay. I’m just gonna be a drag on everyone here anyway.”</p>
<p>So he reluctantly agreed to the plan.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">The Control Center was in a state of uncontrolled chaos. The enemy who had appeared in the labyrinth out of nowhere was far trickier to deal with than anyone had assumed.</p>
<p>“Do we have the EP for the guy targeting Masayuki yet?”</p>
<p>“Here it is! It’s estimated to be around 1.8 million—or it was, but after equipping God-class gear, it’s risen to 2.8 million!”</p>
<p>“What? That’s just cheating!”</p>
<p>Ramiris deeply resented Alpha’s report. But there wasn’t much point whining about it. She needed to get serious and come up with a plan, fast.</p>
<p>“God-class equipment only lends its force to whoever it deems its master. In Sir Alberto’s case, the result more than doubled his existence points…and even then, he was likely not extracting his God-class gear’s full power.”</p>
<p>Ramiris agreed with Beretta’s analysis. With his God-class armor, Alberto had become something equivalent to a spiritual life-form. According to the data taken earlier, his EP went from a starting point of around 180,000 to 400,000 and beyond. That seemed impressive by itself, but apparently there was still untapped power left in his God-class gear. Alberto himself had gone into his evolutionary sleep not long afterward, and no one could wait to see what he’d exhibit once he woke up. (This evoked the question of just how crazy Kurobe was, given his ability to craft God-class stuff, but no one had any time to debate that right then.)</p>
<p><a id="page-43"></a>Regardless, God-class gear was as rare as it was astounding…except in the hands of the enemy, it was nothing but a mortal threat.</p>
<p>“So <em>now</em> what’re we gonna do, huh?! Even Treyni and Charys together are getting pushed around by that Zarario guy! If we gotta deal with this Cornu character along with that, Venom and his friends don’t stand a chance…”</p>
<p>Ramiris had reason for concern. Having become a Demon Peer, Venom’s EP had shot up to 400,000. However, the leader of the overcomer trio was 300,000 at best, and his two partners were 200,000. Minitz and Caligulio, both stragglers from the imperial army, had lost most of their powers; they could manage an EP of just over 10,000. Expecting them to put up a fight was foolish—in fact, one had to commend their bravery for attempting to join in at all.</p>
<p>Still, the pair was brimming with enthusiasm. Minitz, oddly enough, was using his unique skill, Oppressor, something everyone assumed he had lost. The fashionable suit he sported was another concern (he sure didn’t <em>look</em> like a prisoner of war), but Ramiris’s mind was more on Oppressor at the moment. Caligulio’s own EP had also been rapidly rising as of late, topping 400,000 just a moment ago. The rate of acceleration was finally tapering off, but the number was still increasing.</p>
<p>It was totally incomprehensible and tremendously fascinating to watch. But unfortunately, there was no time to explore it further. Suppressing her bewilderment at all these concerns happening at once, Ramiris barked out her orders.</p>
<p>“Dahhh! If they did, my power will just resurrect them anyway! They can act as my throwaway pawns all they want! The <em>real</em> problem is Masayuki!”</p>
<p>“…How do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I mean, he’ll be transported back here if he dies, but if he’s taken away, it’s over for him! Right? So I think we need the surest method possible to ferry him back to safety.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Actually, it looks like Bernie and Jiwu are trying to extricate him from the scene.”</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>Ramiris was impressed. They had acted before she could direct <a id="page-44"></a>them, apparently reaching the same conclusion she had. It did a lot to rehabilitate their image in her mind. Masayuki, she knew, was way too much of a chicken to try something like take his own life in the labyrinth. No matter how bad things got, he’d never even think about using that most deadly approach to escape. With Bernie there, however, Ramiris’s mind was much more at ease.</p>
<p>“Get in contact with Bernie! Tell him to flee back to this room for me. Also, I think he knows this, but if push comes to shove, he needs to off the guy himself!”</p>
<p>“Roger that.”</p>
<p>Alpha promptly sent a Thought Communication, perfectly encrypted and reaching Bernie with zero delay. Confirming that, Ramiris finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“All right. Now we’ve done what we can, at least.”</p>
<p>The large surveillance screen was divided into sections, showing off the state of battle across the labyrinth. The fight was tough in every video feed; things weren’t looking too sunny for them.</p>
<p>“Ugh, I am <em>so</em> useless when Rimuru isn’t around.”</p>
<p>“It was the worst possible timing. If our floor guardians were awake, we wouldn’t be nearly as outmanned as we are.”</p>
<p>“Well, I know that, but…”</p>
<p>Beretta was certainly right. If their entire lineup was deployable right now, they wouldn’t be so far behind in this fight. But even so, Ramiris felt a sense of responsibility as she watched things unfold. That was how irreplaceable the labyrinth had become in her life.</p>
<p>Just then, Beta, who had been monitoring magicule amounts, shouted out in a strained voice.</p>
<p>“Emergency!”</p>
<p>“Oh, <em>now</em> what?!”</p>
<p>“This was anticipated, but the magicule supply from Sir Veldora has been cut off. Unless it’s restored, we have less than an hour until the city is deposited back on the surface!”</p>
<p>“<em>Gehhhh!!</em> Does that mean my master lost?!”</p>
<p>It was a hard reality for Ramiris to swallow. But if Velgrynd was their adversary, it was a reality she had to admit was possible. They had proceeded with the evacuation with that possibility in mind.</p>
<p>For now, Ramiris opted to believe that Rimuru would figure something <a id="page-45"></a>out for Veldora. Getting impressed wouldn’t improve matters for anyone, so all she could do was think positively and proceed as best she could.</p>
<p>“How’s the evacuation going?”</p>
<p>“No problems there. Masayuki successfully persuaded the stragglers before he headed out.”</p>
<p>In any crowd of people, there’s always one group that’s good at griping about anything and everything, and the Tempest capital of Rimuru was no exception. Around 10 percent of the population had refused to evacuate, including residents and visiting merchants trying to profit off the situation. But even they were swayed by the voice of Masayuki. “<em>Well,</em>” they said, “<em>if that’s what he wants</em>”—and then they finally got off their asses and left. The effect, close to brainwashing, startled even Ramiris.</p>
<p>Gamma, tasked with overseeing evacuation-related matters, avowed that there was nobody left in the city. Her mind assured, Ramiris prepared to separate the city from the labyrinth.</p>
<p>“But if nobody’s there, none of our defenses will function. Sadly, we will have to expect untold damage to the town and its buildings.”</p>
<p>“Wh-whoa, Beretta! You’re gonna make me second-guess things if you say stuff like that!”</p>
<p>But it was the unavoidable truth. Ramiris’s own magicule count wouldn’t comparatively amount to much—although the labyrinth had been expanded, she didn’t have the wherewithal to accommodate any extra structures inside it by herself. That was the harmful side effect of relying purely on Veldora for their energy needs, and Ramiris sure didn’t have a quick fix for it right now.</p>
<p>“I am fully aware of that, my lady. But then, I am sure Sir Rimuru would say something to the effect of, <em>‘We can always build it again.’</em>”</p>
<p>“Right? I suppose that’s what we’ll have to commit to…”</p>
<p>Seething over her own lack of power, Ramiris ejected the city to the surface. Now they’d just have to pray some stray bolt of magic didn’t level the thing. But:</p>
<p>“Urgent report! A new enemy has appeared on the surface, two in number. Precision measurements outside the labyrinth are not possible, but their EP is estimated to be at least one million!”</p>
<p>The report came from Delta, who was monitoring the surface. The small window on the main screen was enlarged, revealing two <a id="page-46"></a>angels—or <em>fallen</em> angels, to be exact—bearing black wings. One was a large, muscular woman while the other was a smaller, handsome young man. Each of them sported three pairs of wings.</p>
<p>“Oh, no way! If they have the same number of wings, are <em>they</em> seraphim, too…?”</p>
<p>Ramiris flew around the room, fidgeting. All hope seemed to be truly lost now. But, remembering something that was on her mind, she turned to Delta, a glimmer of hope on her face.</p>
<p>“Delta! How can we be so sure they’re enemies? Maybe—”</p>
<p><em>Maybe they’re not</em>, she thought. <em>Maybe they’re allies, even.</em> But Delta offered no solace.</p>
<p>“Because they are keeping us from covering the hole opened up by Lady Velgrynd. Victory is ours if we can close off the labyrinth…but sadly, it is not to be.”</p>
<p>The answer was obvious, beyond reproach.</p>
<p>“R…right. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Ramiris stopped flitting around in the air and slumped onto Beretta’s shoulder. There was something obscene about the enemy deciding to put four of the Million Class into the field; she wanted to spend all night cursing to high heaven about it. But then a reliable ally woke back up.</p>
<p><em>“Allow me to handle things on the surface. I will not let them destroy the city crowned by Sir Rimuru’s name without a fight.”</em></p>
<p>Geld, the Barrier Lord, had completed his evolution.</p>
<p>“Gelllllllld!!”</p>
<p>Ramiris was crying.</p>
<p>“Geld’s EP is over 2.37 million!” said Alpha. “All his gear is included in that, but even so, it’s doubtful he’ll lose to these invaders now!”</p>
<p>Geld’s Legend-class equipment had itself ascended to God-class with the evolution, driven to greater heights by Geld’s aura. Rimuru hadn’t factored that into his calculations, but everyone witnessing this assumed he’d expected this to happen.</p>
<p>“That’s Rimuru for ya! Even with my own two eyes, I could never have seen this one coming.”</p>
<p>Ramiris was bodily confident about how imperceptive she was. Beretta couldn’t have agreed more.</p>
<p>“Indeed. Such <em>deep</em> forethought.”</p>
<p><a id="page-47"></a>And that wasn’t the only one awakening.</p>
<p><em>“I am here as well. Let me handle the other one.”</em></p>
<p>This was Kumara, the Chimera Lord.</p>
<p>“Lady Kumara’s EP is measured at approximately 1.9 million. Reaching this figure with no auxiliary equipment is simply unbelievable!”</p>
<p>Cheers erupted in the Control Center at Alpha’s report. Then, as if to prove his statement true, an intense battle broke out on the surface. Even more amazingly, Geld’s underlings fanned out across key areas, forming an all-powerful barrier to protect the city from any of the battle’s fallout.</p>
<p>“We can win this!”</p>
<p>“For now, I’d say we have a chance.”</p>
<p>Ramiris was already declaring victory. Beretta was similarly relieved. But it was too early to rest easy yet. Feldway, the Mystic Lord, had yet to fully execute his strategy. In fact, everything up to now had been a feint. His true aim was elsewhere.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">The nervous tension spread across the Control Center had subsided a little. Ramiris, declaring victory atop Beretta’s shoulder, was quieter now, like she needed a nap. Beretta, used to his role, kept his calm demeanor as he tended to his ever-frantic master.</p>
<p>Shinji, watching this from a distance, had been taking in all the previous chaos like he was a spectator at a sports meet. The battle unfolding was so completely beyond his understanding that it seemed to transcend the limits of reality itself. Paradoxically, it helped him stay calm. He understood why Ramiris was freaking out, but—really—she should collect herself a bit more, he thought.</p>
<p><em>I wish she’d learn a little from Beretta…</em></p>
<p>That’s what he truly felt, but he’d never say it out loud. If he did, it’d lead to needless strife and likely a pay cut.</p>
<p>Yes, Ramiris’s labyrinth was truly a mind-boggling invention, but she herself was weaker than Shinji—weak beyond compare, even. No matter how much she panicked and carried on in here, she couldn’t actually do very much.</p>
<p><em>Besides…</em></p>
<p><a id="page-48"></a>Shinji recalled the victory celebration held the other day. All those magic-born titans, boasting untold stores of power—and they each pledged their loyalty to one man, the demon lord Rimuru. Shinji was an otherworlder, a capable one, rated Special A by the Free Guild. He had something called his “existence points” measured, and right now it was more than 120,000. He even possessed the unique skill Restorer. In the imperial army, he was treated as an ace commando, and he admittedly allowed his superiority to get to his head a little. Here, though, he was nothing special. Even the beautiful sisters manning the operator controls had EPs of more than 150,000. It quickly, and understandably, made Shinji stop dwelling on his own strength so much.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Marc’s EP was pegged at 130,000, while Zhen scored 120,000. They seemed pretty equal overall, and none of them would even register in the minds of the monsters being shown on-screen here.</p>
<p>But despite that, even with Tempest’s main force unavailable, they were still making a competitive fight out of this. That alone, Shinji thought, was amazing. Looking back, the force that laid waste to the Empire’s proud Armored Division was not even 30 percent of the Tempest force’s full power. That, too, was before the victory party where the demon lord Rimuru rewarded his top magic-born officers and they fell into evolutionary sleep. Now they were seeing guys graduate into the Million Class.</p>
<p>Shinji’s mind could barely keep up with this. Monster evolutions, including Geld’s just now, made no sense to him.</p>
<p><em>I am</em> so <em>glad that I left the Empire for Tempest!</em></p>
<p>He gave a sincere mental thank-you to Lord Gadora.</p>
<p>Then his eyes moved to the monitor, where his former commanding officer, Minitz, was leading a group fighting off Cornu, one of the Three Mystic Leaders. It looked like something from a movie.</p>
<p><em>I mean, what can they even do against these kinds of monsters? I can’t believe freaks like that are up there in the first place.</em></p>
<p>In Shinji’s mind, Minitz and Caligulio must be insane if they were charging into battle despite losing all their power. He wondered if they were scared—but seeing this movie-like plot of two fallen warriors charging back up against their foes made him think that not everyone in the Empire’s officer corps was a waste of space.</p>
<p><a id="page-49"></a>It just felt so unrealistic. So much so, he wondered if these two thought they were the heroes of their own little movie plots or something. And that was perhaps why his mind wandered away from the danger at hand—to escape reality. Now his attention was focused on Shuna, who was busy providing refreshments to everyone.</p>
<p><em>…But, man, Shuna’s just as sweet as always, huh?</em></p>
<p>There was no point dwelling on his employer—she didn’t matter to him. This vulgar fighting didn’t occupy his mind; instead, it was all about the incredibly fetching Shuna. Just recalling her as she politely bowed and left the room made Shinji feel happier. She was so dignified, so flawless. She looked like such a fleeting figure, who would fade into the wind if you touched her, but she was notorious for being a scary woman when riled. Shinji was hardly the only one who looked up to her—Marc and Zhen were fellow members of Shuna’s fan club, alongside the new recruits Lucius and Raymond.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there was Ramiris, his employer. He sighed.</p>
<p>“Uh, Shinji?” she said. “If you wanted to say something, I’ll hear ya out, but…?”</p>
<p>She was so keenly sharp only when it came to stuff like this.</p>
<p>“No, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>Shinji hurriedly denied it, wondering if it was showing on his face.</p>
<p>Lord Gadora, his master, told him all the time that “<em>if you want to be a wizard, you must always keep your presence of mind. You’ve got</em> much <em>to learn there, my boy!</em>” Now he could see the wisdom in that. Yes, Shinji could get emotional by comparison, and he was poor at the type of self-control that all wizards needed. Zhen always kept it cool, never revealing how he felt, but he wasn’t suited to magic. “<em>Too bad it wasn’t the other way around,</em>” Gadora always told him—and now Shinji had to admit to his shortcomings.</p>
<p><em>Well, if Lady Ramiris is unoccupied enough to yell at me again, maybe she’ll forgive me for it this time…</em></p>
<p>He knew he was dreaming. Besides, comparing Shuna with Ramiris was ridiculous from the start. It was like comparing a grown woman to a child—or not even that. Shuna still exhibited traits of innocent youth, but the way she held herself was as a truly refined woman. Ramiris had been alive for millennia, but her mental age was still as low as her physical body’s. She was a kid, in looks and in mind, and she <a id="page-50"></a>couldn’t even compete in the same arena as Shuna. The juxtaposition was so stark, Shinji even felt a little bad for Ramiris.</p>
<p class="space-break">Shinji’s mind was far away from pressing matters. And that’s why he could notice: One man among them, usually too lazy to lift a finger, had stood up from his seat—and Vester, his dedicated boss, was sprawled over his desk, fast asleep.</p>
<p>“Oh? Deeno, what are you doing—?”</p>
<p>It was sheer coincidence that Shinji posed the question…but it turned out to be the MVP performance of the day. Shinji, the least dedicated to this war of anyone in the room, wound up contributing more to it than anyone else.</p>

<p class="tx1">Deeno stood up and attempted to carry out the duty handed to him. It was with a great deal of reluctance, given how much he hated working, but an old acquaintance of his had asked for it, and he couldn’t turn him down. Besides, he had been taken by the compulsive idea that he <em>had</em> to do it.</p>
<p>But something unexpected got in the way.</p>
<p>“Oh? Deeno, what are you doing—?”</p>
<p>The moment he heard Shinji’s voice, Deeno realized his mission had failed. He had intended to get everything over with before anyone could notice, but the exact right kind of interference showed up at the exact right time. It was a colossal blunder. No one could have ever predicted this act from Deeno, either…</p>
<p>The hand that had reached out to grab Ramiris was now caught in Beretta’s iron grip. It all happened in a single moment. If Shinji hadn’t spoken up, nothing would have stopped him.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to do, Sir Deeno?”</p>
<p>“That’s a surprise. I didn’t expect anyone to get in the way. Eesh… I was waiting for everyone to relax and stop being so tense because <em>you</em> were around, too…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Seriously, Shinji, you really got a lot of potential, y’know? You could be big.”</p>
<p><a id="page-51"></a>Deeno was griping, but he half meant it as well. He knew only a handful of people in the world could spot his moves. That was why he’d had so much confidence this would work—confidence that was fully shot now.</p>
<p>Rolling his eyes, Deeno sighed and stole a glance at Shinji. Then he shook his head and looked back, sneering at Beretta. By now, people around Shinji were seeing the weight of the situation—but there wasn’t much they could do.</p>
<p>Alpha and the other dryads stepped up to surround Deeno, ferrying Ramiris away from Beretta’s shoulder and into their protection.</p>
<p>“…Huh? Huhhhh?!”</p>
<p>Ramiris, left behind by these transpiring events, looked at Beretta, then Deeno, trying bravely to understand her predicament. Shinji stepped away from Deeno to attend to Vester—but Marc and his other friends were just crouched over in their seats, not moving. They were asleep as well, despite everything going on, and now everyone could tell something was wrong.</p>
<p>“Hey! Deeno!” Shinji shouted. “You did something, didn’t you?!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, kinda,” came the listless reply. “But, like, if you got resistance to my power, you must have a pretty excellent skill there. You caught me off guard, Shinji.”</p>
<p>“I’m not exactly happy about the compliment.”</p>
<p>He actually was a little happy, but Shinji didn’t say that.</p>
<p>Deeno merely shrugged. He’d offered Shinji praise, but otherwise he didn’t seem to care about him much, because he didn’t even offer him another look. Instead, his eyes were on Ramiris, behind Beretta’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Ramiris, sorry about this, but you think you could maybe work with my team? I don’t wanna get rough…and if you agree to help us, I promise I’ll treat you well. Neither of us wants to shed needless blood, right? So, you know, you mind coming with me?”</p>
<p>It was about as serious a statement as Deeno had ever delivered. Ramiris’s reaction to it was predictable.</p>
<p>“Huhhh? Have you gone loony or what? Rimuru’s gonna beat your ass silly once he gets back, y’know.”</p>
<p>Ramiris was always keen to rely on someone else’s reputation to defend herself. But she wasn’t wrong, either. Deeno had to chuckle.</p>
<p><a id="page-52"></a>“Yeah, I’m sure. I figured you’d say that. But, you know, I’m not just gonna sit here and accept that. I’m reluctant to do this, like, a <em>lot</em>, but I’m a Monitor and all, so…”</p>
<p>“A Monitor…? You mean one of the Seven Primordial Angels, the closest servants of Sir Veldanava?”</p>
<p>“Well said. And yes, I used to be one of those Primordials. Ever since Feldway and the other leaders left for that alternate world, I’ve been taking care of monitoring activity in their place.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no <em>way</em>!”</p>
<p>“No, I mean it.”</p>
<p>This was a sheer bolt out of the blue for Ramiris. Deeno, a demon lord who even he himself admitted was mostly baggage, actually turned out to be someone important—in fact, someone named by Veldanava himself, the Creator. Ramiris never saw it coming. (Veldanava had also named Ramiris, but after reincarnating herself too many times, she had wholly forgotten that fact. It would pop back into her memory once she attained her complete form, but when that would be was anybody’s guess.)</p>
<p>“I mean, I thought the Primordials all went over to the other world!”</p>
<p>“Of course not, man. Once the surface world was repressed and everything was peaceful again, Sir Veldanava wanted that other world to become stable for him. You know that.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Well, yes, but…”</p>
<p>Ramiris was acting a little strange, but Deeno brushed it off. Pursuing it would just cause more strife for him, and trying to explain it all was even more of a pain. So he continued, assuming Ramiris knew the whole story.</p>
<p>“So Feldway and three other Primordial Angels were assigned to do that. Which left the other three, me included, to handle things here. We’re serving as Sir Veldanava’s boots on the ground.”</p>
<p>“You included?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I get it if you don’t believe me, but I used to treat the job really seriously at one point. But then some stuff happened, and I went from a seraphim to a fallen angel, that sort of thing. My partners are kind of the same way, too, so there’s no ‘pure’ Primordial Angel left any longer, actually.”</p>
<p>“Whoa, hey, you’re forgetting the most important part! I wanna <a id="page-53"></a>find out what kind of stuff happened! That’s more important than anything!”</p>
<p>Ramiris’s patience was clearly wearing thin. Deeno just sullenly sighed.</p>
<p>“Look, stop, all right? It’s too much of a pain to explain it. That stuff doesn’t matter to me anyway. Just use your imagination to fill in the blanks, okay? For now, I want to bargain with you.”</p>
<p><em>Don’t make us fill in the blanks</em>, thought everybody in the room at once. But Deeno’s indolence was world-renowned by now. There was no point, everyone knew, in asking him to explain himself, so they just gave up and listened to Deeno’s demands.</p>
<p>“So what do you want, huh?” Ramiris asked, speaking for the group.</p>
<p>“Like, what I just said. If Ramiris will work with us, I swear we won’t lay a finger on anyone in this labyrinth. If you refuse, well, my hands are tied. I’ll have to take you away, and I’ll kill everyone in my way if I have to.”</p>
<p>“You think I’m gonna say yes to that after what you did?”</p>
<p>“Nah, I guess not. But really, that’s not a problem at all. Ideally, you’ll wanna work with us, but if it comes to it, I’ve been told they’ll let this go if you shut down the labyrinth.”</p>
<p>“That’s what you want, huh? Who gave you those orders?”</p>
<p>“Mm, I dunno if I can tell you…”</p>
<p>“I mean, it’d take someone like Guy, essentially, if you’ll actually listen to someone’s orders.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, I dunno about that, y’know? Guy and I are appointed to the same post, kind of. Why would I need to listen to his—?”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t matter!”</p>
<p>“It does to me…”</p>
<p>Ramiris, ignoring Deeno’s rantings, thought for a moment.</p>
<p>“If it’s not Guy… I know! It’s Feldway, the Primordial Angel leader, isn’t it?! He came back from that other world and caught up with you while you were bumbling around, I bet. And you couldn’t say no to him, right?”</p>
<p>Like a broken wall clock, Ramiris’s deduction skills were right only sometimes. She would make all these incorrect assumptions and observations, then somehow use them to reach the right answer in the end—and this was one of those times.</p>
<p><a id="page-54"></a>“Wow… You’re right.”</p>
<p>Feldway had deployed numerous people for this plan, waiting for just the right moment to step forward. He had two goals in mind: one, assassinate Masayuki, and two, destroy the labyrinth.</p>
<p>Trying to conquer the labyrinth by force would be a gargantuan endeavor, one likely to falter and damage the plan in unpredictable ways. To prevent that, Feldway thought that capturing Ramiris first was vital. It was Feldway’s aim to eliminate all potential random elements, and that’s what led to this strategy. Deeno was just helping execute it.</p>
<p>“Hmm… And you’re a real punk, I know, so you’ve had a falling-out with Feldway, right? He’s a smart man, so I’m sure you guys never got along to start with.”</p>
<p>“H-hey! I’m not a punk! I just procrastinate a lot sometimes, is all. But yeah, I hate it when he orders me around like he’s my mom or something, so having him off the planet’s been a huge weight off my chest…”</p>
<p>As Deeno explained, they had fallen out of contact for a long time, but they still maintained an acquaintance.</p>
<p>“Uh-huh. So the attackers this time are the Primordial Angels?! That’s, like, <em>terrible</em> news for us! C’mon, Deeno! Stab Feldway in the back for me and join our side again!”</p>
<p>It was a pretty outlandish offer from Ramiris, an act even Deeno found all too charming. But he couldn’t agree to it.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s a sad thing, I know, but I got my stuff to deal with.”</p>
<p>Deeno found it impossible to defy Feldway’s will, for reasons he had some difficulty articulating. That was why he didn’t hesitate to turn her down.</p>
<p>“Boy… I guess you’re serious about this, huh? You sure got guts! All right, then—I’ll take you on. I’m part of the Octagram, I’ll remind ya! And I’m ready to protect this place until Rimuru comes back!”</p>
<p>Her mind was made up.</p>
<p>“Yeah? I <em>really</em> don’t wanna have to work for this, you know. Ideally I’d like to live in a world where I could get three hot meals a day doing nothing, but ah well. I sadly can’t go easy on you with this, but—hey—I won’t kill you or anything. So go ahead. Try to chase me outta here.”</p>
<p><a id="page-55"></a>Deeno went back to his usual languid, carefree expression, waving a hand as he replied. Plainly negotiations weren’t working. The conversation was over, and the battle began…</p>

<p class="tx1">“Take care of this for me, Beretta!” Ramiris shouted, perhaps channeling another demon lord she knew.</p>
<p>It was taken for granted that Ramiris herself wouldn’t be fighting. Deeno knew that, so instead of playing dumb, he turned toward Beretta, waiting to see what he’d break out.</p>
<p>The Control Center was now a battlefield, and although it was a pretty big space, it was full of desks, chairs, and other obstacles. It wasn’t too suited for battle at all, and Ramiris honestly wouldn’t have minded settling this elsewhere. But Deeno wasn’t going to allow that. There was every chance Ramiris would try to get away as they changed locations. Thus, Alpha and the other dryads briskly put away all the more important components of the room as the two combatants looked on. When they were done, battle began between Deeno and Beretta, neither of whom really cared where they duked it out.</p>
<p>Deeno was now carrying a broadsword about his height, produced from parts unknown. Its name was Fangsmasher, a thick, single-bladed weapon that could cave in a foe’s skull with sheer blunt force.</p>
<p>It was a ponderous weapon, one that poorly matched with Deeno’s normal outfit of a robe and chest plate, but it somehow seemed to match him anyway.</p>
<p>“What’s that sword capable of?”</p>
<p>“In terms of EP, its value is…one million!”</p>
<p>Alpha was at a loss for words in her report.</p>
<p>“What, a God-class blade?! From <em>Deeno</em>?! That’s <em>so</em> cheating!”</p>
<p>Ramiris’s complaints made little sense. Deeno let them pass, holding Fangsmasher up high ahead of him. Beretta, right in front of him, was unarmed—but his body was composed of the magisteel frame Rimuru had created for him. It was now well infused with Beretta’s own magic force, transforming it into adamantite. It looked exactly as Rimuru had made it, but it was now far tougher and sturdier than before—and it even had Beretta’s aura surrounding it, ensuring no <a id="page-57"></a>run-of-the-mill weapon could touch him. He was a walking weapon at the Legend class or higher, the toughest thing in the whole labyrinth.</p>
