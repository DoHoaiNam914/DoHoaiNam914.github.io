<p><a id="page-70"></a>“Um, what should we do…?”</p>
<p>“This is on a level far beyond anything we can intervene in. No point dwelling on it. We just gotta do what we can. C’mon, let’s go help everyone out!”</p>
<p>The sounds reaching his ears told Bernie that he was being targeted. The fact that he couldn’t even react to it at all told him just what sort of realm this fight was unfolding within. It wasn’t because some spell had weakened him; he was simply isolated, incapable of putting up a fight, no matter what he did. If so, he couldn’t just run around like an idiot here. He had to take action—a thought drilled into him by his military experience.</p>
<p>“All right. I don’t know who that Chronoa person is, but let’s leave this to her!”</p>
<p>Masayuki, meanwhile, was used to having exceptional events take place around him. Clearly, getting out of Dodge was his best bet.</p>
<p>So, regardless of what Bernie and Masayuki were doing, Chronoa and Feldway were crossing swords. But the fight didn’t last long. Countless strikes and parries occurred in the space of a few seconds. The witnesses wondered if there would ever be any resolution to this at all—but then Feldway noticed.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! So <em>that’s</em> where it was! It seems Lady Veldanava’s will is for me to win after all!”</p>
<p>“What’re you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Heh! None of your business. Then again, I <em>could</em> tell you, since you’ll be joining me shortly.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“Bow to my will…Sariel, Lord of Hope!!”</p>
<p>It was an absolute order—and even an angelic ultimate skill couldn’t resist Michael’s Ultimate Dominion.</p>
<p>“What…did you do…?”</p>
<p>“Oh? You’re still conscious? You live up to your reputation as the world’s strongest Hero, Chronoa. But resistance is useless. It’s only a matter of time before you fall under my rule.”</p>
<p>Feldway rejoiced at his sheer luck. Chronoa the Hero’s exploits were legend across the world, even in the Empire. Having Sariel work its way into her was truly a gift from the gods.</p>
<p>Chronoa fell to her knees, just as Feldway had willed her.</p>
<p><a id="page-71"></a>“I am Sariel. Your orders, Sir Michael…”</p>
<p>Her mask came off, revealing her face and the beauty it held—and those were the words that came from her sweet, pinkish lips.</p>
<p>Now Feldway was sure of his victory. And that assured confidence led him to make a serious mistake. Here he had control over Cornu, Mystic Leader and his close confidant, and Chronoa, a powerful Hero easily his equal (despite not being the “real” version of her). With the two of them, he reasoned, completing his mission would be simple. So:</p>
<p>“Very good. I want you to work with Cornu to kill the young man from before. I have other business awaiting me on the surface, so please take care of this for me.”</p>
<p>With that, he left the labyrinth.</p>

<p class="tx1">Seeing Masayuki and Bernie come running back, Venom wanted to curse the heavens themselves. Not that he minded them here. He could sense the rising, menacing presence lurking in the direction they had fled to, so he thought they had fallen dead by now.</p>
<p>“Way to survive, guys. What a relief!”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! Little early to be saying that. The enemy’s still around.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…”</p>
<p>Venom had to admit it—Cornu was strong. They had an immense advantage fighting in the labyrinth, but it wasn’t a matter of whether they could win. They weren’t even sure they’d survive. But despite all that, one look at Masayuki’s face, and Venom felt tremendously relieved. Baseless confidence filled his veins, and he couldn’t help but think it’d all work out somehow. Minitz and Caligulio, apparently feeling the same way, looked much healthier than before.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… Maybe it’s not appropriate, but I’m really having fun here.”</p>
<p>“Right you are again. I feel so light on my feet…as if His Majesty himself has joined me on the field.”</p>
<p>The two imperial officers shared a laugh. Even the vampires, who had no reason to be that involved in this, seemed eager to continue the fight.</p>
<p>Cornu, meanwhile, was confused. Just when he was about to attack, <a id="page-72"></a>a second Masayuki appeared out of nowhere. He looked closer, wondering if he’d misjudged his foe’s position, but it was definitely Masayuki. One of them had to be a fake, which was exactly what the disguised Jiwu was.</p>
<p>“How dare you trifle with me! All you worthless insects and your stupid tricks…!”</p>
<p>As enraged as Cornu was, he had no way of telling which Masayuki was real. His senses told him both were about equal in strength; each of them was a little hard for him to grasp. That’s what made this so maddening. If Cornu got riled up enough, he might easily kill them both at once—but then they’d get revived in parts unknown and he’d have to find them. Thus, Cornu faced an even more nerve-racking battle than before.</p>
<p>But then a helping hand arrived.</p>
<p>“Is that you, Sir Cornu? My name is Sariel, in the service of Sir Michael.”</p>
<p>An unfamiliar girl flew in faster than anyone’s eyes could follow, offering her help. Cornu had no reason to doubt her words. This girl, Sariel, was infused with the aura of Michael, just as she’d hinted.</p>
<p>“Thank you. You aim for the Masayuki on the right. Don’t kill him. He must be captured alive.”</p>
<p>Whether it was a stroke of luck or not, Cornu had just pointed out the real Masayuki.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Sariel nodded, her eyes turning toward her target. Masayuki, sensing this, began sweating a little. Then their eyes met.</p>
<p><em>Um…</em> “Sariel”<em>? That girl called herself Chronoa, and I’m not really sure what her deal is, but she turned traitor on us that fast?! Like…</em></p>
<p>Masayuki was lost for a moment. Then he gave up all hope. But Chronoa’s beauty was so flooring that he hardly felt any fear. In fact, he was too preoccupied to feel anything.</p>
<p><em>What’s with that girl? She’s so cute!</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t very appropriate, but the shock made him forget all about being on a battlefield. There was only one way to describe her—a beauty for the ages, the same conclusion a certain blond-haired demon lord had also made. It made Masayuki wish she would keep the mask off for good, among other stupid complaints that ran through his mind.</p>
<p><a id="page-73"></a>But as stupid as these thoughts were, they offered him a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>Sariel’s hand reached for her sword. Masayuki mentally prepared to die. His life flashed before his eyes in a sort of sloppy, haphazard manner.</p>
<p><em>Man, I can’t get over how hot this lady is. Seriously, she’s gotta be the hottest woman I’ve seen so far in my—</em></p>
<p>Then a frigid chill came over him. His self-preservation instincts were shouting at him to stop with this train of thought. He decided to trust them.</p>
<p><em>…Second hottest, actually. Yeah, probably second hottest. Because number one has to be…</em></p>
<p>The face in his mind belonged to a blue-haired beauty, the last one he’d seen in his original world.</p>
<p><em>Right, yeah, that one! She looked really sweet and everything, and way sexy, too…</em></p>
<p>Not even the threat of imminent death deterred Masayuki from his delusions. But that was actually the right answer.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Heroic true love detected. Now that the fourth hidden condition has been met, the unique skill Chosen One will evolve to the ultimate skill Lord of Heroes.</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Huh?</em></p>
<p>Masayuki was lost.</p>
<p>This wasn’t “love” he was feeling. It was more like primal lust than anything. Why was this voice in his mind trying to pass it off as virtuous or whatever? It was so embarrassing. He wished he could complain about it to someone.</p>
<p>And besides:</p>
<p><em>Why do I get an ultimate skill even though I didn’t even do anything?!</em></p>
<p>He screamed to himself internally, accusing the World Language of stretching way too far out to justify all that. But nothing could change these results. Besides, getting an ultimate skill whose purpose he knew nothing about didn’t exactly seem like a winning edge against Sariel in front of him.</p>
<p><em>I’m glad I got this and all, although it’s coming a little late, y’know? But hey, I’ve made it this far. If I’m done for, I wanna go out with a bang.</em></p>
<p><a id="page-74"></a>So Masayuki let a bold smile spread across his face. The effect was dramatic.</p>
<p>“Protect His Majesty!!”</p>
<p>The imperial soldiers on the scene, who had kept their distance up to now because they’d just get in the way, began an all-out suicide assault, like their lives no longer meant anything to them. Even those on the far outer edges of the field were doing this, and the results were even more awe-inspiring on soldiers closer by.</p>
<p>“I can feel it teeming within me! This must be what it feels like to be completely sure of your victory!”</p>
<p>With a shout, Caligulio thrust at Cornu. His hands had been full just defending himself before, but this self-sacrificial attack made Cornu flinch for just an instant.</p>
<p>Minitz was no slouch, either.</p>
<p>“Listen, imperial soldiers! Let His Majesty bask in your courageous force!”</p>
<p>Driving his army on, he kept his eyes on Sariel, applying Oppressor to keep the pressure on her. A unique skill would normally never work against an ultimate skill, but this time, the attack was just enough to force Sariel back a little.</p>
<p>Even the vampires were springing into action.</p>
<p>“Strange, huh? I feel so omnipotent right now…and it feels <em>nice</em>!”</p>
<p>So shouted one of them, a smile on his face, as he leaped at Cornu and had the lower half of his body blown off.</p>
<p>“Hyaaah! Taste the heat of my full-power energy beam!!”</p>
<p>Not a single care was given as they pressed forward, died, revived, and repeated the process again.</p>
<p>“Hyah-ha-ha-ha-ha! I love this!!”</p>
<p>Some of them were even using their perpetual resurrection skills to serve as human (vampire?) shields for the other soldiers. <em>Intense</em> wasn’t the half of it. This was a vast, vicious attack like nothing before.</p>
<p>What made it possible? Masayuki’s new ability, of course. Unlike his unique-level skills, Lord of Heroes (while firmly in the lowest rank of the ultimate family) granted him the chance to compete against anyone else’s ultimate skill. It took someone with an EP of at least 100,000 to even withstand the effects of casting it, but even if Masayuki lacked that, his luck was giving him enough of a bonus to make <a id="page-75"></a>up for it—and anyone who followed in his footsteps was given similar protection.</p>
<p>Truly, it wrecked the whole balance of the fight. Just him alone on the field could reverse the tide of battle; it was an unbelievable ability. And if Masayuki hadn’t had the chance to see Chloe Aubert’s unmasked face just now, he never would’ve awakened to it. Now, perhaps, it should be clear just how terrible a mistake Feldway had made.</p>
<p>Either way, the battle was now firmly at a stalemate. This very delicate balance held reign over the scene for a bit more than ten minutes. Naturally, that wasn’t going to be enough to defeat the tag team of Cornu and Sariel—but realistically speaking, the battle was already decided. The moment Masayuki unlocked his ultimate skill, all the paths came together.</p>
<p>Now, with the warriors finally buying enough time for themselves, the moment had come. Velgrynd had just been erased from this world…and at the same time, the gears of fate began to turn.</p>

<p class="tx1"><span class="special"><em>Confirmed. Trans-dimensional soul corridor with the subject Velgrynd established.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Huh?</em></p>
<p>Before Masayuki could think of anything else, she appeared.</p>
<p>At first, it felt to him like a wall of pure energy. But it wasn’t. It took the form of a person—a beautiful woman, one from his own past. The cardinal aura she emitted, framed by her almost blindingly beautiful blue hair, belonged to Velgrynd the Flame Dragon, manifested right here on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Her eyes contained the force to make all of creation bow to her. No one dared move; it was like time had stopped. Sariel was the same, silently waiting for Cornu’s orders—little more could be expected, given how this new presence had only just been born within her body.</p>
<p>All the imperial soldiers on the scene immediately recognized what this was. This was the most powerful figure in existence, the one who kept the Empire safe over so many years. Word had spread that she <a id="page-76"></a>was locked in combat with Veldora right now, but apparently that was a false rumor, because here she was…in an embrace with Masayuki. There was just one explanation for this tender move. She was in love with him.</p>
<p>“I was looking for you, Ludora. I’ve wanted to see you for so, so long…”</p>
<p>She turned her closed eyes toward Masayuki as she held him close. Then she brought both hands to his head and gave him a warm kiss.</p>
<p>It wasn’t how Masayuki had thought this would work out.</p>
<p><em>Ah… Whoa, soft. Or sweet? Or…wait, aaaaaahhh?!!</em></p>
<p>His head began to boil. In a flash, all reasoning ability was erased. A terrifyingly beautiful woman was hugging him—which was fine and all. But:</p>
<p><em>M-my first kiss!!</em></p>
<p>The casual outfit, just a simple T-shirt and jeans, combined with Velgrynd’s natural beauty created a supremely hip look. And she was kissing him. He’d be lying if he claimed not to like it. But he couldn’t forget one important issue here. This stunning woman had just called him Ludora.</p>
<p><em>Oh God, she totally thinks I’m someone else…</em></p>
<p>Now wasn’t the point where he could stand there and tell her, <em>Sorry, I think you got the wrong guy</em>. For one thing, she’d need to take her lips off his face before he could say anything. Masayuki needed to get a breath of air soon.</p>
<p><em>C-calm down… You need to stay calm in moments like these…</em></p>
<p>He reassessed the situation. This was a battlefield. His enemy was right in front of him. He was making out with this world-beating beauty. And thanks to being this close range to her, he couldn’t help but notice her ample chest against his. It was sublime, almost heavenly bliss—but he couldn’t let himself enjoy it.</p>
<p><em>What am I even doing?</em> he thought as his mind grew more muddled. One thing he knew for sure was that once she realized she had the wrong guy, his life was over right then. With all the many, many people witnessing this, it’d be impossible to talk his way out of it. Even with Masayuki’s preposterous luck, he couldn’t expect this to turn out in his favor at all. He was experiencing the sheer bliss of enlightenment, but he knew that his promised doom was just around the corner.</p>
<p>So he stopped thinking. He was about to die anyway, and he just <a id="page-78"></a>wanted to appreciate the fact that he got to experience this kiss at the very end. So he defiantly enjoyed his final few seconds of life. His consciousness grew hazy, like he was having a dream…and then the misunderstandings began to spread.</p>
