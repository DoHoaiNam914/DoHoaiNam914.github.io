<p><a id="page-121"></a>As Milim apparently put it to him: “No matter how hard you try, you’re never gonna house more magicules within your body. But don’t worry! If you can Unify with Ranga, that immediately solves the problem—and once you learn how to master the increase in power, you’ll be fine! So leave the magicule surge to Ranga and just try to polish up your senses!”</p>
<p>“So it was nothing but battle-sense training since then,” he concluded with a smile. He had also learned the extra skill Sage, which let him speed up his thoughts. I was pretty impressed.</p>

<p class="tx1">Having Milim back was a boon, actually. After leaving Adalmann, I had been making the necessary preparations all night, just barely wrapping everything up in time.</p>
<p>Promptly, I took out one of the items I had completed. Veldora, Ramiris, and Milim each gave it curious stares as I held it in my hand.</p>
<p>“Pay attention, everyone! I have a special item here, something I’ve been developing for a little while. Personally, I think it’s groundbreaking. It’ll help us solve the problems we’re facing in the labyrinth, and it’ll also add some more fun to all our lives.”</p>
<p>I gave all three one of their own. I didn’t expect Milim in today, but I was planning to invite her over once I had something practical to share, so hers was all set to go.</p>
<p>The idea for this came from the homunculus Archduke Erald used earlier. I figured that having access to temporary bodies would let you do some pretty neat stuff.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“Never seen this before. Do I eat it?”</p>
<p>“Hmm… To me, it looks like a vessel for the soul—or the like.”</p>
<p>Milim, Ramiris, and Veldora seemed equally curious. No, Ramiris, it wasn’t food. Did she think <em>everything</em> I brought over for her was food? Oh, well.</p>
<p>Veldora was fairly close to the right answer. These items were quasi-compartments for souls. When transferring your consciousness <a id="page-122"></a>to a homunculus, a corridor is established between it and your soul using some magic. I had Analyzed and Assessed the core components of that magic, revising them for my own needs. This was what I gave to Treyni—a vessel for her chaos core. I called it a pseudo-soul.</p>
<p>“Veldora’s almost got it. This device imitates a soul vessel. I can’t provide a soul itself, so instead, I tried to create a substitute that mimics one.”</p>
<p>“Hohh. Why did you do that?”</p>
<p>Veldora, maybe pleased he got it right, tried to sound as intelligent as possible. There was no need for me to put on airs; I could go ahead and just state my aims, but before that, I wanted to surprise them a little. After all the effort I spent on this, I thought I deserved a bit of fun.</p>
<p>“Hey, not so fast, not so fast. I’ll explain everything to you, okay? But next up, I’ve also got this. Take it and try to imagine a monster in your mind. Any one is fine.”</p>
<p>I then took out a set of black balls, each about the size of a fist, and handed them to my audience.</p>
<p>Veldora gave it an odd look. “Hmm? Any type?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Either an existing one or whatever crazy thing comes to mind for you.”</p>
<p>“So a goblin or an orc? Or a horned hare, or an ogre bear, or anything?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Sure. But make sure it’s something you like. I don’t want you to complain about your choice afterward.”</p>
<p>“All right. A monster, then? Do these create monsters who you’ll repel labyrinth challengers with…?”</p>
<p>“Something like that.”</p>
<p>He was always supersharp with things like this.</p>
<p>Satisfied enough with my guidance, the three of them picked up their black orbs and sank into contemplation. These items were called master cores, and the magical core of Charybdis came in handy with developing them. I had that kept in isolation within my Stomach, but Raphael had finally finished analyzing it. It was the core of a large monster, as well as the root of its power; apparently, <a id="page-123"></a>in the transformation into demon lord, I had consumed all the negative energy inside, so it was now an empty shell. That made it perfect for housing a soul vessel…and now, here we were.</p>
<p>After a few moments, the magicules in the air began to interact with the master cores, creating monsters—the exact ones each bearer imagined.</p>
<p>“Well? Pretty neat, huh? And like Veldora said, we can use these monsters to engage parties in the labyrinth. That’s what I gathered all of you here for.”</p>
<p>That wasn’t the <em>only</em> reason, but nobody was listening anyway. They were all marveling at the monsters they created.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Meanwhile, I was busy making my own monster—a ghost, a transparent, disembodied soul floating in the air. I’ll omit its stats, but one special skill it had was Cancel Physical Attack—as a ghost, no physical attack worked on it. It couldn’t attack physically, either, of course; magic was its only offense.</p>
<p>Next up was Veldora. There was now a skeleton standing next to him. It couldn’t cast magic, although it could learn how later on—with the right evolution, it could also master Battlewill.</p>
<p>Milim, meanwhile, had generated a bouncy, lustrous blob. It had no limbs, its color a garish red that demanded your attention. It was a slime.</p>
<p>Um…</p>
<p>“Why’d you make a slime? Are you picking on me?!”</p>
<p>“N-no, um, you asked me to go with something I liked. What’s the issue?”</p>
<p>Now she was firing back at me. Ah well. She was clearly happy, at least, her eyes all but shouting “Slime!” out loud. I was wondering about the Day-Glo red, however.</p>
<p>Finally, we had Ramiris. What was this? A knight? Or a suit of armor? Yes, it was a suit of living armor, to be exact—full plate, but looking worn out for some reason. It was still the largest out of the four monsters we made. Maybe Ramiris’s hang-ups about her size drove her to imagine something big. The fact that it was completely empty inside was pretty appropriate for her.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-124"></a>Everyone peered closely at the monsters they just willed to life. But the surprises were only beginning.</p>
<p>“All right, so listen. As Veldora pointed out, I’m thinking about using the monsters we created to dispatch the intruders inside our labyrinth.”</p>
<p>“Mm? Intruders…?”</p>
<p>“Yes. These monsters are the guardians of the labyrinth, so anyone stepping inside has to be intruders, right?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What?”</p>
<p>“Mmm, indeed. Remember, Ramiris, we are running this labyrinth. Calling them ‘challengers’ is rather strange, if you think about it.”</p>
<p>“Yes… Now that you mention it, you’re right!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.”</p>
<p>Veldora’s stepping in to explain matters was convincing enough for Ramiris. Milim, meanwhile, pretended she knew the entire time. I doubted she did at all, but I needed to move things along.</p>
<p>“Right. So we’ll be taking on the intruders with these…but do you think it’ll be possible at all?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. They are far too weak.”</p>
<p>“My armor <em>looks</em> pretty cool, but I’m not too optimistic, no.”</p>
<p>“Rimuru, I’m disappointed in you! You <em>know</em> I’m too smart a girl to expect anything from these.”</p>
<p>Heh-heh-heh. Just as I thought, they were spouting off whatever popped into their minds. Why were Ramiris and Milim acting so haughty with me? That set me off a bit, but I needed to act my age here.</p>
<p>“Well, the story doesn’t end when you create them. The <em>real</em> show begins now, so I’d like all of you to sit down and relax, okay? Now, what I’d like you to do is point your pseudo-souls at your monster and chant ‘Possess!’ out loud.”</p>
<p>There were some incredulous looks, but they all settled into their seats for me. We had some pretty comfy chairs in this conference room; the cushioning was excellent.</p>
<p><a id="page-125"></a>Then, all at once:</p>
<p>“““Possess!”””</p>
<p>The moment we all said it together, the pseudo-souls in our hands lit up as they were absorbed into the monsters, fusing with the master cores inside them. This resulted in a complete avatar core—and when it was done, my consciousness blacked out.</p>
<p>In another moment, my view had changed. My Magic Sense, something I had on at all times, immediately shrank down its range, drastically affecting my vision. I had my five simulated senses now, so it was still far better than my first few days in this world, but the other three had never experienced anything like that, so it must’ve been a bear to deal with.</p>
<p>I looked around as I thought about this. In my hazy vision, I could see a skeleton stretching out its legs, a slime zooming around at surprising speed, and a suit of living armor methodically toddling around like a classic wind-up robot. All three of them had successfully “possessed” their monster.</p>
<p>Even now, I could feel myself getting used to this. It felt far more natural than anticipated—like it was my own body. A body that was far less capable than my own, however, so it was hard to move around. But once you figured out how you moved, it got easier to predict how your body would react to your will. You didn’t need long at all to move it exactly as intended.</p>
<p>The same was true for the other three.</p>
<p><em>“““This is great!”””</em></p>
<p>After a few minutes of testing out their new bodies, they all shouted in unison.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it? What do you think of my research, huh?”</p>
<p>“Amazing. Truly amazing, Rimuru!” Veldora cried.</p>
<p>“That’s classic Rimuru, isn’t it? No wonder I thought you were such a great guy!” Ramiris agreed.</p>
<p>“I knew it all along,” said Milim. “I’ve always believed in you!!”</p>
<p>They were hopelessly wrapped around my finger. <em>But hey, glad they’re happy.</em> “Well, looks like we’ve got a resounding success. And now that you’ve all jumped into those monsters, I don’t think I need to explain what we have to do, do I?”</p>
