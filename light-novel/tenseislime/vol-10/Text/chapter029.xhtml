<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter029">BEHIND THE CURTAIN</a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page-253"></a>Glenda Attley, the beautiful ex-mercenary, pulled the trigger with every intent to kill.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The gun she had kept since she was summoned to this world didn’t betray her. It was already a part of her body, to the point that it no longer even required maintenance. Combine that with her Sniper unique skill, and there was nobody who could stop her.</p>
<p>Sniper, as a skill, provided three abilities. One was Magic Sense, tuned to a perception level far beyond the norm; one was Compute Prediction, letting her read and understand the results of people’s actions; and the other was called Control Space. This third ability, in particular, made Glenda practically superhuman, allowing her to connect any two points in space that she could picture in her mind.</p>
<p>Anything she had physical sight of was within gunshot range for her. She could shoot from directly above the heads of her targets, and she was free to ignore any obstacles in her way as she landed a bullet home. She could also ignore all gravity and air resistance, making long-range shots possible without a sniper rifle.</p>
<p>Put this all together, and Glenda had never failed a mission. But after her last blunder, she came to realize that there was always someone better out there.</p>
<p><em>That was doomed. A monster like that’s too much for me.</em></p>
<p><a id="page-254"></a>The moment she saw him, Glenda realized how dangerous this opponent was. That man, Diablo, was impervious to her handgun. It wasn’t a matter of physical attacks not working. Glenda had two types of bullets, a normal one and a magic-infused set. The first type was for when she couldn’t leave any magical traces behind, but for monsters with physical resistance, Glenda concentrated her own magical force into bullet form, an original magic skill of hers.</p>
<p>She treasured the ability to handle anything that came her way, and so Glenda truly had no blind spots. But Diablo didn’t work that way. Her instincts warned her to run from him, her Compute Prediction skill foreseeing nothing but her death. Even with her standard-breaking strengths, she could see no possible path to victory—a hard lesson in reality for her to take that day.</p>
<p class="space-break1">And now Glenda had stretched her Magic Sense skills to their limits to carry out an assassination.</p>
<p>The bullet she fired appeared just a foot or so away from her target. Now, in the blink of an eye, it’d demolish his head—or it should have.</p>
<p>That eighteen-inch (or so) gap was very carefully selected. When connecting two points in space, the connection would fail if the destination point overlapped with a certain amount of mass. In other words, if the target unexpectedly moved, the connection Glenda built might cut out. That’s why she settled on eighteen inches. Even someone with godly reflexes couldn’t respond quickly enough to something that close, especially a bullet traveling at the speed of sound.</p>
<p><em>That monster is one thing, but the prince of a kingdom is no sweat. Well, no point crying about it. I’ll have to come up with a strategy for the next time I see him.</em></p>
<p>She was much more confident about today’s mission—but at the next moment, her face filled with surprise and foreboding. The bullet that was supposed to shatter the prince’s head had vanished.</p>
<p>“No! What just happened?!”</p>
<p>The unthinkable had occurred, something impossible under any normal circumstances. She didn’t know why it took place, but if someone had done something, it had to be that demon lord.</p>
<p><a id="page-255"></a>“Him! That devil bastard’s boss! Did I underestimate <em>him</em>, too?!”</p>
<p>That was Glenda’s initial reaction.</p>
<p>For a moment, she thought about firing again. Her perfect ambush had just failed, so any further attempt had even less of a chance. She knew that, but it meant that she’d fail her mission. Her bosses—Maribel and the elder Granville—would never allow that. It made her hesitate, and thus she failed to escape soon enough.</p>
<p>“Heh. I would say so. You <em>did</em> underestimate Sir Rimuru. And I have no interest in forgiving you for that.”</p>
<p>“<em>Tch!</em> Who’re you?”</p>
<p>“My name is Soei, faithful Covert Agent of the demon lord Rimuru.”</p>
<p>Glenda was shocked. But quickly, she resigned herself. The man didn’t ask her name in return—not because he didn’t care about her, she thought, but because that could wait until he captured and interrogated her. If she could just get away, she could keep what she knew concealed.</p>
<p>The assassination failed. And being captured afterward would be an even worse fate. Any further mistakes, and she’d be disposed of as useless. Glenda had seen many of her compatriots walk that road, and to her, getting away was job number one right now.</p>
<p>She squared up against her foe.</p>
<p>“…So you were expecting an attack?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Everything was worked out in Sir Rimuru’s mind. If you want to resist, go right ahead. I have no interest in killing you, but the more you resist, the more painful this will be for you.”</p>
<p>“Hah! How kind of you. In that case, I’ll do what I want here, thank you.”</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Glenda fired instead of waiting for a response. This was a single, regular bullet; she had sixteen left, but she doubted they’d work against the magic-born who called himself Soei. A magic bullet would, probably…but instead, Glenda took out her military knife, slashing at Soei with a refined, well-honed motion.</p>
<p>Soei dodged it with the minimum movement required. Glenda smiled at this. The knife was infused with her magical force, making it both a physical and magical weapon. She did this when <a id="page-256"></a>facing foes where physical attack wouldn’t be enough, and Soei just revealed that he saw it as a threat.</p>
<p>Plus, Glenda had noticed another habit of Soei’s.</p>
<p><em>This guy’s the type who hates extraneous motion. He may be more susceptible to simpler methods. Let’s see how comfortable he’ll be in a moment…</em></p>
<p>She unleashed another attack—knife in her right hand, gun in her left. Unhesitant, she repeatedly pulled the trigger, gauging Soei’s response. As she predicted, there was no reaction. He must’ve known they’d have no effect on him—but he kept his guard up, staying on the alert for her knife.</p>
<p><em>Not bad. Maybe the strongest opponent I’ve ever had</em>.</p>
<p>Diablo didn’t count in Glenda’s mind. Foes she never had a chance against weren’t tabulated in her records.</p>
<p>Soei’s left pointer finger moved. Glenda didn’t miss it, sensing the danger and instantly performing a backward somersault to dodge. There was now a sizable distance between them, and that was the right move for her to make, because in the next instant, an ultra-thin wire advanced upon her original position.</p>
<p>“Hohh. You have good instincts.”</p>
<p>“Well, thank you. You’re not so bad, either.”</p>
<p>The light exchange was punctuated by a gunshot from Glenda. It wasn’t a threat to Soei. He went straight at her, not bothering to evade.</p>
<p><em>So simple. I’m glad to have opponents like these. They’re so easy to deal with.</em></p>
<p>Magic bullets didn’t require any firing. They could be shot without a sound, so if she mixed one in with her regular bullets…</p>
<p>Now that her attack pattern was established, she’d strike with her <em>real</em> attack while his guard was down. That was Glenda’s standard strategy—take a seemingly wasted shot and turn it into an instant kill. Even if you were expecting it, it’d be tricky to dodge it out of the blue.</p>
<p>And Soei demonstrated the same reactions all the other titans she defeated before did. He took the bullet in the right shoulder and was sent flying back.</p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! So much for you, handsome man. Rama fell for the same trick. The more confident you are, the more effective a simple move like that becomes.”</p>
<p><a id="page-257"></a>Glenda laughed loudly—but her eyes were still alert, surveying the damage to Soei. Going easy after felling your prey was out of the question. That was the ironclad rule of the battlefield, and Glenda would never relax without checking her foe for a pulse. Besides, she didn’t think she killed him with a single shot anyway.</p>
<p>“…I see. More of a handful than I thought.”</p>
<p>“Being a sore loser now? Well, sorry. If you’ve seen my face, my only choice is to take you out.”</p>
<p>Soei, back on his feet, had lost his right arm. The fight seemed to be Glenda’s to win. That’s why she was more careful than ever as she pointed her gun forward.</p>
<p><em>Magic bullets work on him. And now, with my next move, I’ll blow his brains out.</em></p>
<p>Launching her Sniper unique skill, Glenda cautiously steadied her aim.</p>
<p>“Heh. Don’t worry. I’ve been asked to capture you. I imagine Sir Rimuru wants information from you, but he’s a gentle person. Cooperate with him, and you won’t be killed.”</p>
<p>“Don’t lecture me like that <em>now</em>!!”</p>
<p>With a shout, Glenda fired—three bullets toward his head, two toward his heart. Five magic bullets, whizzing straight to their targets. Then the first three made the leap in space, reappearing in front, above, and to the right side of his head. The other two quickly followed, materializing before his heart and at an angle behind it.</p>
<p>All five bullets hit home, shattering Soei’s body.</p>
<p>These Warp Shots were Glenda’s pièce de résistance. Magically created bullets, unlike their regular counterparts, could disrupt and scatter magicules. Even if he could regenerate his body, those shots made it impossible.</p>
<p>No matter what your skills were with a sword or spear, being targeted by supersonic bullets from all directions would be impossible for even the greatest of masters to handle. Based on her past experiences, Glenda knew full well what she was capable of. That was the secret to her continued survival—and that was why she now checked to be sure Soei was dead.</p>
<p>His body was, in fact, collapsing into black smoke in front of her <a id="page-258"></a>eyes. She breathed a sigh of relief. Since the moment she caught sight of him, a dark anxiety had been smoldering in her heart. It wasn’t as vivid as it was with Diablo, but her instincts told her this was a dangerous foe.</p>
<p>“It’s over. You were a tough one. I didn’t have any capacity to go easy on you.”</p>
<p>Glenda was so relieved that the words just fell out of her. But that relief came just a bit too early. Suddenly, behind her, she heard a voice that couldn’t possibly be there.</p>
<p>“Oh, really? In that case, why not give up and let me capture you?”</p>
<p>She reflexively leaped out of the way. Turning around in a panic, she saw Soei himself standing there.</p>
<p>“Th-that’s crazy! Didn’t you die just now…?!”</p>
<p>“Heh. <em>You’re</em> the crazy one. You think that was enough to kill me? I have no reason to lose to you anyway.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll just do it one more time—<em>Whoaaa?!</em>”</p>
<p>Glenda froze. Anyone would. Unbelievably to her, she now sensed Soei’s presence on all sides of her. She immediately activated Magic Sense, but it just revealed the very truth she didn’t want to know.</p>
<p>“It—it can’t be! Wh-why are all of these <em>physical</em> bodies?! That’s ridiculous! What kind of joke <em>is</em> this?!”</p>
<p>“It’s simple. I have a skill known as Replication. That is all. And while my Replications aren’t as powerful as my true self, you should be proud that you defeated at least one of them.”</p>
<p>Soei—or at least, one of the four Soeis in the room—offered Glenda his sincere compliments. But now, escape was possible.</p>
<p>“God<em>damn</em> it…!!”</p>
<p>With a barbaric scream, Glenda lunged at Soei—and at that moment, her desperate last stand began.</p>

<p class="tx1">On a balcony overlooking a garden blooming with flowers, a girl, a boy, and an old man sat at a round table facing one another. It was Maribel, Yuuki, and Johann.</p>
<p>“We messed up. We botched it,” Maribel said quietly. Despite <a id="page-259"></a>that, she didn’t seem too affected. She had predicted this, and in a way, it was part of the plan.</p>
<p>“What a disaster for Gaban, though. After all the devotion he had for you.”</p>
<p>Johann, seated in front of Maribel, was holding a glass of wine as he lamented the count’s fate. He may not have felt that strongly for him, but even he had just a twinge of sympathy for the man. Gaban, after all, was one of the Five Elders, just like Johann—or maybe <em>was</em>, by now. His fall was already in progress.</p>
<p>“Gaban was incompetent. All that time he spent living in Englesia—did he develop a love for its king, perhaps? He would certainly have brought them under his control faster otherwise…”</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly. Not even we in the Rozzos have reached into the central core of Englesia yet. Gaban couldn’t—”</p>
<p>“No. No, you’re wrong. It’s easy to seize the core. Just kill them all and leave a single infant remaining. And if that infant shares a blood lineage with Gaban, all the better.”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, if you put it that way, but…”</p>
<p>To Maribel, and all the bloodstained history she knew, this wasn’t that radical an approach. In fact, she thought it was the peaceful way. It kept the body count low. But Johann wanted to explain to her that Englesia’s security wasn’t about to just let that happen. It was an easy thing to envision—less so to act upon.</p>
<p>“But I’m interested in those magical inquisitors.”</p>
<p>“…Those unusual-looking people who served the king?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Impudent, aren’t they? So impudent. They must’ve built up their military to oppose the Rozzos.”</p>
<p>“What do you think of them?”</p>
<p>“Mmm, they’re strong, I suppose. Gaban told me as much after he experienced them for himself.”</p>
<p>Maribel was able to share information with those under her Avarice rule, to a certain extent. Anything her target learned, Maribel could tap into as well. Thus, she now used Gaban as a throwaway pawn. She wanted to learn about those inquisitors, so she had him engineer a crime so heinous they’d <em>have</em> to step up. All that foolishness aimed at the demon lord Rimuru was perfect <a id="page-260"></a>for that, and considering Count Gaban was Englesian nobility, the magic inquisitors were bound to come knocking.</p>
<p>She saw all of that. And just as she hoped for, she now knew the secrets behind the inquisitors. In fact, they weren’t anything too deep—just people infused with enough monster force to become magic-born. They hadn’t worked and trained themselves to perfection, like the magic-born Razen of old Farmus.</p>
<p>To Maribel, these inquisitors—bereft even of sentience, a side effect of their bodies rejecting the monster elements injected into them—were just uninteresting toys. But they regained that sentience when not in magic-born form, so depending on what you implanted in them, they could work in a variety of environments. Their strength, each an over-A by themselves, was nothing to sniff at, either. As she saw it, they could be useful enough.</p>
<p>“How fearsome. So you approved of Gaban’s scheme, even though you knew it would fail, just so you could learn that?”</p>
<p>“No. My goal was to help build up your trust. Now the demon lord Rimuru sees you as trustworthy.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean…?”</p>
<p>No, he didn’t need to ask. He understood it well enough. Her goal from the start was to eliminate Rimuru; the magical inquisitors were just a nice bonus. Maribel just wanted Johann to tell her about Rimuru’s internal dealings.</p>
<p><em>And if I don’t give that to her, I’ll be snuffed out as quickly as Gaban was…?</em></p>
<p>He didn’t think he was as incompetent as Gaban. But nonetheless, Johann felt an inscrutable sort of fear toward Maribel.</p>
<p><em>You—you must be kidding. Here I am, one of the Five Elders, and this little girl is bossing me around…</em></p>
<p>He may have thought that, but he would never daresay it. So he decided to return to their main subject.</p>
<p>“What do you think about pitting these inquisitors against the demon lord? Pin some manner of crime on Rimuru—”</p>
<p>“We can’t. We just can’t. All it’d do is anger the demon lord. Yes, the magical inquisitors are strong, but that’s it. Nothing at all that could hold its own against a demon lord. It’s silly even to consider it.”</p>
<p><a id="page-261"></a>“That much so…? So wouldn’t teaming up with the demon lord be our best bet, then?”</p>
<p>Maribel shook her head. “That won’t work. It won’t work at all. Besides, apart from Grandfather, every single one of you are suffering under a serious misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>“Misunderstanding?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes, exactly. The misunderstanding that humans are equal to monsters. Do you understand why I proposed to Grandfather that we eliminate the demon lord?”</p>
<p>“Because he’s building a new economic bloc that will eventually become a financial threat to us?”</p>
<p>“Right. But that’s just our cover story. The <em>real</em> reason is because, in time, we’ll be helpless against him.”</p>
<p>Maribel, this little girl, struck fear in Johann’s heart—and now this girl was looking fearful herself as she spoke.</p>
<p>“How do you mean by that?” Johann asked, pressing her to continue.</p>
<p>“The demon lord Rimuru possesses a staggering amount of war power. With <em>that</em> backing him up, what do you think would happen if he decided to negotiate with someone?”</p>
<p>“That…?!”</p>
<p>Only then did Johann stumble upon the true danger. In this world, wars between nations almost never took place—they needed to save their fighting ability for the monsters who threatened them. The Council stepped in to handle cross-border issues, and that inevitably meant those with the most economic strength were able to speak the loudest. Even the largest of states, such as Englesia and the former Farmus, didn’t have enough of a military to make enemies out of every Council member.</p>
<p>“And you realize that their military’s not their only asset, either, right? Being bound by rules is the same thing as losing your freedom…but if you can create the rules yourself, you don’t have to lose anything, do you see?”</p>
<p>Tempest might follow the Council’s rules at first, but after that, nobody could say. And if Tempest decided to spread its own values to the Western Nations, soon the entire region would have to take orders from them. The demon lord’s rule would be complete—a <a id="page-262"></a>totally peaceful coup. He could threaten them with warfare, he could apply economic pressure—but either way, the stronger nation always gained the power to punish others.</p>
<p>“It’s funny. So very funny. And as time passes, there will come an era where everything will need to go through the demon lord.”</p>
<p>“And—and if…”</p>
<p>If that happened, even Johann know where it led.</p>
<p>“But doesn’t the demon lord seek to coexist with…”</p>
<p>Maribel stopped Johann with her cold eyes. “It’s stupid. So stupid. Not just you, but the entire Council. They’re all idiots.”</p>
<p>Then she took pains to explain matters in a way Johann could understand. Essentially, things may be fine now, but the future was an unknown. If humankind, after forgetting about the threat of the Storm Dragon, ever did anything to cross Rimuru…</p>
<p>“I don’t know what the life span of a demon lord is, but humans are such short-lived animals. If we don’t stop the demon lord’s ambitions right here, the Rozzos’ one fervent desire is as good as scuttled.”</p>
<p>A demon lord could always change his stripes. And while humans may come and go, Maribel absolutely refused to expect human values from such long-lived rulers.</p>
<p>“You see? So that’s why ideas like partnering with a demon lord, or taking advantage of a demon lord—they’re all wrong, down to the very roots. None of them would ever work.”</p>
<p>Johann was silenced. Then, like the final nail on the coffin, one of her Blood Shadow troops chose that moment to make a magical call to her.</p>
<p>He was reporting on Glenda’s defeat.</p>
<p>“No… They captured Glenda?!”</p>
<p>Johann looked shocked. “…Is that true?”</p>
<p>Not even Maribel could hide her surprise. Glenda’s wariness was always commendable; no matter the danger involved, she always made it home alive. Maribel trusted her—not her personality, but that animal-like craving for life.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it. That clever, conniving vixen…”</p>
<p>Glenda was one of the standout results from the Rozzo family’s secret summoning program, an otherworlder forced by their spell to <a id="page-263"></a>remain faithful to them. Her strength was well-known by now, and the family treated her like a full-fledged tactical weapon.</p>
<p>The idea of her being defeated and captured was beyond belief for Johann. Elder or not, he was a normal human, and unlike Granville or Maribel, he could only think about things in standard human terms.</p>
<p>Maribel ignored his awestruck muttering as she pondered her options. <em>Defeating him is out of the question. But if we can take rule over him, all our problems are gone. We’ll have to do it.</em></p>
<p>“…We’ll set a trap,” Maribel said.</p>
<p>“A trap? What are you intending to do?” Yuuki asked, breaking his silence.</p>
<p>She turned to him. “Right. A trap. Your people are going on a ruins expedition trip with the demon lord Rimuru, aren’t you? We’ll set a trap there.”</p>
<p>She wasn’t asking for his opinion. This was a finalized plan, and it was set in stone.</p>
<p>“Right, Kagali’s headed there…but I don’t think that’s such a good idea, y’know?”</p>
<p>“Why is that?”</p>
<p>“Because the demon lord Milim’s joining them,” Yuuki warned. “It’ll be too dangerous to hatch anything.”</p>
<p>In his opinion, they needed to win Rimuru’s confidence first, then work out more of a long-term plan with him. But Maribel’s mind was already made up.</p>
<p>“No. No, I can’t have that. The more time we give him, the more trouble that demon lord will be. That’s what my instincts are telling me. Yuuki, is there a way you can keep Milim from coming along?”</p>
<p>“That’s even less possible. He’s already eyeing me. If I try putting a stop to it, it’s basically admitting that I’m tricking them.”</p>
<p>“Fair enough. Then let’s bring down the demon lord Milim as well.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Yuuki asked, dazed.</p>
<p>“That’s ridiculous! Maribel, that’s not just beyond reckless; it’s beyond the realm of possibility!” Johann stood up out of his seat.</p>
<p>Their reactions were perfectly understandable. Even crushing one demon lord required a careful, foolproof plan. But two at the same time? It was deliberately giving yourself no chance.</p>
<p><a id="page-264"></a>But Maribel still smiled. “I will put everything I have into it. <em>Everything</em>, do you understand?”</p>
<p>“It’s still impossible!” Yuuki cried. “You say ‘<em>everything</em>,’ but my Moderate Jesters are all busy with their own work right now. And—”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how useful they are, but if they’re not available, we’ll proceed without them.”</p>
<p>Maribel shuttered Yuuki’s objections before he could finish stating them. To her, the Jesters weren’t worthy of consideration—or, to be more accurate, she already knew a better force, a large one, that could take on demon lords for her.</p>
<p>“…But you know, Yuuki, I had you supply a certain something from the Dragon’s Nest for me before. I think it’s high time we use it.”</p>
<p>“You mean <em>that</em>? That’s <em>such</em> a bad idea! Not even <em>I</em> can control it!”</p>
<p>“Not a problem. It belonged to the demon lord Milim anyway—we’re just returning it for her. Maybe we could say that Clayman was saving it as his last resort, and his surviving loyal troops set it off? Then Milim’s rage won’t be directed at us.”</p>
<p>“If something goes wrong, it could cause untold damage to human areas…”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“N-no, um…”</p>
<p>Johann attempted to talk Maribel out of this but was completely shut out. She might’ve been theoretically open to alternatives, but flat rejections would never grab her interest. And since Johann had no other suggestions, Maribel’s strategy won the day.</p>
<p>As Johann struggled against her, Yuuki kept talking, trying to figure out her thought process. It made him realize this operation had a better chance of success than he thought. “…All right. In that case, Milim’s likely to take it on herself. She’d stop Rimuru from doing so, for sure, and it’d be the perfect way to separate them, maybe.”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee! Very good. Very, <em>very</em> good. And while the demon lord Milim’s playing around with it…”</p>
<p>“We go in and take over Rimuru’s mind?”</p>
<p>“Yes, precisely.”</p>
<p>“But I’ve still got one worry…”</p>
<p><a id="page-265"></a>“The Storm Dragon?”</p>
<p>“…Yep, you guessed it. If we fail to take over Rimuru, and Veldora goes on a rampage, what’re we gonna do then?”</p>
<p>That—or their target might fight back more than they expected, giving them no time to take over his mind. If it came to that, Yuuki would have no choice but to kill Rimuru. He attempted to voice his concerns about that, in a roundabout away, but apparently that was an acceptable consequence of her plans.</p>
<p>“No need to worry about that. No need at all, Yuuki. Don’t worry about a thing. Just focus on defeating the demon lord Rimuru.”</p>
<p>Yuuki didn’t defy her. In the end, he did what he was told. “…All right. If you say so, I’ll believe in you.”</p>
<p>Maribel gave him a nod.</p>
<p>Thanks to what her grandfather Granville told her about demon lords, Maribel saw much deeper into the world than most.</p>
<p>If Rimuru should fall, and Veldora the Storm Dragon flew into a rage, the demon lord Luminus would likely step in to handle it. Paradoxically, that would actually be better for her than Rimuru keeping up his current rule.</p>
<p>He and Luminus had already joined forces—which essentially meant that Luminus left management of the Western Nations to him. The Queen of Nightmares herself, someone who saw humankind as little more than vampire food, had let the Seven Days Clergy do that before, but—as shown in Granville’s own fall—they were no more. He had lost Luminus’s protection, and with that, the authority he had to influence the Western Nations.</p>
<p>From now on, Hinata the Saint would doubtlessly gain more political clout…and considering their relationship, the rising rule of the demon lord Rimuru would grow even firmer with her.</p>
<p><em>No matter what, I’ve got to stop that.</em></p>
<p>And as she secretly thought this, it didn’t matter if she needed to expose the world to the threat of Veldora to do it.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Maribel and Yuuki spent the next little while fleshing out the details of their plan. By this point, there was no room left for Johann—all he could do was pray they succeeded. Thus, these <a id="page-266"></a>magic-born, packing as much malice as they could into their intricate plans, began to devise a way to suppress Rimuru for good.</p>

<p class="tx1">After that long, long session was over, we all regrouped back at the café. I was relaxing in my seat, the tie on my business suit loosened. I could’ve used Spatial Motion to come home now, but Soei still hadn’t caught our culprit, and there might be some unforeseen snags, so I decided to stick around for a bit.</p>
<p>But…man. That conference was <em>so</em> exhausting. Prince Elrick of Englesia’s intrusion, that guy Gaban pulling the strings behind him, all the councillors whose support they enjoyed…but it all ended with their mouths agape.</p>
<p>Gaban was a high-level noble, I guess, but even he got taken away by those scary-looking “magical inquisitors.” The other councillors in on the conspiracy were saved from that by diplomatic immunity, but thanks to the ledgers I submitted to the authorities, I think their home nations will be investigating them shortly. They’ll lose their posts, no doubt, and a lot of them looked pretty alarmed about that, but they had it coming.</p>
<p>Even a lot of the councillors who <em>weren’t</em> involved at all treated me with, shall we say, “noble” indifference. I let the innocent ones go, but judging by my ledgers, a lot of them were criminals indeed. So I planned to alert their home nations about my evidence as well. The more the merrier, and all that. That ought to shake up things a bit among those fools, a lot of whom used their posts to fatten up their own coffers. The sooner they were gone, the easier things would be for me later.</p>
<p>I sipped my coffee as I thought all this over. “Well, a lot happened today, but now I’m glad Hinata and Shuna got angry before I did. I <em>am</em> the demon lord here, so I figured it wouldn’t look too good if I started bashin’ heads in first thing.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I didn’t ‘get angry.’ Some of the councillors were being discourteous in their diplomacy, and I just offered them some etiquette lessons.”</p>
<p>“Neither did I, Sir Rimuru. I just helped a few rude gentlemen <a id="page-267"></a>see the errors of their ways. If I was <em>truly</em> angry, there wouldn’t have even been a pile of ashes where they once stood.”</p>
<p>Hinata and Shuna smiled at the same time. Perfectly in sync. It was a little frightening. Against that sheer impact, all I could do was nod and say “Uh, yeah” back.</p>
<p>“But it <em>was</em> a good experience for me,” interjected Benimaru.</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“I mean, I got too angry up there. My mind became a total blank, and I didn’t know what I should do about it. If Shuna had waited any longer to act, I might’ve torched every human in that room.”</p>
<p>I nearly did a spit take with my coffee. Yeah, I sure <em>thought</em> Benimaru was coolly eyeing the proceedings. I was glad to see him act all mature for a change—but he was actually so enraged that he lost hold of himself. Guess I shouldn’t have been so impressed. But man, was that close. If I oversaw a bloody massacre in there, the entire human race would have it in for me.</p>
<p>“Look, whatever you do, <em>don’t</em> do that, all right?”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! I was just kidding!” Benimaru tried to laugh it off with a breezy smile, but he couldn’t fool me. He was serious. I’d need to pick a representative to send to the Council before the next meeting, and I better choose damn carefully.</p>
<p class="space-break1">We were still talking, me finishing my coffee, when Soei’s report came in.</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru, I have captured the assassin.”</p>
<p>I figured he’d manage the job fine, and I was right. What a talent—always doing a perfect job with the work I assigned him.</p>
<p>“She was an able fighter, to be sure. She didn’t give her name or any other information about herself…but she referred to you as that devil bastard’s boss.”</p>
<p>Hmm. A crack professional assassin, no doubt, one who wouldn’t divulge her identity that easily. But “devil bastard”…?</p>
<p>“Did she mean Diablo?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t imagine anyone else.”</p>
<p>Made sense.</p>
<p>I didn’t receive any report along those lines from Diablo—at <a id="page-269"></a>least, I don’t <em>think</em> I did—but he’s the kinda guy who treated even Razen like a snot-nosed kid. If he and this assassin ever fought, chances are the girl didn’t even register in his mind. It reminded me once again just how sky-high Diablo’s standards were.</p>
