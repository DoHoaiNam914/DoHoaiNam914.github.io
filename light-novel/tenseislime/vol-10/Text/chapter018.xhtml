<p><a id="page-127"></a>“Heh-heh-heh…,” Veldora chuckled. “Such a silly question. So instead of having the monsters do our bidding, we take matters into our own hands? What a creative idea, Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“Exactly!” I replied. “Although, I wish I could’ve tried conquering the labyrinth in this form…”</p>
<p>“So this is what a video game is like? I’ve heard about this!”</p>
<p>“What? Is that true, Veldora?!” said Milim.</p>
<p>“Master! So we’ll beat up the enemy like this, then? And then we can make these bodies learn new things, too…?” Ramiris jumped in.</p>
<p>Gotta hand it to Veldora. He immediately guessed what I wanted to do. Yes, this was basically a pseudo-MMORPG—although, there wasn’t anything too “massive” about our party of four. Maybe just an MORPG, then? It doesn’t matter. The key thing here, the concept, was that we could now enjoy the very labyrinth we expended the effort to build.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! Well put, Veldora. You can nearly read my mind, I see. But don’t get the wrong idea yet. Yes, I developed this with an eye toward playing the labyrinth like a game, but we have other business first, don’t we?”</p>
<p>“Kwah-ha-ha-ha, we do! We need to use these bodies to dispatch the challengers—I mean, the <em>intruders</em> causing us problems, then?”</p>
<p>He got it, all right. Yes, I thought about using these “avatars,” these monster bodies, to interfere with Green Fury’s rapid advance. And like Ramiris said, I had thought of several ways to enjoy these bodies—leveling them up to evolve them, learning how to fight with the restricted skills they had, and so on. Still, what I <em>really</em> wanted to do was go have fun beating up monsters and challengers—I had no idea I’d invent something so <em>useful</em> just to make that happen.</p>
<p>“Of course, once everything was ready, I was just thinking that we could enjoy conquering our own labyrinth as well,” I said.</p>
<p>“Ah, right. We’ll be able to test out our work, huh?”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm. And with these avatars, we can’t exercise our full powers, right? So I thought it’d help us get another perspective on problems in the labyrinth.”</p>
<p>“Yes… True. And the master of the labyrinth taking on challengers <a id="page-128"></a>himself—some people might see that as unseemly. But copying my soul into a weaker beast like this…”</p>
<p>“Right! This way, we can beat up intruders as regular old labyrinth denizens, not as True Dragons or demon lords.”</p>
<p>“Now I get it! This sounds fun!!” Milim was certainly convinced. Given the nearly infinite power she lobbed around all the time, a much more inconvenient form must’ve seemed novel to her. She looked really excited about it.</p>
<p>“Well, shall we spring into action?”</p>
<p>“Yes, why not clean up the garbage before enjoying our own game?” said Veldora.</p>
<p>“The time has come to fully stretch out my arms, I’d say!” said Ramiris. “I can’t wait to test all forty-eight of my finisher moves!”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure how any of this works, but this seems kinda fun to me!” Milim cheered.</p>
<p>We all triumphantly stood up. Time to go down there, get in Green Fury’s way, and ensure they couldn’t challenge the bottom floors for a little while. How would we do that? Well, I had a few other schemes in mind.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">First, we needed to get used to our avatars. After that, the next important thing was equipment. We all put on Resurrection Bracelets with infinite charges, ensuring we could die as much as we wanted—but that wasn’t enough. Our avatars were freshly born and extremely low level. Pushovers like us wouldn’t deter Green Fury, no matter how well we surprised them. If we had some decent equipment, though…</p>
<p>“Right, we’ll definitely want to get some equipment together. Let’s go to Kurobe’s and have him craft some weapons and armor!”</p>
<p>“Ah yes, indeed! I’m a mere skeleton as it is, after all.”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee! You fools! I’m a slime built for speed and mobility now! I could work just fine in the labyrinth!”</p>
<p>“Um, I’m just a suit of armor… Can I put more armor on over this?”</p>
<p><a id="page-129"></a>“Oh, we can figure something out. Let’s just head over. And if you don’t need equipment, Milim, just stay here.”</p>
<p>“D-don’t give me that nonsense! I can hold my own as it is, but I still need some gear!”</p>
<p>Talk about selfish. She should’ve just said so. I wanted some equipment as well, so I prepared to undo the Possession and leave.</p>
<p>“To go back, just picture the word <em>separate</em> in your mind. That’ll bring you back.”</p>
<p>I gave them a quick demo, putting the avatar core in my pocket as I taught them. These avatar cores had the monster encoded in them, one per core, and they couldn’t be shared between different people. These cores were a second “self” for you, really, so I wanted to be sure people took good care of them.</p>
<p>“With these,” I added, “you’ll be able to call on your second form anytime you like.”</p>
<p>“Pretty neat item, definitely. We’ll need to think about what to do with them while we’re busy Possessing.”</p>
<p>Veldora and Ramiris, back in their original bodies, stood up from their chairs.</p>
<p>“Maybe fit it on our Bracelets so we don’t lose them?” suggested Veldora.</p>
<p>“That’s a good idea. I think I’ll do that!” said Ramiris.</p>
<p>They both played around with the avatar cores in their hands. I think I’ll do that with mine as well. But what about Milim?</p>
<p>“Hey, Mili—”</p>
<p>“I’m gonna go like this!”</p>
<p>Before I could call for her, Milim—in slime form—was digging her way into my pocket. “Okay, let’s go!” she shouted, bossing me around and demonstrating her utter lack of interest in listening to me. She must’ve really liked that body. Pretty childlike of her…which, yeah, she <em>is</em> a child. Calling a child childish wasn’t very constructive, so I gave up on scolding her and got going.</p>
<p class="space-break1">We were at Kurobe’s workshop.</p>
<p>“You there, Kurobe?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Sir Rimuru? What brings you here today?”</p>
<p><a id="page-130"></a>Kurobe came right up when I asked for him. Seeing Veldora and Ramiris with me surprised him.</p>
<p>“Well, we’re looking for some weapons,” I said as we walked inside. I hadn’t been around for a while, but the workshop definitely had more people now—monsters included. It was scorching hot as usual. Temperature didn’t affect me, so it was fine, but working in here must’ve been grueling for the others.</p>
<p>“Looks like you’ve hired some more apprentices.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, luckily! They still need practice, but some of ’em are pretty talented.”</p>
<p>Some of them looked up as they heard us talking in the workshop. Once they saw who I was, they leaped to their feet and bowed at me. Seeing all of them do that at once startled me, but Kurobe was used to it.</p>
<p>“It’s not break time yet! Get back to work!”</p>
<p>His ornery shouting drove his staff to return to their jobs. But I kind of understood their thought process. If you’re sitting at your cube, and the CEO comes in out of nowhere, <em>you’d</em> be nervous, too—especially if you were on the bottom rung. And maybe it didn’t feel that way to me, but I was the ruler of this nation. I hadn’t let it concern me before now, but maybe I should have given more advance warning as a rule.</p>
<p>Coming in casually like this might’ve just caused trouble for everyone. Whenever a district manager or whatever came to view our workplace in my old world, we’d always spend the previous day cleaning up the whole office to prepare. If it was the president, then no mistakes would be tolerated. The higher up you went, the more it unnerved people when you got all casual with them, I guess.</p>
<p>Still, I didn’t want every trip out to be filled with pomp and circumstance. I hated to call Kurobe out of his busy work schedule; better for me to just show up whenever he’s free.</p>
<p>“Sorry I barged in without any warning. I think I’m gonna make a regular habit of it for a little while, so no need to get all tense, okay?”</p>
<p>Thus, I decided to address the staff. Maybe them being <em>too</em> casual <a id="page-131"></a>with me would be a problem, but there was no need to be on pins and needles around me. I loved acting like a boss, but I didn’t make a hobby out of inconveniencing people. If the other person’s too nervous to react to me, that bothered me, too. Gobta’s obliviousness was just right. Just keep in mind the acronym TPO—time, place, occasion—and it was easier to find the right approach.</p>
<p>My advice seemed to relieve the staff a bit. Once I was sure of that, I nodded and went into a room deeper inside the workshop.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I wasn’t aware of this, by the way, but the apprentices weren’t anxious just because I was a demon lord.</p>
<p>While I wasn’t paying attention, someone had held a Tempest popularity contest, and apparently, I had been voted into the top-three idols alongside Shuna and Shion. A surprising result, they told me. Ramiris and Milim were in the rankings as well, and while I won’t say exactly where, I can tell you that Milim and I were <em>way</em> ahead of Ramiris.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure whether to whine about it or marvel at how my town’s grown. Either way, hearing about it later made me roll my eyes.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">“So what kind of stuff d’you need?”</p>
<p>In his personal chamber, Kurobe got straight down to business.</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>We all went over the hopes we had.</p>
<p>“I’m intending to have Garm build the armor, so I think it’d be neat if you could collaborate again.”</p>
<p>“Yeahhh, true. All right. Let’s go bother Garm about it.”</p>
<p>So as we talked, we decided to take Kurobe over to Garm’s workshop. I wound up causing a similar commotion over there, but I’ll skip describing it.</p>
<p>“Equipment for monsters?! Wow. You always have the craziest projects for me, don’t you?”</p>
<p>As Garm groused about this, the four of us all Possessed our avatars to demonstrate for him.</p>
<p><a id="page-132"></a>“All right. We’ll make you exactly what you want—no, even better!”</p>
<p>“Yes, we’re on the case. I love a nice, creative project like this, and I’ll try to craft some stuff that’d never work on a human!”</p>
<p>Kurobe and Garm both readily agreed to the project. And really, I couldn’t wait to see what they came up with.</p>
<p class="space-break1">They said the work would be done in several days, so in the meantime, we trained ourselves to get more used to our avatars. Nothing too complex—fighting monsters in the labyrinth’s upper levels, attacking obvious newbie adventurers.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, we had grown adept at dividing up our roles. Reaching that point, though, was a slog. At first, we even <em>lost</em> to beginner parties up top.</p>
<p>We’d also get wiped out by traps, which would probably be funny to us later but definitely wasn’t at the time, and do other stupid things. We tried using magic items to keep traps from deploying and stuff, even. It was Ramiris who kept setting them off, with Veldora usually suffering as the hapless victim. I floated, meanwhile, and Milim could stick to the ceiling—pitfalls weren’t a concern for us two, so we forgot to warn the others about them.</p>
<p>That was a mistake, I’ll admit, but Ramiris… Seriously? Why are <em>you</em> setting off traps? We made sure to give her an earful about it, and I think she deserved it.</p>
<p>Through all the pain, we skipped out on sleeping to keep on training. In battle, teamwork was the most important thing. Normal parties would talk to one another or give signals with their eyes, but we had pretty much none of those skills at all. We had Veldora and Milim with us, after all, two people who were the strongest in the world all by themselves.</p>
<p>What we <em>did</em> have, however, was one cheat-level skill—Thought Communication, letting us stay in touch and give orders with pinpoint accuracy. I was the party’s command post, Veldora, Milim, and Ramiris serving as my hands and feet. Thanks to that, we began to rapidly build ourselves, eventually gaining some decent experience and abilities.</p>
<p><a id="page-133"></a>Once we had a good footing, we patiently waited for our equipment as we fine-tuned our teamwork. As we did, we heard the news that Team Green Fury had beaten Floor 40.</p>
<p>“Hoo boy,” said Ramiris. “Now they’ve beaten the tempest serpent, huh?”</p>
<p>“They took a pretty careful approach. The first team was all about gathering intelligence, the second whittled down its energy, and then the A team killed it,” said Veldora.</p>
<p>Bosses were resurrected regularly, of course. But if a boss successfully beat a party, that didn’t erase its current damage or state of exhaustion. If a group of people had the right teamwork, this gave them a clear advantage.</p>
<p>“<em>That</em> was a mistake. Bosses really need a way to heal…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but those monsters work strictly on instinct, so…”</p>
<p>As Veldora saw it, they lacked the intelligence to use healing items anyway, making it a moot point. He was right, but we weren’t out of options.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we bring it up with Treyni?” I suggested. “The labyrinth managers can heal monsters, can’t they?”</p>
<p>“Oh, right. I’ll do that!”</p>
<p>So we decided to have Treyni’s sisters heal bosses if they were involved in a consecutive streak of battles all at once.</p>
<p>Little by little, we were addressing and solving the labyrinth’s issues. And then:</p>
<p>“They’re about ready to hit Floor 49. What’ll we do, Rimuru?” Milim was on the verge of panic. But she was right. Green Fury would reach their most climactic battle yet as soon as tomorrow.</p>
<p>“Well, we may not have our equipment at the moment, but I’d say our teamwork is golden,” said Veldora. “Shall we try taking them on now?”</p>
<p>“I’m game! Time to use my arms of steel to beat them to a pulp!” Ramiris crowed.</p>
<p>Those two were always out for blood. Honestly, though, I don’t think we stood much of a chance in a clean fight. For now, Floor 49, packed with the most devious traps I ever devised, was our only real chance at messing with them.</p>
<p><a id="page-134"></a>“Well, so be it. Maybe we can scrounge up some weapons…”</p>
<p>Even if Kurobe and Garm provided us the best gear possible, we probably wouldn’t take a frontal approach with them. It’d certainly up our chances a lot, but we could probably hold our own anyway. But just when I was about to commit, I heard a knock on the conference-room door.</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru,” came Shion’s refreshing voice, “Kurobe said he’s ready.”</p>
<p>Our party looked at one another and grinned.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Our specialized avatar equipment was complete.</p>
<p>I was given a Death Scythe and Hell Garment, two magic items that even ghosts could wear. Veldora got the Death Blade and Hell Mail, along with a Hellgate Shield to complete the picture.</p>
<p>As a slime, Milim could only equip simple objects, swallowing up a Death Stiletto and covering her body with a Crimson Cape. The moment she did, her body grew a pair of bloodred wings—quite a transformation. “See?” she gleefully shouted. “It’s really true! You need to equip your items, or else they won’t work!”</p>
<p>Yeah, great. If she was happy, I was happy.</p>
<p>Finally, Ramiris. She had ordered Heavy Fullplate armor, which looked like a work of art, but we weren’t sure if she could even equip it. Nervous, she Possessed her living armor and tried to take it up—and at that very moment, she <em>switched</em> armor. With a clatter, her old tin suit crashed to the ground, turning to dust and vanishing in the wind. She had upgraded from living armor to heavy living armor—not an evolution, but more like a total replacement.</p>
<p>“Wh-whoa! This is so much easier to move in!”</p>
<p>She was right. Her old, creaky gait was now smooth and ninja-like. It’d help her teamwork a lot, I was sure. Funny to think a suit of armor’s feature set could affect the way you moved, though. Kind of an unexpected discovery.</p>
<p>Elated, Ramiris now had to select a weapon and shield.</p>
<p>“Ha-<em>ha</em>! I don’t need no stupid shield!”</p>
<p>…was her opinion, so she opted for a large two-handed weapon instead—the Death Axe. The power it packed made it the ultimate <a id="page-135"></a>in weapons—wielding it was tricky, but oh well; not my problem. She got picked on all the time for being a wimp, so maybe this’ll assuage her ego a little. Funny how her personality kept coming out like that.</p>
<p class="space-break1">So we were all decked out in brand-new equipment. These weapons and armor were all on the level of a Unique item, but since they were heavily modified for use by monsters, they were more novelty items than anything. For beginners like us, however, they were crazily overpowered. What’s more, they had a type of curse applied that registered our names to them—thus, they could never get stolen.</p>
<p>It was the best equipment we could’ve possibly asked for right now, and it gave us a new perspective on everything. It was almost time to rumble, and we couldn’t have been more excited.</p>
<p>Time for a quick check of our avatars. My ghost dropped physical offense in favor of magical and spiritual attacks. It was classed as a sorcerer, and in time, I’d like to maybe teach it spiritual and illusory magic so it could make the upgrade to full-fledged wizard. Holy magic would be a nice addition, too—what would happen if I placed faith in <em>myself</em> to drive that? That’d be a fun experiment.</p>
<p>Veldora’s skeleton was an all-rounder, capable of various kinds of attacks. It was a fighter class, and I think he wanted to teach it magic so it could become a magic knight later.</p>
<p>Milim’s slime, meanwhile, was geared entirely for speed—and for landing telling blows in a single strike. Wish fulfillment for her, I suppose. Her class was assassin, and maybe I could have Soei give her some training, but I didn’t want to occupy his time with our dumb little make-believe fun here. Her basic strategy involved lunging down on foes from the ceiling—a powerful strike if it worked, but what did she intend to do if it didn’t? Run, I suppose; she certainly was fast enough for it. In a way, she was the ideal slime fighter.</p>
<p>Finally, as you’d expect, Ramiris’s heavy living armor was an attacker with more than ample defense, giving it a lot more stability than I originally gave her credit for. The class was berserker, and <a id="page-136"></a>while she was no crazed warrior, defending herself was never really a priority in Ramiris’s approach. As a dangerous, attack-oriented creature, that was the name she was given. Once she got used to things, I could picture her as a tank, providing a twin wall of defense with Veldora.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">We were all set to go. Given that we never got hungry, long, dragged-out battles were our lone major advantage. <em>Let’s do the best job we can to get in Green Fury’s way.</em></p>
<p>Such was our thoughts as we set off, but…well…we sent them running so fast, the actual battle was a total letdown.</p>
<p class="space-break1">If you threw away all emotion and ran a completely impartial, third-party Analyze and Assess on our avatars, you’d realize that we were probably already pushing an A in rank. Our equipment was more than half the reason for that, but even without it, as long as we made good use of our powers, nothing could stop us.</p>
<p>The main oversight we made was that our own personal battle experience was reflected in our avatars. We couldn’t use all our skills, but things like Thought Communication and Hasten Thought were themselves enough to give us a decisive edge. Plus, we could cast magic so quickly that it was really unfair. Our restricted magicules blocked us from using much of it, but we had the knowledge for it, and thus we could handle magic better than even your average royal court sorcerer. This came with no casting time, so we could engineer tandem magic strikes with practically zero time lag—our foes had no chance to react.</p>
<p>Veldora, meanwhile, was such a genius with his sword, it was like he had eyes in the back of his head.</p>
<p>“Kwaah-ha-ha-ha! My Veldora-Style Death Stance gives me instant access to an infinite number of sword skills! …Oh, wait, this doesn’t work…”</p>
<p>He was trying to imitate the moves he saw in the manga he read. I thought he was just screwing around, but some of his moves were <a id="page-137"></a>actually kind of plausible. His power was off the charts to start with, of course, so I should’ve expected anything and everything from him. Treating this whole thing seriously at all now seemed silly.</p>
<p>Milim was exactly as blazing fast as she set out to be. Even speeds that nobody else had a chance at controlling were no problem with her reflexes. I really had no idea slimes could move that fast if they tried—sliding frictionless across the ground, with enough elasticity to bounce off walls and lunge at foes. That worked just as well off the ceiling, too. Your average person would have trouble even following her with their eyes. As a slime myself, these new discoveries were a huge shock.</p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Slow! Too slow! Face my wrath, you chump!”</p>
<p>She was getting exceedingly carried away as she dropped down on her foes’ backs, stabbing with her Death Stiletto. That was enough to end most battles. Her body was largely impervious to physical attack, and if you want to cast magic against her, you needed to capture her in your sights first. Think about it, and you’ll realize that Milim’s slime was a pretty scary enemy to face.</p>
<p>But what let Veldora and Milim truly shrine was Ramiris, the unsung hero of the pack.</p>
<p>“Hraahhh! Time to be crushed!!”</p>
<p>Ramiris’s battle strategy was pretty simple—find an enemy, run straight at it, and stage a full-frontal attack. This would be a bad idea for most, an imbecilic strategy, but in our case, it was the way to go. She never listened to any of my advice anyway, so I figured we might as well take advantage of her—she’d be our tank, our diversion, and the remainder of the party could get on the attack then.</p>
<p>Normally, that wouldn’t work too well, but Ramiris ran around like a daredevil, never bothering to defend herself, this big suit of armor sprinting for you and spinning a Death Axe in its hands. Anyone who saw it would be forced to deal with it—and since she didn’t care about defense, her attacks tended to find their target. (She also had Cancel Pain, which helped a lot.)</p>
<p>Plus, the armor itself was pretty sturdy. A Heavy Fullplate used <a id="page-138"></a>what seemed like a cartload of magisteel; weight concerns were tossed out the window with it. It came with a Self-Repair function as well, so most damage wasn’t an issue. If a regular person put it on, they probably wouldn’t be able to move at all. Having such a hefty chunk of magisteel come your way—well, I wouldn’t want to be her enemy.</p>
<p>What’s more, I had Recovery Magic.</p>
<p>I had been experimenting with holy magic as part of my work, and it was surprisingly easy to deploy. It wasn’t a matter of “having faith in myself” so much as offering prayers in exchange for control over spiritual particles, a skill usually shut away from me. In my case, my magical power as a ghost was sent over to the “real” me along with the words of prayer. I was, in essence, borrowing force from my main body to cast magic.</p>
<p>These “words of prayer” were mainly about building up an image. When working with spiritual particles, you’d never get anywhere if you kept asking what your disciples wanted and going with that—it’d take too much calculation. All that processing work is instead applied to the people who placed their faith in you. The more disciples you had like that, the more magic force you got—to put it another way, you got higher up as a god. You were also connected to your believers, and you could use those believers’ minds to expand your calculation capacity—kind of a substitution cheat that saved you magic force and time.</p>
<p>Now I saw why Luminus sought to build more believers for herself. With a massive enough number of practitioners, she could whip up large-scale magic on a passing whim. The “secret skills of faith and favor,” indeed. That’s some scary stuff she taught me.</p>
<p>But enough about that. The point is, I had holy magic, and as a party, we boasted a pretty formidable force—and right now, like evil personified, we had just wiped out Team Green Fury on the forty-ninth floor.</p>
<p class="space-break1">You should never be afraid to try something new, I guess. Our frontal attack failed, so we polished our teamwork and took advantage of the traps.</p>
<p><a id="page-139"></a>I set the Slime Doll on them, damaging their weapons. I used the Slime Rain to break their focus and exhaust them—and then we attacked, throwing them into the Slime Pool. While Ramiris’s bellowing grabbed their attention, Milim sneaked up on them, breaking down their teamwork as Veldora split them apart and isolated their rear support. Our giant slime crushed their powerless magicians and thieves, while Veldora and Ramiris bear-hugged the remaining core members straight into the Slime Pool, sinking them down. Our aim was to destroy their weapons in the acidic goop, and once Green Fury’s main weapons had corroded into useless fragments, that’d be a huge damper on their dungeon-conquering speed.</p>
<p>“Ugghh! After all that swag we earned!!”</p>
<p>It turns out the leader of the Sons of the Veldt, the one currently whining about the equipment dissolving in her hands, was female. That surprised me—but not as much as what her companions said next.</p>
<p>“Well, maybe this timing’s for the best. It was about the right moment to pack up.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, our <em>home country’s</em> calling for us anyway.”</p>
<p>I definitely heard one of the survivors from the team say that to the leader. I thought the Sons of the Veldt was an independent mercenary corps, unaffiliated with any other nation. My reports stated they were being funded by someone in Englesia, but maybe it was more like a long-term gig? The term <em>home country</em> indicated that they might’ve had more loyalty to Englesia than a simple employer-employee relationship. I’d need to keep an eye on them.</p>
<p>As long as we were encouraging people to use the Dungeon, we’d naturally see visitors with murky origins. I was expecting that from the beginning, but we should probably give everyone another heads-up about that. The whole Green Fury thing reminded me of it all over again.</p>
<p>Besides:</p>
<p>“We did it.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Victory is ours!”</p>
<p><a id="page-140"></a>“Why wouldn’t it be? We are the strongest in the world!!”</p>
<p>If I didn’t keep these idiots in line, they’d immediately get distracted by the next victory ahead. The thought was in my mind, but—right now, at least—I didn’t let it get in the way of my joy. Mission accomplished.</p>
