<h1 class="appendix-title"><a id="page-357"></a><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-appendix001">AFTERWORD</a></h1>
<p class="noindent">Good seeing you all again. This is Fuse.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, I was actually planning on zero afterword this volume. This was thanks to the page count ballooning to its biggest yet, after a successful diet last time. I’ll never forget the resigned voice of Mr. I, my editor.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>But!</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Once we opened the lid, it turned out we had a few extra pages. They want me to fill around six of them in an afterword, they said.</p>
<p>Like I’ve written before, when I pick up a novel at the bookstore, I read the summary blurb, then go straight to the afterword. I figure the afterword’s a good way to see whether a book is engaging or not. Even for a series like this one, I always read from the afterword first. I’ve got this habit of seeing if there’s any new info, or maybe a release date for the next volume, before I enjoy the book itself.</p>
<p>That’s why I think “an afterword is really important,” but when I’m writing one myself, things change fast…</p>
<p class="space-break1">I mean, really… If I write about my private life, a lot of people won’t care. If I write about the series, I’ll end up talking about <a id="page-358"></a>spoilers. I’m sure a lot of readers would prefer more story to more afterword.</p>
<p>If you have any requests on things to talk about in here, please write the editors at GC Novels! You may just see that reflected in future volumes.</p>
<p>So for now, I’d like to talk a bit about the series.</p>

<p class="tx1">Here’s a little behind-the-scenes info on the gun that appears in this volume.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I gave the full name of it in the text—the Walther P99, a real-life handgun. Glenda uses it in the story, but it’s a semi-automatic pistol produced by the Walther company in Germany.</p>
<p>I was thinking about going with the Beretta M92 or Px4, but then people might confuse it with the character Beretta. After deliberating over my options, I picked the P99 in the end.</p>
<p>The Walther P38 is pretty well-known. In Japan, it’s famous as the preferred pistol of that one master thief we all know and love. I thought I might follow that example but opted against it—I figured that, being a woman, Glenda would prefer a more compact firearm.</p>
<p>So that was my motivation behind choosing the Walther P99. It only gets named once, but I still had to do some research for it, even picking up an airsoft version to handle myself. It reminded me of how much I wanted one as a kid. I guess I’m just buying stuff like this now that I’m grown up and can afford it, can’t I? Not that it matters.</p>
<p>Anyway, I plan to continue bringing handguns like this into the story. They may go under the same name, but between mechanical and magical mechanisms, they could be totally different inside.</p>
<p>The type Rimuru brought along on his adventure has completely original internals, although it looks the same from the outside. They even reproduced the blast charge, although making a lot of it is apparently a pain. They figured they could simplify things a bit, and so it has all the magic revisions described in the story.</p>
<p><a id="page-359"></a>I also hint a little that the Empire has guns of their own, but those will be a completely different model. The idea is that they went through the same thought processes as Rimuru and friends but developed their magic-driven guns in different directions—that kind of thing.</p>
<p class="space-break1">So those are the basics, but that’s only the beginning of my problems.</p>
<p>I’m planning to introduce a family of demons named after classic super-cars, but at first, I was going to have a series of magic-born named after gunmakers, like Beretta. That was the plan, at least, but Beretta never did get any siblings in the web-novel version.</p>
<p>So now what? With the name Walther getting a mention, hopefully that jogs Rimuru’s memory a little, but…</p>
<p>I mean, think about it. Sig, Colt, Glock, Mauser, Walther, Mateba, Remington. The twin brothers Heckler &amp; Koch. Those are just a few of Beretta’s buds, and perhaps we’ll see them floating around Tempest in the future. I can already hear someone shouting “Don’t do it! It’s hard enough to come up with character designs as it is!” but I won’t introduce them until they’re absolutely needed in the story. Promise. But I’d love to put ’em in action in a side story or something.</p>

<p class="tx1">To wrap up this volume, I’d like to express some of the gratitude I feel on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mr. I, my editor, who’s always happy to speak with me. I troubled him with yet another page expansion this time, but he said this was all for the readers, and as the author, that’s a relief to me. Our phone conversations are always a nice mental break for me, so let’s keep this going!</p>
<p class="space-break1">Thanks to Mitz Vah for all the wonderful illustrations every volume.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Maribel’s design gave us a lot of trouble. Because <a id="page-360"></a>of all that hard work, though, I think we’ve come up with a nice character. The cover and interior art’s being worked on right now as I write this afterword, and I can’t wait to see the results!</p>
<p class="space-break1">And to the proofers, designers, and the other many people who helped bring this book to fruition: Thank you!</p>
<p class="space-break1">Finally, to my readers.</p>
<p><em>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</em> has finally ascended to Volume 10. This is all thanks to the support you guys give us, and I want to answer your call. I promise we’ll keep doing our best, right up to the conclusion!</p>
<p class="space-break1">Thanks again for your continued support of <em>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime!</em></p>
