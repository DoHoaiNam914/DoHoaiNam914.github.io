<p>Razen himself, after all, was a human strong enough to be worthy of a magic-born title. The way Hinata described it to me, there was almost no person stronger than him in the Western Nations—and if he called him a wimp, then Diablo’s sense of judgment must’ve been completely out of whack. I should probably teach him more about what passes for “strong” in this world.</p>
<p>I ordered another cup of coffee as I considered this. Shuna, Hinata, and Benimaru were going with tea instead, as well as some cake for dessert… <em>Whoa, you too, Benimaru?! Guess I might as well join in, then. I’ll never say no to a good shortcake; that’s my favorite.</em></p>
<p>So I had the waitress deliver coffee to us both when Soei arrived. The waitress was clearly blushing, which Soei prudently ignored as he drank it black. Coffee really completes the picture with him, although I personally sided more with Benimaru and his sweet tooth.</p>
<p>Thus, we enjoyed our drinks as I asked Soei, this perfect specimen of a man, for his full report.</p>
<p>“…And that’s everything for now.”</p>
<p>He wrapped things up by the time I got to the end of my second cup, using Thought Communication to replay the memory of what he saw to everyone. Based on that, it looked like Soei managed to make this assailant throw every type of offense she had at him. She was pretty beautiful, too, but Soei showed her no mercy. It was kind of like cheating in an old-school online game, taking advantage of some bug to get infinite energy. Letting your opponent think they had a chance to win—and just laughing in the shadows the whole time. If you can get your foe thinking they’ve almost won, that’s when you can get <em>truly</em> malicious, forcing them to use all their items and so forth. That’s the strategy Soei must’ve used to get information from the assassin.</p>
<p>Of course, this wasn’t a game—and in an intelligence operation like this, you had to know how to read the story behind your target. Soei didn’t mess that up at all; I think he deserved praise for a fine job.</p>
<p>“Good work. You always impress me, Soei.”</p>
<p><a id="page-270"></a>“I tested out the strategy you described to me, Sir Rimuru, and it proved surprisingly effective. The key is to show yourself struggling a bit first, isn’t it?”</p>
<p><em>Um…?</em></p>
<p><em>Oh. Right. I think we did talk along those lines.</em> I definitely recall talking to him about spy movies, but maybe we discussed online games, too? It was such an inconsequential conversation that I forgot all about it. I internally apologized to Soei—didn’t mean to implant any “malicious” ideas in him.</p>
<p>“Ha…ha-ha-ha. Glad to be of service.”</p>
<p>“No, I still have so much to learn. She eliminated three of my Replications.”</p>
<p>“Oh, did she? Well, at least we can get some clues about our enemy now.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I will handle the interrogation.”</p>
<p><em>Interrogation, huh? Hmm… Should I say something about that?</em></p>
<p>As I considered whether to, Hinata interrupted us.</p>
<p>“You know, I wasn’t sure whether to speak up about this, but I’m sure you already know anyway, so… The assassin Sir Soei encountered used to serve under me. I didn’t know what kind of powers she was hiding, but it sounds like she was more trouble than I thought. Now I see how she managed to beat Rama. If a bullet appeared two feet away from <em>you</em>, you probably couldn’t react in time, either.”</p>
<p>“Who’s Rama?”</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry. He was a man in my force, one of the Three Battlesages. Glenda beat him, and later he started working for her.”</p>
<p>Maybe Hinata could dodge a bullet that close to her, but most people couldn’t. There was no doubting the danger Glenda’s skill posed.</p>
<p>But this Rama guy was a Battlesage-level fighter, huh? That made him potential demon lord material. <em>Serious</em> strength. And—</p>
<p>“Soei talked about one of his Replications getting blown off its feet. That was probably a hand grenade, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you mean that exploding ball of hers?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that. It doesn’t sound like magic, and I think it’s a weapon from my old world.”</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><a id="page-271"></a><em>Understood. It is believed to be magically generated by the subject Glenda. It is a force somewhat similar to Materialize Weapon, allowing her to bring things in her memory into reality.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">M-Materialize Weapon?! So she’s not only a born sniper, but she’s got <em>that</em>, too?</p>
<p>According to Raphael, the full-on Materialize Weapon let you fully regenerate any weapon in your memory. With Glenda, the skill wasn’t quite as well-defined, so she could only create imitations with similar effects to what she pictured. Even that, however, was enough of a threat.</p>
<p>“I agree with you. I haven’t seen a real one, but it sounds like the ones in movies and stuff. Should we assume Glenda’s an otherworlder, too?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any doubt about that. Especially if she’s using her memories to create Earth weapons.” I sneered triumphantly at Hinata.</p>
<p>She leered back at me. “Why do you know that?”</p>
<p>Oops. She’s sharp. I was still keeping Raphael a secret. Better talk my way out of this. <em>That’s what I get for being a know-it-all</em>, I thought. “Oh, just a hunch. When you get to <em>my</em> level, you start to get hunches like that.”</p>
<p>Benimaru looked over to me, wonder in his eyes. It comforted me a bit as I gauged Hinata’s reply.</p>
<p>“All right. But do you think I could help interrogate her? There are a few things I’ve been meaning to ask Glenda if I had the chance. Saare and Grigori never returned, either, and I think she might know something about them.”</p>
<p>Good. She let it pass. And if she wanted to talk to Glenda, I had no reason to deny her the chance. There was no need to hide our prisoner, and I definitely didn’t want Glenda exposed to whatever awful things Shion did to <em>hers</em>.</p>
<p>It sounded like Glenda had an encounter with Diablo, one she fled from immediately. The whole Prince Elrick thing was nothing to do with us, really; so as long as she gave us her information, <a id="page-272"></a>I wouldn’t get rough with her. I guess Soei gave her quite a fright already—not physically, but in the “break your heart” kinda way.</p>
<p>Whether we’d let her go, on the other hand, was a tough question. She was a tougher foe than we thought; she might be dangerous if set free. But I wasn’t sure handing her over to Englesia was such a great idea, either. Let’s save that question for later.</p>
<p>“Okay. Wanna join me?”</p>
<p>“Please,” Hinata said, nodding.</p>
<p>For now, we’d need to go meet Glenda first, gauge her demeanor, and figure things out from there. We decided to get going.</p>
<p class="space-break1">By the way, I covered our tab at the café, just like I did yesterday. I didn’t exactly appreciate Hinata’s check making its way over to me, but should I have forgiven it like the generous man I am, or should I have said something? I’d hate to be called cheap.</p>
<p>Then again, worrying about little things like this would probably get me pegged as a member of the lower class. The question weighed on my mind as we put Englesia behind us.</p>

<p class="tx1">“Ughh, <em>Chief</em>?!”</p>
<p>We were all back home, meeting up with one of Soei’s Replications there. There we saw the captured Glenda open her eyes, only to find Hinata right in front of her. And she screamed in response.</p>
<p>This was in a plain old reception area, not an interrogation room. Benimaru and Soei were guarding me on both sides, and Hinata was there as well. We were all having tea from Shuna as the interrogation began.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time, Glenda. Glad you’re doing well.”</p>
<p>Hinata went first, coldly looking down on her. She never did go easy on her opponents, and while Glenda was thrown at first, she regained her composure quickly.</p>
<p>“Hah! I guess this is it for me, then,” she brazenly said. “If you’re gonna kill me, go ahead. The fates of captured spies never change much in history.”</p>
<p><a id="page-273"></a>“Silence. All you need to do is answer Sir Rimuru’s questions.”</p>
<p>Soei was being just as merciless with his follow-ups. “Sir Rimuru, should we amputate her limbs to train her to be a little more complacent?”</p>
<p><em>Um, no thank you.</em> And if Soei said he’d do it, he really would, so…</p>
<p>“No, no, just because we’ve got healing potions…”</p>
<p>“Ah, meaning we can give her that painful experience time and time again?” Shuna interjected. “That does make sense—”</p>
<p>“No! I mean, just because we have healing potions, it’s not nice to go so far with this!”</p>
<p>Seriously, stop. Shuna was smiling and nodding her agreement, but Hinata’s eyes were killing me. Not even I would go that far against a woman. And Glenda didn’t seem completely disinterested in talking—I felt like we could negotiate something.</p>
<p>“All right, Glenda. We haven’t met before, have we? I’m the demon lord Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“…Hello. I’m Glenda. One of Lady Hinata’s old troops and part of the Three Battlesages.”</p>
<p>For her part, she understood that jokes and bargaining wouldn’t work against Soei. She provided her name, at least, perhaps figuring I was better worth giving answers to.</p>
<p>She certainly knew Diablo, and I could see it if she ran after realizing she couldn’t win. Very few people who shout out <em>“kill me”</em> actually want to die. I felt safe assuming she was attached to her life. But I was also interested in why she betrayed Hinata. Even if she didn’t reveal her client for this murder attempt, maybe she’d be more willing to discuss other matters.</p>
<p><em>Well, regardless of how open she is, I’ll just have to ask whatever I can.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">I began with a calm approach.</p>
<p>“So you were definitely aiming for Prince Elrick. Is that right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“And was that in order to frame me for it and get me kicked out of the Western Nations?”</p>
<p>“Probably. I didn’t hear any reason. I was just told to do it.”</p>
<p>All right. That didn’t seem to be a lie.</p>
<p><a id="page-274"></a>“Can I ask the next question?” Hinata asked, eliciting a nervous shiver from Glenda.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I assigned you to a commercial hub city so you could have more freedom of movement. I told you not to listen to what the merchants there told you, but had they already won you over by then?”</p>
<p>“No comment there.”</p>
<p>“Were you ready to betray me from the beginning? Because you were ordered to?”</p>
<p>“…No comment.”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking your backers are the group controlling the Council. Who are they?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“I always thought it was strange. The Council would sometimes make these moves to indicate they had an eye out for the Western Holy Church. I figured there had to be a spy, and you were my prime suspect. I was waiting for a chance to expel you, but if you tell me your employer’s name, I’m willing to subtract from your sentence.”</p>
<p>“I told you, no comment!”</p>
<p>“No? All right. One more question. Did you believe in Luminus?”</p>
<p>“<em>Tch!</em> There’s no god out there. If you want me to believe in <em>that</em>, pay me—”</p>
<p>The next instant, Hinata had her rapier out. With a pure, melodious clang, I stopped it with my own sword.</p>
<p>“Whoa, Hinata! Not the head! You interrogating her or killing her?!”</p>
<p>“…I didn’t intend to.”</p>
<p>“You liar! You had every intention of it just now!”</p>
<p>Eesh. Gonna have to keep a constant vigil, I see. Hinata absolutely would’ve decapitated her. I managed to react because I had an eye out, but we came <em>this</em> close to losing a valuable information source.</p>
<p>“It’s all right, Sir Rimuru. I can use her as a test subject for my resurrection magic.”</p>
<p>Shuna was there smiling, like always.</p>
<p>“That’s true. And I can use divine miracle resurrection as well. There was hardly any problem with it.”</p>
<p><a id="page-275"></a>I wasn’t sure how much of this was an act. Both Hinata and Shuna were griping at me now, but I didn’t really think it was okay to kill someone just because you could resurrect them later. I didn’t think so, but there <em>was</em> a certain type of persuasive logic to it. It’s strange.</p>
<p>“Look, can you just shut up for a second, Hinata?”</p>
<p>Time to tag back in. This was going downhill really fast, so I better have Hinata cool off for a bit.</p>
<p>So. My turn again.</p>
<p><em>Raphael, do your stuff!</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>…Understood.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Raphael eagerly accepted the challenge. I simply voiced what it told me.</p>
<p>“I’m assuming a professional like you isn’t gonna just tell me everything because I asked nicely. So you can just listen to me instead, okay?”</p>
<p>Hmm. Interesting. Prod her and gauge what she knows from her reactions, then?</p>
<p>“Try not to lose your poker face, then.”</p>
<p>“Hah! You better not look down on <em>me</em>. I don’t need you to remind me!” Glenda’s up to the challenge, huh? <em>So who’s gonna win this?</em> I wondered, as if I were part of the audience.</p>
<p>“Unique skills often take root in people’s souls. You’re a good example of that. Yours is bound fast to your soul with a powerful force.”</p>
<p>“Huh. Didn’t know that. So?”</p>
<p>“So in that conference I attended, a lot of the councillors were tarnished by their vast, greedy desires.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh…”</p>
<p>“These desires were forcibly planted into them. There’s a force involved that can directly impact people’s souls, and I think that’s what guided their moves.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“And you’re under that same influence, Glenda.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p><a id="page-276"></a>“In your case, though, your unique skill is providing protection to your soul, so this influence hasn’t fully clouded you yet.”</p>
<p>“Ngh…” Glenda wordlessly scowled. Maybe she couldn’t find a way to deny it—it was kinda news to me as well, but still.</p>
<p>“But as amazing as your unique skill is, there are people out there who can see it for what it is.”</p>
<p>“…You mean with Appraiser’s Eye?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. Dragon’s Eye, from the demon lord Milim, is more famous. Not that I’m up on this stuff, but there’s an old story about how <em>Milim can see everything</em>, right? Apparently, that’s really true. One glance at someone, and Milim has a general idea of what kinds of skills they have.”</p>
<p>That was true, although she couldn’t guess someone’s internally manifested skills and couldn’t give you details unless the subject invoked them. She could gauge their strengths, as well as whether a given skill was “extra” or “unique” in nature. It was just harder to give you finer details—for example, if someone had two or more unique skills, she’d have trouble telling whether it was two skills or one <em>really</em> powerful skill.</p>
<p>I was actually the same way, too. My Analyze and Assess was now accurate enough that I got a hazy insight into the skills of other people, and I also learned how I could conceal mine from others, the way Guy Crimson had hidden his own magicule count. When I first met Guy, I assumed your skills stayed hidden unless you showed them off to people. I was wrong—like I said, an Analyze and Assess skill forged well enough can detect them, with the one being assessed none the wiser.</p>
<p>Looking back, I was pretty lucky, actually. Thanks to having four different ultimate skills, Guy must’ve taken one look at me and assumed I couldn’t be toyed with. Raphael was the one skill I absolutely had to keep under my hat, so that was the watchword for my future moves from that point forward.</p>
<p>So I switched my way of thinking and assumed there was no way to hide skills, but that was actually pretty possible. If you’ve built up a skill to the point that it’s completely your own, you can actually defend Analysis skills from picking up on it. It wasn’t perfect yet, but that was the result of the experiments I had been doing.</p>
<p><a id="page-277"></a>“What are you trying to say? Yes, I have a unique skill. But even if it’s protected me from the desires, so what?”</p>
<p>My little pause there must’ve irritated Glenda. Hearing about these outside influences inspired her to play along with me. I wanted to give her an answer, but Raphael’s roundabout descriptions were getting a bit hard to grasp. Parsing it into something I could reasonably explain took some time.</p>
<p class="space-break1s1"><em>Suggestion. Use Hasten Thought?</em></p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara"><em>Yes</em></p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara"><em>No</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Oh, yeah, there <em>was</em> that. I thought <em>Yes</em>, cursing myself for not doing that in the first place. Now let’s hurry this up and get Glenda on my side already.</p>
<p>“Whether your mind’s clouded by greed or not is none of my business. But one thing’s for sure: Your employer’s got a pretty powerful unique skill running. That’s true, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“No comment…but I guess there’s no denying it, either.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. So, building on that, there was a man at the Founder’s Festival whose desires were being harnessed like that. His name is Gaiye, and Shuna took care of him at the Council this afternoon. The other festival visitors weren’t subjected to interference that way, but some of the merchants were. And if a large number of people are brought under a skill’s influence at once, chances are that the skill user is physically nearby. That’s what I thought.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Gaiye was completely hooked by it, but the farther away you got from the skill user, generally, the weaker the skill got. Masayuki’s skill was another monster, but the rumors that spread around about him only added to its synergy. That foundation is why the skill propagates so much further than he means it to.</p>
<p>Influencing people’s desires, meanwhile, was purely dependent on the skill’s power itself. Beyond that, the user could utilize their strength or some other element to enhance the effect if they <a id="page-278"></a>wanted. Basically, though, if you told me our skill user attended the Founder’s Festival, I’d certainly believe it.</p>
<p>Along those lines, I had a suspect in mind. Someone I speculated about enough that I had Soei look into her. “Have you ever heard the name Maribel Rozzo?”</p>
<p>Raphael sure was cutting to the chase. The name came straight from the dossier Soei prepared for me.</p>
<p>“…!!”</p>
<p>She might’ve been trying to hide it, but Glenda gave me an ever-so-slight response. So that was a yes.</p>
<p>“My Analyze and Assess skill is pretty good, y’know. Not only can it detect what skills a person has, but it can also tell if someone’s hiding one of them. I was sensing the latter all throughout the Founder’s Festival, and one of the people I got that vibe from was that girl Maribel.”</p>
<p>I could see Glenda grow paler as I continued. I couldn’t tell if she was getting hot or if it was a cold sweat running down her cheek. Either way, she was getting nervous.</p>
<p>“Y-you—”</p>
<p>“Maribel Rozzo, you said? The Rozzo family… Hmm. I see.”</p>
<p>“Ah…?!”</p>
<p>Hinata interrupted Glenda just when she was about to say something. I should’ve been annoyed, but looking at Hinata, I didn’t need to be. She had a delighted expression, like she had just found the answer. Glenda, meanwhile, made it clear that something had gone awry with her plans.</p>
<p>“Granville Rozzo. The founder of the Rozzo family and a former Hero. I’m sure you know him, too, don’t you, Glenda? That—and he was the real person behind Gren, the Sunday Priest and head of the Seven Days Clergy…”</p>
<p>Just as I thought—Hinata was at the truth now. I could see her mentally connecting the dots on the people she knew.</p>
<p>“Seven Days, huh? Those guys we met before? I heard they had all died, but Granville’s still alive?”</p>
<p>“Nicolaus said he landed the final blow, but we’re talking about someone who ruled over the Western Holy Church for centuries. I wouldn’t be surprised if he survived it.”</p>
<p><a id="page-279"></a>So Maribel was the skill user behind all this greed manipulation. And Granville Rozzo—Gren from the Seven Days—was the head of her family. Mm-<em>hmm</em>. And if Gren’s the kind of monster who can survive for hundreds of years, he’s likely got the Council in his pocket.</p>
<p>“So should we assume Gren’s our mastermind here?”</p>
<p>“No doubt about it. He’s using Maribel’s powerful skill for some kind of scheme of his.”</p>
<p>Hinata and I were now comparing notes, ignoring Glenda entirely. We basically had our answer, and Glenda had just lost her value to us.</p>
<p>“God<em>damn</em> it! Why do you know so much? I didn’t even <em>tell</em> you anything! This is basically the same damn thing as me <em>revealing</em> it all!”</p>
<p><em>Mmm, yeah, sorry about that. You picked the wrong team to mess with, is all I can say. Raphael’s too much of a talent to compete against.</em></p>
<p>“I suppose they might think you did, wouldn’t they?” I said.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s what you get, Glenda,” said Hinata. “A fitting end for a traitor.”</p>
<p>“Dammit. I… I… They’re going to kill me…” Seeing Glenda whisper to herself, face drained of color, I felt a little bad for her.</p>
<p>I had no intention of killing her; now that I had my info, I was ready to hand her over to Englesia. But…yeah. Wherever she went, she probably wasn’t gonna be alive much longer. I figured she had the talent to flee to safety, but judging by how unnerved she was, she was dealing with some pretty ominous odds.</p>
<p>“Is this Maribel girl that powerful?” I decided to ask.</p>
<p>“…She’s not that big an issue. But summoned people like me are bound by spells that we can’t resist. The moment they decide I’ve fled from them, they’ll crush my soul, and that will be the end for me.”</p>
<p>Gee, <em>that</em> doesn’t sound nice…</p>
<p>“So you didn’t betray Luminus out of your own free will? It was because you didn’t have any other choice?”</p>
<p>“Well…it’s complicated. I wanted to throw myself upon the mercy of my god, but Granville’s eyes were on me. Really, there was nothing I could’ve done about it.”</p>
<p><a id="page-280"></a>Maybe I was right to sympathize with her a little. Hinata was still giving her a cold look, but I think she wasn’t so angry now. She wanted to murder her less, at least.</p>
<p>“No, you’re right about that. If your soul’s shattered, not even Resurrection can help you then.”</p>
<p>Wow. Guess even Hinata can be gentle sometimes. She was still stern, but now she was looking for a way to help Glenda. But could I undo that spell?</p>
<p class="space-break1s1"><em>Understood. It is not a problem. Remove the spell?</em></p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara"><em>Yes</em></p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara"><em>No</em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>That</em> was easy.</p>
<p>And so it was off.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">“It’s over now,” lamented Glenda. “Maribel… She’s reading my emotions. I may not have intended to betray her, but she’s gonna judge me now…”</p>
<p>So I let her in on what I just did.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, no need to worry. We’re all done with you, so go live whatever life you want. I’m pretty sure <em>she</em> thinks you’re dead now.”</p>
<p>“N-no, um, I wasn’t talking about that. You mean to say you undid the curse ruling over me?!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, pretty much. But lemme just remind you: You get hostile with me, and I’ll show you no mercy.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I suppose I’ll look the other way,” Hinata said. “If I kill someone Rimuru let go, he’ll never let me hear the end of it. But keep this in mind: You have betrayed Luminus herself. The Western Holy Church will never forgive you for that.”</p>
<p>Glenda was a strong girl. A threat. But now that she was free from the rule of Maribel or whatever, we didn’t have much reason to remain hostile. If she started trouble with us again, we could always <a id="page-281"></a>do her in then. Personally, I didn’t think she caused <em>that</em> much of a headache, so I was ready to forgive her. Hinata seemed willing to do the same; I guess she felt she couldn’t be so narrow-minded about someone I let go free.</p>
<p>Besides, in a way, Glenda really <em>was</em> just following orders—not with her brain, exactly, but with the influence of the curse forced upon her. This time, I was willing to give her a slap on the wrist.</p>
<p>“So right, you’re free to go. If you want to stay in my nation for a while, you’re welcome to, but if you cause any trouble—”</p>
<p>“W-wait a… I mean, <em>wait</em> a second! You’re really letting me go?”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh. I don’t really feel like killing you anyway.”</p>
<p>“If Sir Rimuru has forgiven you, we have no reason to defy his will,” said Soei.</p>
<p>“Not that you’re much of a threat anyway,” Benimaru added.</p>
<p>They were willing to go with me, too. I didn’t much appreciate the way they phrased it, but they didn’t seem to have any complaints. They <em>didn’t</em> see her as a threat, I imagine—which I wasn’t too sure about, but to them, it was the truth. She’d never beat Benimaru’s full effort, much less Soei’s. Glenda struck me as the kind of woman who took a profit-and-loss approach to living, so she’d never do something stupid like challenge an unbeatable foe. Letting her go didn’t seem like that big of a problem.</p>
<p>As I convinced myself to take an optimistic approach, Glenda turned to me, kneeled, and said something extraordinary.</p>
<p>“I—I have a request! I’ll tell you everything I know, so could you please give me some employment? I’ll do anything you want, even dirty work, so please!”</p>
<p>Benimaru and I looked at each other, passing messages with our eyes:</p>
<p><em>Now what?</em></p>
<p><em>Do whatever you want.</em></p>
<p>But “<em>employment</em>”? What about the money? I had more to work with, but we were still sorting out salaries for my top officials. Working for free was still the norm around here.</p>
<p>“Hmm… I appreciate the sentiment, but we’re still busy developing ourselves. We’re pretty far behind in terms of organization, so we’re not paying anyone a salary yet…”</p>
<p><a id="page-282"></a>Times like this, you gotta just be honest. No point trying to smooth over things.</p>
<p>“…Huh?” Glenda froze. But the next thing she said surprised me instead. “Well, I’m used to that. I was stationed with the Master Rooks in the Holy Empire of Lubelius, but they didn’t pay us there either…”</p>
<p>Dang.</p>
<p>Even the Three Battlesages, the best Lubelius had to offer, didn’t get any money. They were paid in goods—and any money they needed, they were expected to scrounge themselves. They had an illustrious name to leverage, though, and I’m sure they got treated like kings wherever they went. Sometimes they’d receive payments for resolving crimes, too, so they led pretty decent lifestyles.</p>
<p>“Wait, so you get nothing, either, Hinata?”</p>
<p>She sure racked up a hell of a bill at the festival…</p>
<p>“<em>Tch…</em> No. Lubelius is an advocate for equality, so there’s no public salary at all. We all get paid in goods.”</p>
<p>That was a surprise…but also a relief. Lubelius has a long, storied history, and it made it <em>this</em> far without salaries. Maybe we shouldn’t be in any hurry to enact them, either.</p>
<p>By the way, thanks to running the Crusaders and the Imperial Guard, Hinata <em>was</em> given access to some of the government budget. Between that and monster-hunting rewards, her income was actually pretty upper-class.</p>
<p>“And yet you made <em>me</em> pay for you?”</p>
<p>“Quit sweating the small stuff! I’m just saving money.”</p>
<p>She brought the kids all kinds of stuff, but with me, it’s all “Ooh, gotta save money.” And actually, did Mjöllmile pay her the labyrinth reward fees yet? The thought just occurred to me, but I didn’t want to prod <em>that</em> hornet’s nest. I was too scared to ask, so I didn’t.</p>
<p>“But I’m pretty well-known around the Western Nations. Even if I’m free, I don’t have any work waiting for me. No nation’s gonna hire me now, and I’m not cut out for adventuring work. Besides, you’re on the cutting edge in culture here, so if you can guarantee me meals and a roof over my head, I’m good!”</p>
<p>Judging by how desperate Glenda was sounding, I doubted she was trying to deceive me.</p>
<p><a id="page-283"></a>And I had reason to believe her. If Lubelius was in pursuit of the Three Battlesages, everyone would have to assume a betrayal was the cause. She’d never find a nation willing to employ someone as politically touchy as her. Even if she became an adventurer under an assumed name, I could get it if everyone kept a prudent distance. If her cover got blown, she might have Lubelius <em>and</em> Granville come after her, too. Any kind of stable life was impossible.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess you’ll have a hard time of it without support from somewhere.”</p>
<p>“Right? So please, Sir Demon Lord! I know you don’t believe a word of this, but I swear I’ll stay faithful to you!”</p>
<p>There’s no way I <em>could</em> believe it. But somehow, I just couldn’t find it in myself to hate her. She was the classic spy-film femme fatale, and I couldn’t just abandon her.</p>
<p>“Can I leave her to you, Soei?”</p>
<p>“As you wish, Sir Rimuru. I have no objection.”</p>
<p>“Great. Thanks. And I can’t have her turning traitor, so deal with that if it happens, okay?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely. In terms of battle strength alone, I would rate her above Soka, so perhaps I could establish a special-ops team for her that answers to me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, kinda like a team all the problem kids get thrown into?”</p>
<p>“Something like that, Sir Rimuru. I’d like to scout out members locally and elsewhere.”</p>
<p><em>Soei’s got some ideas brewing, doesn’t he?</em> Diablo was still off searching for an army, so it wouldn’t be fair to turn Soei down. Let him do what he wants.</p>
<p>“Right! I’ll leave all that up to you! You can work out a budget with Mjöllmile later.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir Rimuru!”</p>
<p>We wrapped <em>that</em> up fast.</p>
<p>“Can you not call me a problem child in front of my face?”</p>
<p>Glenda was whining about something, but if she had an issue, she oughtta try to win my trust first. Either way, she was now part of our team.</p>

<p class="tx1">Before leaving Glenda to Soei’s management, we decided to have Glenda tell us everything she was aware of. It was no longer an interrogation, so we decided to talk over dinner.</p>
<p>“In the dining hall, you pick up these boards with menu items on them and take them to the window over there. There’s a selection of three items each day, plus a regular special. If you get promoted to management, you’ll get to order one item of your own, too.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really? Because <em>my</em> meals always get picked for me.”</p>
<p>They were always good, I felt, but I never went through that board trade-in thing. The managerial dining hall brought food over to you without having to say or do anything. That—and Shion and Gobichi would occasionally rent kitchen space so they could develop special new meals of their own, but that was another story.</p>
<p>“Today’s special is our most popular menu item,” Shuna explained with a smile. “Normally, you’d either reserve it with merit points or get in line early for a chance at it.”</p>
<p>Ah. I always thought the desserts were really fancy here. I guess I wasn’t alone.</p>
<p>“We always get this, don’t we?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I make sure I get my share.”</p>
<p>Benimaru and Soei order the special, too? I wondered what Soei meant by that. Did he have one of his spies stand in line for him? I hope he’s not resorting to silly cafeteria antics like that.</p>
<p>With the dishes on our table, dinner began.</p>
<p>“Right, so let’s begin with—”</p>
<p>I was trying to talk to Glenda…but she was completely focused on her food, a woman possessed. It <em>was</em> good, I’ll admit—definitely worth being called a special. So I decided to wait. It’s nice to have more pleasant conversation during a meal anyway.</p>
<p class="space-break1">After we were done:</p>
<p>“Up until now, I always thought money was the most important thing in life. But today, I’ve changed my mind. From now on, I live for nothing but merit points!!”</p>
<p><a id="page-285"></a>If she meant it, she was <em>way</em> easier to take down than I thought. But whatever. If that’s what motivates her, then hey, knock yourself out.</p>
<p>“All right. So what do you know? Give me the unembellished truth,” Soei pressed.</p>
<p>And Glenda finally started to talk.</p>
<p>First, about the Council. This organization was under the control of five senior councillors, known as the Five Elders. These were headed by Granville, whom we had discussed earlier. As for the other four? Amazingly, one of them was Count Gaban, the mastermind behind today’s events. Prince Johann of Rostia, one of the councillors relatively supportive of me, was another.</p>
<p>“How come there are so many differing opinions among the Five Elders?”</p>
<p>“That’s how Maribel likes it. She pits the Council against one another so they can keep the mainstream faction the strongest. It’s kind of fixed, you could say, but to the people involved, it’s a serious battle for survival.”</p>
<p>Hmm. A way to encourage activity within the group? It’d be more efficient if they all worked together, but that’d open it up more to stagnation and corruption. You often hear about family-run companies getting ruined by whoever was at the top. Besides, if Johann successfully earned my trust, it’d be easier for him to learn more about our inner workings. If they had booted us out today, then fine; if they didn’t, now Johann was no doubt ready to extend his feelers toward us.</p>
<p>“It’s all kind of malicious, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I wish we could just burn it all up instead of deal with it.”</p>
<p>Just hearing about all this made my eyes water. You had to know who your friends and enemies were, or else you’d quickly be ruined. That’s how they did things in the nobility—and if I didn’t know that, I would’ve been on the cusp of trusting in Johann. Maybe taking Glenda in was the right thing after all.</p>
<p>The other two elders were Margrave Cidre, tasked with protecting the northern regions of Englesia, and King Doran, leader of a small military kingdom also called Doran. This meant two out of the five elders were Englesian, which showed how much Granville <a id="page-286"></a>valued that nation—close to the Holy Empire of Lubelius, far from the Forest of Jura, and one of the safest countries in the world. He must’ve marked it as the nation most worthy of serving as his political and economic center.</p>
<p>“So why do they see me as the enemy? I’m so harmless! I wouldn’t hurt a fly.” I kind of let that slip out. It seemed to surprise the group.</p>
<p>“Huh? If you keep picking the kind of fights <em>you</em> pick, of course people are gonna be hostile.”</p>
<p>Pardon?</p>
<p>“Yeah, I thought you were picking fights with people, too. Diablo told me all about how Sir Rimuru was going to have the world economy in his grip before long, so I thought you wanted to take over the Council.”</p>
<p><em>What?! And hang on, Diablo’s saying stuff like that?</em></p>
<p>“That was my intention as well. My information gathering was part of that effort, I thought.”</p>
<p><em>Well, no, I’ll admit that was what it’s for, but…</em></p>
<p>“…Don’t tell me you didn’t even realize you were doing it?”</p>
<p><em>Not you too, Hinata! Why’s everyone looking at me like that?</em> “N-no, um… I’m not gonna say I <em>didn’t</em> mean it, but I didn’t intend to hurry things along <em>that</em> quickly. So for now, I just wanna keep things to peaceful negotiation…”</p>
<p>Hinata sighed and rolled her eyes. “If some new merchant comes along and ruins <em>your</em> marketplace, <em>you</em> won’t find a lot of merchants softhearted enough to forgive that, either.”</p>
<p>Oof. Maybe not.</p>
<p>“Well, all right, all right. We were gonna clash in the future anyway, so let’s just treat ourselves to the main support of economic activity in the Western Nations, all right?”</p>
<p>“That was my intention all along. My job’s to shore up their defenses, but…”</p>
<p>“And I will investigate the Rozzo family and the Five Elders.”</p>
<p>In a way, it was good that we knew our enemies now. Befriending Glenda was an unexpected windfall, and thanks to that, we had a direction to go.</p>
<p><a id="page-287"></a>“Okay. Be careful on that. I don’t want to wage a two-front war against Yuuki and the Rozzos.”</p>
<p>“I’m aware,” Benimaru said with a nod, while Soei gave his own agreement.</p>
<p>I was taking a wait-and-see approach with Yuuki as we waged information and economic warfare with the Rozzos. There were no real bullets flying around, at least, which made things easier on me.</p>
<p>So I was about to wrap things up, wondering if I was worrying too much about this, when Hinata stopped me.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute. Yuuki and the Rozzos? Why are you suspicious of Yuuki?”</p>
<p>I was thrown for a moment, but then I realized Hinata might be oblivious to all that.</p>
<p>“Well, thinking about it, if you look at the list of people who know I’m a reincarnate involved with Shizu—and who could’ve leaked that info to the Eastern merchants…”</p>
<p>“Yuuki’s about it, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>“Pretty much. And while I’m at it, I think that Roy, the guy who played the role of a demon lord, was killed by this guy Laplace, member of something called the Moderate Jesters. Sorry if I’m wrong about that.”</p>
<p>“No, I appreciate it. I don’t have any stake in that, but if he’s working against us, I can’t stand for that.”</p>
<p>She was willing to accept Laplace and his cohorts as our foes. She gave a cold, cold smile, one that froze my spine in place. <em>Man</em>, that’s scary. I definitely better make sure I don’t rile her.</p>
<p class="space-break1">After that exchange, Hinata stood up, preparing to head home.</p>
<p>“Ummm, actually, about that…,” Glenda timidly spoke up. Guess she still had something to say.</p>
<p>“What is it? If you wanna say something, don’t hold back. Did you remember something else?”</p>
<p>Then she dropped the biggest bombshell of the day.</p>
<p>“By Yuuki, you mean the grand master of the Guild, right? He’s connected to Johann of the Five Elders, but I’d say he’s pretty much under Maribel’s complete control.”</p>
<p><a id="page-288"></a><em>Huh? Yuuki’s being manipulated?!</em></p>
<p>“Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“I’m not shameless enough to joke at a time like this.”</p>
<p><em>No, I bet not.</em> “…Well, why didn’t you tell us sooner? That’s important!”</p>
<p>“Um… You know, I answered directly to Granville for the most part, so…”</p>
<p>Essentially, two people had the right to give Glenda orders: Granville and Maribel, although it was Granville nine times out of ten. As a result, Glenda didn’t get to talk with Maribel often or get much of an insight into her mind.</p>
<p>I picked her brain a little more, seeing if I could get anything else. We learned about more of her underlings, as well as the Blood Shadow, a group that handled the Rozzo family’s dirty work.</p>
<p>“That <em>is</em> a problem,” said Shuna after a moment of reflection. “It might be that whoever’s controlling Yuuki drove him to leak your secret for some reason.”</p>
<p>Hinata was lost in thought as well. It looked like we’d need to reconsider matters from the ground up.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>……</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Even Raphael was thinking in silence for once. That’s a rarity, but if it couldn’t come up with an answer, worrying about it might be a waste of time.</p>
<p>What we needed here was a clear solution. If thinking won’t solve a problem, we can think later. When taking an exam, it’s always smarter to leave the tougher questions for later—wasting valuable time was never a good idea.</p>
<p>“Well, either way, Yuuki’s still suspicious, so let’s keep an eye on him… Actually, wait a minute.”</p>
<p>As wary as Yuuki was, I couldn’t imagine him trying to spring something on me. But if he was under someone’s thrall, that was another story—and since that someone’s the clearly hostile Maribel, maybe the assumptions I’ve been working with were wrong all this time, huh?</p>
<p><a id="page-289"></a>“Hey, if Yuuki can’t defy Maribel’s orders, you think he might be scheming something no matter <em>what</em> his position is?”</p>
<p>Yeah. That’s the thing. Maribel wanted us out of the picture, and she might be willing to use Yuuki for that goal, keeping her own hands clean. Trying to avoid a “two-front war” was the least of our worries.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t sound too good, does it?”</p>
<p>“Given that we’re in the info-gathering stage, the Rozzos can’t make any flashy moves, I imagine. But…”</p>
<p>“Soei and my brother are right. You’re about to venture into the ruins with Yuuki’s assistant, the Guild vice-master Lady Kagali, yes? They might be planning something in there…”</p>
<p>Mmm. Looks like everyone’s reached the same conclusion. Maybe the wait-and-see approach was too optimistic.</p>
<p>“I can’t lie and claim that’s not a worry of mine. Maribel and the Rozzos can always say they didn’t know what Yuuki was doing, too. They can pin all the blame on the Free Guild and cause a rift between us…”</p>
<p>“…And that would ruin your plans, Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“If we stay on the sidelines like this, they might strike first.”</p>
<p>Mmmmmm.</p>
<p>But I felt we were already on guard enough. Security was stepped up across town. They could try to rile up our townspeople, but it wouldn’t go that easy.</p>
<p>So…</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Suggestion. You could deliberately open a soft spot to lure them in.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">That’s it!</p>
<p>“Perhaps we could cancel the expedition?”</p>
<p>I shook my head at Benimaru. “No. Actually, let’s take advantage of it. Milim will scream at me if we cancel it, so let’s go through with it. Let’s go in as prepared as we can for anything that could pop up—and when it does, let’s engage it!”</p>
<p>Milim was looking forward to exploring the ruins. It was like a <a id="page-290"></a>field trip to her, something to take her mind off homework, and she’d fly into a rage if I told her it was off. I didn’t want to create yet more problems for myself, so I really wanted to avoid that.</p>
<p>“But wouldn’t that be dangerous?”</p>
<p>“With Milim there? And I was going to take Shion to guard me anyway.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that should work, then. I’m sure she’ll be glad to hear that, given how she was on home duty.”</p>
<p>Benimaru had no complaints, so Shion it was.</p>
<p>“And I’ll take Gobta and Ranga along, too. That should be more than enough of a fighting force, shouldn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Understood. We’ll make sure nothing happens in town in the meantime!”</p>
<p>“And I’ll help my brother strengthen the barrier around it.”</p>
<p>“I’ll keep a steady watch for any unusual movements between countries—especially the Five Elders Glenda mentioned.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. And we have Veldora in the Dungeon, so if things get <em>really</em> bad, turn to him.” I gave each of them my approval.</p>
<p>“Well, I need to bring all this discussion back to Lady Luminus,” said Hinata. “Be careful, all right? Because you have a tendency to get careless sometimes.”</p>
<p>“Quit reminding me!”</p>
<p>So she magically willed herself back home. She’s usually cold to me, but sometimes, in her own way, she can demonstrate legitimate concern, too.</p>
<p>Was this her idea of flirting?</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Understood. No.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">No dice, huh? I was hoping I’d get to dream a little, but reality isn’t so kind, is it?</p>
<p>Anyway, we had our walking papers. Now we just had to prepare for the big day.</p>
