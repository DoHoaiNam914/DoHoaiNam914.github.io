<p><a id="page-28"></a>It was kind of like setting up a vending machine selling toilet-paper packets at high prices next to a train-station bathroom that had no paper on hand. Unfair? Yes—but extremely effective. Masayuki’s insight really <em>was</em> sensational.</p>
<p>“Well,” I said with a smile, “if you have any other thoughts in mind, don’t be shy about sharing them.”</p>
<p>Masayuki pondered for a few moments, no doubt recalling all the video games he’d played.</p>
<p>“Hmm… Could we maybe have a portable save point you can only use once? I was lucky enough to make it to Floor 10, but now that you’ve removed the trapdoors, I think it’s taking a lot more time to reach that point. This isn’t a game to the challengers, so I think the time commitment involved is making things a lot harder as well.”</p>
<p>Yes… That’s fair, too. I had to agree with him. The way things were, a journey to Floor 10 would take several days. With his previous idea, we had stumbled upon the notion of making money off extended stays in the labyrinth. Maybe we should think more along these lines?</p>
<p>“Mmm, yes, that child is on to something! I was thinking the very same thing. Humans are such fragile little creatures, so we need to offer a bit of a helping hand.”</p>
<p>Veldora was the first to offer agreement. And who was the very person who designed this hellscape of a dungeon for fragile little humans anyway?</p>
<p>“Well, I can certainly set up disposable save points! But wouldn’t it be more profitable to have adventurers stay at inns?”</p>
<p>So implementation wasn’t a problem. Man, whenever the topic turned toward money, Ramiris was sharp as a tack. I was surprised she had something useful to say.</p>
<p>“No, Lady Ramiris, not necessarily. We should actually price them on the high side. If they don’t have any pressing business, they can always stay at an inn, but I think a lot of people would need to regularly report back to their patrons or whatever. That, and I think some people would want to carry them around as extra insurance, <a id="page-29"></a>in case something unexpected happens in the labyrinth. It could help sell our return whistles as well.”</p>
<p>Mjöllmile was keen on this, too. I think he sensed a business opportunity. And he was right—you could use them in many different ways. If you were spending several days in the labyrinth at once, you may want to know what’s going on outside. Plus, the idea was to attract mercenaries hired by the nobility going forward, and they may need to file regular reports with their bosses.</p>
<p>And also…</p>
<p>“In my case, my companions beat him pretty easily for me, but the save point on the tenth floor’s protected by a powerful monster, right? I think a lot of people would want to use a save point <em>before</em> they challenge that guy.”</p>
<p>I nodded deeply at Masayuki. To a gamer, saving before you tackle a boss—or a floor guardian, in this case—was common sense. I recalled moments when I skipped that vital step before the final boss, only to lose several hours’ worth of play. Sad accidents like that can be laughed away because it’s only a game, but how frustrating would it be if that happened in real life?</p>
<p>“Right,” I said. “Thinking about it, maybe we’re being a little too unkind.”</p>
<p>Veldora and Ramiris nodded their agreement at me.</p>
<p>“Boy… Ah, right, your name was Masayuki? The advice you provide is quite helpful, yes.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! I’m really amazed! You sure <em>are</em> an otherworlder, aren’t you? Just like Rimuru! It’s gonna be great working with you, Masayuki!”</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, Masayuki had been accepted as a peer.</p>
<p>“Now, there’s no need to spoil anyone past Floor 50, I don’t think. But in the floors that won’t entertain too many veteran adventurers, I think it’d be a good idea to at least go a little easy.”</p>
<p>And now Masayuki was advising them as a full-fledged labyrinth administrator. That adaptability is probably his greatest asset of all, I think, and I had no objections to his take.</p>
<p>“All right. So let’s set up a rest stop before the stairway on each <a id="page-30"></a>floor. When you reach it, you can pay a fee or something to gain access to part of Floor 95.”</p>
<p>“And we’ll set up an inn and tavern down there?”</p>
<p>“Right, right. I’m not gonna open up the elven lounge to the general public—that’s still members only—but we could easily set up something similar for adventurers. And don’t forget—we’ll charge a premium for it!”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! Oh, I understand, believe me, I do.”</p>
<p>As a rule, prices are high in tourist sites. There’s a soda and coffee vending machine at the summit of Mount Fuji, but you’re gonna be paying the equivalent of five bucks for a soda. There’s nothing like eating a cheap box lunch at the peak, but while something like that’s never gonna be gourmet cuisine, if you purchase it on the mountain itself, you can bet it’s gonna go for four-star restaurant prices. So it’s a given that the facilities inside the labyrinth will be pricier than their equivalents outside.</p>
<p>Now the little town we had going on Floor 95 would be more useful than ever.</p>
<p>“But can you really craft disposable save points like that, Ramiris?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely no problem there! Easy-peasy! There are these things called Recording Crystals, and they’re fine for disposable use.”</p>
<p>The item Ramiris produced was actually quite handy. You could use it anywhere in the labyrinth, and it worked exactly like a regular save point. Add yourself to a Recording Crystal, and the next time you die, you’ll be able to restart from where you saved. If you use a return whistle to exit the Dungeon, the next time you go in, you’ll pick things up from your Recording Crystal. That held true even if the structure of the labyrinth itself changes—you wouldn’t reappear in the exact same location, but you’d get transported to the nearest safe place, kind of.</p>
<p>“We can sell <em>those</em> at high prices, too, indeed.”</p>
<p>“Well, actually, I’d like to distribute those a little more widely.”</p>
<p>“How about we mix them in with the rarer items in treasure chests?”</p>
<p>The discussion was humming now.</p>
<p><a id="page-31"></a>“Kwaaah-ha-ha-ha! Now I have more to look forward to!”</p>
<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t expect anything to change <em>too</em> quickly, but I <em>do</em> think we’ll see fewer challengers give up.”</p>
<p>Even Veldora and Masayuki were excitedly joining in. This was working out well. We were tackling our problems, addressing them, and debating together to come up with solutions.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Right. That was certainly a worthwhile meeting.</p>
<p>Floor 1 would now house a training area to help people learn the ABCs before tackling the Dungeon, as well as a place for general announcements. We’d provide virtual “missions” for visitors to try out, helping them acquire the minimum knowledge necessary to survive. They were free to undertake this training—or not, as the case may be. Forcing the challengers into it wouldn’t help much. All the risks fell on their shoulders, besides.</p>
<p>We would also set things up so that you couldn’t die in the first floor, either. You never know; we might get some crazy adventurer in here causing problems, and I don’t want our staff in any danger. Besides, I wanted people to experience for themselves what death was like in this space. We’d made it so you were instantly revived on the spot, so maybe it’d be a fun place for kids as well.</p>
<p>For the more advanced challengers, we’d also prepare a room for battle training against a few different types of monsters. We’d put bracelets on the monsters we captured for the purpose, so they could be revived again and again—that way, people could learn how to fight and polish their battle skills. In addition, there was a large gymnasium-style area for the use of our nation’s new soldiers. Maybe, on occasion, it’d be fun to capture a whole bunch of monsters and stage a large-scale group battle in there.</p>
<p>Things would begin in earnest starting with Floor 2. But from there until Floor 4, we got rid of all the insta-death traps and downgraded the rank of the monsters wandering the halls from E to F. The rooms would have just one D-ranked creature, and in <a id="page-32"></a>the chests they guarded, we’d toss in Low Potions and other useful labyrinth-conquering tools. Equipment and other high-market items would begin appearing on Floor 5.</p>
<p>So we worked on adjustments like these, recalibrating the Dungeon’s overall difficulty. That should help people advance a bit faster starting tomorrow. Video games hold closed beta sessions all the time, after all; maybe launching without a rehearsal wasn’t such a great idea.</p>
<p>…I mean, we <em>did</em> do some testing, but our test party was six people from Shion’s Team Reborn, so the feedback we got wasn’t particularly useful. They had no trouble storming all the way down to Floor 40, before we had the tempest serpent serving as that level’s boss wipe them out. Thanks to that, I had the mistaken notion that the labyrinth’s difficulty level was just right. The traps and minion-level foes were no sweat to them as they breezed their way downward. Based on Team Reborn’s progress, we figured everything was okay—with a little experience, folks would be hitting Floor 50 soon, no doubt.</p>
<p>We needed to select our testers a little more carefully. Shion personally trained the members of Team Reborn, and I guess they’re far more talented than I thought. But we could tackle that later.</p>
<p class="space-break1">“So does that round out the issues? Anything else to bring up?”</p>
<p>I lobbed out the question, already happy enough with this discussion. Everyone had pitched in, and I figured we were done for the day, but…</p>
<p>“Can I say something?” Mjöllmile asked.</p>
<p>“Oh? Something else?”</p>
<p>“Yes. More to do with labyrinth administration, but…”</p>
<p>Ah yes, something about advertising or revenues? I had my concerns about that as well. It was only day three, of course, so I wasn’t expecting to rake it in yet. But Ramiris’s eyes were practically shining at the mention of the topic. It’s almost hilarious how money-obsessed of a fairy she is.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha! We’ve only just started making back our investment,” Mjöllmile said with a laugh, as if defending himself against her. <a id="page-33"></a>Then his expression grew more serious. “No, I wanted to report to you about our advertising. In order to attract the nobility’s attention, I’ve calculated the amount of the reward purse we should offer. What do you think about a hundred gold coins?”</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>“And that’s gonna be paid in…?”</p>
<p>“We’ll use one stellar gold coin, of course.”</p>
<p>Glad to see Mjöllmile’s reading my mind on that. I had learned from our mistake last time; I needed to get our hoard of stellars changed out. And a hundred gold coins would be about…what, around a hundred thousand dollars?</p>
<p>“That’s not too little, is it?”</p>
<p>It was a fortune to your average peasant, but it didn’t seem like enough to motivate a noble who’s probably swimming in money. Sure, adventurers can pick up magic crystals and rare items along the way, but a hundred gold didn’t seem quite enough for all the effort.</p>
<p>But Mjöllmile simply grinned at me. “Hee-hee-hee! I understand your doubts. But I’ve spread the word that this reward would be given to whoever can make it past Floor 50. We’ll award it to the first party each month to achieve the feat. Manage it solo, and you earn the entire purse; work as a party, and you’ll divide it up among yourselves. And that’s not the only reward…”</p>
<p>As he explained, he had also attached prize money to the boss monsters on every tenth floor.</p>
<p>On Floor 10, that would be a black spider, a B-ranked creature. The first five teams to defeat it would receive three gold coins. Floor 20 housed an evil centipede, rated B-plus, spewing Paralyzing Breath across a broad range—pretty decently strong. The first five teams to beat <em>him</em> got five gold.</p>
<p>Down on Floor 30, we had an ogre lord, another B-plus, along with five of his henchmen. Unlike Benimaru and his kin, these were unintelligent creatures, violent and acting strictly on instinct. Their physical strength was astonishing, though, and they were capable of team warfare to some extent, so tackling them with a fully equipped party was a must. Beating them earned you ten gold, and again, we’d award it to the first five winning parties.</p>
<p><a id="page-34"></a>After that, things begin to get <em>serious</em>. Floor 40, as planned, housed an A-minus tempest serpent, boasting extraordinarily powerful Poisonous Breath that could instantly annihilate an unsuspecting party. Even an A-ranked adventurer on Gaiye’s level would have serious trouble defeating it solo. Taking the serpent down was worth twenty gold coins, awarded to the first three parties who managed it, but I doubted we’d be giving out that prize <em>too</em> often.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Floor 50, I was planning to have Bovix and Equix take turns serving as floor guardian. They had evolved into magic-born ranked above A, so only a small handful of fighters stood a chance. Make it past that floor, and you earned the big one-hundred-gold prize—a big step up but merited given the difficulty spike.</p>
<p>“All right. That’s actually a pretty well-thought-out plan. It oughtta make for some good advertising, too. Do you think it’ll help encourage the nobles to compete with one another?”</p>
<p>“Precisely, my lord. Announcing the prize winners each month will encourage competition. And challengers can only win a prize once; they can’t be awarded the same prize multiple times, so we can keep things from getting <em>too</em> competitive.”</p>
<p>Makes sense. If you could only get it one time, there was no motivation for people to “farm” bosses strictly for money. This ensured the same small group of people wouldn’t hog all the prizes each month—and since each award had a strict maximum, we could count them as fixed costs in our accounting.</p>
<p>“So do you think we can make a profit doing that?”</p>
<p>“That will not be a problem, no. Based on preliminary calculations from the past three days, I think we could even afford to increase the prizes a little.”</p>
<p>Compared to our earnings, it was pocket change, but the prizes would help encourage competition and speculation among challengers without hurting our bottom line. It was a brilliant strategy. Besides, nobody was going to zoom past Floor 50 anytime soon, so I figured our payouts would be on the low side for a while to come.</p>
<p>“In fact, if anything, perhaps we could have Sir Masayuki beat Floor 50 and play that up in our advertising…”</p>
<p><a id="page-35"></a>“Huh?!”</p>
<p>“With <em>your</em> mettle, I’m sure it’s only a matter of time, Sir Masayuki.”</p>
<p>Aha. That Mjöllmile, always looking for another angle. He seemed to have the plan pretty well worked out. Let’s have him keep with it.</p>
<p>“Ooh, I like that. It’ll boost Masayuki’s reputation further, even as it advertises our Dungeon for us. Let’s deploy that once things slow down a little, maybe.”</p>
<p>“That’s just what I was thinking as well. How nice to see we are of the same mind, Sir Rimuru, <em>heh-heh-heh…</em>”</p>
<p>“You’re always sharper than me at this, <em>deh-heh-heh…</em>”</p>
<p>We exchanged self-satisfied smiles.</p>
<p>“Um, if I could interject…”</p>
<p>Masayuki looked like he had something to say. I pretended not to hear.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">But Mjöllmile wasn’t done there. In fact, he was just getting to his main topic.</p>
<p>“Now, Sir Rimuru, along those lines, I’m thinking about a potentially even larger project!”</p>
<p>He flashed an evil grin, champing at the bit to reveal his news. I was starting to like that smile a lot. It was proving reliable.</p>
<p>“I’m all ears, Mollie. Go ahead.”</p>
<p>I gave him a friendly smile of my own.</p>
<p>“As I see matters, if we <em>really</em> want to impress the nobility in the local area, I think we should announce that anyone who survives the bottommost floor will earn a hundred stellar gold coins!”</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>“Oh-ho?”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“Um, how much is that in yen?”</p>
<p>Maybe about one billion? And with the cost of living as low as it is here, it might be worth even more.</p>
<p><a id="page-36"></a>“Pretty bold, huh, Mollie?”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! Such a generous reward should motivate any reluctant challengers to spring into action. They’re all bound to hire adventurers to conquer the labyrinth.”</p>
<p>And that means even more money would be changing hands. The more people gather someplace, the more prosperous it gets. If we can drive people’s interest, potential customers who weren’t interested before may hop on just so they’re not left behind.</p>
<p>“But—but that’s a lot of money!” Ramiris shouted, looking concerned. But the confident Mjöllmile wasn’t perturbed.</p>
<p>“And <em>who</em> was the master of this labyrinth again?”</p>
<p>He gave Veldora a glance as he lodged the almost-taunting question.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… Kwaahh-ha-ha-ha! It is I, Veldora the Storm Dragon, the very precipice of the draconic races!!”</p>
<p>Veldora made no attempt to hide his opinion of himself.</p>
<p>“Huh?! Veldora the Storm Dragon? That name sounds familiar…”</p>
<p>Masayuki looked a bit pensive about something as Mjöllmile villainously nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m fully aware of that, Sir Veldora. And I’m also fully aware that not a single soul is capable of felling you in battle.”</p>
<p>“Of course not. Mjöllmile, you are truly an intelligent man! Kwah-ha-ha-ha!”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… No, no. I’m simply leveraging what I’ve learned observing Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>What? Me?</p>
<p>As Veldora and Mjöllmile shared an echoing laugh, I thought over his proposal. We were offering a hundred stellars, a ridiculous amount—but that required conquering the final floor. In other words, beating Veldora. Nope. Not gonna happen. It seemed almost like a swindle to me, but it wasn’t a lie, either. Besides, we still weren’t sure right now whether anyone would even make it to Floor 100.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I do think our labyrinth is well-nigh unconquerable.”</p>
<p>“Right, right.”</p>
<p>“That’s bleedingly obvious.”</p>
<p><a id="page-37"></a>“Precisely. Floor 50 is one thing, but the difficulty beyond that is simply unimaginable to me. We have literal dragons! Where will you find an adventurer who can slay a dragon?”</p>
<p>Mjöllmile looked a little floored. The concept even exasperated someone as bold and driven by greed as he. Our labyrinth was well defended, to say the least.</p>
<p>“I doubt we’d ever have to pay out those hundred stellars.”</p>
<p>“No. That’s the whole idea. This is just bait for the nobility, so I humbly believe we can be a bit lavish with the figures we throw around. I understand the paladins will be trying their luck, but I <em>do</em> look forward to seeing the results.”</p>
<p>He left it unsaid, but I’m sure he didn’t think they could reach the bottom. I agreed with him. The money figure shocked me at first, but thinking about it with a cool head, we didn’t have to worry about anyone actually claiming it.</p>
<p>“Mollie, let’s go with it. Make it happen!”</p>
<p>“Very well, my lord.”</p>
<p>“And try to get as many people coming here to take the challenge as you can.”</p>
<p>“Let’s tout it up as much as possible, then! We could call it the Demon Lord’s Challenge!”</p>
<p>Would that work as advertising?</p>
<p>…Actually, wait a second. If I was going to keep calling myself demon lord, there was a good chance that reckless, suicidal people would keep on trying to fight me. It was a pain to deal with each and every one of them—so why don’t I let them take a crack at me if they conquer Floor 100, or something…?</p>
<p>Yeah. Let’s go with that.</p>
<p>“In fact, tell everyone that if they beat the challenge, I’ll give them an opportunity to fight me. That applies to you, too, Masayuki, so if people tell you to take me on, try to change the subject or something, okay?”</p>
<p>“All right. Because honestly, I have no intention of fighting you at all. Thanks.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I know. Well, Mollie, you have my official permission. Have at it!”</p>
<p><a id="page-38"></a>“At once, my lord. I’ll just excuse myself, then.”</p>
<p>Mjöllmile is <em>so</em> dedicated to his work. Once the conversation died down, he stood up, offered each of us a quick bow, and left the room.</p>
<p class="space-break1">We could have ended the meeting there, as we all watched him go, but Masayuki looked concerned about something. Curious, I decided to inquire.</p>
<p>“What’s up? Something on your mind?”</p>
<p>“Well, about fighting…I guess people think I’m taking a wait-and-see approach, but I really <em>am</em> gonna have to do that fight sometime soon, aren’t I…?”</p>
<p>Fight…? Ah, the promise he made during the tournament?</p>
<p>“You mean against Bovix?”</p>
<p>“Yeah… After what I said in front of that huge crowd, I can’t really escape it. But if I fight him, I’m absolutely gonna lose…”</p>
<p>I’m sure he would. Masayuki’s unique skill was about as unique as they came, but it wouldn’t be much help in actual combat. Although maybe it would be, come to think of it. It let him win without fighting, after all.</p>
<p>But we <em>would</em> need to consider that Bovix battle. The crowd truly believed Masayuki could win, and so did Mjöllmile for that matter. Masayuki wasn’t shy about playing himself up in the arena, either. It was too late to say never mind.</p>
<p>“Maybe you could train with our kids while Hinata is here?”</p>
<p>“That sort of thing would kill me! All I want is to live in peace, you know?”</p>
<p>He smiled briskly as he stated that rather sad fact. I thought at one point that he needed someone to teach him a lesson, but as a kid who came from Japan at the most peaceful point in its history, of <em>course</em> he wasn’t gonna be this belligerent wild man. I’m not unlike him, if you think about it.</p>
<p>“Well, I can’t have you lose either way, so let me think about that a little.”</p>
<p>“Will you? Thanks, Rimuru!”</p>
<p>“Sure. Just give <em>me</em> a hand when I need it, okay?”</p>
<p><a id="page-39"></a>“Of course!”</p>
<p>Masayuki was being cooperative, and his reputation was helping me out a lot right now. If Bovix beat him, I stood to lose a great deal. It was a thorny problem, but we’d have to do something about it. I could try to reason with Bovix, but that didn’t seem fair to me. <em>I’ll work on it.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">We chatted for a little while longer before I wrapped up this emergency meeting. The adjustments to the labyrinth were completed before the end of the day.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">So we excitedly continued our watch over the Dungeon.</p>
<p>Personally, thanks to the things Masayuki pointed out, I felt like the labyrinth had gotten a lot easier. But considering Mjöllmile’s warnings, I didn’t think it had gotten <em>too</em> easy or anything. How would people react?</p>
<p class="space-break1">First off, of course, there were always idiots who didn’t bother listening to the instructions. They just breezed right along, ignoring the missions completely. They didn’t get far into the ensuing floors, of course, but they just kept on trying, nonetheless. What drove them to do that? Their employers? Their pride? No, the answer was nothing so noble. They had a more calculating reason than that.</p>
<p>When we debuted the labyrinth, the Rare-level sword that Basson’s party grabbed from a treasure chest was apparently a truly excellent piece in their mind. I guess they saw it in a much different way from me.</p>
<p>Rare, in this world, referred to superior magisteel-forged gear that had evolved to exhibit unique capabilities. The magisteel our nation produced was made by taking the magic ore from our high orcs in the mountains and exposing Veldora’s magicules to it. Simply storing it inside the labyrinth made the process happen by itself. This gave us an easy supply of high-quality steel, and we could liberally use it in our own weapons and armor.</p>
<p>Unlike the gear circulating around the Western Nations, we could <a id="page-40"></a>craft items made out of nothing but pure magisteel. The difference came down to the materials themselves, so even the swords distributed to our regular forces could be classified as Special in make, several times better than the equipment most labyrinth challengers ran around in. Kurobe’s workshop apprentices handled equipment production for our army, a good dozen of them or so by this point, hammering away daily under Kurobe’s careful instruction—and even their gear was equivalent to Special, a level above the Normal stuff sold across the Western Nations.</p>
<p>Now their goods were being placed into our treasure chests. The production failures were disposed of, and things deemed worthy of actual use were brought into the labyrinth. We had a wide range of quality in this gear, and some of it really was excellent. Basson had gotten his hands on something that only barely qualified as Rare. You usually had a hundred-to-one chance at one of those, and as odds went, maybe it was an enticing offer for a lot of people.</p>
<p class="space-break1">By the way, even items from Kurobe’s workshop dismissed as failures could be appraised at the Rare level. They may look like quality pieces on the surface, but if Kurobe called it a failure, it was a failure. “There’s a clear difference,” he’d tell me.</p>
<p>So I looked into this a bit more, and it led to a discovery. Even with gear in the same class, there can be individual differences in capabilities—something Kurobe had picked up on and used to craft his definitions of success and failure.</p>
<p>I decided to compare two Rare-level swords, one from Kurobe and one from an apprentice. The difference was obvious, something I noticed only because my Analyze and Assess skills had improved. If Kurobe hadn’t pointed it out, I’m not sure I would’ve picked up on it.</p>
<p>Different how? Let me give an example. Let’s say I made a copy of one of Kurobe’s works. The results, of course, would be in the same class—but like I said before, I can’t completely copy all its capabilities. They may look the same, but what I produce is still an inferior copy. That’s the difference.</p>
<p><a id="page-41"></a>Maybe this happens because I don’t have the blacksmithing skills of Kurobe. But what I can say here is that even weapons come in different levels. Maybe a weapon seller would never notice, to say nothing of an amateur, but I feel like I can tell the difference between these levels now.</p>
<p class="space-break1">To someone who stakes their life on these weapons, differences in capability are important.</p>
<p>In this world, you never knew when monsters might attack you. High-quality weapons and armor were a kind of lifeline. Kurobe’s presentation during the Founder’s Festival must’ve generated a lot of buzz, enough to create a deluge of requests for the goods we’d exhibited. We were still considering how to handle that, but the plan was to make a decision after investigating the market more.</p>
<p>The Rare equipment dropped by the boss on Floor 10 was the best that Kurobe’s apprentices could produce right now. They were inferior to Kurobe’s own work but still on the upper end of what’s generally available worldwide. Adventurers naturally want quality, of course, and I could see why Basson was so delighted. Even Normal weapons, after all, could fetch over ten times the usual price if they were good quality. Once you got into the Special realm, that was more like fifty times. Rare? Obtaining one was a matter of luck more than anything. There weren’t many around to find, and realistically speaking, money can’t buy them.</p>
<p>So it made sense that people were clamoring to enter the labyrinth. And Basson and his gang were even advertising for me at the taverns—“Heh-heh! Look at this, all of you! A sword just as wonderfully powerful as I am!” and so on. The fact that the Floor 10 boss dropped Rare gear spread like wildfire among the challengers, then the merchants, and then around the Free Guilds of every nation. In an instant, people hoping to strike it rich were beating a path to our labyrinth—and that’s what led to where we are now.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I do have to thank Basson’s band for all the free advertising, but you can’t just run in and grab Rare equipment like it’s a trip to the convenience store.</p>
<p><a id="page-42"></a>Thus, the people who refused to take our guidance began to lag behind those who completed our missions before tackling the labyrinth. If you had a little intelligence, you’d know it pays to listen to our instructions, after all—and as more people seriously took up the missions, training on the first floor began in earnest. Now we had challengers taking what they’d learned and fully preparing with it, helping our own budget with the equipment they purchased near the front desk.</p>
<p>Then, a few days after we rebalanced the Dungeon, we began to see parties reach the fifth floor. Floor 2 was vast but simple, and the traps up to Floor 4 were more like jump scares than anything really malicious. So long as you kept an accurate map, making it to Floor 5 was actually pretty easy. This seemed acceptable to me.</p>
<p>Floor 5 downward was more of a test of ability. The traps got more hazardous, and monsters ranked D and above made their debut—but the treasure chests also held more valuable items. I wanted our customers to really pound those floors, doing their best to conquer them…but alas, it really was a challenge for most.</p>
<p>To put it simply, fatigue began to be an issue. Keeping a constant watch for monsters is an easy way to mentally exhaust yourself, I suppose. Many people retreated back to the last stairway to take advantage of our rest space; the inn on Floor 95 was doing fabulous business, so that much worked out as planned.</p>
<p>Around when our challengers began to strike a presence between Floors 5 and 8, we started to see adventurers arrive from the world’s Free Guilds, following the rumors. Some of them were seasoned adventurers bearing contracts from noble sponsors, and before long, the whole town was getting busier. With this second wave livening up the old guard, the race to conquer the floors grew frenetic—and with these serious contenders, we also began to see people try to cheat their way to glory.</p>
<p>Yes, people decided to sell maps of the labyrinth in broad daylight. A lot of people (myself included) had no sense of direction, and in a labyrinth, all the strength in the world couldn’t help if you kept getting lost. So I could understand the demand…but I really <a id="page-43"></a>wished people would have formed parties and assigned mapmaking duties to members instead.</p>
<p>So following an announcement posted in and out of the labyrinth, we began to change its inner structure. The challengers were livid, of course, and we got lots of complaints—but I’m a demon lord. I’m not beholden to them. I needed to show them early on that maps were meaningless unless you made your own. If anything, I was being kind to them—if they <em>didn’t</em> make their own, they’d find it impossible to adapt if a change to the labyrinth rendered their maps useless. Call it tough love.</p>
<p>As a rule, we changed the labyrinth layouts once every two or three days. Completing a single floor took at least a few hours; there’s no way you’d reach the save point on Floor 10 in one go. Thanks to that, the layout changes were a pretty big success. The challengers gave up on selling and buying maps, instead taking a more serious approach to the labyrinth. It seemed like some people plunged in right after a layout change to whip up a map to sell anyway, but I decided to let that slide.</p>
<p class="space-break1">We were pretty happy about the anti-cheating measures. But we sure couldn’t let our guard down. The Free Guild adventurers may’ve gotten a late start at the labyrinth, but some of them wielded Automap, the elemental magic spell that gave them a skillful advantage in exploration.</p>
<p>Free Guild members really <em>were</em> in a class of their own. They were used to fighting monsters, so they were battle-honed and ready for combat. They also knew how to divide tasks among their party members, which I appreciated. Basson’s party was all about fighting, but now we saw groups with each member picked to carry out a particular role—fighters to handle the monsters, explorers to handle traps and mazes, and gatherers with a wealth of knowledge to tap. Balance was the watchword with these parties, and it really struck me how adaptable they all were.</p>
<p>So the adventurers quickly completed the training missions and dived into the Dungeon. Those with ruin-exploration experience <a id="page-44"></a>were masters at trap removal. They didn’t sprint for every treasure chest they saw. Compared to the bodyguards and mercenaries we saw first, they were quite careful—demonstrating an even more professional performance than I imagined. Seeing them execute such a clear understanding of the rules, I started to think we shouldn’t have reined in the Dungeon after all.</p>
<p>So just a few days after the second wave arrived, someone managed to beat Floor 10. Now the challengers were really on a roll—learning from their predecessors’ mistakes, painstakingly devising countermeasures, and starting to make real, constant headway. And once someone figured out how to handle this trick or that monster, word spread fast about it. People started to imitate the winning formula. I bet people were selling their advice, too. No stopping them, I suppose. If maps were a nonstarter, I suppose information comes next. I really had to hand it to them—and really, the more enthusiastic everyone was, the better.</p>
<p>And the town was starting to see the challengers’ progress as a kind of spectator sport to enjoy over drinks. The shops, the inns, the taverns—rumors spread everywhere, packed with tales that delighted and thrilled.</p>
<p>Among them came word about one party appearing out of nowhere to blaze down the labyrinth at a previously unheard-of speed, a stout and well-balanced group of ten. The first thing they did was add themselves to the save point on Floor 10. One of them joined a party who had already made it that far down; he then put his info in the save point, used a return whistle to go back to the entrance, and then headed down with his own party.</p>
<p>I was anticipating this and had no issue with it, but the speed they proceeded at astounded me. In just three days or so, they had defeated the boss monster on Floor 20. They had talent, no doubt—each one ranked around a B individually, but maybe B-plus as a group. All ten of them showed great teamwork, too, so in terms of real strength, I bet they could earn an A-minus.</p>
<p>But if they’re going <em>this</em> fast, there had to be some kind of trick behind it. I mean, they kept on selecting the shortest routes through each floor, every time…</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><a id="page-45"></a><em>Understood. Elemental interference detected. An elementalist is utilizing Elemental Communication.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Oh, that…?</p>
<p>An elementalist is a magician capable of harnessing the power of elemental spirits. One of the tricks up their sleeve is Elemental Communication, allowing them to listen to the words of those elemental spirits. If they can talk to wind and earth elementals on a deep enough level, it seems, those spirits will guide them down the correct path to the stairs—and since an elementalist could tap that, a twisty maze of passages was no sweat to them.</p>
<p>Those dirty, dirty elementalists! But sadly, this was fully within the rules. After all, there’s no guarantee the spirit you tap into will always give you the correct path. Besides, there were precious few elementalists in the world, so I didn’t even consider that kind of workaround. As far as I was concerned, this was a perfectly valid approach, one I shouldn’t bother trying to counteract. If anything, I should praise them for coming up with it.</p>
<p>The party’s rapid advance continued anon. Part of our procedure was that whenever a party conquered a new floor, it was announced across town; thanks to that, the party members quickly became household names. The crack team of explorers were collectively called Green Fury, their mystery elementalist serving as leader, and before long, they were rapidly approaching Masayuki’s Team Lightspeed in popularity.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Just as we hoped, the labyrinth was now hosting serious talent. No doubt we’d see more young challengers visit town with dreams of fortune and glory. The labyrinth—currently enjoying a steadily growing audience of challengers—had become a well-oiled machine.</p>

<p class="tx1">We took this opportunity to gather again. It had been ten days since we reorganized the labyrinth, so I wanted us to confer and talk <a id="page-46"></a>about any problems that had come up. Unlike before, everything was going great, so the mood was lighthearted—natural smiles all around.</p>
<p>“Ah yes, Masayuki, was it? I always thought you had potential, but now I see you are a mighty man indeed!” Veldora seemed very chipper today, and the moment we were all together, he was heaping Masayuki with praise.</p>
<p>“Oh, you think so? Um, thanks…” Masayuki didn’t seem sure how to respond.</p>
<p>He looked at me, as if to ask “who <em>is</em> this guy?” I did introduce them to each other last time, but Masayuki <em>was</em> kind of nervous back then. I could see it if he didn’t remember him.</p>
<p>“I think I introduced you before, but—”</p>
<p>“N-no, um, people just started talking and stuff, so…”</p>
<p>Oh, did we?</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Understood. As the subject Masayuki Honjo stated, no introductions were made.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Oh. Guess <em>my</em> memory was pretty hazy, too. <em>Can’t blame Masayuki then</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>“Ah well, let me do that now. This is Veldora, a good friend of mine. He’s serving as the master of the labyrinth’s hundredth floor.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, ’tis I, Veldora, and I gladly accept you as one of us, Masayuki. Welcome!”</p>
<p>To Veldora, Masayuki was part of the club already. He flashed him a friendly smile. Then Masayuki’s face visibly whitened.</p>
<p>“Ummm… By Veldora, do you mean the Catastrophe that killed the entire army of Farmus…?”</p>
<p><em>Oh, right, that</em> was <em>the rumor we spread around. I don’t mind telling Masayuki the truth, but it’s kind of a long story and there’s no pressing reason to. Let’s just go with this.</em></p>
<p>“Yeahhh, he’s kind of a big shot, so try not to rile him, okay?”</p>
<p>“Kwah-ha-ha-ha! Oh, but I am a generous soul indeed, so it takes a great deal to anger me! And if you provide me with sweet treats to eat, I would not hesitate to offer you my protection!”</p>
<p><a id="page-47"></a>There he goes again. I rolled up my notepapers and swatted him with them. Punishment complete. Discipline, you know; it’s important.</p>
<p>It must have surprised our local dragon, because he shouted “What are you doing?!” and so on for a bit, but I still had Ramiris to introduce.</p>
<p>“And this is Ramiris, a fairy and someone you could call the ruler of the labyrinth.”</p>
<p>Masayuki had been muttering things like “So I wasn’t imagining it…” In the midst of this, but my voice helped him regain his composure. His eyes turned to Ramiris, flapping in the air.</p>
<p>“Oh… You’re a fairy, Ramiris? And you built that entire amazing labyrinth? That’s really great.”</p>
<p>The compliments were more than enough to get Ramiris going as well. “Whoa! Hey, I <em>like</em> you! In fact, I’ll gladly name you my underling. And Rimuru! Did you hear that? He said that I’m really great!!”</p>
<p>She was kicking the air in my direction, visibly excited as she bragged. God, lay off. If I played along, she’d only get worse. Ignoring the dropkicks she applied to me, I tried to move things forward.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, congrats,” I replied. “If Masayuki wants to be your underling, have at it, I guess.”</p>
<p>A Hero serving as a henchman for a demon lord. Whatever. But this must be hopelessly confusing Masayuki, right?</p>
<p>“Uh… Who <em>is</em> Ramiris, exactly?”</p>
<p>“She may not look it,” I said, matching Masayuki’s quiet whisper, “but she’s a demon lord just like me.”</p>
<p>“Wha?!” he exclaimed, frozen as the beaming Ramiris approached him. Our voices were hushed, but not enough for her sharp ears, I guess.</p>
<p>“Heyaaa! That’s me, Ramiris of the Octagram! Good to become officially acquainted, Masayuki!!”</p>
<p>“H-huh? Ramiris… You’re a demon lord? And Veldora’s a dragon… W-wow. <em>Really?</em>”</p>
<p>Masayuki…</p>
<p>The thought of dealing with a demon lord and Storm Dragon all <a id="page-49"></a>this time dazed him. I guess I should have explained things fully before making the introduction. That’s on me…but Masayuki <em>had</em> to take some of the blame here. <em>He’s</em> the one who acted all cool and collected at our last meeting. That’s why I assumed he knew them already. It was his nerves of steel that allowed him to keep his composure. I didn’t realize he was clueless this whole time…</p>
