<p>“Forget it already. You can’t beat me.”</p>
<p>Yuuki took her attack unguarded. The black waves dissipated like clouds around him. And at the next moment:</p>
<p><em>“Grrhh!”</em></p>
<p>The edge of Yuuki’s hand shot straight into her heart—and that wasn’t even the worst of it. Her force flowed out of her body as Yuuki’s own absorbed it all.</p>
<p>“Nghh…ah… My power… You’re…”</p>
<p>“You got that right.”</p>
<p>“No… You—you can’t…do that…”</p>
<p>The light faded from Maribel’s eyes, the power draining from the arms clutching at Yuuki.</p>
<p>“If you were born into this world even ten years earlier, you might have taken the whole thing over. You just weren’t lucky this time. Your body was too young to fully control your skills, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Maribel didn’t respond. She glared at Yuuki, frustration clouding her face…and then her soul flickered once, twice, before fading away. The one golden rule of this world had been upheld once more—the powerless always lose.</p>
<p>“You said it yourself, didn’t you? You said I had too much ambition. Well, good night, Maribel. I’ll take on that desire of yours…”</p>
<p>His words no longer reached her—and thus, Maribel, who lived in an era of near-constant upheaval, breathed her last.</p>

<p class="tx1">Leaving everyone else to Shion and my friends, I rushed over to help Milim.</p>
<p>Right this minute, I was looking down on the Chaos Dragon. It was huge. <em>Super</em>-huge. A good three hundred feet or so in length, maybe. It made Charybdis look like a shrimp, and just beholding it drove the viewer to despair. The Chaos Dragon was now <a id="page-342"></a>consuming the magicules around itself, growing bigger and bigger. I could see it razing entire mountains with a single spout of breath. It was violence personified.</p>
<p>Even I had no chance against a monster like this. But Milim was different. Thanks to her super-dreadnought-level magicule stores, she had stopped the Chaos Dragon’s advance.</p>
<p>“Sorry I’m late, Milim!”</p>
<p>“Rimuru? It’s about time! I’ve got a little problem here. This guy’s actually my friend. I wanted to seal it away, but it’s just not working. I think it’s gonna cause some damage soon…but I can’t bump off my own friend!” She looked ready to cry.</p>
<p>Unlike Charybdis, the Chaos Dragon was bosom buddies with Milim. She must’ve wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt…but it was so huge that not even Milim had enough force to banish it away. Simply beating it would be doable enough, but she couldn’t kill a friend like that.</p>
<p>I could understand that. It reflected well on Milim, in my eyes. So I smiled, trying to reassure her.</p>
<p>“It’s all right now. I’ve got an idea!”</p>
<p>Milim’s eyes sparkled as she watched me. I could tell she trusted me, but <em>man</em>, talk about pressure. I couldn’t let it get to my head, though. Trying to look as confident as possible, I explained my strategy. “Listen. No matter how big this guy is, there has to be a core in it. You can attack him accurately enough to leave that intact, right?”</p>
<p>I figured Milim could preserve the Chaos Dragon’s soul while striking the rest of it—much as I did with Charybdis to save Phobio, its vessel. This soul would be protected by the dragon’s astral and spiritual bodies, but those bodies were already corrupted and breaking apart—or actually, they were broken to start with, hence this hate-driven corruption. It was also smeared head to toe with Maribel’s desire, and I couldn’t extract it out of the guy.</p>
<p>But its soul, though—the “heart” of Milim’s best friend—still seemed to be working hard to me, shining as strong as always.</p>
<p>“B-but… If it’s this big, it’ll take a lot power to stab into it. If I mess it up, I could blow away the whole thing…”</p>
<p><a id="page-343"></a>“I taught you how to go easy, didn’t I? Your friend’s trying its very best for you right now. You have to be strong for it!”</p>
<p>I couldn’t let her make excuses. Momentum was key. If she starts thinking <em>What if I mess this up?</em> she’ll fail at something she ought to succeed in.</p>
<p>“And I’ll help you out, okay? Just follow my instructions and release all the magic force you’ve got!”</p>
<p>Yes, I told her I had a plan. I really didn’t. I was just gonna rely on power here—Milim’s power. But this wasn’t the first time for me. I already saw it happen once, and it succeeded then. This was operating on an even huger scale, but the task before us was identical.</p>
<p>“All right. I believe in you, Rimuru!”</p>
<p>“Okay! We got this!”</p>
<p>I faked as much confidence as I could. Really, it was breaking my heart, acting so bold like this. If it failed, I was deathly scared of the consequences…but I had no other bright ideas, and I was the only one who could pull this off.</p>
<p><em>You’re on, Raphael!</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Understood. Yes, my lord!</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">I might be a pro at palming responsibility off…but for this moment, at least, I needed to perform. No mistakes would be allowed. I repeatedly told myself that this would go fine.</p>
<p>“This’ll be easy, okay? It’s the same thing over again! Do it, Milim!”</p>
<p>“Right! Yeah, you’re right. Here goes, my friend. May the shining of the stars burn into your eyes! Drago Buster!!”</p>
<p>There was a flash, so bright that closing your eyes did nothing.</p>
<p>The enormous swirl of power Milim released reached the Chaos Dragon, smashing against its ominous wall of force. Power struggled against power—and as I watched it, I searched for the source of the Chaos Dragon’s strength, relying on Raphael’s calculations to control Milim’s torrential might.</p>
<p>It was heavy. Incredibly heavy. I could tell it was draining my <a id="page-344"></a>own magicule stores. But despite all the energy we poured into it, the Chaos Dragon was unscathed. This guy really <em>was</em> crazy.</p>
<p>It was about to break my heart, but if I gave up now, this would all be for nothing. All my previous experience was for this exact moment—I truly believed that as I threw everything I had at it.</p>
<p>Trying desperately to retain my peace of mind, I slowly brushed away the evil force that loomed around the Chaos Dragon’s soul. In terms of time, it was less than a second, but the pressure made it seem like forever.</p>
<p>I saw it! The Chaos Dragon’s spotless heart, blinking there amid it all. But I couldn’t let up yet. Even without the black mist of desire, even without the hateful evil, I still had the dragon’s broken, polluted spiritual force waiting for me.</p>
<p>Carefully, with pinpoint precision, I kept up my work. Then, out of nowhere, the black mist disappeared. Yuuki defeated Maribel!</p>
<p>“Yes! We can do this!” Hoping to seize victory, I set off Belzebuth. “Milim, we’re finishing this now. Can you boost your output?”</p>
<p>“You got it! Raaahhhhh—Drago-Nova!!”</p>
<p>Heeding my instructions, Milim finally got serious.</p>
<p>Feeling it all over again made me realize just how amazing she was. How could she turn the spigot any farther than that? The way she engineered incredible feats of strength like that—I could really tell she was on another level from the rest of us.</p>
<p>But watch out. Now’s no time to stare at her, all amazed.</p>
<p>“Okay, Chaos Dragon. I’m gonna stop the pain for you.”</p>
<p>Now for the final touch.</p>
<p>Timing was going to be key here. Milim’s magic had to pulverize the Chaos Dragon’s exposed spiritual body, breaking down its astral body as well. Not missing my beat for a moment, I waited until just before Milim’s power shattered its heart, then triggered Soul Consume.</p>
<p>Ignoring all rules of time and space, Belzebuth did its work. Within my perception, it was done quicker than Milim’s magic—and just as I planned it out, I had the Chaos Dragon’s shattered heart in hand.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-345"></a>Without the core governing that massive cloud of magicules, the Chaos Dragon was already starting to disintegrate. But that was a problem of its own.</p>
<p>“R-Rimuru! This is bad news! It’s gonna explode!”</p>
<p>Milim had already stopped infusing her magic at my signal. But now there was a massive energy field in the sky, twisting and warping the air inside. Force clashed against force, compressing the energy at eye-popping pressures. The reaction would come soon enough, a huge explosion that not even Milim could neutralize.</p>
<p>She gave me a panicked look. But I was calm. According to Raphael, I could apparently do something about this.</p>
<p>“It’s all right. I’ll figure it out!”</p>
<p>“You can do that?!”</p>
<p>She looked surprised. I appreciated her admiring eyes, but if I messed this up, I was gonna look like such a dumbass—ah, but now’s no time for that.</p>
<p><em>Are you sure this’ll be okay, Professor?</em></p>
<p>I couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Affirmative. It is not a problem.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Just as businesslike as ever. That seemed so reckless but kind of reassuring in a way.</p>
<p>With a smile, I looked at what used to be the Chaos Dragon. It was already just a shell at this point. No need to hold back.</p>
<p>“Gobble it up, Belzebuth!!”</p>
<p>Could it really consume such a vast blob of energy? My worries were instantly quelled by the fury of Belzebuth’s appetite, astounding me beyond imagination as it swallowed every bit up like a midnight snack.</p>
<p>“Is…? Is it over?” Milim asked.</p>
<p>“No, not yet. We gotta do something about your friend here.”</p>
<p>“Huh? You will?”</p>
<p>“Sure. I brought this along for times like these!” <em>Not really! But let’s roll with it!</em></p>
<p><a id="page-346"></a>I took out a pseudo-soul.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>No time to spell it out for the confused Milim. I focused on myself. Theoretically, this was possible. In fact, Raphael guaranteed it. I just had to believe in it.</p>
<p>Boldly, I did my work, trusting it was guaranteed to succeed. I picked up all the pieces of the shattered heart, then absorbed them into the pseudo-soul; Soul Consume patched all the pieces into a single unit for me, so it went easier than I expected.</p>
<p>The issue was what came after that. Can a core like this be housed in a pseudo-soul?</p>
<p>There was no reaction.</p>
<p>I began to sweat. Staying calm on the surface, I frantically tried to brainstorm a solution. What should I do at a time like this?</p>
<p>My brain finally settled on something I saw on TV dramas a lot.</p>
<p>“M-Milim… Did this Chaos Dragon have a name or anything?”</p>
<p>“A name? Nothing like that, no…”</p>
<p><em>No? Crap. But calm down. There has to be another way…</em></p>
<p>“…Gaia! I wanted to call it that someday. This creature’s name is Gaia!!”</p>
<p><em>Oh, it does have one.</em></p>
<p>I breathed a sigh of relief and softly called Gaia’s name.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>What a nice name that is!</em></p>
<p><em>So your name’s Gaia, huh?</em></p>
<p><em>Hey, shouldn’t you open your eyes before your friend starts crying?</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">The pseudo-soul began to softly glow. We did it. The heart was in the soul.</p>
<p>Now I wrapped the master core in Gaia’s pseudo-soul. That completed its avatar core, and now my job was done. Time would take care of the rest—and once Gaia’s heart was healed up, it would be revived in the shape of its choice. In Gaia’s case, that shape would be its actual body, not some other vessel. It’d be a new monster, coming to life right before Milim’s eyes.</p>
<p>“It worked, Milim. This is the new Gaia. It hasn’t been born yet, <a id="page-347"></a>so it’s kind of like an egg right now.” I presented the avatar core to her.</p>
<p>“Right… Right! I just <em>knew</em> leaving everything to you would work out. I trusted you, Rimuru. Thank you. Thank you!”</p>
<p>Glad to be of service. That, and I’m glad I didn’t screw that up. But more than anything, seeing Milim smile really did make me happy.</p>
<p>“Wanna head back? Everyone’s probably worried for us.”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm! I need to tell ’em all what I did!”</p>
<p><em>Sure, sure.</em></p>
<p><em>Good thing Milim came along, though. I couldn’t have done a thing against that guy alone.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">From far away, we saw the palace, along with our friends nervously watching us. They all looked okay, which was reassuring.</p>
<p>That wrapped things up, then. I just wanted to go home and relax. A nice bath, followed by a cold beer. Basking in the joy welling out from me, I joined Milim as we went back down to regroup with our friends.</p>
