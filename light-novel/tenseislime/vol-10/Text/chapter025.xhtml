<p>My voice rang quietly in the silent chamber. I wasn’t shouting at all, but it seemed to make all the representatives’ minds shiver with fear.</p>
<p>I wasn’t using Lord’s Ambition or anything like that. Against a human target, Lord’s Ambition would cause sheer panic at best, insanity and death at worst. No need to break <em>that</em> out. And I wasn’t brainwashing them at all, either—if I did, I’d be throwing all the goodwill I built with humanity out the window. I had no interest in living out my life with a legion of boring puppets who said nothing but yes to me.</p>
<p>No, this was just me being riled into destroying the desk and laying out my full opinions. But even that had a massive effect.</p>
<p>“N-no, Sir Rimuru, that was not at all the motive behind our requests…”</p>
<p>“C-certainly not! We simply provided our perhaps overly optimistic feedback out of a desire to deepen our friendly ties with you.”</p>
<p>The browbeaten councillors desperately began making excuses. The more of them I heard, the more annoyed I got.</p>
<p>First off, why was the king of a nation only a “sir”? If I was convening with other kings and leaders, I’d expect that—but being called it by someone without a country to govern was the same as saying I ran no nation at all. It was a nation addressing a colony, and it demonstrated zero respect for us. I’m sure they looked down on us as a bunch of monsters. I could put up with being looked down upon personally, but if it was my whole <em>country</em>? Forget it.</p>
<p>I <em>am</em> a demon lord and expected to be treated that way, but this was even worse than I expected. My hotel was first class, and lot of the councillors here treated me with respect, so maybe I let my guard down a little—but still, this was horrible.</p>
<p>“Oh? Then what <em>was</em> your motive? Because to me, this sounds like you want my nation and me to work day and night for you as your slaves.”</p>
<p>“No, not at all!”</p>
<p>“That was not our intention whatsoever! It was nothing like that—”</p>
<p><a id="page-218"></a>The councillors argued mightily. If these nobles were meant to represent entire nations, it just made my head hurt. Even with a heart as tolerant as mine, having to negotiate with people like this was testing me. If Yuuki had made these sly old dogs do his bidding, then he must be the slyest fox of all. I wish I could follow his example, but I don’t think I could.</p>
<p class="space-break1s1"><em>Suggestion. Would you like me to automatically handle this?</em></p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara"><em>Yes</em></p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara"><em>No</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">It sounded like Raphael was saying something, but I’m sure I imagined it. Yes, it’s a trusted, talented assistant, but it’s still just a skill. It shouldn’t be able to so freely speak its mind like that. I guess I’ve been relying on it so much, I’m starting to hear my own internal desires spoken back to me. If something like that were possible, I’d probably have Raphael give all my speeches for me, and it’d be—like—why did I suffer for so long, then?</p>
<p>I shook my head, attempting to shake the delusions from my mind, then stared back at the councillors.</p>
<p>…Crap. Now that my mind was cleared out, I just realized I had no idea how to resolve this situation. Haste makes waste—and all that. I just made things super-complicated for myself, and fixing it all up was going to be an uphill battle. The representatives were frantic for a solution, and honestly, so was I.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Report. It is not a problem. As you intended, Master, I have confirmed the effect of the spiritual interference affecting the room.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Um, <em>what</em>?</p>
<p>I wasn’t intending anything there. I wasn’t thinking at all. I was pissed off, so I reacted accordingly. And now—</p>
<p class="space-break1s1"><em>Report. With this quantity of samples, I have discovered the laws governing the spiritual interference. As with the subject Gaiye, the majority of councillors in this chamber are under the effect of spiritual interference from someone. Remove the interference?</em></p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara"><em>Yes</em></p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara"><em>No</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Well, I mean, sure…</p>
<p>I thought <em>Yes</em> in my mind without hesitation. The moment I did, the previously silent councillors began to speak up again.</p>
<p>“Well, of <em>course</em> Lord Rimuru is angry! How could we make up for this disgrace—?”</p>
<p>“Wait! These conditions weren’t even brought up in our previous special session!”</p>
<p>“Who tried to slip these past us?!”</p>
<p>Things started to change pretty quick. Raphael strikes again. No matter the issue, I can always rely on it.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh… Looks like the councillors regained their senses,” I defiantly muttered, as if this was my plan all along. I just wanted to look cool, really, but it sure elicited a response from Shuna.</p>
<p>“They certainly did! I <em>thought</em> they were acting a bit strange, but someone had taken over their spirits?”</p>
<p>Well, Raphael?</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Understood. It is a type of Spiritual Interference skill. It does not exert any influence on magicules, so confirming its presence took some time, but it is statistically impossible for so many people to possess such similar wavelengths. It was believed that canceling it would take time, but your anger wavelengths created an open seam.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Right. Exactly like I pictured it—let’s go with that.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it was that strong,” I ventured, without any evidence. “The spiritual interference gave the councillors a sort of tunnel vision, maybe?”</p>
<p>Shuna and the rest of my crew gave me looks of impressed respect.</p>
<p><a id="page-220"></a>“I see. So you placed pressure on them to shake them out of it?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, Benimaru. I considered it all clearly before doing it.”</p>
<p>Better phrase it that way, I don’t want them to start imitating my temper tantrum just now. Plus, this gave me the perfect excuse for Hinata. We’re all good…</p>
<p>…but I still had my doubts. Who carried out that spiritual interference, anyway? Probably not Yuuki, I don’t think; I doubted he’d take an approach that left so much evidence like this. If he did, he’d need some motivation to—but no point pondering over that. Now wasn’t the time to pursue the culprit.</p>
<p>Right now, I needed to solve the problems staring me in the face. The newly awoken councillors were bearing down on a subset of the Council, the group who created that list of demands. There were more than I thought, but they still looked like all was well. They must’ve had some other scheme in mind.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt something odd. A few of them were looking toward a door deeper inside the chamber. Turning my ears toward it, I could hear several sets of footsteps. Did someone call the royal guard?</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Report. No such movements were detected, so it is believed this was planned in advance.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Maybe they set this up to have me cause a scene so they could arrest me? Against a demon lord, that took a lot of guts. Maybe it really <em>was</em> that sloppy of a plan—I could picture it—but if so, the people of Englesia and its surrounding nations must have been pretty oblivious to danger. They were so far away from the threat of demon lords that they must’ve gotten soft. The same was true of their councillors; there must have been a lot of optimists around there.</p>
<p>Or maybe these were the fools “scheming something” Hinata had warned about?</p>
<p>The moment that occurred to me, the door opened, revealing a dozen or so soldiers led by a larger man.</p>

<p class="tx1">“Well, <em>someone’s</em> sure in a lively mood! So you’re the fool calling himself a demon lord? You certain you can afford to act so high and mighty if you’ve only got three people with ya?”</p>
<p>The large man immediately began shouting at me the moment he came inside. He gave a vulgar smile as he made no attempt to hide his disdain for me. This wasn’t just rude; he was trying to start a fight, and there was no way to excuse it. My friends and I gave one another dumbfounded looks.</p>
<p>Hang on. This was part of their plan. They had some kind of deep design behind this—</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Understood. It is believed that this man has nothing of the sort.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>…Oh, really? So he’s just a huge idiot?</em></p>
<p>“Um… My name is Rimuru, and yes, I call myself a demon lord. Are you confusing me with someone else?”</p>
<p><em>Juuuust</em> in case, I thought I should ask. <em>Whoops, wrong guy</em> wouldn’t cut it when the dust settled, so I tried to figure out the man’s true motives.</p>
<p>Shuna’s smile had disappeared, and Benimaru was so angry that he was now frozen in place. Soei was about ready to whip out the sword he had hidden on him, and weapons in the chamber were gonna be <em>real</em> hard to explain later. I was just as livid as them—in fact, I was so far gone, I almost wanted to laugh. That was how I remained coolheaded enough to ask the question.</p>
<p>But the results were pretty lacking.</p>
<p>“Yep. You’re the one. He said that idiot’s name was Rimuru!”</p>
<p>No mistake, then. Which meant I was safe doing him in, but…</p>
<p>“…Look. Can you quit it with that? I dunno what you want, but do you think you’ll get away with that kind of lawlessness in front of all these witnesses?”</p>
<p>This wasn’t something I could really say after bashing up that <a id="page-222"></a>desk, but that was then. Let’s use the law as a weapon to chase this freak away, because otherwise, I really <em>might</em> kill him—and if I didn’t, I feared Benimaru or someone else would lose it.</p>
<p>But the large man kept at it.</p>
<p>“Moron! This is my big chance! Once I knock you around and put <em>this</em> on you, all of you monsters will be under our command!”</p>
<p>Uh, what? Knock me around? Under his command? What’s he talking about? Maybe I really <em>was</em> a moron, because I didn’t understand him at all…</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Understood. This fool is saying that he will defeat you and make you follow his commands.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Yeah, I know! If you keep explaining things with a straight face like that, I really <em>will</em> look like an idiot.</p>
<p>And what’s that in the man’s hand? It was none other than an Orb of Domination, the very artifact I saw in use back when Milim pretended to be hypnotized. It looked real, but would that work on me?</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Understood. It is impossible to rule over my lord with the Orb of Domination.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">That’s a relief.</p>
<p><em>I don’t know where this lumbering man found it</em>, I thought, <em>but I’d better break it before it puts anyone in danger</em>.</p>
<p>I stood up from my seat. It must’ve woken the chairman from his stupor, because he started shouting in a panic.</p>
<p>“W-wait, Lord Rimuru! This is some kind of mistake. No one in the Council is sponsoring this! Please, confirm it with Lady Hinata if you wish! She’s an impartial party!”</p>
<p>He was respectful toward me, and I didn’t think he was lying. Hinata didn’t say anything about this; in fact, she warned me to stay on guard. I didn’t think it’d be <em>this</em> in-your-face stupid, but for now, I couldn’t do much except sit back and see how things went.</p>
<p><a id="page-223"></a>The chairman wasn’t my enemy. Neither was Hinata. And I had a lot of allies among the councillors as well.</p>
<p>“I know nothing about this! What is going on here?”</p>
<p>“Who sent you here?”</p>
<p>“Those soldiers’ armor bears the emblem of the Englesia royal family. Is Englesia instigating this?”</p>
<p>I could hear them shouting above the confused representative. Clearly, they couldn’t have been involved. This wasn’t something the Council hatched—it was the work of a smaller group gone clearly out of control.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Amid the chaos, one person made a coolheaded decision. That was Hinata. When the chairman stated her name, she stood up and stepped between the large man and me.</p>
<p>“Sir Reiner, what is the meaning of this?”</p>
<p>Reiner, was it? If Hinata knew him, was he famous around here?</p>
<p>“Do <em>not</em> come in here without permission! We are in the middle of a Council session. Soldiers like you are <em>not</em> allowed!”</p>
<p>Emboldened by Hinata’s actions, the chairman began yelling at the group as well. But instead of Reiner, one of the councillors answered him—Count Gaban of Englesia, I think his name was.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! Worry not, Chairman Leicester. I called them in here to discipline that lawbreaker over there.”</p>
<p>Gaban was all smiles from his seat in the second tier, close to the chairman.</p>
<p>“Sir Gaban, have you gone mad?!”</p>
<p>The chairman’s face went red as he shouted. I could see why. If a fellow councillor was involved, that kind of prevented the chairman from claiming the Council wasn’t in on this. And as long as we had an impartial observer in Hinata, this ridiculous farce could very well benefit me. I hated all this verbal abuse but decided to weather it for a bit.</p>
<p>“Sir Gaban! I was not informed of this!!”</p>
<p>This was Representative Johann Rostia, a prince, screaming now. He was among the more decent councillors, not placed under spiritual interference. I remember the disgusted look on his face when <a id="page-224"></a>things first went awry. Looks like he was siding with me here—I presumed he was on the pro-admission side.</p>
<p>“Everyone, please, calm down. I know that we all fear the demon lord Rimuru. Am I wrong? And Sir Reiner here is the strongest man in all of Englesia. He is here to defeat Rimuru, rule over him, and make this member of the Octagram into his personal pawn. And with him…comes Veldora!!”</p>
<p>Even with the other councillors telling him off, Gaban remained unaffected, using his seat to formally declare hostilities against me. Several councillors shouted their agreement.</p>
<p>If it was getting to this point, I no longer had any reason to hold back…but the situation was progressing so fast, I was getting left in the dust.</p>
<p>“I-impossible!”</p>
<p>“Unforgivable! How dare you disrespect the Council!”</p>
<p>“Indeed! Are you ignoring the will of the Council and prioritizing your own motives instead?”</p>
<p>Even more councillors stood up and began airing their grievances.</p>
<p>This was starting to look ominous. Some of the representatives didn’t look well, hanging their heads. Given Gaban’s dauntless behavior, he probably had another trick up his sleeve. And I was right.</p>
<p>“Order, please, gentlemen. What my knight Reiner says is true. And now the demon lord’s been kind enough to come visit us. How could we afford <em>not</em> to use this opportunity?!”</p>
<p>With these words, a delicate-looking man strode into the chamber. This blond-haired figure wasn’t a councillor but certainly acted like their boss. I thought I detected a murmur of surprise among the Council; I could guess he was pretty high up. But the next moment:</p>
<p>“Prince Elrick, what is going on here? I thought I advised you to refrain from any foolish behavior…” Hinata confirmed it for me.</p>
<p>Apparently, this was the honest-to-goodness prince of this nation—and not even a council could be rude around a prince. No wonder there was so much consternation in the chamber.</p>
<p><a id="page-225"></a>So was this Prince Elrick the mastermind behind all this? He had incited at least a few councillors, by the looks of it.</p>
<p>“Hinata, I am disappointed in you. You’ve grown fearful of the demon lord and abandoned your post as guardian of humankind.”</p>
<p>“…What?” came the cold, low-pitched reply.</p>
<p>Wow. He really pissed her off. Now I wasn’t sure I needed to act at all.</p>
<p>“Enough back talk, Hinata. All right? You may be the leader of the paladin forces or what have you, but there’s no possible way you could best me, the head general of the Englesia royal knight corps. You can’t even beat that wispy weakling of a demon lord—instead you lick each other’s wounds. What a laugh! I bet you wet your pants running from him, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>That vulgar smile was still on Reiner’s face as he picked a fight with Hinata. Oh, man. Even <em>I</em> could feel the blood draining from my face.</p>
<p>“You…”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! Can’t even reply, can you? I’m assuming I’ve hit the nail on the head? Well, Ms. Crusader captain… That’s a ceremonial title I presume you obtained by exercising your womanly wiles on that dirty old cardinal? Yes, I’m sure it was a sorry fight indeed between you and that demon lord. And a demon lord with no interest in killing his adversary? Don’t make me laugh!”</p>
<p><em>Oh, now</em> I’m <em>taking the heat again. I really wish he’d stop.</em></p>
<p>“But I’ll hand it to you, Hinata. You <em>are</em> attractive. If you’ll be my lady, I promise I’ll take good care of you as a concubine. You know?”</p>
<p><em>Ohhh, man. Now he’s dead.</em></p>
<p>Hinata’s expression didn’t change. She was the cool, reserved beauty she always was. But the colder she looked on the outside, the more her insides raged like bubbling magma. Her patience amazes me, it really does. I would’ve lost it hours ago.</p>
<p>“Now, now, General Reiner. Isn’t that going a little <em>too</em> low? But I’m interested in the demon lord as well. I wouldn’t want you to have him all to yourself, you know. What do you think?”</p>
<p><a id="page-226"></a>I felt an indescribable chill run down my spine. Was this Gaban guy coming <em>on</em> to me?! The thought, and this man, sickened me—and after today’s events, it’d take a <em>lot</em> to move me at all. Good thing he was far away from me, because otherwise, I might’ve clocked him just now.</p>
<p>“…Prince Elrick, as the prince of Englesia, are you willing to allow this man, Sir Reiner, to say such things?” Hinata hid the anger in her cold voice as she asked the question.</p>
<p>Elrick just smiled. “Hee-hee-hee! Hinata, if you had cooperated with me, I would have given you much more honorable treatment. If you wish to blame anyone, blame yourself for angering Reiner. And yes—I forgot to mention this, but Reiner is more powerful than an A-ranked adventurer. And he’s not alone…”</p>
<p>With that, Elrick snapped his fingers. The door immediately opened once more, revealing a man in black, another in a green robe, and a group of people in overcoats with a familiar emblem on them. Come to think of it, I knew the first guy, too. It was Gaiye, the dude who got his head cut off by Delta the dryad. And those overcoat guys were definitely Green Fury, the team our avatars waged a life-and-death battle against.</p>
<p>So was the green-robe guy part of the Sons of the Veldt? He was hooded and wearing a scarf over his face, making for a mysterious, unknown figure—but he acted all upper-class, so I figured he maybe ran the Veldt or something.</p>
<p>“Allow me to make some introductions. This is Sir Gaiye, an A-ranked adventurer and now Reiner’s aide-de-camp. And this…”</p>
<p>Elrick placed a hand on green-robe guy’s shoulder. The theatrics made it clear just how self-absorbed he was.</p>
<p>“…is the leader of the world-famous mercenary group, the Sons of the Veldt. I assembled as powerful of a team as I could, as I thought defeating a demon lord with anyone less worthy would be poor manners. Yes, you see, there are dozens of people like you running around here. Just because you have a little strength to your name, you know, doesn’t give you the right to act like a king.”</p>
<p>He certainly had confidence. And if he wanted a fight, I was happy to give it to him—</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><a id="page-227"></a><em>Report. Doing so would have a 100 percent chance of damaging your reputation.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">…Right? Even to me, a demon lord starting a fight in front of such an influential audience seemed like a poor idea. And my policy was to fight a challenger only after they conquered my labyrinth. If I started bending that rule for no good reason, I’d have to duke it out with every idiot I passed by on the street.</p>
<p>And what’s more…someone in the chamber was angrier than me. People are strange that way. If someone else gets angry first, that actually has a calming effect on you.</p>
<p>“Let me ask you, Prince Elrick. What you are doing is antagonizing not only me, but the entire Western Holy Church,” said Hinata. “Are you prepared to accept the consequences?”</p>
<p>“No need to worry. I will not cause any trouble for the Western Holy Church, nor for the Holy Empire of Lubelius. Just sit there and watch, and I will guarantee your safety.”</p>
<p>Seeing Hinata fight to keep her cool, I forgot all about how angry I was.</p>
<p>But from the chairman on down, there were councillors attempting to defy Elrick’s group. We weren’t alone in the lion’s den here; we hadn’t been rejected by the Council. These were just some idiots gone out of control. Maybe it wasn’t worth getting worked up about.</p>
<p>“That is not the issue. I have been asked by the Council to attend this session as an impartial observer. My role is to ensure its proceedings remain fair, and I am thus in no position to let your recklessness go unanswered. If this was the Council’s will, that would be a different story, but please don’t expect I will allow a single person to act out of line like this!”</p>
<p>Given their relative positions, Hinata was trying to reason with Elrick first. I doubted it’d work much. The words just weren’t reaching him.</p>
<p>“Lady Hinata is right! This nonsense will not be tolerated in the chamber!”</p>
<p><a id="page-228"></a>“Prince Elrick, I heard nothing about this! And Sir Gaban, do you expect no repercussions from this?!”</p>
<p>“Lord Rimuru himself came out here for us. This treatment is going to spark an international incident!”</p>
<p>“This is unforgivable! Is this how the Kingdom of Englesia oppresses its people?!”</p>
<p>Rage, anger, ranting—more and more councillors were putting up a fight. Now I felt like I was in a theater, watching the events unfold from my seat. My starring role might’ve been taken from me, but I didn’t care.</p>
<p>“Without fairness, can you call it a Council at all?!”</p>
<p>Now the chairman was shouting. I cheered him on in my mind. <em>Keep it up!</em></p>
<p>“Shut your mouths, old men! You can simper all you want once I’ve taken control of the demon lord!”</p>
<p>Reiner, meanwhile, was already up on his imaginary victory podium. He had already riled Hinata past the point of no return, so I doubted I needed to do anything. I figured we’d just ignore him.</p>
<p>“Prince Elrick, our agreement only covered our bodyguard services for you alone. Any hazardous behavior you engage in would void our agreement…”</p>
<p>Whoa. So the Sons of the Veldt leader wasn’t in on this? And here I had bunched them all together in my mind. Good thing I learned the facts in time.</p>
<p>“Y-yes! The demon lord Rimuru is the most dangerous figure I can personally think of! That labyrinth he created is crawling with all kinds of insane creatures! You’d have to be a madman to come up with it!”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Should I take that as a compliment?</p>
<p>Maybe all that fighting was worth it after all. The elementalist leading Green Fury was almost <em>too</em> scared of me now.</p>
<p>“Hmph. Nonsense. You cowards do nothing but get in my way.”</p>
<p>Ah, but Gaiye’s in the same boat with Reiner, eh? They seemed pretty alike—overconfident and turning a deaf ear to all outside <a id="page-229"></a>opinion. He was flashing hateful looks at me now, although I really didn’t know where the grudge came from.</p>
<p>Either way, the chamber was one step away from erupting into full-fledged combat.</p>

<p class="tx1">Elrick, taking charge in the midst of this stalemate, raised a hand.</p>
<p>“Order!! All of you, listen. Prince Elrick is speaking!!” shouted Gaban, who had come down from the mezzanine to stand next to Elrick.</p>
<p>The prince nodded his approval, took a long, careful look around, and suddenly spoke. “Councillors! Now is the time to express your will to me! Will you join us, the heroes who will slay the demon lord? Or will you side with that nefarious lord and betray humankind? I, Prince Elrick von Englesia, know in my heart that the representatives before me will make the correct choice!!” He gloated like a stage actor.</p>
<p>“What,” I reflexively replied, “we’re gonna vote on it now?”</p>
<p>The prince nodded back at me, like this was common sense. After that wacky entrance he made, he still wanted to try upholding his honor? Besides, if we held a vote right now, there’s no way he’d win a majority of—</p>
<p>“Heh-heh! Why not? We must decide this democratically, by vote. Of course, I’m sure we hardly need to. The Council, you see, is firmly on my side.”</p>
<p>That piqued my interest. He was supremely confident, as if he already knew the results…which, if you thought about it, was ridiculous. Not even a prince could get away with this outrageous behavior in an international council like this.</p>
<p>So why was he doing it?</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Understood. He has likely bribed many of the councillors.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Ah, I knew it. But I didn’t think he’d buy off representatives from foreign nations as well. It’d be an international scandal if it <a id="page-230"></a>got out, so I discounted any possibility of that. Served me right for making the wrong assumption.</p>
<p>“Now, let us decide—fairly and honestly! We are about to defeat and take rule over the demon lord. All in agreement, stand up!!”</p>
<p>As the prince’s voice rang up to the rafters, several councillors rose to their feet with vile smirks. The collusion was obvious.</p>
<p><em>Well, I suppose it’s come to this. Even if today’s turned out disappointing, I’ve got all the time in the world. If we’ve been rejected, then it’s our duty to accept those results.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Report. There are no problems. This is within expectations.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Um…it is?</p>
<p>I was struck by the vision of Raphael letting a dark grin materialize on its visage. Come to think of it, Soei had done a lot of investigating, hadn’t he? People’s opinions of our nation; the financial states of all the countries; how the royalty and nobility approached them… He had even pored through the legislative proceedings of each member nation.</p>
<p>Raphael had examined all of it in intricate detail, and inside my Stomach, it had quickly created a set of documents for me. I took them out. It was a set of ledgers.</p>
<p>…Ooh! Secret ledgers! Were these <em>really</em> within your expectations, Raphael?</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe this guy had actually found dirt on all the paid-off councillors. If I revealed these detailed lists of bribes given and received, I could take down everyone involved in one fell swoop. And now that I had incontrovertible evidence, this really <em>was</em> nothing more than a farce.</p>
<p>That’s Raphael for you. No stone left unturned. It was honestly scary.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Report. My lord will be victorious without needing to reveal that evidence.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Hmm?</p>
<p>Before I could figure out what it meant, the vote was over. Several <a id="page-231"></a>councillors stood up and started clapping. Seeing this, Elrick’s voice boomed out again.</p>
<p>“We have our results. And the Council’s majority agrees. The resolution has passed!”</p>
<p>Gaban and Reiner had similarly sinister smiles as Elrick gloated to the audience. They were ready to capture us at any moment…but not so fast.</p>
<p>Fewer than a third of the Council’s members were actually on their feet. The majority were still sitting down. That fool Elrick was so sure of his plan that he declared victory without even looking at the seats.</p>
<p>Now the councillors clapping for Elrick realized they were the minority. They nervously looked around, faces growing pale. The results were clear. The majority was against slaying the demon lord—in other words, me.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I had more ledgers on me than the number of people standing up. They made up more than half the Council, in fact, but I guess a lot of them had a sudden change of heart.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Understood. It is believed that, after removing the spiritual interference earlier, they have regained their consciences.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">I see, I see. They regained their wits and realized how foolishly they were acting. Excellent. It meant the people seated right now had weighed the issue fairly and decided to side with me. The bribes were apparently good enough for some of them, but—</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Understood. It is believed that the spiritual interference stimulates the desires of its targets. It appears to exact a powerful coercive force on them.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Huh. I kinda sympathize with them, then.</p>
<p>Between that and Masayuki’s Chosen One, mind-altering skills are a menace indeed. Masayuki had no control over it, but it looked like <em>this</em> skill user could target individual people. I didn’t know who it was, but it was definitely someone to watch out for.</p>
<p><a id="page-232"></a>That blond dude, maybe…?</p>
<p>Well, at least the freed councillors saw the light in time. They all seemed friendly enough to me, so maybe I could keep quiet about the bribes. Really, though, if the fate of nations can ride on the choices of just a few councillors, I think there might be some issues with the whole Council system.</p>
<p>If organizations like the League of Nations or the United Nations can’t keep themselves pure like that, it’s only a matter of time before they go rotten. Corrupt representatives ruin the reputation of the nation they represent. If you’re going to leave nations’ destinies to individual personalities and dignities, then I wish they picked the councillors here a <em>lot</em> more carefully.</p>
<p>But then, that’s nothing for me to worry about. My concern right now was with the people who stood up. Anyone who kept their head down and engaged in injustice like this needed to pay for their crimes. Before that, I thought, we should open the eyes of the fools who still hadn’t caught up with events.</p>
<p>“Hey. Take a breath and look closer at the room.”</p>
<p>I kept myself composed as I spoke to Elrick.</p>
<p>“Hah! What are you—?”</p>
<p>He hadn’t noticed the vote yet. It’s amazing how much you could embarrass yourself when you were <em>this</em> stupid.</p>
<p>“What are you, a clown?”</p>
<p><em>“What?!”</em></p>
<p>“No, pardon me, Prince Elrick. It was just so comical, you see.” Even Hinata, coldly viewing this farce, chose this moment to join with me. She may have seemed frigid, but right now, she was bursting to fight.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to lose out to her, but Hinata’s lips were simply moving too fast.</p>
<p>“The majority of the chamber voted against your opinion. As the observer, I hereby declare that this vote was carried out in a fair, legal fashion. Of course, I’m sure the Council will hold an inquiry later to determine whether you had any right to call for a vote in the first place.”</p>
<p><a id="page-233"></a>“…Hah! I refuse to stand for this nonsense! Have you all forsaken me?!”</p>
<p><em>Pfft!</em> I love it. His anticipated results failing to happen, Elrick was now carrying on like a child. Considering how much of a narcissist he was, seeing him break down like this was the height of comedy. Hinata was all smiles, and so was I. I could just feel all the frustration from before dissolve away.</p>
<p>“…Y-yes. Yes, Prince Elrick is right! Do you understand what this means, everyone? If you pull an act like this, we will rescind our nation’s support to—”</p>
<p>“Wait. What does <em>that</em> mean, Sir Gaban? Would you mind explaining it to us?”</p>
<p>The exhausted-looking chairman cut Gaban off right as he was shouting, spittle sticking to the edges of his lips. Something about that statement must’ve caught his attention. “Our nation’s support,” perhaps?</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Understood. It is excerpted in the previous documents.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">I looked back at them. Ah yes. Now I see the transactions in detail.</p>
<p>“Anti-flooding construction in the Kingdom of Raibach. Food support for the drought in Carnada. They’ve made many other promises of support to an assortment of nations. And <em>this</em> is how they were meant to pay you back, huh? But if you’re going to cut off that support after they stopped taking your orders, it’s all but admitting to the malignant bribery you’ve been engaging in.”</p>
<p>“Wha…?!”</p>
<p>“Why do you know about our internal affairs?!”</p>
<p>Elrick was silenced. Gaban was unable to hide his shock. I remained calm and lorded over them with a light smile. That was all I needed to bluff my opponents. I didn’t really know what was going on, either, but if that’s what Raphael said, I was sure there was no doubting it.</p>
<p>Now Elrick’s allies were beside themselves with panic. The <a id="page-234"></a>chairman, sensing my gist, was staring at them like a man possessed. The Council had just taken another turn—now things were tilting our way for good.</p>
<p>I saw one of the councillors try to sit down when no one was looking. None of <em>that</em>, thanks. Soei’s Sticky Steel Thread had already kept them standing in place.</p>
<p>“Ah, I knew it,” said the Sons of the Veldt leader in an indistinct, genderless voice. “We’re not in the business of guarding someone looking to prod the hornet’s nest.”</p>
<p>I guess their business transaction with Elrick was over. Victory was ours. By now, our objectives were as good as accomplished…but there were still some fools here who refused to accept defeat.</p>

<p class="tx1">“Enough of this utter garbage! Prince Elrick, now is no time to give up. Once I defeat the demon lord, our problems are solved!”</p>
<p>“Ah—ah, Reiner!!”</p>
<p>“Y-yes, General Reiner. We still have you, the greatest weapon in our arsenal. What a sight for sore eyes!”</p>
<p>They didn’t know when to quit, I guess. Now they were casting the entire Council aside to fulfill their aims. I doubted it would work, but then, I didn’t know much about an idiot’s thought processes.</p>
<p>“Are you trying to defeat me?”</p>
<p>“Of course, you fool! Or have you gotten cold feet now? Crawl up here and lick my boots, and I’ll think about keeping this painless for you!”</p>
<p>Reiner’s vulgar smile was back. He was flashing the Orb of Domination around, so I suppose he was still intent on stuffing that into me somehow. Gaiye, behind him, gave out some sort of order to his soldiers. They promptly moved to block the door. I suppose they wanted to keep everyone in here, to keep word of their blunders from getting out. The Sons of the Veldt had already taken a step back, but there were still a few upper-level adventurers on Elrick’s side, weapons out and pointed at us.</p>
<p><a id="page-235"></a>“W-weapons in the chamber! Of all the foolish things…!!”</p>
<p>The chairman was screaming his head off, but the soldiers were keeping anyone from leaving the mezzanine. I stopped hearing him after a while, so I guess he got captured along with the other councillors.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>If it’s come to this…</em></p>
<p>…I thought, but Hinata moved first.</p>
<p>“As observer, I refuse to accept this reckless behavior. Also…”</p>
<p>Hinata smiled at Reiner, reminding him of all the insults he lobbed at her. She wasn’t armed, since weapons weren’t allowed in the chamber, but if she was, I’m sure she would’ve had her hand on the hilt of her sword by now. They’re <em>so</em> dead.</p>
<p>“…Rimuru, I’ll take care of this.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… Oh, this is rich. I am the strongest man in Englesia, and I say it’s time to expose you. Some Saint <em>you</em> are! You might’ve gotten carried away, being touted as the guardian of humankind and all, but that ends today. It’s time to give you a dose of reality!”</p>
<p>Never once reflecting on her actual skills, Reiner gave Hinata all the bombast he could muster.</p>
<p>And you know what? He <em>wasn’t</em> weak. An over-A in rank, even. He could probably wage a pretty even battle with a magic-born like Gelmud. But he wouldn’t know, would he? In a land as peaceful as Englesia, he was an outstanding talent and font of strength, but he hadn’t put in hours on the battlefield fighting monsters. That’s why he was so oblivious to the threat they posed. Gaiye was the same.</p>
<p>“Heh… Would you allow me to engage the demon lord, then?”</p>
<p>“Of course! But don’t kill him, Gaiye. Make sure you control the force of that holy sword I gave you.”</p>
<p>“No need to remind me. With this piece of equipment, I’ll never face failure again!”</p>
<p>Gaiye wanted to go against me. Whatever fancy weapon he got put him in high spirits, but it wasn’t anything <em>that</em> extraordinary—kind of toeing the line between Rare and Unique. Plus, if he’s relying on equipment and skills instead of actual talent, it’s unlikely he had <a id="page-236"></a>much of the latter to work with. Gaiye’s another over-A fighter, but to me right now, he wasn’t even a threat.</p>
<p>Faced with a foe like this, the honest thought in my mind was <em>Man, I really don’t wanna have to deal with this.</em> But apparently, I wouldn’t need to.</p>
<p>“All this time, I’ve put up with your humiliation…but you have been far too rude to Sir Rimuru, the man I respect and admire.” Shuna stepped in front of me, her attitude suggesting she’d take no prisoners. Quietly, she walked up to Gaiye. Wow. She might be <em>way</em> angrier than me.</p>
<p>Looking around, I spotted Benimaru, frozen in place and not moving an inch. He was caught flat-footed, and when our eyes met, he gave me an awkward look. <em>Yeah, I get it.</em> We were of the same mind, and one glance was all it took to confirm that.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh… Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! How long will you continue to put me down?! Aren’t you ashamed at all, Demon Lord Rimuru, hiding in the shadow of this poor little girl?”</p>
<p>Shuna was right in front of Gaiye as he continued to scoff at me. What did he expect from me? If Shuna was ready to kick ass, I didn’t want to steal her thunder. And if Benimaru was reluctantly giving her the stage, I had to follow suit.</p>
<p>“Silence. There is no need for Sir Rimuru or my brother to bother themselves with you. I am more than enough.”</p>
<p>“Hmph! If you say so. But you better not regret this, all right? Man or woman, I go easy on no one!”</p>
<p>With that, he took out his sword. It <em>was</em> a holy one—pretty cool-looking, I thought. But Shuna’s smile only widened. Her Parser skill must’ve already stripped Gaiye’s abilities bare for her, and if it did, I had nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>If something went awry, Soei was already poised to step in, so I decided to cheer her on instead.</p>
<p>And so, as the leaders of the Council and I looked on, the battle between our two groups began.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I might’ve tried to make that sound epoch-making, but the fight was over in an instant.</p>
