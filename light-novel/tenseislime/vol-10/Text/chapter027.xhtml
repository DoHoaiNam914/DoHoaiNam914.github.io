<p><a id="page-238"></a>First off, Hinata against Reiner. This was like an elephant against an ant.</p>
<p>There was Hinata, dressed to the nines in the formal wear she picked for the Council. It didn’t look too suited for physical work, but she still lunged at Reiner, not a single wasted motion in her approach.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Reiner, meanwhile, couldn’t keep up with her at all. I couldn’t blame him. She wasn’t going at 100 percent force right now, but she might very well be stronger than a demon lord or two.</p>
<p>Reaching for his chest, she grabbed Reiner by the hand and shoulder and threw him straight off his feet.</p>
<p>As for Gaiye, he lived up to his word, offering no quarter as he slashed at Shuna. But that didn’t alarm her, so she removed her folding fan and made a single swipe. That was all it took for Gaiye’s blade to snap off.</p>
<p>“…Haahh?!”</p>
<p>His pained wail sounded less than heroic, but Shuna wasn’t done yet.</p>
<p>“What garbage. I’m not going to make this kill easy for you. You said something about the A rank, if I recall, but would you mind fighting seriously for me, please? Don’t tell me you’re giving up just because your sword’s broken?” She pointed the fan at Gaiye, egging him on.</p>
<p>“Damn… Damn you…!! A monster like you, acting like my lord and master…!!”</p>
<p><em>Indignant</em> didn’t begin to describe Gaiye’s state just then, but Shuna was clearly toying with him. The talent difference was clear, and if he thought he could win, I had no idea what was going through his mind.</p>
<p>Still…</p>
<p>“Shuna’s a damn good martial artist, isn’t she…?”</p>
<p>“Yes. She’s been learning jujitsu from Hakuro.”</p>
<p>Shrine maidens are certainly versatile. Of course, Hakuro’s jujitsu was the old style, suited for real-life combat. A lot of its moves were designed to kill, putting the art well beyond the bounds of <a id="page-239"></a>self-defense. If <em>that’s</em> the kind of thing they taught ogre princesses, there was no denying that race’s battle chops.</p>
<p>Shuna’s follow-up attack continued. Gaiye had taken out a backup sword, but she kept toying with him, knocking him down with a foot sweep. His heavy armor backfired on him as he frantically tried and failed to get up.</p>
<p>Now she loomed over him, her fetching lips reciting a spell.</p>
<p>“I dedicate my prayers to my god. I seek the power of the mighty spirits. Now, heed my request…”</p>
<p>The prayer coursed through space and time to reach me. It didn’t have to since I was right there—but that didn’t matter.</p>
<p>“Huh? Whaa?!”</p>
<p>A multilayered magic circle surrounded the flabbergasted Gaiye.</p>
<p>“Wait! This—this magic…!!”</p>
<p>Oh, he knew it? He really <em>did</em> break the A-rank barrier, then. But understanding it and being capable of defying it were two different things. The spell was near completion, and there was no escaping it. Could he withstand or block it? I doubted it. After all, this spell…</p>
<p>“Ah—ahhhhhhh…?! Stop—stop it…!!”</p>
<p>“…Consume all! Disintegration!!”</p>
<p>…is the most powerful of all holy magic.</p>
<p>A torrent of light swallowed Gaiye whole, consuming everything inside…or so it appeared. Just as I was thinking <em>Oh, great, she killed him</em>, I realized it wasn’t the case after all.</p>
<p>“Ah—ah, ngh, hnnnhhh…”</p>
<p>The swirl of light disappeared, revealing a half-naked Gaiye. His legs must’ve failed him, because he was sitting down on the floor and weeping like a schoolyard kid.</p>
<p>Well hey, at least he’s alive!</p>
<p>“Oh dear. My skills are still so <em>immature</em>; I suppose my magic didn’t work. I knew I shouldn’t have tried a spell I’m still practicing…”</p>
<p>She smiled the whole way through. I had to resist shouting “Yeah, right!” at her. Using Disintegration to strip only the armor off someone, after all, is an impossible feat unless you had perfect control over the spell.</p>
<p>…Really, though, it wasn’t <em>that</em> long ago since I had Shuna and <a id="page-240"></a>Adalmann work together to learn holy magic. And she’d already learned the hardest spell? What a magic phenom she was. Her Parser skill must have been offering her tons of support.</p>
<p>Regardless, though, it meant she beat Gaiye without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p class="space-break1">That left Hinata, but the results were already clear as day.</p>
<p>“G-General Reiner! Stop playing around!”</p>
<p>“Silence that impertinent woman at once. You must defeat the demon lord! We have no time for games!”</p>
<p>Gaban and Elrick, failing to grasp the situation, were shouting at Reiner in unison. Reiner couldn’t move. Hinata’s stare was just too withering for him. Only after that throw did he finally realize just how much stronger she was.</p>
<p>“Not coming back for me? Then how about I head over to you?”</p>
<p>The moment Hinata moved to take a step forward:</p>
<p>“Ah—ahhhh…?!”</p>
<p>With one of the most pathetic screams ever uttered in the world, Reiner buried his head in his hands and fell to his knees. A steaming liquid was leaking out from his crotch. Holy crap. Who was wetting their pants now, huh? It was so exasperating that I didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>“Wha…? General Reiner?!”</p>
<p>“What—what has happened? As strong as you are, Hinata the Saint should pose no challenge at all!”</p>
<p>Seeing someone refuse to accept reality like this is scary, isn’t it? It made it so easy to issue the cruelest of orders to people. Reiner just kneeled there, tears and spittle intermingling all over his face. So much for that. It was a mismatch from the start, but I assumed this was the end of it.</p>
<p class="space-break1">With that settled, I looked around at the people standing by their ground-floor seats.</p>
<p>The most prominent one was Elrick, in the front row and acting strangely. The Sons of the Veldt were huddled next to him, but I <a id="page-241"></a>doubted they wanted a fight. They were keeping a natural distance, appealing to me with their body language that they wanted nothing to do with this.</p>
<p>“All right, Elrick—sorry, Prince Elrick? You picked a fight with me, so what’re you gonna do now? Keep going?”</p>
<p>“Ah, um, no…”</p>
<p>“And you guys who stood up. I’m assuming your home nations fully sanction your behavior today, right? So can I presume them guilty of the same crimes?”</p>
<p>“N-no, that, uh…”</p>
<p>“S-Sir Rimuru, please, one moment… I mean, <em>L-Lord</em> Rimuru…”</p>
<p>“Please allow me to speak for a moment!”</p>
<p>I was greeting them with a smile; they were keeping their pallid faces down. A few of them were trying their hardest to plead their case, but I ignored them. Soei had forced them to remain on their feet, so all these councillors who incurred my hostility could do right now was plead for mercy. Whether I engaged with them or not, they were powerless. This way, I knew I had the upper hand.</p>
<p>From the side, it may’ve looked like a pretty little girl nonchalantly lording it over a bunch of grown-ups. A rare sight if you ever saw one. Comical, probably.</p>
<p>No way a faceless crowd like this could ever oppress a demon lord. Their lack of common sense—or a mind too weak to notice reality—just lost them the day. And what a sloppy strategy! I can’t believe they really thought they’d beat me and turn me into some kind of puppet demon lord. I suppose Hinata was right; they wanted to rile me into making the first move, but…</p>
<p>“So how to settle this…?”</p>
<p>Well, hang on. Over half the councillors were subjected to spiritual interference, their desires stimulated. Without me intervening, they would’ve sided with Elrick, and his measure would’ve passed, putting me in a bad spot. No matter the internal circumstances, it was nigh impossible to reverse a completed vote. Things only worked out like this thanks to Raphael.</p>
<p>But clearly, someone’s out to get one over on me here—</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><a id="page-242"></a><em>Report. Murderous will detected. The target is the subject Elrick.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Oh crap!</p>
<p>My Magic Sense skill was picking it up, too. Over a mile away, someone was eyeing this chamber with malicious intent. But what would they do from this far…? I promptly invoked Mind Accelerate and gauged the situation.</p>
<p>Via Magic Sense, I saw a girl with red hair and kind of a wild look. In her hand was something small, black, and metallic—a handgun.</p>
<p>Huh? A handgun from <em>that</em> range?! And I didn’t know how far one could shoot, but—</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Understood. It is the Walther P99, a compact, lightweight, but highly capable pistol with an effective range of fifty-five yards.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">…I didn’t need to know all that, thanks.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s a really good gun, but if it can’t clear a football field, it’s pointless. Our chamber is almost in the center of Englesia, built inside a special security zone. Anti-magic defenses are built into its walls, sturdy enough that your run-of-the-mill attack couldn’t even make a dent. Besides, any bullet fired would be subject to the physical laws of gravity and air resistance. Maybe it was enhanced with magic or skills, but if so, there was no reason not to use a full-on sniper rifle.</p>
<p>Of course, you needed to <em>see</em> a target to shoot it…and there shouldn’t have been any way for the girl to see Elrick from her spot. Even if she had access to Magic Sense to pinpoint his location, there was a wall in our direct path, making a sniper strike impossible. After the recent assassination of Duke Meusé, security had been beefed up around the chamber. I was on my guard as well, and I had already confirmed that this building was a poor choice for an assassination strike from far away.</p>
<p><a id="page-243"></a>So her behavior shouldn’t have meant anything to us. <em>Shouldn’t</em> have. Or was she aiming for a ricochet that’d changed the path of—</p>
<p>The moment I had the thought, the red-haired woman fired her handgun.</p>
<p>In the midst of dilated time, I could see the bullet fire out from the barrel, flying at blazing speed…only to be swallowed into a black hole that appeared out of nowhere.</p>
<p>…Huh?!</p>
<p>As I goggled, the bullet disappeared.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Report. This is Spatial Connection, a type of Spatial Motion.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Spatial Connection was just that—a skill that connected two recognized points in space together. If the distance involved was small and the portal tiny, it apparently didn’t take that much effort to deploy.</p>
<p>But I didn’t have the time to listen to that explanation. The red-haired woman had used Magic Sense to pinpoint our positions, then aimed carefully and launched her skill so her bullet would reappear within close range of Elrick. Thanks to that, she was about to assassinate someone across a full mile of walls, homes, and who knows what else.</p>
<p>A small black hole opened up in the air, about a foot and a half from the side of Elrick’s head. Coming out of it was a sure-kill bullet running at a quarter mile a second. It was a point-blank shot, and there was nothing blocking it from drawing nearer and nearer to him.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, I watched it unfold. But I couldn’t do anything. My voice wouldn’t reach him in time. Nor could I move quickly enough to try to stop it.</p>
<p class="space-break1s1"><em>…It is not a problem. Launch the ultimate skill Belzebuth, Lord of Gluttony?</em></p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara"><em>Yes</em></p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara"><em>No</em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-244"></a><em>Oh, that’ll work?</em> I thought as I invoked it. And then… Whoa. Neat. Ignoring all time and space, the bullet tumbled into my hand, all its energy gone.</p>
<p>“…?! Are you okay?”</p>
<p>A disturbed-looking Hinata was already talking to Elrick as she approached him. The Veldt leader appeared just as shocked as he stole a glance at me. I said nothing as I checked up on Elrick. He didn’t seem to understand what was going on and was just staring into space. Only a couple of us <em>did</em> know, really. But whatever happened must’ve triggered the building’s magic security network, because alarms began going off chamber-wide. The session would have to adjourn for a while.</p>

<p class="tx1">“Soei, capture the assassin.”</p>
<p>“I have a Replication on its way.”</p>
<p>As we waited for the councillors to calm down, I carried out the tasks demanded of me. Already, there was an investigation happening nearby.</p>
<p>“You could kill a person with this?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s called a bullet. You need a special tool to fire it, but there’s not one near us at the moment.”</p>
<p>“So the assassin was targeting Prince Elrick? But what for?”</p>
<p>“To frame the demon lord Rimuru, of course.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, indeed. If Prince Elrick was killed at this point in time, suspicions would naturally turn to Lord Rimuru. It’d certainly complicate our efforts to admit Tempest into the Council.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that was probably the real motive. These fools were likely set up as disposable pawns the whole time.”</p>
<p>The security chief, Sons of the Veldt leader, Chairman Leicester, and Hinata were discussing matters here. I was certainly glad to be cleared of doubt.</p>
<p>Elrick was safe now, although he’d need to face up to the commotion he caused in the chamber later.</p>
<p><a id="page-245"></a>“Am—am I being targeted even now?” he asked, his face haggard. He might’ve been a fool, but I didn’t want him dead or anything.</p>
<p>“I think it’s all right now, Elrick—sorry, Prince Elrick. When the assassin missed you, that put an end to the ambitions of whoever wanted you dead. At this point, there’s no reason for them to try again.”</p>
<p>By now, it was no longer possible to frame me for murder. Elrick was no longer of use to them, you could say, and therefore he had no need to fear for his life.</p>
<p>“B-but I’m the prince of a superpower nation. People could exploit me in so many ways…”</p>
<p>Ummm, you think so?</p>
<p>Maybe he <em>was</em> vulnerable, as someone in line for the throne, before he pulled all that nonsense today. But he wasn’t officially crown prince, and there were other people in the line of succession, so at <em>this</em> point…</p>
<p>If Elrick had actually succeeded today, he would have been a hero, I suppose—but Englesia wasn’t easy enough on its royalty that an idiot prince doing dumb things would be allowed on the throne. Maybe the people would sympathize with his motives, but they’d never forgive him for screwing up. After today, Elrick’s chances of being King Elrick someday were as good as gone.</p>
<p>“But hey, life’s not all about becoming king, is it? You’ll probably need to atone for today somehow, but after that, why don’t you try reconsidering your future a little? I mean, I became a demon lord just by sort of drifting along, but I never really <em>wanted</em> to be one or anything. But there’s no going back on it now, so I figure I may as well take advantage.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh! A demon lord offering <em>me</em> comfort? I thought you’d be scarier… More vengeful.”</p>
<p>“I’m not trying to comfort you. But generally, I’m a pacifist.”</p>
<p>Elrick’s shoulders slumped down as he resigned himself to his fate. “I was a fool to be tricked like that, Gaban. It’s time for you to take responsibility.”</p>
<p>“P-Prince?!”</p>
<p>“You were the one who approached me. I fell for your cajoling, <a id="page-246"></a>and I must atone for that…but you had best prepare to do the same, Count Gaban.”</p>
<p>Elrick had now fully given himself up to the security team.</p>
<p>It was pretty obvious that Gaban was the main person behind all this, rounding up Reiner and Elrick and convincing them to cause this wild scene. <em>I’m sure someone’s using Gaban, too—that mystery organization, perhaps. I can’t write it off as a conspiracy theory. It’s probably best to conduct a full investigation, but not even Soei’s found any clues yet.</em></p>
<p><em>If we can capture the sniper, though, maybe that’ll lead to something. Let’s hold out hope for that—and meanwhile, there’s someone else I need to consult about.</em></p>
<p>“So, Gaban, there’s something I wanted to ask…” I turned my eyes to Gaban in custody.</p>
<p>“Wh-what? What does a demon lord want from me?”</p>
<p>Even now, his attitude still had problems.</p>
<p>“I want you to tell me what you were scheming when you enticed Prince Elrick to join you.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? I’m not sure what you mean. I don’t know anything.”</p>
<p>“Wh-what?! Are you abandoning me?!”</p>
<p>“And where’s your evidence? Yes, I was asked by the prince to invite you here, but I <em>certainly</em> had no idea he would try something like that.”</p>
<p>“You will not talk your way out of this, Sir Gaban. Both the other councillors and I in this chamber will speak against your case.” Johann was having none of it, and neither were the assorted representatives nodding along with him—including a few being forced to keep standing. <em>No problem finding witnesses, then.</em></p>
<p>“Behh… But it’s true! I didn’t know. The prince designed all of this! All I did was follow his orders!”</p>
<p>“Nonsense! You’re the very one who procured the orb and brought the plan to me!”</p>
<p>“I can’t say I know what you’re talking about. Again, you will need to find some proof—”</p>
<p>Gaban was sticking to his story. And as sly as I’m sure he was, he must’ve been convinced that no evidence was left. Would it be hard <a id="page-247"></a>to pin anything on him, then? It’d probably damage his reputation for a period of time, but at this rate, I could see him returning to the scene after a while. That’s the nobility for you—you can’t take your eyes off them for a moment, and they’ll never go down too easily. A more direct approach—with weapons—would be quickest, but that was a last resort.</p>
<p>As I thought about this, the door suddenly opened.</p>
<p>“His Majesty the King Aegil is here!”</p>
<p>The attendant’s shout was audible across the chamber, and those responding to it immediately stood at attention. I was about to join them before Shuna and Benimaru stopped me. Yeah, me kneeling or whatever would’ve presented an awkward picture. Apart from Hinata and me, however, everyone was focused entirely on the new royal visitor. Even the chairman was bowing his head. That’s the kind of respect the king of a nation like Englesia deserved.</p>
<p>King Aegil glanced at the councillors Soei had restrained. He didn’t linger on them long before turning to me, his bushy blond hair going well with his curly mustache.</p>
<p>“I see my son’s caused you some trouble.”</p>
<p>“You could say that. But I think we’ve cleared up our misunderstandings?” I had no intention of exaggerating things. If human society could accept us, better to let a little rudeness now and then slide.</p>
<p>“…Ah. Very good. Then as his father, not as a king, I give you my apology and my appreciation.” He lightly bowed his head at me—the king himself.</p>
<p>I was willing to accept that. “Consider it forgiven. But I don’t want to see a repeat.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that I am certainly aware of. I hope to build a good relationship with you.”</p>
<p>King Aegil looked straight at me, providing me with what I felt were his honest feelings. I figured I should trust him on that. If he reneged, I could consider my options at that time.</p>
<p>“It’ll be good to work with you, then.”</p>
<p>“And with you.”</p>
<p>We shook hands. He was also kind enough to forgive the <a id="page-248"></a>busted-up desk, so as far as I was concerned, our reconciliation was complete.</p>
<p>“All rise!”</p>
<p>Everyone raised their faces. They had all overheard our exchange, but I supposed this formality indicated that it wasn’t meant to be on the record. A king wasn’t supposed to bow to a foreign power <em>that</em> readily, and I supposed King Aegil saw it as a last resort.</p>
<p>“F-Father…”</p>
<p>“Enough. You need some remedial education, I see.”</p>
<p>“…Yes, Father.”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>With a nod, King Aegil turned to Gaban. “Count Gaban?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty!!”</p>
<p>“You were talking about evidence. Were you expecting a quick escape because you thought I wouldn’t intervene?”</p>
<p>“N-no, Your Majesty, not at all…”</p>
<p>“I have called for magical inquisitors. I will let them decide your treatment.”</p>
<p><em>“Gehh?!” Now</em> Gaban seemed concerned. He clung to the king. “P-please, forgive me! I will tell you everything, so please, Your Majesty, have mercy!”</p>
<p>His desperation might’ve evoked sympathy among some people, but King Aegil’s reaction was merciless. “Take him away.”</p>
<p>“““Sir!!”””</p>
<p>One glance at his attendants, and his royal guard sprang into action.</p>
<p>“Now, Sir Reiner, Sir Gaiye… You’ll come with us as well.”</p>
<p>The guard began to haul them off.</p>
<p>“Stop! Let me go!”</p>
<p>“Who do you think I am?!”</p>
<p>They tried to resist but were stopped in their tracks by a group of hooded men that appeared—those magical inquisitors, I supposed. Reiner and Gaiye tried to resist as well, but the men had them subdued in short order, treating those admittedly powerful men like little children. I could tell these weren’t your average prison guards, no.</p>
<p><a id="page-249"></a><em>Englesia really is a superpower, huh? And they got some pretty tough hombres working for them.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Report. It is likely a show of force, to prove to my master that they have powerful fighters at their disposal.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Ah. One of those “don’t mess with us” things? This must’ve been their way of demonstrating that Reiner wasn’t the best Englesia could produce, an attempt to preserve their dignity. It’s hard being a king. I guess he had to stay on his toes to keep a demon lord like me from taking advantage of him. As if Aegil <em>wouldn’t</em> have used my power to make Englesia the world’s dominant force if Elrick had actually succeeded…</p>
<p>…Well, if you wanted to keep a legion of sly, cunning nobility under your finger, I supposed you needed that type of malice in you.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, then. And please allow us to handle this affair.”</p>
<p>With that, the king’s entourage left. They confiscated the Orb of Domination, too, by the looks of it, but I didn’t mind. I had already disabled it while no one was looking—it wouldn’t do to see it used for evil purposes. It also wouldn’t do for me to carry on about it any longer, so I let it go without comment.</p>
<p>Following an afternoon break, we continued with the legislative session. The councillors seemed a lot less energetic than they were in the morning hours, somehow. That was lucky for me, because I didn’t need to cajole them into passing all the day’s important business.</p>
<p>The following three resolutions were enacted today:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bl-list">• Tempest is recognized as a nation.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Tempest will officially join the Council.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• The Council’s military rights will be assigned to Tempest.</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break1">These were accepted without protest and passed, barring any issues, by unanimous vote. It was a long road to get there, but everything I wrote up for the Council was accepted in the end.</p>
<p><a id="page-250"></a>I’m really not good at this level of brinkmanship with a room full of hungry sharks. People can scoff at my ideas all they want, but having to feel out my opponent’s mind and objectives just tires me out. I think I’ll let Raphael handle that for me from now on.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>…Understood.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Today it was brute strength that let me take control of my problems. But I didn’t lash out first—it was Hinata and that charming young Shuna. In fact, I was the guy who saved Elrick’s life. This amply demonstrated the broadness of my heart, I think, so I was pretty satisfied with myself. What’s more, I had taught them all a valuable lesson: Attempting physical force against a demon lord was meaningless.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The session behind us, we left the chamber. It was a stormy day, but now, it was finally over.</p>
