<p>“Overcome our fear of you? Too easy! You might think yourself invincible as an Arch Demon, but we stumble across demons like you in our homeland all the time!”</p>
<p>“No demon can survive for long if you pulverize their physical form! That applies just as much to an Arch Demon!”</p>
<p>“We’ve done our homework on how to handle demons like you. Don’t count us humans out!”</p>
<p>The hunters worked in tandem as they shouted at him, going into a lethal formation. They had a laser focus on Diablo, despite what their bold insults would imply. Diablo, after all, had a name, and a named Arch Demon was a level above the norm threat-wise.</p>
<p>“What? No response, then?”</p>
<p>“All bark and no bite, eh?”</p>
<p>Swinging Special compound-alloy chains imbued with the holy element, they pinned Diablo down, binding his arms and legs. Their very first move had succeeded, and it made them let up on their caution just a bit.</p>
<p>The Eastern Empire, for better or for worse, had more experience with marauding demons than the Western Nations. This was supposedly because of a demon stronghold in the East that held sway over a gigantic amount of power, but either way, it also meant that demon hunters really <em>were</em> well-trained fighters in the art of anti-demon tactics. An Arch Demon was strictly the stuff of legend in the West, but eastward, they had conducted extensive research on demons, dividing them into categories and coming up with strategies for each type.</p>
<p>The leader of the demon hunters had pegged Diablo as a medieval-age demon, but considering his named status, it seemed sounder to treat him as an “ancient” one instead. A member of the demon nobility, gifted with massive power, intelligence, and perhaps even a vast army of kin. The threat could not be underestimated.</p>
<p>But the leader still believed in their chances at victory. He had experienced several Arch Demon fights himself, and he never doubted the decision-making skills he learned from those battles.</p>
<p>“Are you ready, then?”</p>
<p>That was why Diablo’s question seemed so befuddling to him.</p>
<p>“Wh-what?”</p>
<p>“I mean, if you have made your preparations, I would appreciate a starting signal.”</p>
<p>The leader failed to understand what the serene demon meant. “…Huh?” He hid his concern, trying to sound as defiant as possible. “Are you saying you won’t get in our way, no matter what we do?”</p>
<p>“Why would I? With all the effort you are clearly putting in, I don’t want to interfere, you see. This will just make the fear that much more vivid.”</p>
<p>“Heh…heh-heh… Don’t toy with us, demon. Your arrogance will be your end!”</p>
<p>Diablo’s joking around sent a slight chill across the demon hunters’ minds. Demons like him often looked down on people, overestimating their own skills. With that knowledge in mind, Diablo wasn’t venturing far from the typical demon script. This time, though, he was delivering these lines while already chained to the ground. Even a seasoned demon hunter would be put off by <em>this</em> much confidence.</p>
<p>Still, these were professionals. They didn’t delay a single beat, executing on the training routines they repeated day after day.</p>
<p>“…You shall regret your arrogance in hell! Vanquish him now! Thunderbolt!!”</p>
<p>As King Edward, journalists from nations worldwide, and Saare and the rest of the Lubelian royal guard looked on, Diablo was roasted by blinding flashes of electricity.</p>
<p>“How about that! What does natural, non-magicule-infused lightning taste like to you?!”</p>
<p>“A demon like you is protected by layers of barriers, we know. But too bad for you! With our Imperial technology, we can break right through your defenses!”</p>
<p>“Demons must be granted physical form to impose their will upon this world. With your body destroyed, there is nothing you can do!”</p>
<p>The demon hunters seemed to treat their victory as a given. Any magicule-driven force could be easily blocked by a barrier built for the purpose. In response, the Eastern Empire had researched weapons that didn’t rely on magic to work. This lightning trick was one of them, the latest in anti-demon tech, and hearing that made Edward’s terror ease a bit.</p>
<p>“Wonderful!” he shouted, relieved. “Truly, you are the heroes of the East! I must raise my reward for that merchant!”</p>
<p>His face was twisted in glee as he looked at Diablo. The lightning was roasting the demon alive… Or was it? The flashes of light had fully enveloped his body by now, but that smile was still on Diablo’s lips.</p>
<p>Only Saare and Glenda picked up on this at first. It worried them. The demon hunters’ leader, however, was puzzling over something else.</p>
<p><em>…This shouldn’t be happening. This shouldn’t be happening! Why isn’t there a single burn mark on his clothing?!</em></p>
<p>Then he saw it. That evil, evil smile.</p>
<p>“Y-you…!!”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. A rather meager effort. Too meager, in fact. You thought this would suffice against me? After all that hard work, I can’t help but call it a disappointment.”</p>
<p>Diablo casually brought an arm up. The moment he did, the chains binding him shattered.</p>
<p>“Whoa!”</p>
<p>“Nngh!!”</p>
<p>With unbelievable force, Diablo ripped the reinforced-alloy chains off his body.</p>
<p>“Y-you monster!!”</p>
<p>He laughed at the words of shock from the leader’s mouth. “Right, then,” Diablo said, as if nothing had just happened. “Now for the selection test.”</p>
<p>“W-wait! This is insanity! Why didn’t the lightning work on you?!”</p>
<p>Out of disbelief, or perhaps to divert his impending terror, the leader had to ask the question. Diablo was kind enough to provide a detailed reply.</p>
<p>“Why, you ask? It’s simple. I am equipped with a strong resistance to natural influences, electrical discharge included. Your attack just now was such a meager strike at me, it didn’t even merit building a defensive barrier to counter it. Is that satisfactory?”</p>
<p>The leader began to visibly shake. If anything, that was brave of him. The rest of the hunters, realizing the portent behind Diablo’s statement, had already fallen screaming to the ground.</p>
<p>“Aaaahhhhhhh!! Get away! Stop! Get away from me!!”</p>
<p>“Nnoooooooooo! H-help me!!”</p>
<p>These were first-class demon hunters, fearless, battle-trained warriors. And they weren’t alone. Except for the protected journalists, everybody witnessing this scene felt their spines freeze solid. Edward fainted right where he stood, foaming at the mouth, and so did his royal guard.</p>
<p>What just happened? The leader could see it well enough—this overwhelming terror, the sheer pressure this demon was sending their way. To put it as simply as possible, all Diablo did was unleash the full brunt of his aura—but that aura was daunting enough in itself to kill.</p>
<p>“Oh? So only three of you passed the test? Well, I suppose you <em>do</em> deserve praise for withstanding my Lord’s Ambition. You hereby have my permission to engage me.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, even as he felt the terror closing around his throat, the leader turned around. There, just as Diablo promised, were the two others left standing—Saare and Glenda, the young man and the wild beauty.</p>
<p>The sight of them seemingly unfazed helped the leader rally his exhausted mind. <em>It’s all right. It’s still all right. The Battlesages didn’t let us down—truly the heroes of the West. My hunters may be done for, but with these two on hand, victory could yet be ours…</em></p>
<p>Encouraged, the leader turned back toward Diablo. “Heh… Heh-heh. Yes, you are every bit your demon lord’s servant. You’re just as good at bluffing as he no doubt is.”</p>
<p>“Bluffing, you say?”</p>
<p>“I do! You called that Lord’s Ambition just now, didn’t you? It takes a demon lord–class monster to wield that skill—and if Arch Demon is the highest level of the demon races, it is impossible for you to become a demon lord! That proves you are a liar!”</p>
<p>In the East, this fact was considered highly classified research. Demons, he knew, had an upper limit to the amount of magicules their bodies could store. This was a set number across all of them, even though they could differ in other forms of strength. Older demons would have more experience in battle, allowing them to form better strategies for conserving their magic and squeezing everything they could from it. This was also one reason <em>not</em> to fear demons as much as people often did, for if you knew your enemy’s magic limit, you could work with that, no matter how they tried to spin it. Knowledge is power, and having the right knowledge can keep an obvious bluff from clouding your mind.</p>
<p>“I see. That is both correct and incorrect. It is true that demons like myself are limited in our magicule count. However, it <em>is</em> possible to evolve to the next level, assuming the right conditions are met.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I think the Red would be an example famous enough for you to be aware of?”</p>
<p>“The Red? What do you…?”</p>
<p>And then a certain demon flashed across the leader’s mind. One so famous, his entire existence was the exception that proved the rule.</p>
<p>“It would be simple enough to obtain the title of demon lord, you see. All it takes is for one of us to build our strength up to the maximum level, then live for at least two thousand years. One hardly needs to even work for it.”</p>
<p>Diablo made it sound easy, but in reality, it was fiendishly difficult. As a spiritual life-form, demons naturally enjoyed combat. Even if they were never summoned to the physical realm, battle was a constant part of life in the spiritual one. Losing a fight over there would dock magicules off your upper limit, which meant that some demons actually <em>de</em>volved over time. Reaching one’s maximum, then maintaining it for two millennia, basically meant evolving into an Arch Demon and building an unbeaten record that entire time—not even a single loss.</p>
<p>The demon hunters’ leader wasn’t aware of that per se, but even he had a hunch that Diablo was heavily downplaying the stakes involved. But the offhand reference to the Red was what attracted his attention—Diablo was speaking of that absolute ruler, the famous demon, as if they were casual buddies.</p>
<p><em>It couldn’t be. Out of all the things, it couldn’t be that…</em></p>
<p>Demon society worked in a strictly hierarchical relationship, according to a theory first advanced by Lord Gadora, the great sorcerer from the Eastern Empire. This hierarchy was punishingly strict in nature, applied equally both to the Primal Demons and the higher-level members of each demon type. A lower-level one referring to a higher-level one without some term of respect was as unthinkable as the end of the world.</p>
<p>“But perhaps the White would be more famous in the East, where you grew up? I observed her using Lord’s Ambition over there just the other day…”</p>
<p>The remark cleared the haze from the leader’s mind. He recalled the events of several years ago, just before Blanc, the fearsome Original White, took form in this world. They called the event the Bloody Shore, and if it had turned out the wrong way, it would’ve marked the birth of a second Guy Crimson, disrupting the balance of demon lords and dooming the planet to chaos. The Empire used its clout to bury the events of that day, ensuring the public didn’t know about them.</p>
<p>The leader turned pale. Now he knew. The demon that casually called them Red and White had to be at least as powerful as the one that caused the Bloody Shore.</p>
<p><em>That, that, that just can’t be…possible…! There… There’s just no way for us to win! It’s ridiculous. How could any of this happen?!</em></p>
<p>The leader screamed internally…and then, all too easily, something snapped. Demon hunters were professionals, not thrill seekers. They didn’t risk their necks over a job unless the money was right. If it involved protecting their own family, that was one thing, but nobody wanted to die in a faraway foreign country like this. And now that the leader understood how desperately outclassed he was, he abandoned all resistance as futile.</p>
<p>“Please, save me!” He let go of all shame and honor, pleading with Diablo. “At least spare my life… Help me, please…!”</p>
<p>Diablo rewarded the display with a gentle smile. “Oh, what’s wrong? You passed the test for me. Why don’t we have some fun? Don’t you want to find out whether I’m bluffing or not? You should see it for yourself.”</p>
<p>The leader was desperate. There was no more doubting Diablo. He realized fully now that this was a supreme danger to himself and the rest of the world. Bluffing? Don’t be ridiculous.</p>
<p>“P-please, forgive me! I only came here for the money. I swear I will never defy you again! I’ll never do anything to interfere with you. If you order me to slit the king’s throat while he’s still unconscious, I’ll do it for you right now! Please! Anything for my life!”</p>
<p>The pleading was taking on a pathetic tone. It turned out to be worth it.</p>
<p>“Hmm. In that case, you may leave. Go into the barrier the journalists are in, and take all the other people strewn around here with you.”</p>
<p>The leader immediately obeyed. Without hesitation, he shook his fellow hunters awake, ordering them to fetch the fallen knights for him. The king, he personally hefted over his shoulder before fleeing into the barrier. None of the journalists chided him for it. They were too busy watching over this bizarre turn of events, holding their breath in anticipation.</p>

<p class="tx1">The area in front of the tent was much cleaner now, as Saare flashed a defiant smile at Diablo.</p>
<p>“Hmm… Impressive. I find it hard to believe you’re merely a calamity-level Arch Demon.”</p>
<p>“Oh? You weren’t fleeing me?”</p>
<p>“Fleeing? Such an amusing remark. My name is Saare. I directly serve the Holy Emperor of Lubelius as part of his Imperial Guard, a member of both the Three Battlesages and the Ten Great Saints who stand in opposition to this demon lord of yours. But who are <em>you</em>?”</p>
<p>“As I stated earlier, I am called Diablo. That is my name, as granted to me by the great and powerful lord Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“…And you still aren’t going to reveal yourself?”</p>
<p>Saare attempted to keep himself friendly and at ease, even as the humiliation was making him reach his boiling point inside. All Diablo’s talk about people failing to “overcome” his terror was a direct affront to him—but he kept his thoughts rational. He wasn’t the kind to let pointless anger cloud his self-control, but in his mind, Diablo was acting far too disdainful with him.</p>
<p>Those demon hunters from the East were a joke, bragging about how professional they were but forced to beg for their lives at the end of it. Saare had let them keep up their act, since Glenda had suggested using them as sacrificial pawns, but this performance was far below his expectations.</p>
<p>Internally, he sneered at the demon before him. <em>I shouldn’t have expected more from private citizens. We are tasked with guarding the Holy Emperor and the god Luminus herself. We are far more prepared to battle than they would ever be!</em></p>
<p>Despite that, he kept himself on a higher alert than usual. <em>Grigori wanted to fight as well</em>, he recalled, <em>but it looks like the prey chose me instead. In which case…time to make him regret his arrogance.</em></p>
<p>Diablo was an unknown name, not mentioned in any of the ancient texts he was familiar with. It meant this was no great demon, nothing to pose a threat to him. <em>Red, White—all that pretention. What’s there to be so afraid of? If this was a still-unnamed Primal Demon, all bets are off, but…</em></p>
<p>He could tell his foe was no regular Arch Demon, but to Saare, this didn’t seem like much to be concerned about. It was the sort of confidence that only the truly ignorant could have. He just knew too little about demons.</p>
<p>In his eyes, if this one wasn’t going to reveal his true nature, he’d just have to rip the disguise off by force. Saare, after all, had enough power to fight a demon lord alone. Valentine may have escaped at the end of their battle, but he was a hair’s breadth away from slaying him. A mere Arch Demon wasn’t cause for alarm at all.</p>
<p>That explained why Diablo’s attitude irked Saare so badly…but Diablo’s next statement made the Battlesage doubt his ears.</p>
<p>“…Reveal myself? Ah yes. I have so little interest in strength, I forgot to mention it. Indeed, as you say, I am not an Arch Demon. In fact, I have completed my evolution to Demon Peer. Rather similar, I think you’ll see,” he casually added, “but do try to remember the difference.”</p>
<p>That much really didn’t matter to Diablo—not as much as his name did. It was a trivial matter to him, but a massive crisis to Saare.</p>
<p class="space-break">He couldn’t believe it. He didn’t <em>want</em> to believe it. What did the <br/>demon before him just say? A Demon Peer? That was…purely the stuff of legend, unofficially classified as a disaster-level threat, and its force far exceeded anything else in the demon family. Not even a higher-level spirit could hope to catch a whiff of that kind of power. It would take multiple elemental lord–class creatures to deal with it.</p>
<p>Only a few very old tomes had examples of one interfering with this world, but it proved that they did exist. Just look at the strongest demon lord that ever walked the earth…</p>
<p><em>Oh.</em></p>
<p>Now it made sense to Saare. A demon who had lived for millennia and become a demon lord–class presence, like Diablo mentioned, could evolve into a Demon Peer via some kind of trigger. Of <em>course</em> that evolution would boost his force to such dizzying levels. The Red’s magicule count had ballooned to several times that of a regular Arch Demon, and he had all those extra years of experience, too. Truly, there was no limit to his strength.</p>
<p>The demon hunters’ leader, warily eyeing these events, had fallen unconscious the moment he heard the words <em>Demon Peer</em>. He was overcome—not with fear, but with relief. If he had actually <em>fought</em> that demon… That was too much to even consider. And the joy he felt, avoiding that fate, literally knocked him unconscious.</p>
<p>Nobody could blame the guy. Even Saare was taken by an all-encompassing desire to run away. And the scariest part? Some fool out there was insane enough to give such a rare Arch Demon a name.</p>
<p><em>What in the name of Luminus could Rimuru have possibly been thinking?!</em></p>
<p>Saare could feel a cold sweat erupt from every pore in his body. His instincts were sounding the alarm bells, the easygoing attitude of a moment ago now barely a passing memory. He knew how impossible this was.</p>
<p>If Diablo had given his name without hesitation like that, it meant there really was someone out there who had granted it to him. A masterless named creature would never be so eager to share his name, since it would expose him to falling under the control of someone else. It proved that the demon lord Rimuru really <em>was</em> behind this.</p>
<p><em>But could Rimuru, freshly ordained as a demon lord, even have the energy needed to name an Arch Demon?</em></p>
<p>There wasn’t much point pondering that question, but Saare couldn’t help but wonder. His mind was just attempting to escape reality at this point.</p>
<p>Then he felt something in motion next to him.</p>
<p>“What are you balking for, Saare?! Let’s you and I take out that sexy-looking demon together!”</p>
<p>Glenda was virtually screaming at him.</p>
<p>“No! Glenda, wait!”</p>
<p>Saare was already too late to stop her. Like the wind, she strode forth, sneaking up to Diablo without a sound and thrusting her black-bladed knife at him. It plunged straight into Diablo’s undefended heart.</p>
<p>“Ha! No threat at all!!”</p>
<p>Glenda laughed. She could tell that hit home. But sadly, Diablo had no intention of dodging that from the start.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh… That is some commendable physical ability. Unfortunately,” he flatly stated, “physical attacks do not work on me.”</p>
<p>That was the truth. Diablo had acquired a trait known as Cancel Melee Attack.</p>
<p>Glenda quickly leaped back a safe distance. “Pfft! What a pain!” Then, ignoring Saare’s warning, she launched a barrage of quick attacks. Even she could tell he was a formidable foe; she no longer openly berated him like before, and she was treating this like a battle against a full-bore demon lord.</p>
<p>But it was all mere sport to Diablo. He was in a realm of his own, power-wise, and nothing Glenda busted out could ever affect him.</p>
<p>Now Glenda realized this—or to be exact, she had sensed as much from the start. Her real goals lay elsewhere.</p>
<p class="space-break">Saare, resigned to his fate, steeled himself. Unable to abandon Glenda, he joined the battle, unleashing his spiritual force and boosting his physical skills to the max. Wielding the Demonslayer, a Unique weapon obtained through massive amounts of capital, he slashed at Diablo. It didn’t work.</p>
<p>“Dammit! Slashes don’t work on him?! Glenda, buy me some time so I can unleash my holy magic…”</p>
<p>Reasoning that only his strongest magic would knock this menace out, Saare asked Glenda for a hand. Glenda had no response. Diablo spoke in her place.</p>
<p>“I believe your female companion just fled?”</p>
<p>Saare had trouble understanding this at first. Turning around, disbelieving his own ears, he couldn’t find Glenda there. Diablo was right; she had fled the scene long ago.</p>
<p>“Damn herrrrrrr!!” he screamed at the top of his lungs. It didn’t accomplish much. Glenda decided unilaterally to start this battle, and then she left Saare to deal with the fallout. It enraged him, but Diablo <em>was</em> right there, sporting his evil grin. It was time for Saare to worry about his own hide, not hers.</p>
<p><em>I can do this. I have to do this! I need to keep this going until Grigori returns!</em></p>
<p>With his hopes now pinned on his other stalwart companion, Saare roused his spirit. Grigori had gone to the city to lure the demon over to him. Their target was right here, and thus he should be back shortly. Believing in this, Saare plunged himself into this desperate battle—a fleeing wish that never had any hope of coming true.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">As Saare faced these insurmountable odds, Grigori of the Three Battlesages was in a desperate situation of his own.</p>
<p>There, as he ran across the battlefield, he was greeted by a calamity from the skies. It was the mercenary force Yohm had brought on, seemingly fighting to protect the city gate. They were doing what seemed to be a fine job, fending off Farmus’s vanguard force.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the prey Grigori was supposed to be targeting. He had no interest in Farmus’s internal strife; it had nothing to do with him. He was only after the demon who killed Archbishop Reyhiem, and his intelligence stated that he’d be found working undercover in this town.</p>
<p><em>King Edward was accompanied by those specialists from the East when I saw him</em>, he had thought. <em>Unless they run off on him, I doubt I’ll have much work to do…</em></p>
<p>But now Grigori was faced with a much more present threat than a demon. It was a gigantic, fearsome wolf in his way.</p>
<p class="space-break">The wolf, of course, was Ranga, wagging his tail with glee as he sprinted across the heavens. He was light, as light as a feather, and now his feet weren’t kicking against the ground at all. This was Skywalk, a technique only a small handful of magical beasts could hope to learn, and he had acquired it all too naturally.</p>
<p>To Ranga, however, this was a trivial detail. The waves of power released from his body were bringing him pure joy as he whirled around, feeling himself fill up with magical energy. His legs, covered in jet-black fur, were crackling with gold-colored lightning—his aura releasing electricity into the air, whether Ranga meant to or not. It was being controlled by the shining gold horns on his head, radiating a force like a crown, even as the lightning-infused fur shone black like a robe of darkness. He was the king of wolves, and now he had every bit of the majesty that title entailed.</p>
<p>Now he approached the speed of sound in the air, as he instantly sighted the group Diablo tipped him off about. Another moment, and he was back on solid ground—right in front of Grigori.</p>
<p class="space-break">Accompanying Grigori was a small handful of the Lubelius Imperial Guard. The other five thousand with them were the second wave of Farmus knights sent by Edward as reinforcements.</p>
<p>One of the Farmus generals, an inexperienced member of the nobility, nervously approached.</p>
<p>“S-Sir Grigori, your orders?”</p>
<p><em>Hell if I know</em>, he thought.</p>
<p>All of Farmus’s top-notch knights were long gone, erased from the world during the previous attempt to invade Tempest. What remained were the also-rans, the fighters whose skills and brainpower weren’t enough to join in last time. None of them could think for themselves; they relied fully on Grigori, this wonder child from exotic lands, without even the slightest sense of shame.</p>
<p>“General Gaston, you tackle the forces lagging behind us. You saw them advancing from the ground and the sky, right?”</p>
<p>The observation made Gaston come to his senses. “Very well. What about you, Sir Grigori…?”</p>
<p>“Me? Isn’t it obvious? I gotta take that guy on. Python, Garcia, you two join—”</p>
<p><em>Join Gaston and keep him guarded</em> is what Grigori wanted to say, but he was interrupted by a dark gale-force wind rushing by.</p>
<p>“Wha…?!”</p>
<p>At a speed that only Grigori could react to, Ranga charged right into the forces Gaston led.</p>
<p>“Dammit!” Grigori shouted. “That stupid dog!!” He thrust his halberd forward with all his might; Ranga easily leaped out of harm’s way, then began exercising free rein to wreck the whole troop. Leaping up and down, he kept attacking and attacking, piling up the casualties. Neither Python, nor Garcia, nor all of their many companions could avoid the feast of violence, sending them all crashing to the ground.</p>
<p>And before long, those fangs were being bared at Grigori himself.</p>
<p class="space-break">Gobta and Gabil were chasing Ranga as fast as they could.</p>
<p>“Come onnnn, Ranga, you’re too faaaast…”</p>
<p>“Indeed. I fear there will be no assignments left for us at the end of this.”</p>
<p>“My brother,” interjected Soka, “please, enough whining. Continue the chase.”</p>
<p>They were all bickering at one another just like usual, but everyone knew they were good friends. Only the three of them thought they were hiding it.</p>
<p>“Right!” bellowed Gobta. “Here we go!”</p>
<p>“Got it!”</p>
<p>Gobta triggered Shadow Motion, accompanied by a hundred of his goblin riders. Gabil flew ahead, a hundred members of Team Hiryu joining him. Soka, meanwhile, returned to Hakuro to give the field commander his report.</p>
<p>As the first person on the battlefield, Gobta was greeted by the sight of heaps of soldiers lying in what felt like a single spot. The knights still in the fray were in a loose circle around Ranga, keeping a prudent distance and praying that Grigori could defeat this beast. The downed knights were all the talented ones—or at least, those courageous enough to engage Ranga and keep Grigori guarded. They paid for that dearly, all gathered together in a heap because Ranga was using his front paws to toss them over there, ensuring he didn’t accidentally trample them to death.</p>
<p>The faces of all the praying knights were strained with despair. Their cheers, loud and enthusiastic at first, were now replaced with stony silence. Grigori was already covered from head to toe in wounds. Victory, at this point, would be a dream wrapped within a dream. Even with Impervious, the steel-like protection covering Grigori, in Ranga’s eye he was just a slightly tougher chew toy than usual. The fact that he couldn’t be knocked out simply meant he had to endure the pain that much longer.</p>
<p>“Whoa!” The sight half panicked Gobta. “That’s, uh, that’s a bad wolf, Ranga! He’s gonna die if you do any more of that!”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Gabil agreed, “we must heal him at once!”</p>
<p>The order made Ranga freeze in place. Noticing the sorry sight around him, he hunched over, tail pointed straight down, shrinking down in size.</p>
<p>“Um… Right. But doesn’t this human wish to play for a while longer…?”</p>
<p>Grigori was unconscious, a broken halberd still in his hand, as Ranga ruefully prodded him with a paw. It was just too pitiful a sight for Gobta and Gabil to stand. Just imagining themselves in his place…</p>
<p>“Um, no, no, I don’t think so, Ranga…”</p>
<p>“No, indeed! Best stop this for now, or else Sir Rimuru will never let you hear the end of it!”</p>
<p>The mention of Rimuru’s name forced Ranga to give. Looking at the two of them with his sad eyes, he finally gave up.</p>
<p>“Oh no. He’ll be angry at me…”</p>
<p>The freed Grigori’s face was caked with drool, his limbs going off in assorted slightly off-kilter directions. Just slightly, mind you, but still in no angle the human body was designed for. He was pretty seriously banged up, in other words, and it was a wonder he continued to draw breath.</p>
<p>But Grigori survived it all. And with the healing potion Gobta provided, he made a full recovery before the sun set on the day. His body may not have paid the price for the experience…but his self-esteem certainly did. In later years, he came to be known in his homeland as the Canophobe Crusader, for reasons he refused to divulge to the general public.</p>
