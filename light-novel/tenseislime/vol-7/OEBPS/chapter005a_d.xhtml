<p class="tx1">“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>The group was back on the road the next morning, fully rested and recharged. They would need it, because navigating the treacherous roads into the Forest of Jura took a lot of willpower.</p>
<p>Hinata was all smiles as she set off with them, but it wasn’t long before that enthusiasm evaporated.</p>
<p>“What’s all this about?”</p>
<p>“This is so easy, it almost bores me.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and just look at this highway! It’s as neatly paved as the streets of the Englesian capital. This is crazy!”</p>
<p>The surprise around the party was understandable. The road was paved in stone, not a single puddle of water to be found. It was even lightly banked around the turns, and gutters had been dug on both sides. The winter weather hadn’t frozen the path at all, ensuring the easiest possible journey.</p>
<p>“I don’t even think there are any monsters nearby. There weren’t too many out in the open forest, either…”</p>
<p>Litus, who had staged a short expedition into the unexplored woods, couldn’t help but be astonished. She was right—the barrier deployed over the entire highway was a shock to see in action. Magical devices had been installed every six or so miles to power it, preventing any nearby monsters from wandering the roads. This made the journey vastly safer, and they saw more passing merchants traveling down the road as they pressed on. Those merchants must’ve been responsible for breathing so much life into Blumund right now.</p>
<p>“If they’ve devoted this much time and effort to constructing a road like this, I wonder what we should expect to find in the monsters’ homeland up ahead.”</p>
<p>Nobody responded to Arnaud. He was just stating what everyone else was thinking—and they all wanted an answer just as badly.</p>
<p>“That merchant said you could take this highway mounted easily enough. He was right.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I thought our horses would be a bother in the forest, but I suppose we had nothing to worry about.”</p>
<p>Hinata had heard reports about the large-scale construction project Rimuru was carrying out in the forest. Seeing it for herself, however, made it hard to hide her surprise. The Forest of Jura, so forbidding to humans for so many years, was now as accessible as a city park.</p>
<p>So the party proceeded along for a while, until they spotted a group of hobgoblins riding wolves up ahead.</p>
<p>“Did they notice us?!”</p>
<p>“Hold it,” Hinata calmly said. “I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>She was right. They could hear laughing. It sounded like the hobgoblins were merely chatting among themselves. It was a straight path ahead, so they had noticed Hinata’s party, but they just waved and approached in a friendly manner.</p>
<p>“Hello! We haven’t seen you before. You don’t appear to be merchants—are you adventurers, then?”</p>
<p>“More or less, yes.”</p>
<p>“Ah, very good! I wish you good luck on your mission. Now, I’m sure you’ll be just fine, but there are a few things I need to warn you about.”</p>
<p>The hobgoblin changed his tone, then outlined the rules all travelers needed to follow on the highway:</p>
<p class="ul_f">No garbage dumping.</p>
<p class="ul_m">No fighting on the highway.</p>
<p class="ul_m">Use the drinking fountains located every six miles on the highway when camping overnight.</p>
<p class="ul_m">For added safety, take advantage of the patrol stations located every twelve miles on the highway.</p>
<p class="ul_m">If you have the money for it, inns are located every twenty-five miles.</p>
<p class="ul_l">If you see anyone in trouble, report it to the nearest patrol station.</p>
<p>…and so on.</p>
<p>“Also, you’ll see a glowing stone tablet every six miles, but please don’t touch them. Breaking them will lead to severe penalties.”</p>
<p>It was those glowing stones that kept the barriers running, he explained. They were these little glowing spots among the flagstones forming the road, which also helped travelers find their way in dark nights.</p>
<p>All in all, the rules went into so much detail that the party could hardly believe they were enacted and enforced by monsters.</p>
<p>“All right. Thanks for letting us know.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s fine! You’ll see people like us patrolling the highway, so let any of us know if you run into trouble.”</p>
<p>With that, the hobgoblin security detail darted down the road, leaving a dumbfounded Hinata behind.</p>
<p>“Um, Lady Hinata…”</p>
<p>“Hold it. Can you remain silent for a little while? I need to think about something.”</p>
<p>Arnaud and the others obeyed. The party traveled in silence for the next hour until they stumbled across a drinking fountain—on the exact mile marker the hobgoblin said they’d find it at. These markers, located at every mile along the highway, began at zero on the western entrance to Rimuru (the capital) and counted upward from there. Each one provided quick guidance on how much farther the nearest water, patrol station, and inn was.</p>
<p>Hinata, recognizing these from the trips she had taken on Japan’s expressways, immediately saw the value of these markers in a pinch. If you needed help and weren’t sure whether to keep going or double back, these provided instant guidance on what to do. It spoke volumes about how much this highway’s designers cared about traveler safety.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting, by the way, that “miles” did not originally exist as a unit of measurement on this world, but Rimuru ignored that and simply used a system he was already familiar with. The inns were spaced every 25 miles based on the assumption that the average person could walk a little over three miles in an hour and manage that for eight hours a day easily enough. Merchant wagons went about as quickly as a grown person on foot, so as long as you weren’t in too much of a hurry, it was easy to organize a trip that gave you an inn to rest in every night.</p>
<p>Clearly, someone had devoted a lot of thought into designing this. There was no doubting it now. Rimuru obviously craved interaction with the human race.</p>
<p class="space-break">The journey beyond Blumund went far more comfortably than the one before it. The drinking fountain the party found themselves at was just that—a clean source of drinking water, available to anyone for free. It was almost a dizzying sight to them. Seeing the very modern-day planet-Earth concept of free water applied to a forest as hazardous as this one made most of the party wonder what Rimuru could possibly have been thinking.</p>
<p>These fountains were paired with cooking pits and cleared-out grassy areas for those putting up tents nearby, complete with benches made of sawed logs and roofed areas to get out from the rain. It was a campsite, just like any one you’d find off your local highway.</p>
<p>Between this and everything else, the Forest of Jura—once seen as a forbidden holy sanctuary by the rest of the planet—was now calm and accessible enough for just about anyone. This forest that was supposed to be crawling with all kinds of horrid monsters; the kind of place where if you were an adventurer ranked B or lower, one false move could spell death.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the domain of human beings. It was an Eden for monsters. And developing it to the point that it was open to anybody… Hinata hadn’t even entertained the concept. It wasn’t a matter of whether it was possible or not—it was just beyond her imagination, and probably that of fellow otherworlder Yuuki Kagurazaka, too. All that effort they had expended protecting humanity from the threat of monsters, and he made it look <em>this</em> simple?</p>
<p><em>You’ve got to be kidding me</em>, Hinata thought grudgingly to herself. <em>Now at least I understand what Yuuki mentioned to me.</em></p>
<p>She recalled a meeting with Yuuki at one of her favorite cafés in Englesia. They regularly met to exchange intelligence, and this time, the topic of Rimuru came up. Apparently, Yuuki said, Rimuru was earnestly serious about creating and developing a nation of monsters—and not only that, but he was sending out feelers toward the Western Nations, in hopes of getting friendlier with them. And that new brandy cake they were enjoying at the café? Readily available for purchase from Rimuru, who had invested in producing a wide variety of fine liquors.</p>
<p>“He’s like nobody else out there,” Yuuki had laughed as Hinata took little bites out of her slice, savoring each one. “It’s like he does it all and makes it look easy, you know? And he’s got insight way further into the future than I do. I think that’s why he’s putting so much effort into bringing little treats like that cake into this world.”</p>
<p>He warned her that hostilities with him would be ill-advised—which in turn suggested the Free Guild was siding with him. She let that slide without comment at the time. But now:</p>
<p><em>…He was right</em>, she thought as she watched some merchants gratefully taking advantage of the fountain near her. <em>There’s no way he’d focus on these little things unless he really</em> could <em>“do it all.”</em></p>
<p class="space-break">Two hours after leaving the fountain, they sighted an inn, the last of seven built along this highway. Hinata’s party decided to spend the night here, and before long, they were situated in the dining hall.</p>
<p>“All right,” she said once they were seated. “I want to hear your feedback. What do you think of what we saw today?”</p>
<p>Arnaud, representing the rest of them, spoke first. “If I…may be honest with you, Lady Hinata?”</p>
<p>“Go ahead. That’s what I want to hear.”</p>
<p>“Judging by this highway alone, I think the demon lord Rimuru must be an incredibly gifted leader. The sense of security his patrolmen give this road must attract all kinds of travelers. I can’t see much of a future for the businesses lining the route through Farmus.”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” rumbled Bacchus, “monsters are not the only threat out there. You have bandits targeting merchants; you have illness; you have the potential for injury; you might break an axle and be stranded. Such things happen often, and having more people up and down the highway can do much to keep people from worrying.”</p>
<p>“True,” replied Litus. “If you’re someplace where you can expect help if you need it, that really puts your mind at ease.”</p>
<p>“And you can save money,” Fritz added, “because you no longer have to hire a personal guard detail. That alone… It’s big.”</p>
<p>The praise for Rimuru was glowing all around.</p>
<p>“He seems to be more devoted to his rule than a lot of the barons you see out there. His title might be demon lord, but if that’s what he is, he’s a damn benevolent one.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. There’s a lot we could learn from him. Including a few things our leaders in Lubelius would be advised to implement.”</p>
<p>“I’m just glad the divine-enemy declaration never came down.”</p>
<p>“Now we’ll just have to see if he’s willing to accept your apology, Lady Hinata.”</p>
<p>Hinata nodded her agreement. “I’ll have to be as heartfelt with it as I can. If he still wants to duel with me, I’ll have to accept, but…”</p>
<p>But she had her doubts. Why would he seek a duel at <em>this</em> point? Whether he forgave Hinata or not, she didn’t see why it called for another fight to settle. Rimuru just didn’t seem to be the kind of person to show off his newfound demon lord power like <em>this</em>.</p>
<p class="space-break">Even with those doubts in her mind, Hinata’s journey continued apace. They took advantage of an inn on the seventh day as well, and this one was already as ornate and luxuriant as any you’d find in Englesia. There was even a vast public bath, the perfect place to soak after a long journey.</p>
<p>What’s more, these inns always had at least a few people recruited from Blumund working for them. Trading money for services was still kind of a novel thing for the monster staff, apparently, so her party often saw a human employee providing on-the-job guidance. It was, in a way, an ideal cross-species relationship, and it was more than enough to make Hinata see the need to reconsider Luminism’s teachings.</p>
<p class="space-break">They would arrive at Rimuru, the capital, the next day—and with that, an encounter with the demon lord himself.</p>
<p><em>I hope we can work this out with words instead of swords…</em></p>
<p>She knew it was a selfish thought, but Hinata really meant it…even as a vast web of intermingled bad intentions schemed to prevent it.</p>

<p class="tx1">Hinata, still trundling along, was due in this evening, according to the latest report from Soei’s team. She had spent two weeks on this journey, making zero use of teleportation or other magical means to speed things up.</p>
<p>“Thank you. It’s so vital to have this sort of intelligence early on. Keep it up.”</p>
<p>“This is nothing,” Soei said, quietly accepting my praise. “We will redouble our efforts.”</p>
<p>He’s literally a shadow. I mean it. And when someone as handsome as he is pulls that off, you can’t be jealous of that. He looked great.</p>
<p>I should note, however, that when he gave me an urgent report from the inn Hinata first stayed at, he suggested poisoning her to “take her out of the picture sooner than later.” I gave him a few not-so-nice words about <em>that</em> idea. It still felt to me that Hinata was here to talk, not fight, as much as we still needed to remain on guard. Something about the way she stayed at every inn along the way, totally unhurried, seemed almost <em>too</em> bold to me.</p>
<p>“Could this be a diversion?” Benimaru suggested. A diversion? Was she deliberately drawing attention while that separate force launched a surprise attack? It was possible, I guess. This <em>was</em> Hinata we were dealing with. As coldhearted as she was, I’m sure no method of securing victory was below her.</p>
<p>“What are the hundred other paladins doing?”</p>
<p>“They continue to lie low along the old path, sir. If we hadn’t spotted them just when they departed, I’m not sure we would have noticed them at all.”</p>
<p>These guys, meanwhile, were in full-on military mode. Hinata was looking more and more like a lure. Either way, though, we couldn’t relax. Shion already had her force deployed; if these paladins made any moves, things would start happening quickly after that.</p>
<p>“Given Hinata’s strength, her serving as a lure wouldn’t be strange at all. I’m the only one who can handle her—even now, Benimaru, you’d probably be in over your head. If I had to guess, I’m willing to bet she thinks she can beat all of us together.”</p>
<p>“Heh. That’s quite a lot of confidence, believing such nonsense even after she knows you. I could only call it foolish,” Soei said with a thin smile, although to me, <em>that</em> assertion was the foolish talk.</p>
<p>But who knows? She would only know me from before my ascension, but I knew just how capable she was. Looking back, it was blatantly clear how easy she was going on me back then.</p>
<p>“We better not let the paladins fan out, then,” noted Benimaru. “If they build a Holy Field, that will put us at a huge disadvantage.”</p>
<p>Soei nodded at him. “True. If so, we will need to contact Shion out on the field and try to have her eliminate them as soon as possible…”</p>
<p>He paused mid-thought and then told me the one thing I didn’t want to hear:</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru, we’re detecting movement. They have attempted to fan out and cover the four cardinal directions around town, but Shion has intercepted them. Battle is reportedly underway.”</p>
<p class="space-break">So Hinata chose to fight. Ah well. If she wants to be my enemy, I’ve got a plan for that.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="" class="ornament1" src="images/Art_sborn1.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Putting the inn behind them, Hinata and her companions prepared for the day’s journey ahead. They would likely reach the capital of Rimuru that evening, and the tension was written on everyone’s faces.</p>
<p>“Well, here we are. I don’t know if we’ll actually see him today, but be prepared, all right? Even if this does end in a fight, I don’t want you laying a hand on him.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“That’s an order. There’s no further point to being hostile toward the demon lord. I’ll go in, I’ll take full responsibility for all this, and then we’ll talk things over—”</p>
<p>Before she could wax poetic about her desire for peace, she was interrupted. An emergency message had just been magically sent to her.</p>
<p>(…nally, we connected to… You hear us, Lady Hi…? The Three Battlesages…en route to…)</p>
<p>It faded in and out, but the urgency and the identity of its sender—Cardinal Nicolaus Speltus—were both obvious. Something must have been jamming it.</p>
<p>Hinata tried to send a message back—(What is it? What happened?)—but she could sense the transmission dissipating into the air before it got far.</p>
<p>(Beware the Seven Days…)</p>
<p>And with that final message, Nicolaus’s presence disappeared. Something must have happened, Hinata realized.</p>
<p><em>Was he trying to send a message to me over and over before he finally succeeded? Maybe whatever happened, happened well before now. But the Three Battlesages are joining in…? Wait, were they part of the chaos in Farmus?!</em></p>
<p>The blood drained from Hinata’s face as she crafted another magical transmission, this one pointed at Holy Emperor Louis.</p>
<p>(What is it? That’s a rather poorly formed spell you used. Has something gotten you flustered?)</p>
<p>The emperor sounded serene as usual. That was a relief to Hinata.</p>
<p>(Yes. No time to explain. I’m just going to ask this right out: Did you order the Three Battlesages deployed?)</p>
<p>(What? I did nothing of the sort. Did they?)</p>
<p>(Yeah, I didn’t think you suddenly took an interest in human nations. I was on orders from Luminus to keep them on standby, and they’re not the sort of people to work on their own volition. Something’s going on.)</p>
<p>Louis’s main interests in life were Luminus and the city of Nightgarden. This was why Hinata called the actual shots around Lubelius. The Battlesages weren’t afraid to voice their discontent, but Hinata’s orders were always followed. It was hard for her to imagine them choosing now, of all times, to defy her.</p>
<p>So yes, something must have happened. Or someone was feeding the Battlesages a line.</p>
<p><em>Seven Days…?</em></p>
<p>She was now sure about the bad feeling in the pit of her stomach. Immediately, she resolved to return home. A little transport magic would help make up for lost time. She really wanted to be fully refreshed and ready for the potential battle against Rimuru, but now was no time to whine about that.</p>
<p>But the clock was already against her.</p>
<p>(Yeah, it looks like it. I’ll need to—)</p>
<p>An audible <em>thunk</em> of dull pain ran across her head as her link with Louis was cut off. Some kind of force field covered the area around her, blocking the casting of magic. As it did, she could sense a large battle unfolding not far away, making the very air shimmer.</p>
<p>“Wha…?! Is that…Renard?!”</p>
<p>Arnaud, watching over Hinata, quickly expressed his surprise at these sudden events.</p>
<p>“Let’s go!”</p>
<p>Things were moving fast—and not in a good direction. She hadn’t even encountered Rimuru yet, and the situation was rapidly deteriorating. Unease filled her mind as she ran at full speed for the battlefield.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="" class="ornament1" src="images/Art_sborn1.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Hearing that Hinata was making contact with someone, I chose to block her signal. Once I did, she reportedly began running for the battlefield at full tilt. That would nip in the bud whatever she was scheming.</p>
<p>Now, though, it was certain.</p>
<p>“That was Hinata’s doing, huh?”</p>
<p>“It would appear so,” replied Benimaru. The way she immediately changed tactics once she knew we were on to her… Shrewd as always.”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s follow the plan. Hinata and I are gonna work this out, just the two of us.”</p>
<p>“Roger that! I will let no one interfere.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Keep the paladins at bay. Let’s move!”</p>
<p>“““Yes sir!”””</p>
<p>With a quick, reassuring nod to Benimaru, I turned into my human form.</p>
<p>“Good luck to you!”</p>
<p>Shuna waved as we all set off—Benimaru, Soei, Alvis, Sufia, and me. Bracing myself, I cast Dominate Space and popped over to Shion’s location before Hinata could reach it. I appreciated her holding her own out there, but against a pack of Crusaders, Team Reborn would face an uphill climb…</p>
<p class="space-break">…or so I assumed; and sometimes, I assume wrong.</p>
<p class="space-break">I had no idea what was going on. I thought I was going out of my head. How did <em>this</em> happen?! The sight before me made me completely lose my sense of speech.</p>
<p>What was I seeing? Well, it was Shion, arms folded in front of her, issuing orders to Team Reborn. That much was fine—part of the plan. It was the way they fought that was the problem. In a good way, it was completely unexpected.</p>
<p>“What in the…?! Our attacks don’t work on them!”</p>
<p>“These aren’t undead! What is the meaning of this?!”</p>
<p>The paladins sounded just as shocked. The one who asked that particular question would never receive an answer, as a Reborn member took him down with a quick dagger strike. The Reborn had used his own body as a feint to land the attack, making the most incredible use of his immortality.</p>
<p class="space-break">But I knew it couldn’t last. The paladins would regroup soon, and then it’d be a one-sided match…or so I thought.</p>
<p>Again, my predictions were turned on their head. Less than three minutes later, our foes were almost at the breaking point.</p>
<p>As I thought, the paladins <em>did</em> rally, successfully closing the distance between them and Team Reborn without a challenge. Given the difference in core strength, they must’ve figured being immortal wouldn’t be enough to make them unbeatable. So they attempted to pin them down instead—but it didn’t work. Slash ’em up all you want; the Reborn guys immediately heal, something the paladins couldn’t manage. As soon as they fell, they were quickly bound up by the Team Kurenai members on standby, ensuring they were out of the fight.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee!” said one of the Reborn, a small child, as she half taunted one of the captured paladins. “Y’know what? This knife has this superstrong sleep medicine rubbed all over it! The moment we land a strike on you, we win!”</p>
<p>I wasn’t a huge fan of her spoiling the whole trick, but ah well. She’s just a kid.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Report. The subject Gobwe is older in years than the subject Gobta.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">Dude. Really? Man, I have the <em>worst</em> trouble telling these monsters apart. I know Gobta’s evolved way past from when I first saw him, but looks-wise, it was that exact same dopey face. So should I expect some kind of breathtaking transformation from him in the future?</p>
<p>Either way, seeing this tiny girl lecture a paladin before my eyes almost made me chuckle a bit. This wasn’t an uphill battle at all. If anything, for Team Reborn right now, it was a pretty steep <em>downhill</em> one. Unless the paladins were careful enough to bring an antidote along or had a natural skill to resist poison, there was no resisting this sneak attack. It’d only work once, of course, but damn, was it effective.</p>
<p>Still, it was rapidly coming to an end. There were yet more paladins in the group, and they weren’t going to let up now. Trickery like this wouldn’t work so easily against such overwhelming force—and now that they’d seen how the trick worked, we couldn’t expect an encore performance. The only reason Team Reborn could land those little nicks and cuts was because the paladins let their guards down after ripping them to shreds, after all.</p>
<p>Still, those nicks and cuts had successfully knocked half of the enemy out of the battle, and that was more than praiseworthy. Talk about overachieving. Now to return to the original plan, which called for a protracted battle of attrition as the paladins— No, I was being proven wrong again.</p>
<p class="space-break">Shion gave the figures in front of her a signal with her chin. It was targeted at Gobzo and Gobwa, who looked at each other, then Shion, incredulously.</p>
<p>“You wish for us to join in?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t <em>you</em> going to join?!” Gobzo asked. “’Cuz if it’s just us, I don’t think it’ll be easy to beat those guys!”</p>
<p>“No,” Gobwa explained, “I think it’s all right if we don’t win, as long as we can buy some time…”</p>
<p>“Huhhh?! I thought we were ordered to win at all costs!”</p>
<p>Gobwa, standing guard by the meeting-hall door, knew what we had discussed in there. Gobzo didn’t and was totally floored by the news. Something wasn’t adding up here, was it?</p>
<p>“Um,” Gobwa asked Shion, sensing Gobzo’s disquiet, “during our strategy meeting, we were supposed to be on standby, weren’t we…?”</p>
<p>Yeah. They were. I <em>thought</em> something was weird about it. Good to hear my mind isn’t playing tricks on me. But Shion wasn’t having it. “What are you fools talking about?!” she roared. “We have victory within reach; can’t you see that?! Securing victory against a stronger foe is how you can climb over the wall to the next level! You’re being given a golden opportunity! You should thank me for this!”</p>
<p>I…wasn’t sure if I agreed with these statements. Victory was within reach, but our foes were stronger? A bit contradictory, isn’t it? But Gobwa was convinced, a twinkle appearing in her eyes as she smiled defiantly.</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes, you’re right. Allow Team Kurenai to seize this opportunity!”</p>
<p>Gobzo, meanwhile…</p>
<p>“Uh, ummm… Isn’t that, like, ignoring orders or something?”</p>
<p>It took a lot of guts to ask Shion that question, but Shion immediately shot him down. “You’re still here?! Either you do what you’re told, or you’ll become the test subject for my latest kitchen delights. Is <em>that</em> the decision you wanna make?!”</p>
<p>The threat was all too real to Gobzo. Whether he was convinced by her arguments or not, he dove straight into battle.</p>
<p>…I can’t say he was wrong. But it was weird. The way the other two framed it, this was now all Gobzo’s fault. Gobwa, as befitting one of Benimaru’s fighters, was always ready for a scrap, which made it easier to convince her. Gobzo, despite his slack-jawed look, was a far more honest, upright person. Unfortunately, that often drove him to say things he was better off not saying, which always blew up in his face. Maybe he had it coming sometimes, but if he did, he never realized it. Still, he seemed pretty content overall, so I opted not to intervene.</p>
<p>“…Are you sure this is all right, Benimaru?”</p>
<p>Benimaru shrugged back. “No, but playing it by ear is sometimes a necessity in battle. Shion, in particular, has a keen instinct for this. She gives orders like that because she senses victory, I think.”</p>
<p>True. I had gone for a more passive approach, asking them to buy time because I thought they couldn’t win—but if we could neutralize this threat with no casualties, no need to go easy.</p>
<p class="space-break">I turned my attention toward the battlefield.</p>
<p>Things were really starting to ramp up. Team Reborn was taking on the remaining fifty paladins, two team members per opponent with one Team Kurenai fighter providing backup. In a full-on battle, Kurenai fell behind the paladins in strength, but not by an insurmountable gap. The paladins were ranked A, but the lower end of A, while Team Kurenai was about as close to A as you could get without crossing the line. With the right support, it could actually turn into a decent fight.</p>
<p>Plus, Kurenai had backup on-site, substituting in if one of their team fell or was growing exhausted. We had all the potion we needed, so the cycle could keep going semi-perpetually.</p>
<p>“What a powerhouse they are,” marveled Alvis. “Imagine, <em>another</em> force of that caliber serving your nation?” Her eyes were not pointed toward Kurenai, but Reborn—battle hardy (immortal, you could say) and ready to fight for as long as it took.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Sufia replied with a nod, “they’re trouble. Not even decapitation can stop ’em. I bet they’d give us a workout.”</p>
<p>They had high praise for Team Reborn, and even I was fairly surprised. The paladins, meanwhile, had no backup support. <em>If this keeps up, we might even have a chance at this.</em></p>
<p>“Yeah, I wasn’t really planning for this, but…”</p>
<p>I vaguely nodded back at them.</p>
<p class="space-break">Shion, meanwhile, licked her lips as she appreciatively watched the battle unfold. I caught a glimpse of the wet sheen on the tip of her tongue. She turned toward me, sensing our presence, and gave us a broad grin. It was hard to imagine it, really, given the mask of terror she gave Gobzo a second ago.</p>
<p>“The plan is working, Sir Rimuru!”</p>
<p>“What are you, nuts? This wasn’t the plan at all!”</p>
<p>“Your praise is such an honor, my lord!”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t praising you…”</p>
<p>“Now, I must go!”</p>
<p>With that, she planted her feet on the ground and took off like a bullet, leaving me in the dust.</p>
<p>“Uh, go where…?”</p>

<p class="tx1">She was like the wind, using her extended senses to weave effortlessly through the twisty trees. The elemental spirits infused her body as she zoomed headlong through the forest.</p>
<p>Upon reaching a clearing, Hinata encountered five high-level magic-born. They had spotted her coming, but their eyes were focused on a much more faraway sight. Following their lead, Hinata spotted her people, the noble paladins, facing what could soon become a bitter defeat.</p>
<p>She painfully sighed, holding in her emotions. The defeat didn’t anger her. What did was the way this whole thing broke down into hostilities so quickly. With battle underway, negotiation could no longer be hoped for. Whatever kind of internal subterfuge was going on with Hinata’s side, that wasn’t Rimuru’s problem.</p>
<p>Rimuru, meanwhile, just stood there, watching the battle as calmly as Hinata. Both of them were quietly thinking to themselves, gauging the forces of their opponent.</p>
<p>On Rimuru’s side were four powerful magic-born, plus a woman in a suit emitting an eerie aura. The two women in front appeared to be lycanthropes, former servants of Carillon, judging by the reports. It seemed likely they were part of the famed Three Lycanthropeers, of the former Beast Master’s Warrior Alliance; their mere appearance drove run-of-the-mill magic-born away from them.</p>
<p>But the other two figures lined up with them were no pushovers, either. On one side of the lycanthropes, there was a dashing figure with red hair and two black horns. On the other was a young blue-haired one with a single white horn.</p>
<p>“The Three Lycanthropeers?” Arnaud promptly whispered to Hinata when he caught up to her. “And are those ogres… No, ogre mages?”</p>
<p>Hinata kept her eyes on them. “No. They’re oni.”</p>
<p>“Oni?”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of them. Monsters whose magical powers put them on the level of regional gods. Some pagan religions even worship them as deities, I read.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. They’re part of the evolution ladder up from ogres, but only a very few of them ever reach that level. But here they are, right in front of us. Consider each one to be a Special A-ranked threat.”</p>
<p>This was demon lord territory, and they were uninvited guests. Arnaud and the others were all too aware of that. Hinata, meanwhile, was worried that even Special A might be selling them short a little. That red-haired one, in particular, seemed to have more force than a would-be demon lord. If they ever came to blows, she would want Arnaud and at least two other commanders on her side—but they had four magic-born, and there were only four Crusader officers to go around. That couldn’t be a coincidence; Rimuru must have arranged the numbers that way.</p>
<p>And then there was the demon lord himself. His presence was overwhelming, nothing like their previous encounter.</p>
<p class="space-break"><em>“I’ll take you on. You and me, in a one-on-one duel.”</em></p>
<p class="space-break">The words flashed back into Hinata’s mind.</p>
<p><em>Yeah… Yeah. You wanted a duel with me, didn’t you? Because you didn’t want any distractions?</em></p>
<p>If that’s what it came to, she at least wanted him to take her life and spare her soldiers. No— She wanted him to win, and win overwhelmingly, then accept her apology.</p>
<p>In secret, without telling a soul, she prepared herself.</p>
<p class="space-break">She noticed the female magic-born in the suit begin to move, letting out a concussive wave of force as she flew toward the faraway Renard. Rimuru was there, watching her go—and when he was done, ever so slowly, his eyes turned toward Hinata.</p>
<p>Their eyes met.</p>

<p class="tx1">Oh, brother. I mean, seriously, oh, brother. But everything was still within what we predicted. No issues so far.</p>
<p>So I turned around. Hinata was standing there, looking cool, collected, not even out of breath. She must’ve been watching the battle, just like I was. Her gaze met mine. We just stood there a few moments, staring at each other. I finally spoke first.</p>
<p>“Well, Hinata, now you’ve done it. I imagine you don’t need to be reminded, but this is my territory. The moment you staged military action within our borders, that was enough to make me assume you’re hostile. I’m a nice guy, but not nice enough to allow you to strike at us first, you know?”</p>
<p>…Which, well, if we got into a “who shot first” argument, then the truth was murkier. But that doesn’t matter! We were guaranteed to lose if they launched a Holy Field, so of course I was gonna send Shion out ahead. If Hinata started whining at me about that, she was barking up the wrong tree.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Hinata calmly replied, “that much I can tell. I have no idea why Renard disobeyed orders, either.”</p>
<p>Talk about shameless.</p>
<p>“Oh, sure. You killed Reyhiem so you could pin the blame on us, didn’t you? And now Farmus’s new king has all the momentum in the world behind him.”</p>
<p>“Killed Reyhiem…?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Archbishop Reyhiem. You called him back there, remember? All I did was give him that message for you. Nothing else.”</p>
<p>For just a moment, Hinata looked thoroughly confused, but beyond that, her expression was a mask of indifference. Her cold eyes drilled into me, sizing me up. She may have been beautiful, but that only added further polish to that numbing look.</p>
<p>“Oh… I see,” she whispered.</p>
<p>“You did get the message, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I did.”</p>
<p>“And this is your answer?”</p>
<p>“Well…not exactly, but you wouldn’t believe me if I said that, would you?”</p>
<p>Not exactly <em>how</em>?</p>
<p>“Oh, I could. But before that, you have to order <em>them</em> to cease hostilities and return home.”</p>
<p>I pointed at the pair locked in combat with Shion. She looked where I was pointing, then softly shook her head.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I can. I think it’s going to be over before I step in.”</p>
<p>Good point. That was…Renard, right? He was the strongest dude on the field, and Shion wasn’t holding back against him. And someone else, too—not quite as strong as Renard, but still up there. I assumed they were both among the Ten Great Saints, but Shion was taking them both on, letting her inner monster shine. <em>Geez. If that’s how thick it’s gotten, we don’t have much choice except to let them duke it out till they’re done.</em></p>
<p>It peeved me a little to accept Hinata’s excuse, but I didn’t think she’d be able to satisfy my conditions.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?!” one of the younger knights shouted with resentment before I could speak. “If Lady Hinata calls our forces back, what will happen to her? You’re the one who called her here; how do we know you won’t do anything to her?!”</p>
<p><em>Sounds like they had no intention of talking this out from the beginning…</em></p>
<p>“Silence,” Benimaru replied. “The only people with permission to speak here are Sir Rimuru and Hinata Sakaguchi. <em>You</em> were not called here. Know your place.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The knight was unfazed. The next instant, a flash of swords erupted in front of Benimaru. One of them, belonging to the knight called Arnaud, was breezily deflected away by a casual swipe from Benimaru’s blade.</p>
<p>“Not a killer blow, was it? A smart choice. If you were intent upon killing me, you’d be on the ground right now.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to get in the way of Lady Hinata’s negotiations. I was just prodding you a bit, although I wasn’t expecting you to react. I don’t want you to have the wrong idea.”</p>
<p>“The only one with the wrong idea is you.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh. How about we continue this conversation away from the action?”</p>
<p>“Very well.”</p>
<p>Arnaud gave him a smile, although I could see a vein throbbing over his temple. <em>He can dish out the trash talk</em>, I thought as they walked off, <em>but he certainly couldn’t take it.</em> Out of the four members of Hinata’s entourage, that Arnaud guy was undoubtedly the strongest. That was why Benimaru chose to take action. Perfect. I was certain Arnaud would occupy him well enough without any murder involved, just like I liked it.</p>
<p>Hinata just watched them go, rolling her eyes instead of trying to stop him. She must have noticed that Arnaud was no match for Benimaru, but she let him go anyway.</p>
<p>“All right,” Alvis said, “you all could use some entertainment, too, no? I would be glad to occupy your time for a while, so we don’t get in Sir Rimuru’s way.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” added Sufia, “I’ve always wanted to test out the might of the Ten Great Saints!”</p>
<p>They set off. Maybe this was their motivation all along; I don’t know. Sufia <em>was</em> kind of a war maniac like that.</p>
<p>“Let me join you.”</p>
<p>“Very well… I’ll take you on.”</p>
<p>The four tramped off. All that remained was Soei and the lone female paladin.</p>
<p>“Shall we?”</p>
<p>“I suppose so,” she said, no doubt reading the atmosphere on the field.</p>
<p>This, um, wasn’t exactly what I had planned. I mean, they didn’t have to physically march off like that. Except for Benimaru, those three pairs acted more like they were pairing off for dates than fighting. <em>You don’t</em> have <em>to exchange blows, guys. Sheesh.</em></p>
<p><em>Besides, I’m fighting a woman myself. The most beautiful one, no less. Not that I’m getting much enjoyment out of it.</em></p>
<p class="space-break">…All joking aside, we were now left fully alone. I suppose this was inevitable.</p>
<p>It was time for my rematch with Hinata.</p>
