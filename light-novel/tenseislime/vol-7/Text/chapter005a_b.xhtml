<p>As these relationships with foreign countries grew, there naturally began to be friction in certain areas. That created a need for the Master Rooks, a division that worked under the more direct control of the Holy Emperor. “I call it a division,” Adalmann said, “but in the beginning, it was a small handful of people. They all boasted tremendous strength and had the right to give orders to the Temple Knights. As a group, they pledged their loyalty strictly to Luminus and the Holy Emperor—even the most powerful consuls in the Papacy could no more than ‘request’ their services, not order them.”</p>
<p>These consuls were the politicians of Lubelius. If not even they could order this division around, they had to be powerful, indeed.</p>
<p>“By the way, my friend Alberto was invited to join this division once. He turned it down so he could serve as my aide in the Holy Church. The Holy Emperor rewarded him with the title of acolyte.”</p>
<p>His jawbone clacked up and down in a show of what I assumed was pride. Alberto was the death knight that gave Hakuro all that trouble, if I recall. He was now just a skeletal fighter, but between his sword skills and possessing a monster’s strength, he’d give anyone a run for their money.</p>
<p>“However, I understand that things are quite different around the group now.”</p>
<p>Oops. Adalmann still wasn’t done talking.</p>
<p>According to him, the biggest difference was the power the Church had acquired; their Crusader paladin corps gave them a much greater say in matters. Papal consuls were now largely picked from the Holy Church’s cardinals, putting them in a much safer position than before. The Seven Days Clergy had a lot to do with that.</p>
<p>When Adalmann was there, this Clergy also worked as consuls, enjoying powers second only to the Holy Emperor. They were ordered to rebuild and shore up the Church’s position, and the changes they enacted created the Church structure we know today.</p>
<p>This Seven Days Clergy sounded kind of fishy to me, though. It sounded like they were the ones who tried to run Adalmann and his friends out of the Church, and he was clearly still no fan of theirs.</p>
<p>Although the Crusaders performed few noteworthy feats under the Clergy’s direction, Hinata’s training had helped them grow into the strongest of knight corps. This was how Lubelius had acquired both the Master Rooks and the Crusaders for itself.</p>
<p>“You seem to know a lot about this, Adalmann. Weren’t you in Clayman’s domain by this point in time?”</p>
<p>Adalmann gave this question a clacking laugh. “The demon lord Clayman saw the Western Holy Church as his enemy. He feared its power to make war and gathered as much intelligence as he could about them. I was a leader in their bureaucracy, so even if he didn’t accept my feedback, he still provided me with the information he had.”</p>
<p>That made sense. Clayman’s near-obsessive wariness had unexpectedly helped us out.</p>
<p>“Please, my lord and savior Rimuru, be careful. Lubelius is home to a group of Enlightened known as the Ten Great Saints, a cabal that even Clayman was afraid of. I must advise you not to let your guard down.”</p>
<p>He also mentioned the Three Battlesages, a group within the Master Rooks that was also Enlightened class. This trio, along with six commander-level knights and Hinata, formed the Ten Great Saints. An Enlightened was a human with powers on the same level as a would-be demon lord, and if they had ten of those, no wonder they kept Clayman awake at night. It seemed pretty likely that Hinata’s four companions on her current journey came from this group. Bringing regular soldiers along would just guarantee their deaths; better to presume that the top brass would be knocking on our door. Plus, if the Temple Knights were being mobilized, it was safe to assume the Master Rooks were, too, along with the Three Battlesages.</p>
<p>“My lord, please allow me as a former Church cardinal to attempt to reason with this Hinata woman! I will gladly convince her to abandon her faith in the Church and turn it toward you instead—”</p>
<p>“Ah, wait, wait. I don’t need any of that, so you can go.”</p>
<p>I put a stop to Adalmann before things got any weirder. In a way, he was even worse than Hinata—once his mind’s made up, there’s no derailing it. Talking with someone like him rarely results in anything useful.</p>
<p>“I see… A wonderful idea.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh… Ah yes, there is always that approach!”</p>
<p>And of <em>course</em> Shion and Diablo loved it.</p>
<p>“What are you two idiots talking about?! If we try to pull that crap on her, things are gonna get even <em>more</em> complicated!”</p>
<p>Talk about being cut from the same cloth. I was starting to wonder if they actually liked more than hated each other.</p>

<p class="tx1">With Adalmann gone, it was time to return to the topic at hand. We had all the info we needed—now to devise some actual policies.</p>
<p>First, I wanted to have some kind of throwaway piece I could use to gauge my opponent’s power. Who would work for that…? I could sense Veldora eagerly staring at me. <em>No, Veldora, not you. That’s too much.</em></p>
<p>“Veldora, you—”</p>
<p>“Ah! Finally, my turn in the spotlight? At your service!”</p>
<p>“No, Veldora. I want you to man our last line of defense.”</p>
<p>“Whaaaat?”</p>
<p>“Did you hear me? The last…line…of defense. Doesn’t that sound cool? You’re the only person I could imagine for the job.”</p>
<p>“Mm, of course, of course. I thought so as well!”</p>
<p>He nodded proudly. Great. Good thing I could corral him before he went berserk on me. <em>Veldora would never lose in battle, but sending him out just wouldn’t be the right thing to do</em>, I thought. I hadn’t given up all hope of talking things over with Hinata, so I couldn’t just whip Veldora out at first sight, or even as primary backup.</p>
<p>With Veldora placated, it was Benimaru who spoke next.</p>
<p>“First, I will announce my assignments for Sir Yohm’s reinforcements.”</p>
<p>Mm. Good. Benimaru was turning into quite the commander. He had gained a lot of experience in that previous battle, and unlike Shion, he wasn’t letting it get to his head any longer. Now he could correctly analyze the data at hand and determine the differences between the two sides. I was still the commander in chief, but by this point, he was better suited for the job than I was. I mean, hell, I didn’t really want that work anyway. <em>Let’s hope that Benimaru can grow into the role.</em></p>
<p>With his loud, deep voice, Benimaru announced the assignments. The reinforcements would consist of one hundred goblin riders, led by Gobta; four thousand troops from Benimaru’s Green Numbers, along with a hundred members of Team Kurenai to lead them (the remaining two hundred Kurenai members would stay back to protect the town), and a hundred fighters from Gabil’s Team Hiryu. That was a force of 4,300 in total.</p>
<p>“…That is all. This will mean fewer troops guarding the town, but we have lycanthropes among our fighters now, as well as Sir Veldora, so I don’t anticipate that being a problem. Any feedback?”</p>
<p>“Whoa! Uh, me?!”</p>
<p>“Is there a problem with that, Gobta?”</p>
<p>“Nnnn…no.”</p>
<p>Benimaru’s eyes were enough to clamp Gobta’s mouth shut. Doofus.</p>
<p>“Hakuro will be the supreme commander of this force, but don’t worry. If anything happens, I will use Spatial Motion to back you up at once. Just keep in mind that there’s a good chance I will be fighting Hinata Sakaguchi myself. This might make it impossible to contact me, so try to follow Hakuro’s orders as closely as possible!”</p>
<p>“Understood, sir,” said Hakuro.</p>
<p>“It shall be this battle, this very battle, where my name will shine!” cried Gabil.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, all right…,” murmured Gobta.</p>
<p>Hakuro and Gabil were raring to go. Gobta frankly worried me a little, but he had a knack for working through crises, so he ought to be fine, I think. Maybe.</p>
<p>“Hmm. I still worry, though. Ranga, are you awake?”</p>
<p>I addressed Ranga, currently sleeping in my shadow. He spent almost all his time in there lately, in part to guard me, but his magicule energy had been expanding in the weirdest way. He probably needed more exercise.</p>
<p>“Will I be deployed, Master?”</p>
<p>“Yep. I need to get you running around now and then, you know? Follow Gobta and keep him safe!”</p>
<p>“I shall! A little wake-up exercise would be very kind to me.”</p>
<p>Weird. I was getting the strangest feeling that unleashing this guy was gonna be seriously bad news. For our foes anyway.</p>
<p>“Oooh, yeah, if Ranga’s joining me, I’ll be totally fine!”</p>
<p>Now Gobta was showing some more enthusiasm. <em>Looking out for number one, aren’t you?</em></p>
<p>“Ranga, don’t take any reckless risks. And try not to kill your opponents, all right?”</p>
<p>“It shall be done! Lady Shion has taught me how to restrain myself!”</p>
<p>“Um, great…”</p>
<p>Now I was <em>really</em> worried. I thought he was just spending all day sleeping in my shadow, but he was doing that, too? Having Shion as his teacher filled me with anxiety, but hopefully it’d work out fine. <em>We’ve got potions, I guess.</em></p>
<p>Benimaru offered no objection, although his eyes indicated he thought I was spoiling Gobta. Thus, with a delighted howl, Ranga curled up next to Gobta. <em>Let’s just hope anyone who crosses him lives to tell the tale.</em> I almost wanted to wish my opponents luck.</p>
<p class="space-break">We had our force assignments. Now we had to discuss the reinforcements Farmus’s new king was receiving.</p>
<p>“So, Diablo, tell me how you intend to proceed.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir. I was expecting reinforcements, but thirty thousand is well beyond my projections. My original plan assumed a force of approximately ten thousand fighting for Edward.”</p>
<p>His new plans began with having Edmaris send a letter to the new king once he began moving these troops around, asking him to explain his actions. Edward was no doubt planning to shift responsibility for the reparations to Edmaris, and I wanted to keep that from happening. The new king would no doubt say that any agreement Edmaris signed was null and void. That wouldn’t pass muster with the Council if Farmus was part of it—it barely did with us, in fact.</p>
<p>No, his plan likely involved executing Edmaris and reneging on his promises to us. We’d then be angered enough to stage a military operation, and then the Western Nations would join together to resist us—that kind of thing. To prevent that, Edmaris had been rescued by Yohm’s squad. He was lying low in Migam at the moment, which was just what we planned. Yohm had a force of about five thousand over there, and the original plan called for us to teleport 4,300 more to Migam for him. That’s not a huge difference, but the psychological effect—the terror of having a brand-new army appear out of nowhere behind the first one—would turn the tables during battle.</p>
<p>But now that Edward had started assembling reinforcements, we couldn’t use that. If we waited for him to get his whole force together, we’d be faced with a four-against-one disadvantage in numbers. The sooner we acted, the better.</p>
<p>“It seems to me,” concluded Diablo, “that Edward is waiting for reinforcements he can use to strike Edmaris’s domain.”</p>
<p>The plan at this point had been to defeat Edward in one decisive battle or another, then have Edmaris endorse the champion Yohm as king instead of reclaiming the throne.</p>
<p>“Currently, Edward has access to a force of twenty thousand,” Soei commented. “Give him three more weeks, and the full force of forty thousand will be assembled. That’s more than enough to take Migam, as weak as its rear guard currently is.”</p>
<p><em>So the longer we wait, the worse things will get. But if we go all out right now, it’s going to be full-on, blood-soaked war.</em> Farmus had already lost twenty thousand troops; a dragged-out war would cause untold damage.</p>
<p><em>So what then…?</em></p>
<p>“…This is just the worst. We could always just give up on this, you know. If I forgive the remaining debt they owe us, we can avoid war that way, right? That’ll eliminate the whole pretense for fighting us in the first place.”</p>
<p>“We can’t! If we do that, Sir Rimuru, you will look like a big pushover!”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t want that, no, but we’ve already profited from this big-time. Wouldn’t it be easier if we just stepped on the brakes and waited until after we’ve handled Hinata to deal with it?”</p>
<p>As far as I was concerned, we were paid more money than I ever expected to see from them. Cutting our losses now would still put us way ahead, and I felt that waging a war on two fronts would be too risky by comparison. Shion did have a point, though. Demon lords have a vested interest in being feared.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh-heh… Abandoning this plan would be unthinkable. Sir Rimuru, you are willing to let me handle this, yes?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but I don’t want people to keep dying on my watch, whether they’re involved with it or not…”</p>
<p>“That will not be a problem. If that is your will, sir, then it is my duty to abide by it. It will be a simple task for me.”</p>
<p>I was seriously considering calling the whole thing off, but Diablo hadn’t given up at all.</p>
<p>“What are you intending to do?”</p>
<p>“I will find the culprit,” he quietly replied. “The evildoer who tried to pin the crime on me.”</p>
<p>Wow. He’s pretty angry.</p>
<p>“‘Destroy the demon,’ they say?” He gave me a little grin. “Well, if they want me eradicated, I will gladly serve as their opponent. Somewhere, among this thirty thousand, there could be someone involved with the culprit. I will give them a <em>gentle</em> interrogation.”</p>
<p>Uh-oh. There wasn’t a shred of gentleness about that. And Diablo sounded like he was ready to take on thirty thousand Temple Knights by himself. Better rein him in a little bit—</p>
<p>“I see,” Benimaru said as I stewed over this. “If you came out to engage them, we’d have nothing to worry about. But don’t kill any innocents, all right?”</p>
<p>“There is no need to remind me. I will never defy Sir Rimuru’s will.”</p>
<p>“Fair enough. In that case, Hakuro, can you suppress the new king’s soldiers without killing any of them?”</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t be a problem. It would be easier to stage a surprise attack to end things quickly, but that would provide no training for us.”</p>
<p>“True. Gabil, we’re going to need a great deal of potion.”</p>
<p>“Certainly! I will be sure it is ready.”</p>
<p><em>Huh? Um, hello?</em> I was being left in the dust.</p>
<p>Shion smiled at me. “Looks like the Farmus invasion is in good hands, Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah… Yeah. Good luck, guys…”</p>
<p>““Yes, my lord!”” they all replied.</p>
<p>With that, the conversation was over. Couldn’t argue with that.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">I didn’t like how that was handled very much, but either way, our discussions shifted over to the next issue—who would handle Hinata and her party.</p>
<p>“So about the party of five,” Benimaru said, looking at me. <em>All right. Time to take the initiative on this one!</em> …But just as I was about to speak, Soei suddenly stood up.</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru,” he said in a strained voice, “we have an emergency. The Crusaders have begun to move…”</p>
<p>The room fell into a panic…or at least, I did.</p>
<p>“Is something up with Hinata’s team?”</p>
<p>“No. Hokuso, monitoring Englesia, reported to me that he sighted a hundred mounted knights departing at this very moment…”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“They are half a day behind Hinata, but at this rate, they will catch up with them before long. They are headed in the same direction, at least, so it seems fair to assume they are coming our way.”</p>
<p>Hinata was moving along at a regular, unhurried pace, although her four paladins had used magic to catch up at full speed before slowing back down. There had reportedly been some dispute among the group when they rendezvoused, but they remained together, a team of five bound for our city. They were still in Englesian lands, headed toward Blumund, but only at a relatively slow speed. If those hundred knights wanted to catch up with them, they could—however, instead of using the highway or another commonly used route, they were reportedly more likely to abandon their horses and take the old path into the forest instead.</p>
<p>“So they aren’t trying to meet up with Hinata?”</p>
<p>“Their motives are unclear. It will take no less than two weeks for Hinata to arrive, and the knights behind her are likely going to take about the same time.”</p>
<p>Soei, who was as confused about this as I was, ordered his force to tail them. We would just have to wait for further reports. Out of the frying pan and into the fire, huh? Except I had the impression we hadn’t left the frying pan at all. I really didn’t like this, but no point whining about it. Things were rapidly changing.</p>
<p class="space-break">My staff began to debate among themselves. I listened in, thinking over my options.</p>
<p>There were five Enlightened to deal with, Hinata included, plus a hundred paladins doing who knows what. This hundred was far more of a threat to us than the twenty thousand members of Farmus’s military—hell, Hinata alone was way worse. That’s just the way things worked in this world. Strength in numbers meant nothing against strength brought to loony extremes. No matter how many nameless Mohawk-wearing punks you lined up in a row, they weren’t going to beat the Fist of the North Star.</p>
<p>I wasn’t planning to go out there alone. That seemed kind of suicidal to me. So…what?</p>
<p>“Why not just kill them all instead of fretting about it?”</p>
<p>I probably don’t need to say who suggested that. Life’s so <em>easy</em> if you never use your brain at all, isn’t it? Just focus on the results; don’t think about whether you can or can’t do something. Of course, that’s probably how she earned that freaky unique skill of hers, but still…</p>
<p>“This would be exactly the kind of thing we could call upon Geld for,” Hakuro noted.</p>
<p>“Ah, he has his own tasks to deal with,” reasoned Benimaru. “We must handle this ourselves, unless there is truly no other recourse.”</p>
<p>I hated to hear that, but they had a point. Should I really be so stubborn about keeping Geld out of this? I mean, we’re only talking a hundred or so people. There was no point deploying a massive force against it; it was already clearly something only our strongest people could deal with.</p>
<p>If I was going to handle Hinata, someone else needed to keep the other four down for me. It’d be great if Hinata agreed to my one-on-one offer, but taking on five people at once by myself was way too risky.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Understood. It will not be a problem. The sole concern is the subject Hinata Sakaguchi.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Um, that’s kind of the problem here, man! Are you feeling all right? You’re starting to seem a lot less reliable than the Great Sage was.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">…</span></p>
<p class="space-break">The whole reason I was stewing over this was because I didn’t want to have anybody killed. If I went with massive numbers to tire out the paladins, victory was assured, but it’d result in tons of casualties. We had all kept ourselves alive and well up to now; it’d be ridiculous to stop that streak now.</p>
<p>But…this was Hinata we were dealing with. She’s <em>seriously</em> bad news. I focused squarely on running away the last time we tussled, but if I had truly tried to fight her, I almost certainly would have been dead. Even though she wasn’t even giving her full effort.</p>
<p>Right now, I was the only one of us who could give Hinata any kind of challenge, and if it was a one-on-one duel, I didn’t think I’d lose. If she was paired with her paladins, though, I couldn’t be so sure. Striding in with too much confidence could get me killed. Those hundred other paladins were another issue, too; how should we handle those? If she just wanted to talk with me, she wouldn’t have taken this many people with her. And given how she was going out of her way to avoid notice, you’d have to be silly not to be alarmed.</p>
<p>“Wait!” Veldora suddenly belted out. “I know! How about I just <em>happen</em> to test out my dragon’s breath when they arrive? We’ll simply pretend it was a misfire and I wasn’t aware anybody was near me!”</p>
<p>“Can you shut up one second? You’re the final defense line, and I mean the really, <em>really</em> final one, all right?”</p>
<p>I swear. He was like a bratty kid sometimes. If Hinata <em>did</em> want to talk, and we pulled a stunt like that, it’d blow the whole thing. There was no telling how much damage that breath would cause, either. It was too scary to think of. It’d be happier for everyone, us included, if he stepped away from the battle. His plan did make sense if we were in this to kill, but I had to know for sure what our opponents wanted first. We couldn’t leave them to their own devices, though, because a few paladins were all it’d take to build another Holy Field over me. They had to be watched but not killed.</p>
<p>Paladins were positioned as the guardians of humankind, protected by the elemental spirits. In this world, monster-based mayhem was no laughing matter. It was a daily threat to one’s life. The paladins Hinata trained grew up knowing that fear, as they patrolled the villages and frontier towns they offered their free protection to. Many people owed their lives to them. The Crusaders held a special place in the hearts of those survivors, along with Luminism. Their strength was top-shelf, each one ranking an A or above, and we’d take serious casualties in a frontal assault.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the problem. Killing these knights, these fighters with the hopes and prayers and anticipation of the weak and helpless heaped upon their shoulders, would undoubtedly be the source of untold headaches to come.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for Luminism’s stance that monsters were the common enemy of humanity, maybe we could’ve talked this out. I hadn’t abandoned that hope, but I couldn’t be too confident that this attempt would work out any better than the last one. To them, we were simply evil, and they didn’t negotiate with evil. And I could understand their thoughts. Some of them must have survived their own villages being destroyed, their parents being killed. Being tricked by the wrong adversary meant the loss of life—not just theirs, but those of everyone who needed protection behind them.</p>
<p>Even now, there were wild monsters causing havoc everywhere. Their numbers had gone down in the lands around Tempest, but in other realms, they were still appearing from the woods and going berserk. If we wiped out the paladins, who would keep the countryside safe then? If you think about it that way, I wasn’t so sure we should just wipe all these guys out.</p>
<p>If Hinata had just opened up and <em>talked</em> to me last time, there wouldn’t even be this whole misunderstanding. Sadly, though, she didn’t. Because I’m a monster. She was stubborn like that—stubborn enough that, even after that message I sent, she brought a whole force along with her.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Concern. Some factors seem unnatural about that. There is likely a high possibility this paladin activity goes against Hinata Sakaguchi’s desire.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Huh? So there</em> is <em>room to talk, then?</em></p>
<p>If I put my foot down and declared her an enemy, there were a million and one ways I could defeat her. But as long as I didn’t know what they were up to, it was all but impossible to figure out our best move. There were a few reasons for that, but if I had to pick one, I guess it just comes down to the fact that I didn’t want to kill Hinata. Shizue was worried for her, too, and now that I had taken on her will, I didn’t want to resort to violence.</p>
<p>Ugh! And this was all because of how headstrong she was. So annoying.</p>
<p>Either way, though, if talks failed, we wouldn’t avoid a fight. If that was how it turned out, we were at a disadvantage, really. We were dealing with an anti-monster expert, nobody we could afford to trifle with, and I was certain that I wanted to avoid casualties on either side.</p>
<p>We would need to assume the worst in our approach, no matter what they did. If talking didn’t work, I wanted it to be a duel between Hinata and me. That was exactly what my message said, so that shouldn’t be a problem. They might be considering a more full-on battle, but if they were, they were gonna do it on my turf.</p>
<p>If we could spring a trap or something on them, that could buy time enough for me to defeat Hinata. It was a pain to think about, but it had to be done.</p>
<p>“All right. I’ve got it sorted out. We need to consider the future here, and along those lines, I want to do our best to avoid killing any of the paladins as well.”</p>
<p>That was the direction I wanted to go with—assuming talks failed, of course—and it ignited some more debate among my staff. It’d be a terrible waste if we took casualties of our own in an effort to avoid hurting them. We had to work out the best possible approach, and the surest way was for me to beat Hinata and break the paladins’ morale. As a result, our primary focus was earning as much time for me as possible.</p>
<p>“So why don’t we just slash ’em all up and silence them that way?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I was joking,” Shion said with a cough. <em>Is she really all right? The way she acts alarms me almost as much as Veldora.</em></p>
<p>“Basically,” she continued, “you want to maintain the battle, without killing any paladins, and without losing anyone on our side. In the meantime, you will defeat the enemy’s leader. Am I right, Sir Rimuru?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. That’s what it is. I’m glad you get it.”</p>
<p>Oh, so she <em>did</em> follow me. I was seriously worried for her sanity for a moment there. And if she got it, I was sure the rest of my staff did. But just when I breathed a sigh of relief, Shion confidently beamed at me.</p>
<p>“In that case, I have an idea!”</p>
<p><em>Uh-oh.</em> I began to feel anxious, for reasons I couldn’t put into words.</p>
<p>“…What is it?”</p>
<p>“There just happens to be exactly one hundred members in Team Reborn, the group I lead. They would certainly be up to the challenge. I’d like them to engage the paladins!”</p>
<p>She looked defiantly at me.</p>
<p>“What are you, crazy?! Team Reborn’s only about a C-ranked threat level! They’re <em>not</em> gonna be up to the challenge—no!”</p>
<p>I wanted to know where Shion’s confidence came from. They may have matched numbers-wise, but in terms of strength, it was like night and day.</p>
<p>“…There are some issues with that suggestion, yes, but I think it would be an effective idea.”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it was Benimaru who defended her. Everyone in Team Reborn had the extra skill Complete Memory, which made them hard to kill with regular attacks. It was unlikely, he said, that our foes would break out their worst, most soul-crushing attacks on the first salvo against a weaker force. As he put it, their weakness “would put the paladins off their guard, giving us a hole to plunge through. If buying time is what we’re looking for, they might actually be well suited for that.”</p>
<p>He was starting to convince me. If the paladins didn’t have any way of directly attacking the souls of their foes, Team Reborn would even be at an advantage. It could make things a lot easier than if we sent any other force their way.</p>
<p>“Benimaru is right!” Shion bellowed. “And also, Sir Rimuru, I have been carefully training them all. They have successfully acquired Cancel Pain, of course, and they also resist poison, paralysis, and sleep. When it comes to tenacity, at least, they won’t lose out to anybody. Hakuro said so himself.”</p>
<p>Hakuro was nodding at her. It must’ve been the truth, but I thought I’d check to be sure.</p>
<p>“How did they acquire those resistances, by the way?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>Her reply surprised me. Apparently, she asked Kurobe to make them all weapons that inflicted their targets with status ailments, then had them use those weapons while training against each other, building up their natural immunity. They were largely immortal, so they’d never go easy on their sparring partners, and it was so hard to knock them out entirely that battles tended to last forever with them. In the simulated fights they carried out, it was more a matter of “whoever’s left standing is the winner.”</p>
<p>“And if Team Reborn is in danger, Sir Rimuru, I can send Team Kurenai in to help them out. Are you up for that, Gobwa?”</p>
<p>Benimaru was talking to the large, attractive-looking ogre guarding the door for us. She came over to me, kneeled, and bowed her head to us both. This Gobwa was the squad leader of Kurenai, apparently. She must’ve been a goblin at the time I gave that name to her, but you’d never believe it now—at this point, she was an elite officer, dressed in a striking scarlet-red uniform.</p>
<p>“Sir!” she said, puffing out her chest. “I have been training our squad just as hard as Lady Shion has. Please allow us to serve your needs on the field, Sir Rimuru!”</p>
<p>Her eyes were sharp, giving her a strong presence. She was also an A rank, maybe higher, which made her at least as strong as Soka. <em>I guess Benimaru’s been raising some real talents of his own.</em></p>
<p>“They may not be an even match for the paladins,” Benimaru said, “but my fighters are talented, indeed. Two of them could engage one of the paladins long enough to allow Team Reborn time to escape.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous! My team can neutralize the paladins all by themselves!”</p>
<p>They started bickering. Both of them were certainly ready for a fight, at least. Maybe it’d be worth leaving this job to them.</p>
<p>“All right. Shion, I accept your offer. Gobwa, you handle the rest.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes sir! Gladly!”</p>
<p>Gobwa’s cheeks reddened as she replied. It must’ve been exciting for her, which was fine by me. It’d be more ideal if I didn’t need to use them at all, but regardless.</p>
<p>“Remember, Shion, don’t send them out until we’re sure that the talks are a nonstarter, all right?”</p>
<p>“That’s fine! But if our foes make any suspicious moves…”</p>
<p>Yeah, that’d be a different story. I forgot about the need to interfere with them in advance, lest they toss a Holy Field our way.</p>
<p>“If they try anything funny, don’t be afraid to hold back then. Check with me via Thought Communication first, then take action!”</p>
<p>“Roger that,” Shion replied, giving a satisfied nod as Benimaru ordered Gobwa back to the door.</p>

<p class="tx1">So we now had Team Reborn assigned to delay the Crusaders and Team Kurenai providing emergency backup, about three hundred people against a hundred paladins. I was happy with that. Now we just had the question of who would handle the four saint-class paladins accompanying Hinata.</p>
<p>First off, who among us was powerful enough to handle them? By my estimation, the group included Veldora, Ranga, Benimaru, Shion, Soei, Geld, Gabil, Diablo, and me. Hakuro had the sword skills to keep up as well, although his magical strength wasn’t quite up to everyone else’s level. Shuna… I wasn’t sure. A magical fight was one thing, but against a close-range expert, I didn’t like her chances. The Ten Great Saints were reportedly on a level with a pre-ascended demon lord or Orc Disaster; that’d be a lot to ask from Shuna.</p>
<p>So counting Hakuro, ten people. I was handling Hinata. Veldora was out of the question—I didn’t want him going out of control on me, so he could focus on town defense. I mean, for all we knew, there could be yet another enemy force on the move that we hadn’t noticed yet. We needed our defense to be as solid as possible. Geld, meanwhile, I didn’t want to bother if I could help it.</p>
<p>I wanted to have Diablo, Ranga, Hakuro, and Gabil focus on Farmus, not this fight. Which left:</p>
<p>“So the only people I have free are Benimaru, Shion, and Soei, huh?”</p>
<p><em>Ideally, I’d like one fighter per adversary, but I was short one body. So now what?</em></p>
<p>“I will join the battle, of course,” Benimaru said. This was exactly why he let Hakuro lead Yohm’s reinforcements. I couldn’t have him miss this one.</p>
<p>“I will stay as well,” Soei added. “My Replications can handle my intelligence duties well enough, and Soka and the others are proving fairly useful by this point.”</p>
<p>“Me too!” shouted Shion. “As your secretary, Sir Rimuru, I will forever remain by your side—”</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Report. If there is an Enlightened-level fighter among the hundred paladins, attempting to buy time with them may prove impossible. It would be safer to devote some of your war power to them as well.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Ohhh. Yeah, there’s always that concern, too. Thanks for the actual useful feedback!</em> I knew I could rely on Raphael.</p>
<p>“Hang on, Shion. There’s something I want to ask Soei first. Do you know if there are any Enlightened among the paladin force, separate from Hinata?”</p>
<p>Soei closed his eyes for a few moments. “My apologies,” he replied. “All of them are at least an A rank, but none particularly stood out from the pack in my perception.”</p>
<p>With monsters, it was pretty easy to figure out, what with the way they let their aura hang out all casually. The stronger they were, the more you could <em>feel</em> it from them. But with (for example) Hinata, she didn’t feel different from any other human being. I couldn’t pick her out at all, which was what made her strength so surprising. Ah well. We’d find out quick enough in battle <br/>anyway.</p>
<p>“Just in case, I want Shion to monitor the group of paladins. We’ll have her command both the Reborn and Kurenai groups. Is that all right, Benimaru?”</p>
<p>“If that is your decision, it is not a problem at all, Sir Rimuru. Soei and I can each engage two of Hinata’s companions.”</p>
<p>Talk about confidence. To Soei, this all seemed perfectly natural.</p>
<p>“One moment, Sir Rimuru,” said Rigurd. “Perhaps this would be a good opportunity for me to join in? I am content with arranging our political system around town, but even I want to smash some heads sometimes!”</p>
<p>“In that case, I, too, am available,” added Shuna with a smile. <em>Look, you aren’t suited for close-quarters combat, all right? It’s gonna be too dangerous for you.</em></p>
<p>“And so am I. I don’t want Gobta to hog the spotlight forever!”</p>
<p>Now Rigur was throwing his hat in the ring. He and Rigurd were both past the A rank, but neither was anywhere near demon lord status. It would be throwing their lives away.</p>
<p>“Hang on, hang on. I think this is a little too dangerous for you all.”</p>
<p>“But we don’t have anyone else, do we?”</p>
<p>“With us involved,” Benimaru said, “that will be more than enough.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” countered Rigurd. “I know your team is powerful, but it would be best not to underestimate our foes, wouldn’t it? Allow Rigur and me to take this responsibility…”</p>
<p>The debate was starting to heat up. All this worrying might be for naught if a fight didn’t break out in the end, but I wanted to tackle this with as much confidence as possible. If we were going to pull out all the stops with this, maybe we should call back Geld after all, just for that one day.</p>
<p>I was pondering this as I tuned out the endless debate my staff was having when there was a loud noise on the other side of the door.</p>
<p>“I told you,” I could hear Gobwa say, “we are in the middle of a meeting—”</p>
<p>“Yes, and we want to be part of it!”</p>
<p>“Stop being so belligerent, Sufia. Come on, lady, all we want is to repay a favor we owe him, okay?”</p>
<p>It was Sufia and Alvis, two of the Three Lycanthropeers. The door was finally opened to them.</p>
<p>“Hey. Sorry to barge in. I saw that bony dude runnin’ around just now, but what’s up with that? We wanna join in, too, Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“Demon Lord Rimuru, please forgive our sudden visit. Sufia is being rude as usual, but we truly to seek to support you. Please, allow us the chance to repay the favor you gave to us.”</p>
<p>The two of them were in front of me, kneeling. Well, not <em>directly</em> in front of me, since Gobwa was still trying to drag them out by the ear. Benimaru raised a hand to stop her, finally allowing them to approach—but now it was Diablo standing between them and me. Benimaru seemed to trust them as well, but either way, a few people here were kind of antsy about them being close to me. Diablo, in particular, eyed them with open suspicion. If I ordered him to, I’m sure he would’ve chopped off their heads in an instant.</p>
<p>Sufia and Alvis contrasted starkly with each other, but on this point, they were two beastmen of the same mind. They pushed their way in here, knowing it would offend, and asked me to let them help out. The cold treatment from some of my staff was something they seemed to expect.</p>
<p>“Benimaru, Diablo, both of you, step back.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>As they returned to their seats, I had chairs set up for Sufia and Alvis. After a few moments to ensure everyone had calmed down, I continued.</p>
<p>“So you want to help us?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir Rimuru. We are dealing with some of the Ten Great Saints here, right? It seems you need someone to stop them in their tracks, and we want to be the people who do that for you.”</p>
<p>“Yes! Combat’s pretty much the only thing I can do, y’know. We’ll never be able to repay our debt to you otherwise. Please, use us freely!”</p>
<p>I thought about this. Force-wise, this was not a problem. But if either of them got hurt, how would I ever explain it to the (ex-)demon lord Carillon?</p>
<p>“Are you sure you can volunteer for that without Carillon’s consent?”</p>
<p>“Of course! Lord Carillon is always quite tolerant of things like that.”</p>
<p>“And our lord seemed concerned about repaying his debt to you as well, Sir Rimuru. If we don’t step up here, I am sure he would lecture us about it.”</p>
<p>Hmm… Frankly, I appreciated this offer a lot. Having these two around would put my mind at ease quite a bit for the battle.</p>
<p>“I agree,” Benimaru added. “I believe we can trust them.”</p>
<p>“When I’m gone,” Shion asked, “will you be able to eliminate anyone getting in Sir Rimuru’s way?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” Sufia casually replied. Those two did seem to get along pretty well with each other—and I wasn’t hearing any no votes.</p>
<p>“Can you do it?”</p>
<p>“You can count on us!”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your kind words!”</p>
<p>I hated to rain on Rigurd’s parade when he was all revved up like this, but I needed someone to lead the people in town. When it came to fighting, I didn’t have complete confidence in him, either. But with Sufia and Alvis on our side, we couldn’t be much better prepared for Hinata and her forces.</p>
<p class="space-break">It was hard to call what we had cobbled together a “strategy,” but either way, we had something to work with. Now my staff was discussing the details with one another, checking to make sure there weren’t any holes in our plan.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and tried to guess at Hinata’s behavior again. Raphael’s calculations told me this approach was the most likely way to avoid casualties. You could say that I had nothing to worry about, but I was still hung up on a couple of issues.</p>
<p>One, this whole thing would be so much more in the bag if I either gave up on conquering Farmus or called Geld back here. I was going through with this anyway for reasons I suppose you could call purely egotistical. That was why I had to aim for a complete, flawless victory.</p>
<p>If Hinata agreed to talk, then fine. If not, we’d duel it out, one-on-one. We were fully prepared for that scenario, albeit with one considerable pitfall: What if I lost? Then everything would be meaningless. Raphael seemed to have little doubt about my victory, but if I blew it, that would tank this entire operation. Could I really trust Raphael’s calculations? I had a suspicion that Raphael tended to err on the side of overconfidence, and it wouldn’t be the first time, either. It believed too much in me—it wasn’t overrating my chances, was it?</p>
<p>I couldn’t banish that thought…but I had to do this. <em>That’s how it’s always been, and that’s how it always will be. Whether I fully believe in myself or not, all my friends certainly do. I just have to stop wavering and press on.</em></p>
<p>“I’m going to say this one more time. If, at any point in this battle, it looks like we’ll have trouble keeping ourselves afloat, I want you to immediately focus on annihilating the enemy. The lives of our allies have to take first priority. You need to understand that all this means nothing if any of you get yourselves killed. I expect everyone to make it through this alive, just as we always do. Dismissed!”</p>
<p>“““Yes sir!!”””</p>
<p>If we were too reluctant to pick off a paladin, and it got one of our friends killed, it’d make all of us look silly. I wanted to be sure everyone was fully aware of that. Seeing them all voice their agreement, I reciprocated with a satisfied nod.</p>
<p>Now to wait and see what Hinata tried.</p>

<p class="tx1">The journey to Tempest was proceeding along well for Hinata.</p>
<p>A quick trip through the transport gate was all it took to go from Lubelius to Englesia, but from there, she had to do it the normal way—and without any replacement horses, so frequent rest breaks were a must. She was used to marches like this, so she kept her own gear to a bare minimum. One horse and a sleeping bag, which she kept filled with emergency rations, a pot, and so forth.</p>
<p>The trails weren’t blocked by snow or anything, but the seasonal weather still precluded her from making this trip with haste.</p>
<p class="space-break">She had rendezvoused with four of her paladin subordinates soon after departing. It had been a surprise at first, hearing hoofbeats from behind and spotting four familiar faces—Arnaud, Bacchus, Litus, and Fritz, her paladin commanders. Renard, the vice captain, was holding the fort while Hinata was gone, and since having all the commanders away from Lubelius at once was not an option, they drew lots and picked Garde to stay behind.</p>
<p>“…What are you doing?” she had asked them.</p>
<p>“We would ask you the same question, Lady Hinata. Attempting to get a head start on us?”</p>
<p>“A head start on what? I am merely going there to talk.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come now. You know, you sound less than convincing given how clearly you are equipped to wage war.”</p>
<p>“Yes! And we have no interest in standing atop your sacrifices. Our glory comes only when we serve under you.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. And besides, that message didn’t insist upon you traveling alone, did it?”</p>
<p>Hinata rolled her eyes and sighed. “I know, I know. But this is a demon lord, all right? I’m the one who riled him up. This is <em>my</em> problem. You have neither any responsibility nor any involvement in it. Return to our homeland at once.”</p>
<p>But Arnaud and the others ignored the order. She was eventually forced to say “Whatever” and allow them to join her.</p>
<p class="space-break">The road this band of five chose was maintained, but it had seen better days. Inns were sparse along the way, and at this time of year, no-vacancy signs were a frequent sight. They would be forced to camp out, and even though they weren’t running into monsters, camping out in the cold of winter with nothing but emergency rations took its toll on Hinata and her companions.</p>
<p>By the time they reached Blumund ten days later, they had exhausted a worrying amount of their strength. They decided the time was ripe for a night indoors, for a change.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">“This town has certainly changed,” Arnaud said after the five of them each rented their own room and assembled down at the dining hall.</p>
<p>Hinata felt the same way. Litus had said as much in her report, but seeing it with her own eyes made the difference exceedingly obvious.</p>
<p>After changing and resting up a bit, they decided to go explore town. The markets were packed with people, despite the winter weather, and all sorts of strange and unfamiliar merchandise was available. The backward country atmosphere Hinata felt the last time a mission brought her here was now considerably weaker.</p>
<p>“And did you see the people? So much more variety to the clothing around here now. Some of them had the kind of fancy outfits you normally only see in Englesia.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and those weapons and armor… I think some of it is monster-derived. Real high-quality stuff circulating.”</p>
<p>Arnaud and Bacchus had trouble believing their eyes. Hinata could see why. It wasn’t up to the standards they enjoyed as paladins, but everything they saw was almost <em>too</em> upscale for a small country like this. And all the merchant stalls! In a world where many shops closed for the winter season, the sheer number they saw was an extreme rarity. If they were open, that must have meant customers were around—and <em>that</em> must mean that, even in winter, this little backwater town was entertaining large numbers of merchants and adventurers.</p>
<p>“Is this Tempest’s influence at hand?” Fritz asked, gauging Hinata’s response as he did. All this development must have come after trade relations were opened up with Tempest. That was the only reason he could think of. It also meant that large numbers of people in this town were not only ignoring the teachings of Luminism, but actively flouting them.</p>
<p>“All this prosperity,” whispered Litus, clearly shocked, “by doing business with a <em>demon lord</em>?”</p>
<p>Hinata, deep down, had to agree with her. This wasn’t normal. For <em>him</em>, though; for someone like Rimuru who came from the same land as her, maybe this wasn’t so strange at all.</p>
<p>For example, the menu on the wall of this dining room.</p>
<p>“Have you decided?” an attractive waitress asked them.</p>
<p>Hinata was ready for her.</p>
<p>“I’ll have the ramen, please.”</p>
<p>“The ramen! That’s been gaining an audience lately. It comes in miso, shoyu, and <em>tonkotsu</em> flavors, each available in a lighter or thicker broth. Do you have a preference?”</p>
<p>Six types in all. This wasn’t some misunderstanding. Ramen, here, definitely meant the meal she was familiar with.</p>
<p>“<em>Tonkotsu</em>, please, on the thick side. And one side of <em>gyoza</em> and rice to go with that.”</p>
<p>“Excellent! You certainly know your food, ma’am, if this is your first time here. And you guys?”</p>
<p>Her companions watched in awe as she ordered without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Um… The same.”</p>
<p>“M-me too…”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“And I, as well.”</p>
<p>None of them knew what any of it was, so they just followed their captain’s lead.</p>
<p>“Lady Hinata, could you tell us what this…ramen is?”</p>
<p>“You <em>do</em> know, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It… Well, it might be a tad difficult for you guys to eat.”</p>
<p>“““What?!”””</p>
<p>Tension raced across the table.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I only think it will take some practice before you can eat it correctly.”</p>
<p>Hinata was just worried about the chopsticks. Did Arnaud and her other compatriots know how to use them? Did anyone in Lubelius, for that matter? Her friends, meanwhile, were now scared Hinata had made them order something on the level of monkey brains.</p>
<p>After a short wait, the bowls came out. It was ramen, no doubt—a nostalgic sight for Hinata, a totally unfamiliar one for the rest of the table.</p>
<p>Brushing her hair back with one hand to keep from dunking it in the soup, Hinata picked up a pair of disposable chopsticks, snapping them apart.</p>
<p><em>They’re even the kind you break… Is</em> this <em>what they’re focusing on?</em></p>
<p>Could Tempest really popularize chopsticks so quickly that they were already spreading to their neighbor countries? It unnerved her a bit, but the steaming ramen in front of her diverted her attention.</p>
<p>She put her hands together in a small prayer before picking up a <em>renge</em> ramen spoon off the stack and sampling the soup. It was definitely <em>tonkotsu</em> pork broth, on the thicker side. She had no idea where they got the dashi soup stock from, but it perfectly re-created the heavy, flavorful taste she remembered.</p>
<p>Then she picked up some noodles, brought them to her mouth…and half spat them back out.</p>
<p>“Are you all right?!”</p>
<p>Arnaud stood up. “Was it poisoned, Lady Hinata?!”</p>
<p>“Quiet. Just calm down and eat.”</p>
<p>Hinata picked up some noodles again—this time, placing them on her spoon and blowing on them a bit first. She wasn’t used to food served at this temperature. It was almost cutesy of her, especially given her usual frigid demeanor, but she was too focused on the noodles in her mouth to care.</p>
<p>Good body. Good taste. The savory broth had soaked into the noodles well. It was excellent. She never thought she’d taste this again, but it was a perfect re-creation.</p>
<p>Silently, Hinata concentrated on her meal, Arnaud and the others carefully watching her every move. Soon, they tried imitating her.</p>
<p>“…Agh! Hot!”</p>
<p>“Mmmm! Wow, what is this?!”</p>
<p>“The soup’s great, too!”</p>
<p>“Incredible! I’ve never eaten anything like this before…”</p>
<p>They were struggling mightily with their chopsticks as they challenged themselves to the ramen, but their reactions were like nothing Hinata expected. To them, whose diets revolved around the staples of hard bread, salty soup, and fresh salads, this ramen opened up an entire new universe of taste. It was a revolution for their taste buds.</p>
<p>And look at this rice! This rice they ordered simply because Hinata did. It was a perfect accompaniment to the ramen, growing sweeter in the mouth the more you chewed on it and filling your stomach in the most satisfying way. And the <em>gyoza</em>… Oh, the <em>gyoza</em>! The contents spread across your mouth when you bit into them, the aroma wafting all the way up your sinuses. It was a symphony of flavor, played by a large variety of ingredients and performing in exquisite harmony with the rice.</p>
<p>“This is so good!” Arnaud half shouted. “I can’t believe this!”</p>
<p>Compared with the portable rations of the last ten days, this was heaven. It wasn’t long before a single <em>gyoza</em> dumpling remained. Fritz’s chopsticks began to drift toward it…only to be deflected away by Hinata’s with a dry <em>tssh!</em> sound.</p>
<p>“That’s my prey, Fritz. I wanted to save it for last. No stealing.”</p>
<p>Fritz felt a shiver go down his spine. She was playing for keeps.</p>
<p>“S-sorry, Lady Hinata. It was just so good, I couldn’t help myself…”</p>
<p>“You could always order another plate,” an appalled Hinata replied—and right on cue, her four companions began shouting for the waitress. But then, tragedy struck.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry, guys, but that was the last of our supply for the day.” The waitress delivered the devastating news. “You know, this ramen is actually a new offering from us. We only started serving it last week…and just between you and me, I heard it got its start as a fervent request from the demon lord for his dinner. There’s a merchant named Sir Mjöllmile who’s one of the bigger names around this town, you see, and he purchased this ramen directly from the demon lord himself. Can you believe that? It’s not selling that well yet—it’s pricey, and there’s kind of a learning curve—but once you try it, you just can’t get enough!”</p>
<p>Considering this was “just between you and me,” the waitress was loud enough to be clearly heard across the entire dining hall. The act fascinated Hinata; no doubt she was instructed to advertise it to her regulars like that. Building a faithful base of repeat customers would allow them to create more of it in bulk, establishing it as a full-fledged product. She could spot a few people in the hall curiously eyeing her table. Watching her consume that bowl so expertly probably made them want to try it themselves.</p>
<p>She took in the last of the soup as they chatted.</p>
<p>“Thanks. That was very good.”</p>
<p>Hinata paid for the meal and stood up. Her companions, seeing this, scrambled to slurp up the remainder of their soup.</p>
<p>“No rush. I’m just going back to my room. Also, here’s a word of advice: If you drink all the soup, too, you’ll gain weight.”</p>
<p>Litus was the only one who stopped eating.</p>
<p>“Huh? But… You did…?”</p>
<p>“I’m naturally skinny.”</p>
<p>And with that warning, she left. She could feel Litus’s hateful gaze pointed at her, but she was too happy and sleepy to turn back around.</p>
