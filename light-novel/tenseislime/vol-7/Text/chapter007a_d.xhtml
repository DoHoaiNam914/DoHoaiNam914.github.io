<p class="space-break">For the remaining forces, Gabil promised not to pursue them further if they retreated, an offer that General Gaston immediately accepted. Word was quickly sent to the battered and bruised forces still attacking the town gate.</p>
<p>So ended the siege of Migam before it really began. And as he left the scene, Gaston could be heard shouting “Beat <em>them</em>? How could we <em>possibly</em> beat them?!”—a quote that became far more famous worldwide than he probably intended.</p>

<p class="tx1"><em>Come on, Grigori…! Come on! Get over here!!</em></p>
<p>Saare couldn’t have wished that any harder for himself. But he was in luck—Grigori <em>was</em> coming, draped over Ranga’s back. In fact, Saare’s wish was about to come true in just a few more moments. Grigori probably wasn’t going to provide the services he was looking for, but for Saare right now, ignorance was bliss.</p>
<p>Besides, he reasoned, this Diablo was just too ridiculous a demon to deal with. Here he was, one of the most powerful human beings on the planet, and not even he could fully plumb the depths of this guy’s force. There was no doubting Diablo now. He really <em>was</em> more powerful than the demon lord Valentine. Why would he bother going out of his way to kill Archbishop Reyhiem? A few well-planted threats from Diablo, and he could get literally anyone to worship the ground he walked on.</p>
<p><em>So why did I even have to deal with this…?</em></p>
<p>Saare was still expending every effort possible to fend off Diablo’s barrage, but he knew the end was near. His endurance, and his mental acuity, were about to be exhausted.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh… Come on. Put in some more effort. Show me an interesting skill or two.”</p>
<p>And the demon was gleefully enjoying the sight, too. Saare just wanted to cry. From the bottom of his heart, he wanted to go home.</p>
<p>He had been praised as a genius. He was long-lived, thanks to his elven blood, and his dauntless effort helped him sharpen his fighting style to a fine point. His reward for this was the unique skill All-Rounder, which let him fully understand and acquire an opponent’s art after seeing it only once. It worked on the same principle as Hinata’s Usurper, just geared specifically toward arts.</p>
<p>It went without saying that actually using these arts required superior physical ability. Saare knew that well, and thanks to that, he had mastered a wide variety of skills, including complex magic/arts combinations that were among the trickiest moves out there to perform. Adding magical effects like that to his own aura unlocked access to some incredibly powerful sword slashes. Thus he preferred to use Spiritslash, a basic Battlewill move and also the ultimate way to enhance one’s physical ability. To this he would add whatever element his current foe was weakest against, letting him unleash a strike that could rip through almost any enemy.</p>
<p>That was a source of pride to Saare—and none of that worked here. Before he could even deploy the magic, Diablo analyzed its structure and disassembled it. It robbed Saare of his ability to bend the laws of nature—and without that, there would be no miracles today. Instead, giving up on magic, he opted instead to just fight with the Battlewill art Aura Sword.</p>
<p>“Dammit,” he bitterly whispered.</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing about all this was how Diablo wasn’t even seriously trying yet. He could tell. The difference in magical skill alone was like comparing a grown adult to a newborn. The same was true in physical strength. Only in tactical skill, something that could be learned on the battlefield and nowhere else, could Saare safely consider himself close—but even then, Diablo was already closing the gap within the space of this fight. The speed of his growth was dizzying. If he wanted to, Diablo could’ve easily killed Saare right now.</p>
<p><em>And if he’s not, that must mean…</em></p>
<p>Diablo had no intention of ending his life. Which meant that someone else out there must have killed Reyhiem. But who?</p>
<p><em>Yes. Hinata never wanted to be involved with all this, and the incident occurred after she left—as if aiming for that exact moment. It’s so…</em></p>
<p>…so suspicious. Wait. Not even suspicious. It <em>had</em> to be the Seven Days Clergy behind this. Saare was sure of it. And just then:</p>
<p>(Saare, we’ve come to give you aid.)</p>
<p>(Rejoice! We shall destroy this demon together!)</p>
<p>(Hold the demon back for us. Our magic will take care of him.)</p>
<p>The air warped behind him as Saare felt a new presence, one bearing a stupefying amount of force. They were the members of the Seven Days Clergy—three of them in all—and despite the way they put it, the magic they were attempting to cast was far too dangerous to use in this space.</p>
<p>A good criminal always knows how to destroy the evidence. And in this case, the “evidence” was anyone who knew that Diablo didn’t kill Reyhiem. Which included the journalists on hand. They weren’t idiots—many of them had come to the same realization as Saare by now. It was the whole reason Diablo kept them around.</p>
<p>So if the Clergy wasn’t aiming for Diablo at all…</p>
<p>“Run! Get away!!”</p>
<p>Just as Saare turned toward the press and gave that warning, a massive fireball engulfed the entire area.</p>

<p class="tx1">A white-hot bolt of force penetrated Hinata’s chest.</p>
<p>Hurriedly, I came over to help her up.</p>
<p>“Hey, you all right?”</p>
<p>“Ngh… Gaaah!”</p>
<p>She was coughing up blood. But through the pain, she still brought a hand to her chest, attempting to cast a spell. It failed—as it would, given that she couldn’t speak any longer. Instead she eased herself down, lying limp in my arms. The blood from her began to stain my clothes a bright shade of crimson.</p>
<p>Unless I did something, Hinata was going to die without ever knowing what happened. We could work out the timeline that led to this later. I took a potion out of my Stomach and sprinkled it over her chest. But while this would normally begin the healing process immediately, now—of all times—nothing happened.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Understood. The subject Hinata Sakaguchi possesses high resistance to magic. Her body automatically disassembles magicules, neutralizing their effects.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>It cancels out magic?</em></p>
<p>“M-magic won’t work on Lady Hinata,” her assistant Arnaud said, shaking his head as he ran up to me. “Any recovery magic has to be holy in its alignment, or else it will be neutralized on contact…”</p>
<p>Ah. So holy magic, which didn’t work through magicules, was okay? A lot of good that did me. These potions were useless, then. In that case…</p>
<p>“In that case, don’t just stand there. Cast some holy magic on her!”</p>
<p>We needed something more effective. Hinata was still alive. If we used holy magic to heal her, she ought to be able to recover.</p>
<p>After I shouted at them, Arnaud and the other paladins began to act. But they couldn’t move. Something was blocking them—a ring of light, binding all the paladins. A group of people, each bearing a huge amount of power, had used a high-level teleportation spell to jump into our area, restraining Arnaud and the rest.</p>
<p>The two mystery visitors kneeled before me.</p>
<p>(Demon Lord Rimuru, it is a pleasure to meet you. We are members of the Seven Days Clergy, and we have come here to punish Hinata Sakaguchi for violating our orders…)</p>
<p>It sure was brazen of them.</p>
<p>Hinata was on the ground, barely conscious; Arnaud and the other paladins were all tied up; and then these guys show up. And I had heard of the Seven Days Clergy before. Adalmann didn’t seem to appreciate them too much. <em>Very</em> suspicious. I wanted to learn more from them, but things were kind of urgent right now.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what’s going on with you guys,” I said, trying to sound as annoyed as possible, “but don’t get between Hinata and me. We already settled things between ourselves, so I’m not gonna let her die.”</p>
<p>The Clergy raised their arms up high, making their disagreement clear. (Unfortunately, we must insist. Hinata, the woman there, has ignored the will of the god Luminus. This is blasphemy, and we must issue divine punishment in response.)</p>
<p>The gall of these guys. They teleport right into my backyard and think they can just say anything they want.</p>
<p>“B-but…!”</p>
<p>“Please, forgive Lady Hinata! She had her own motivations for this…”</p>
<p>The Clergy had no interests in the pleadings of the paladins.</p>
<p>“Don’t give me that crap!” one of them suddenly shouted. “You tricked all of us, didn’t you?! You wanted Lady Hinata dead from the start!”</p>
<p>This was the captain of that band of a hundred, the one who’d faced off against Shion. Then, suddenly, things began to get a little hectic…by which I mean, the paladin standing next to him took out his sword and plunged it into that captain’s body.</p>
<p>“Wha—? Garde, y-you…” the captain gasped.</p>
<p>“Such insolence, Renard. I refuse to allow you to speak so ill of the Seven Days. You were conspiring with the rebel Hinata all along, weren’t you? You’re the one who tricked us!”</p>
<p>The shouted accusation created a stir among the rest of the paladins. They had no idea who was telling the truth, I figured. That was how much political power this Clergy must’ve had over them. But that wasn’t true, was it? I mean, that heat beam or whatever came from Garde’s direction. Which meant…</p>
<p>…Well, it meant I had no idea what to do next. Things were so chaotic, there was no hope of putting them back in order. I wanted to take Hinata back from the brink of death, but the Clergy was in my way—and now Renard was betrayed by his own men and in mortal danger himself. And then the Clergy says they want Hinata dead for defying them, although they don’t seem to be hostile to me.</p>
<p><em>So now what…?</em></p>
<p>Job one was to save Hinata. Shizue asked me to, for one, but beyond that, I think we were just a few steps away from working everything out with each other. If we could make up, I figured that could lead to friendlier relations with both the Western Holy Church and the nation of Lubelius. Abandoning her was never an option for me.</p>
<p>“Look, I’ll hear all of you guys out later. This is my nation, and you need to follow my laws while you’re here. Um, you’re Arnaud, right? Cast your healing magic on Hinata now.”</p>
<p>My nation didn’t have laws, really, but I still had executive power, and I meant to wield it. But the Seven Days Clergy wasn’t impressed.</p>
<p>(We cannot allow that. The followers of Luminism have sworn absolute allegiance to the god Luminus. Even if the demon lord Rimuru wishes it, no one here will execute your request.)</p>
<p>They were keeping all the paladins from doing anything. It was <em>so</em> annoying. There was no time to try reasoning with them. I thought about forcing the issue—but just as I did, Diablo sent me a Thought Communication.</p>
<p>(Sir Rimuru, I have an emergency report—)</p>
<p>(What is it? Keep it short; I’m kind of busy.)</p>
<p>(Pardon me. I have discovered Reyhiem’s killer. It is a group known as the Seven Days Clergy; they appear to have devised all these events behind the scenes.)</p>
<p>(Hohh…)</p>
<p>(I am faced with three of them right now, and I fear that leaving them alive might cause harm for us later—)</p>
<p>(Can you provide evidence that they’re the killers?)</p>
<p>(We have a press corps full of journalists from around the world here as eyewitnesses, my lord.)</p>
<p>(…All right. Permission granted. Rub ’em out.)</p>
<p>(Yes sir!!)</p>
<p>What impeccable timing! Diablo definitely earned a nomination for Most Valuable Butler with that show. I had no idea how he had engineered this to work out so well, but I guess I had the right man for the job.</p>
<p>This solved a lot of riddles on my end. So the Seven Days Clergy were the bad guys here? Their motives were unclear to me, but I guess they were after Hinata, not me. They wanted her dead, presumably because she’d be trouble for them alive—and since she’d be too formidable a foe for them, they had hatched a scheme to turn the rest of the world against her.</p>
<p>The dude who just stabbed the paladin Renard must have been connected to them, too—or maybe he was a Seven Days member himself—but either way, this Garde guy was the real hit man here. He must’ve wanted a clean kill, but performing the crime right in front of me was a mistake. My Universal Detect was in operation, so doing the deed with me around was like shouting “I’m the killer!” as you pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>I suppose these were the guys who fiddled around with my message for Hinata, and I had to assume they interfered with Diablo’s plans, too. These were the culprits, and no one else—and now that I knew that, I didn’t have to worry about hurting my relationship with Lubelius.</p>
<p>This was <em>my</em> nation.</p>
<p>Originally, I had thought it best to leave them alive, but they had been a thorn in <em>my</em> side as well. I didn’t see much need for that now. If they were going to run on me, let’s just kill ’em off instead.</p>
<p>So leaving Diablo to take care of his own business, I began to take matters into my own hands. Time to let off a little steam.</p>
<p>“Benimaru! Soei!”</p>
<p>““Sir!”” they both shouted.</p>
<p>“Capture those two. If they resist, take any measures you deem necessary.”</p>
<p>“Just what I was waiting for!”</p>
<p>“As you wish, Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>Benimaru and Soei came for the Clergy, who immediately shot me a pair of dirty looks. I didn’t let it bother me.</p>
<p>“Shion!”</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord!”</p>
<p>“You take care of Garde over there for me.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Watch out. He might be a Seven Days guy in disguise.”</p>
<p>“I see! Then let me show him the deepest pit in hell and expose him for what he is!”</p>
<p>She gleefully readied her massive sword. This time, I didn’t stop her. Hell, I was <em>hoping</em> to see that sucker.</p>
<p>(Heh…heh-heh… Well, look at this!)</p>
<p>(Are you quite sure? It will mean all-out war against us.)</p>
<p>Those two could babble all they wanted. If I let them be, it’d be even more trouble for us later— And if I was gonna take action here, better make it count.</p>
<p>“Sorry, guys, but you went too far. I guess you tried pinning the blame for Archbishop Reyhiem’s murder on me, but I’ve seen right through all that. If you’re picking a fight with me, I assume you know what’s coming for you, yeah?”</p>
<p>The paladins exchanged confused looks. A few of them, at least, seemed to see things my way. Arnaud, meanwhile, with an enraged expression, already had his sword pointed at the Clergy. But the pair didn’t look daunted. In fact, they were laughing in our faces.</p>
<p>(Heh-heh-heh! I didn’t think we would be found out.)</p>
<p>(Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! But the Saint is already dead! Demon Lord Rimuru, you and Hinata both exhausted your strength in that battle, didn’t you?)</p>
<p>(We wouldn’t dream of missing this golden opportunity!)</p>
<p>(And if all of you know the truth as well, you will die with your demon lord!)</p>
<p>At least they weren’t making any more excuses. The Seven Days Clergy fully admitted to it, laughing the whole way. Such a vulgar display. It almost made me sick. There was no value in keeping them alive at all.</p>
<p>Benimaru, Soei, and Shion each sized up their prey. But it turns out the Clergy was craftier than I thought.</p>
<p>(Fools! I commend you for exposing us, but everything has already been accounted for.)</p>
<p>(We planned to kill all of you from the beginning!)</p>
<p>(Heh-heh-heh… Let us begin!)</p>
<p>With that, the two of them leaped back and floated into the air. Garde joined them, revealing his true colors before Shion could reach him. Then, with the three of them grouped together, they constructed a large-scale magic circle on the ground. This was dangerous—certainly beyond what a human of regular intelligence could handle, and certainly something that required advance preparation. Inside this circle was us, two of the Three Lycanthropeers, and the paladins. They intended to kill us all and make sure no evidence ever saw the light of day.</p>
<p>“Hellflare!!”</p>
<p>“Demonwire Slash.”</p>
<p>Dark pyres of flame shot out toward the trio, accompanied by a torrent of Sticky Steel Thread powerful enough to break through sheet metal. But the only sound anyone could hear was high-pitched laughter.</p>
<p>(Ridiculous! You waste your time! This magic circle deflects all non-holy strikes! Any magical attacks from evil creatures like yourselves could never penetrate it!)</p>
<p>(Wah-ha-ha! Such utter fools. Our knowledge has been built and refined over centuries. It will never lose out to the brute force of some arrogant monster horde!)</p>
<p>The laughter echoed above us, but I was too busy keeping Hinata alive. She had a temporary heart, made from my own body, but it took up a ton of magicules. I wasn’t used to pulling this off, and it wasn’t exactly a very compatible donor organ for her, so it wasn’t working as well as what I concocted for Mjurran.</p>
<p>Then Shion charged forward, ready to push all my concerns away.</p>
<p>“Shut up! That means nothing in the face of my Goriki-maru Version 2!!”</p>
<p>She wasn’t making much sense, but she made a mad dash for the Clergy, muscle memory winning out over her brain. It would have struck most people as idiotic. But Shion was on another level today.</p>
<p>(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! You imbecile! What could that sword possibly—?!)</p>
<p>There was an audible ripping sound, out from the air in front of the sneering Clergy.</p>
<p>(N-no!)</p>
<p>(She’s going to break down the magic circle?!)</p>
<p>(So be it! We must release it now!!)</p>
<p>Shion’s nonsensical attack was pure brute force, something that didn’t care much about elements or attributes at all. In addition…</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Understood. She appears to be using Guarantee Results, part of her Master Chef skill, to alter the space around her.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>This is just crazy. I can only hope she doesn’t start using that stuff on me.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Report. While the possibility is slim, the subject Shion’s attack might be effective against you as well.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Aw, crap, really? Better make sure I never piss her off again.</em></p>
<p>This had taught me all over again how amazing she was, but sadly, even that couldn’t stop the Seven Days Clergy’s attack.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Report. Attack incoming.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">Their broad-range annihilation attack was complete. <em>Crap. What should I—?</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Report. It is not a problem. The magic circle has already been analyzed.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">The cool, refreshing voice of Raphael calmed my frayed nerves. Okay, uh, great. No problem at all, then. This magic circle looked kind of complex to me…but ah, I guess it was child’s play to the wise master here. I hated to dent the Clergy’s confidence and all, but I guess a riled Raphael could still outwit them.</p>
<p>(((Prepare to meet your doom! Trinity Break!!)))</p>
<p>Three voices chanted in unison to launch the spell. But all that effort was already in vain.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Report. Relaunching the ultimate skill Belzebuth.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">Just as the professor reported that to me, Belzebuth swallowed up all the droplets of murderous light raining down from above. In a moment, they were all gone. Yikes. Set this thing to full blast, and it was a real monster. Even the paladins stared wide-eyed at me, shocked at the sight of all those missile blasts disappearing before their eyes.</p>
<p><em>But…wait a second. Didn’t I “sacrifice” Belzebuth when I fought Hinata just now?</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Understood. The ultimate skill Belzebuth, Lord of Gluttony, was indeed sacrificed, but a copy had been backed up, so it was not a problem to reactivate.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Huhhh? Backed up?</em> And why was Raphael using the past tense there? You gotta <em>tell</em> me about this crap, man! I thought I had lost that thing forever. The professor acted like this was all settled history, but I wasn’t sure I was willing to accept that.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Report. Rise in holy force detected. Main attack incoming.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Oops. That last strike wasn’t the main one?</em></p>
<p>(((Face your ruinous end, demon lord! Trinity Disintegration!!)))</p>
<p><em>Whoa, crap! Belzebuth ain’t gonna cut it now.</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1">Report. It is not a problem. Invoke Absolute Defense from the ultimate skill Uriel, Lord of Vows?</span></p>
<p class="extra-indent"><span class="wl1">Yes</span></p>
<p class="extra-indent"><span class="wl1">No</span></p>
<p class="space-break">Hey, hey! There’s the professor I know. That’s another yes, but… Hang on. Again, something didn’t seem right.</p>
<p>But even as I pondered this, the first Absolute Defense wave activated—a single, thin, transparent layer covering my skin. This was all it was—and this was all it took to perfectly disable Trinity Disintegration.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Right. Yeah. That’s the thing. That was definitely the first time I used that move. I had been using Multilayer Barrier up to now, not Absolute Defense.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of my Mind Accelerate speedup, I finally asked Raphael the question on my mind. <em>Hey. Why didn’t you activate that earlier? I could’ve blocked that strike on Hinata with that thing!</em></p>
<p>The response was enough to push my frustration to the brink.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Understood. This is because the ultimate skill Uriel’s Absolute Defense may still be penetrated by spiritual particles on occasion. As a result, it was determined that invoking it would be meaningless.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">Raphael made it sound like common sense. <em>I swear, you don’t have to be such a perfectionist about this stuff…</em></p>
<p class="space-break">The behavior of the spiritual particles that magicules were made of was apparently difficult to predict. They ignored time and space as they moved around, cutting straight through well near any barrier. The near-random elements that controlled their movements—the forces of nature that governed over these particles—made it impossible for Absolute Defense to handle them, unless you knew how they worked.</p>
<p>And yet, here I was, perfectly safe after that barrier just trounced Trinity Disintegration. What’s up with that? Did Raphael fully predict things this time?</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Understood. In the previous Meltslash attack, Belzebuth both canceled out the strike and invoked Predation on it. This made it possible to gather enough information to successfully recognize the random elements involved. As a result, it became possible to predict and defend against holy attacks. In addition, you have also obtained the holy sword skill Meltslash.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">Hmm…</p>
<p><em>What? Wait. Waaaaaaaaaiiiit. Huh? So you mean you sucked up Hinata’s sword on purpose back there?</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">……</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Dude, don’t clam up on me, you bastard! I can totally picture you reacting like “Oh no, Rimuru got me” just now! Your silence is telling me everything I need to know!</em></p>
<p><em>Although… Wait a second. I know Raphael isn’t the type to take dangerous risks, but…could I have, like, survived a Meltslash blow without having to cancel it out with Belzebuth?</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Understood. Of course. You lost a great deal of magical energy, but your material body could have been instantly reconstructed with Infinite Regeneration.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>…So what were you so freaked out about? You didn’t just want to consume Meltslash so you could analyze it, did you?</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">……</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Oh, more of that, huh?</em> Bastard’s getting better and better at dodging my questions. More…malicious, you could say, or humanlike. You could tell me the guy was a living being, and I think I’d believe you.</p>
<p>But…I dunno, I suppose I would’ve wanted it, yeah. Wanted to withstand that attack, wanted to use it myself… Did it take that moment of desire to act upon it that quickly? What a crazy ability I had. It almost felt like it was going to waste on a bum like me.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Negative. I exist only for the sake of my master.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Pretty fast replying to that one, huh? Pfft. Thanks. Keep up the good work, partner! Just try not to keep any secrets from me.</em></p>
<p class="space-break">Thus, within the dilated time Raphael and I bickered with each other, our entire conversation ended in a single real-world instant.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">(No! That couldn’t… No!!)</p>
<p>(It is impossible. Such a ridiculous feat should never happen!)</p>
<p>(There could be no creature in this world who could withstand a direct blast of Disintegration…)</p>
<p>And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>All three of them were mightily confused, and…y’know, I could see why. Even <em>I</em> thought it was kind of freaky, and I allegedly cast it. The ultimate in holy magic, cast in triplicate no less, and I blocked it like a spit wad. If I were them, I probably wouldn’t want to accept it, either.</p>
<p>But that’s reality for you. It’s what you get for making me—or, I guess, Raphael—your enemy.</p>
<p>“All right. Now it’s our turn.”</p>
<p>Benimaru, Soei, and Shion nodded.</p>
<p>“Your fancy magic circle seems to have disappeared,” Benimaru said, a ball of flickering black flame in his hand. “Think you can withstand this a second time?”</p>
<p>The Seven Days Clergy visibly recoiled at the sight of this. Their hand was fully played, and they had nothing left to counter with.</p>
<p>Shion flashed a fearsome smile as she sized up her prey. “You can’t escape us, you pile of garbage. Prepare to die!”</p>
<p>Soei was silent, watching the Clergy’s movements with an unblinking eye. Alvis and Sufia, the Lycanthropeers, were watching over the paladins, making sure none of them stepped out of line. There were unlikely to be any more real threats among them, but no harm in being sure. Not like any would-be assassin among them could do much of anything now.</p>
<p>(Ngh…)</p>
<p>The Seven Days trio had now been herded into a single location. But they still refused to give up.</p>
<p>(Think this over carefully! We are the guardians of humankind! If you kill us, the followers of the god Luminus will not take it sitting down!)</p>
<p>(Exactly! Luminus’s rage will burn all of you to ashes!!)</p>
<p>(We will step back this time. Now that we know you are not evil, I am sure talks will proceed smoothly with the Western Nations. You will be good neighbors to each other…)</p>
<p>With a mix of intimidation and flattery, they deigned to negotiate with us. This was really starting to piss me off. It was time, I thought, to end this—</p>
<p class="space-break">“…I seem to have caused quite a lot of trouble for you, Demon Lord Rimuru.”</p>
<p class="space-break">—but then a cold, bracing voice echoed over us as a massive gate appeared, cutting through the air. The door opened, revealing a beautiful young woman. Between her unique silver hair and her heterochromatic eyes, there was no mistaking it—she was the demon lord Valentine herself, and I probably didn’t need to ask why she came.</p>
<p class="space-break">(Gahh!)</p>
<p>(My… My lady…?!)</p>
<p>(What are you doing in a place like this…?)</p>
<p>The Clergy visibly withered in her presence, cowering in fear. Then they kneeled before her.</p>
<p>Well, then. I guess Valentine was actually the god Luminus this whole time. The realization struck me dumb.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Diablo, almost shaking with glee, let out an evil laugh.</p>
<p>(…All right. Permission granted. Rub ’em out.)</p>
<p>With those simple words from Rimuru, he had full permission to do as he pleased. He wanted these fools eliminated as quickly as possible, yes, but before that, there was some business to take care of.</p>
<p>He turned toward the press corps. “Now, everyone, are you all right?”</p>
<p>The fireball was blocked by the barrier Diablo built, keeping all the journalists unscathed. This barrier also kept all the demon hunters, as well as King Edward and his knights, safe from injury. Nothing based on magicules, including aspectual and spiritual magic, could penetrate it.</p>
<p>(Tch. Annoying little demon. You are capable of that much…?)</p>
<p>(A fearsome foe, indeed. It is time to show off our own holy force…)</p>
<p>(Prepare to launch!)</p>
<p>The Clergy, expecting to wrap this whole thing up in a matter of seconds, had to be surprised. No matter how powerful this demon was, destroying his physical body would eliminate any influence of his on this world. The moment he could no longer maintain his magical form, it was back to the spiritual realm for him.</p>
<p>Anticipating this, the Seven Days Clergy launched an ultimate-class magic the moment they arrived—Nuclear Flame, part of the nuclear family of aspectual magic. Three people were required to carry it out, the force of it being too much for one, and it rained unquenchable hellfire upon its target. Against Diablo, however, it was powerless.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed, the Clergy quickly opted for their final weapon. Defeating someone as powerful as Diablo required holy force, and nothing else. Their minds made up, they decided to bring out their finisher—Trinity Break. It was the same move their compatriots tried against Rimuru, and while it took some time to prepare, they could be protected by a barrier during casting, keeping them safe. What’s more, the Trinity Disintegration launched at the end of this spell was the most powerful of all holy magic, capable of reducing anyone and anything to its composite cells. No matter how great the monster or magic-born, from demon lords on down, this attack could never be resisted.</p>
<p class="space-break">It was thus with total confidence that the Clergy uncorked this spell…just as Diablo began negotiating. Not with Seven Days, but with the press.</p>
<p>“Did you see that attack?” he gently asked. “It seems clear to me that they made an attempt on your lives, didn’t they?”</p>
<p>Even Saare, enemies with Diablo until a moment ago, couldn’t deny it. The journalists certainly didn’t. They all nodded their understanding. The guardians of humankind, the great heroes, the Seven Days Clergy of legend—everyone there knew of them. Diablo was telling the truth; they were sure a moment ago that they’d be breathing their last. The Clergy would bury them all, Diablo included, and then they’d pin the blame for it on the demon.</p>
<p>“But there is no need for alarm. I will protect you all.”</p>
<p>To the crowd, Diablo’s smile looked like the reassuring countenance of a benevolent god. They believed him. If he was powerful enough to shrug off a Battlesage like Saare that easily, beating the legendary Seven Days didn’t seem so fantastical, either.</p>
<p>“What, what do you want from us…?”</p>
<p>“Oh, money?”</p>
<p>Some among the press worried about what Diablo would desire in return. Demons never work for free—they always demand something back, and Diablo was no different. He’d never provide a service for no reason, unless he was doing it for Rimuru.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh… I appreciate your understanding. I seek only one thing from all of you…”</p>
<p>His demand, given with a smile, was this: Report his innocence to the world. The journalists, hearing this, breathed a sigh of relief. They were expecting a cruel, merciless demon, but the truth was something else entirely.</p>
<p>If Saare, one of the chief officers in the Holy Empire of Lubelius, was caught up in the Clergy’s dragnet, it meant that group had to be conspiring on an impossibly high level behind the scenes. The journalists were being used, too, and once they knew that, there was no reason to turn down Diablo’s request.</p>
<p>“Of course! Let us spread the word far and wide!”</p>
<p>“Yes, we will write whatever you want! All about your glorious deeds!”</p>
<p>“That we will. So please! Please, help us!!”</p>
<p>There were nearly a hundred members of the press there, and all of them promised their loyalty. The unique skill Tempter was faithfully doing its work on them. Betrayal would not be forgiven. The pact had been forged.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh… Very well. Then I promise to save all of you…but <em>not</em> you.”</p>
<p>The demon pointed at Edward, only now recovering from his fainting spell.</p>
<p>“Wh-why?! What did I ever do—?”</p>
<p>“Silence!” he spat out. “You openly mocked the great Sir Rimuru, a crime worth a thousand deaths. It is time for you to realize that saving you is worthless.”</p>
<p>Edward racked his hazy mind for some way out, but none came. The only thing for certain was that, if things kept up, he was going to die. He looked toward his knights; they averted their eyes. Defying the will of a monster like that, or the heroes of legend, was not conducive to their health.</p>
<p>“Please… Please, if you could, allow me to live…”</p>
<p>All that remained was to attempt a teary-eyed round of begging. It failed to bend Diablo’s heart.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh… Feel free to continue lamenting your foolishness as you depart this realm.”</p>
<p>None of the press lifted a finger to help Edward. What could they do? Edward was the cause of all this in the first place; nobody was going to step in for him now and face that demon’s wrath.</p>
<p>The king, realizing this, started crying. “I’ll give you everything. My money, my position… My, my throne! I’ll abdicate and give you everything…”</p>
<p>Diablo paused, apparently giving this offer some serious thought. “Come to think of it,” he said, lightening his tone, “the hero Yohm is guarding Edmaris at the moment, is he not? I believe he is the only one qualified to truly lead the land of Farmus, but what do you think of that?”</p>
<p>Edward knew that. His mind, racing at speeds higher than he ever felt in his life, was sure of that.</p>
<p>“I—I agree with you! He has great potential. I would gladly announce him as my successor…”</p>
<p>The answer was a source of great satisfaction for Diablo. The journalists could sense it as well. A couple of them even began to laugh.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha… The birth of a hero king, is it?”</p>
<p>“This is the news of the century…”</p>
<p>Diablo nodded contentedly. Now the table was set perfectly. A few of the details had gone awry in his plan, but the results wound up more than satisfactory.</p>
<p>Now all that remained was to sweep up the garbage.</p>
<p class="space-break">The time had come.</p>
<p>(Hmph. Are you ready for this?)</p>
<p>(In just a few more moments, a rain of light will cleanse this realm of evil.)</p>
<p>(Enjoy what few remaining seconds you have left to—)</p>
<p>The Clergy had been watching these events from afar, assured that their upcoming spell would win the day for them. What arrived instead was a single moment of despair.</p>
<p>“Am I ready for what, exactly? Don’t make me laugh, you scum. You meddled with my plans and shamed me in front of Sir Rimuru—both serious crimes. You will taste the fear and despair I felt many, <em>many</em> times over.”</p>
<p>There wasn’t a trace of a smile on Diablo as he regarded the Seven Days. His face was expressionless, the beauty to it only adding to the fear factor.</p>
<p>(Wh-what…?)</p>
<p>(What are you saying?)</p>
<p>(Have you lost your mind? This spell could never—)</p>
<p>The Clergy was cut off by a snap of the fingers—and then the world was enveloped in horror.</p>
<p>“Enjoy the sensation of powerlessness in a crumbling world! …Moment of Despair!!”</p>
<p>This was Diablo’s power, taking advantage of Tempting World—one skill in the Tempter repertory. Normally, it worked directly on the target’s subconscious to affect their mental state, but Diablo had improved on it. It let him materialize a virtual world for its hapless victim, then exercise absolute control over that world. Diablo could even dictate who lived and died in this virtual realm—and then, with the help of the Truth Twist skill, he could switch out that pretend world for the real one. The phantoms and monsters crafted by him would take on real form in the physical plane.</p>
<p>It was as unfair a skill as it was inhumane. Breaking out of it could only be done with sheer willpower and a well-trained spiritual body—but almost nobody could defeat the spiritual life-form of Diablo in that contest, and not even the Seven Days Clergy was an exception.</p>
<p>(What, what is this?!)</p>
<p>(Our, our magic is disappearing?!)</p>
<p>(N-no…)</p>
<p>The three of them struggled in abject surprise, but there was nothing they could do. The clock ticked on their personal hell—and after a short while, their world collapsed.</p>
<p>“Enjoy reflecting upon your foolishness in the deepest pit of hell…”</p>
<p>It was time for the final flourish—End of the World, the final snuffing out of the Tempting World he created, taking everything inside with it. It swallowed up the Seven Days Clergy’s full despair, taking it all the way to the final second…</p>
<p class="space-break">…and then the promises made in this battlefield were safely carried out.</p>

<p class="tx1">Having the demon lord Valentine, er, Luminus show up was kind of a surprise, but now someone else was coming through the door. This was the so-called Valentine from Walpurgis, right? The stand-in for Luminus?</p>
<p>The three Clergy members here paled in his presence as they kept kneeling before Luminus. They had no interest in fighting any longer, trembling like lambs waiting for their judgment. So what would Luminus do? The way she apologized for causing me trouble, I suppose she wasn’t here for a fight, either.</p>
<p>But then the former stand-in opened his mouth. “Stand back,” he commanded, his voice projecting far and wide. “I am Louis, the Holy Emperor, and the presence you see here is our god—Lady Luminus!”</p>
<p>The paladins promptly fell to their knees. It reminded me of a certain retired lieutenant general—not that I said that to anyone. Instead, we decided to watch what would unfold, as confused as we all were about it.</p>
<p class="space-break">But…a demon lord serving as a god? What kind of a joke is that? And that stand-in was the Holy Emperor? The propaganda getting thrown around was so ridiculous, I hardly knew what to make of it. Thinking about it, though, maybe this was the most effective way for her to position herself…</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Affirmative. It would allow you to create the most efficient environment for ruling over the species of humanity.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">Hmm. Yeah. But I wasn’t suggesting we copy that, all right? Don’t let me be misunderstood on that. Otherwise, I was scared of what Raphael might decide to try next.</p>
<p>“…Hinata,” Luminus said as she approached her knight, still cradled in my arms. “I told you to restrain yourself, but you decided to venture here anyway…”</p>
<p>She lifted a hand into the air.</p>
<p>“May your heart be revived. Resurrection!”</p>
<p>This was Resurrection, the miracle of god, in action. Before my eyes, the hole from Hinata’s back to the left side of her chest began to close up. This was even faster than my own recovery potion. Which…</p>
<p><em>…Wait a sec. Why did a “demon lord” wield holy energy like this?!</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><span class="WL">Understood. The “miracle of god” refers to the efficient utilization of spiritual particles. These particles cannot be intervened with normally, but I have discovered a way to do this. This will be analyzed later…</span></p>
<p class="space-break">I didn’t really get Raphael, but I guess the wise master had a nice new project to tackle. That guy’s so helpful. Let’s leave the job to it for now.</p>
<p>“Nn-nnhg… Master…?”</p>
<p><em>Oops. Hinata’s back awake.</em></p>
<p>“Hey. Quit babbling,” I said. “What’s this ‘master’ talk? Who—?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but needle Hinata a little. It was funny to me. None of her usual grimness. She looked almost innocent now. <em>She got summoned to this world during her high school years, right, and now she’s spent the past decade or so here? That put her at around—</em></p>
<p>—but before I could finish the thought, her eyes bored into me, just as icy as I remembered.</p>
<p>“…You.”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am.”</p>
<p>“You weren’t thinking something rude just now, were you?”</p>
<p>“No, not at all.”</p>
<p>“Oh. All right. So how long do you plan to cling to me?”</p>
<p><em>Cling? She makes it sound so dirty. I was helping her this whole time, too.</em> But now didn’t seem like the right time to complain about it, so I better just shut up and apologize. Sometimes, as you learned over time, losing was the best way to win.</p>
<p>“Oh, excuse me! Not that I minded it particularly!”</p>
<p>Hinata jumped away from me. Then she looked down at her chest. There was a hole in her clothing, revealing the pale skin below.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Crap. She wanted to kill me with every fiber of her body now. Did I step on a landmine there?</p>
<p>“Has anyone ever told you,” she asked as she glowered at me, “that you’re completely tactless?”</p>
<p>“<em>You’re</em> the one staring daggers into me right now. Why do you have to be so stubborn? You never listen to people!”</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to mouth off like that. <em>That</em> was a mistake. Hinata’s beauty turned into a mask of angry rage. I could hear her give me an exasperated <em>tch</em>. But she simply took a breath, bottling it up, and flashed me a smile—which was scarier, in a way.</p>
<p>“…Look. I’m just shortsighted sometimes, that’s all. You <em>are</em> tactless, aren’t you? I bet you had trouble getting dates your whole life.”</p>
<p>Her words pierced straight through my heart. A critical hit! <em>Shut</em> up<em>, lady! Quit making me remember my forgotten past!</em></p>
<p>“I—I did not! People thought I was considerate and reliable!”</p>
<p>“Oh? Well, great,” she replied, giving me a look of pity as she chuckled. <em>God, I hate her. Right at the end, she beat me good.</em> I won the battle, but now I felt like such a loser. And, oh, wait, I never declared victory anyway…</p>
<p class="space-break">Leaving me to deal with my shock alone, Hinata used her own healing magic to take care of Renard. <em>Her</em> spell did a hell of a job as well. I thought Luminus might’ve helped him out, but she couldn’t have cared less. I guess she’s the type to pretend people didn’t exist if she wasn’t interested in them. <em>Hang in there, Renard. Guess he’s got it worse than I do, in a way.</em></p>
<p>By healing Hinata, Luminus had restored the paladins’ confidence in her. Some of them knew the Holy Emperor Louis’s name, too, and none seemed to question his presence here. Seeing Renard come back to life sent up a cheer among the troops, many shouting “Lady Hinata!” and crying their eyes out.</p>
<p>She punched out one dude she caught staring at her chest, though. <em>That’s Hinata for you. Can’t let your guard down. What’s she talking about, being shortsighted? It’s not like she didn’t have Magic Sense on all the time. But I guess she was particularly sensitive to the wandering eyes of men, huh? Better be careful. Kinda too late for me, but…</em></p>
<p class="space-break">After the commotion calmed down a bit, Luminus slowly opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“Now… Seven Days Clergy, what excuse do you intend to make for this?”</p>
<p>We all looked on, wondering how she was going to handle this. Then I got another message from Diablo.</p>
<p>(…The job is complete, Sir Rimuru.)</p>
<p>(Good. How did it go?)</p>
<p>(Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh! All according to plan.)</p>
<p>He sounded pretty happy with himself. Guess there were no more problems on his end.</p>
<p>(Excellent. Report back here to me once things settle down.)</p>
<p>(Yes, my lord. I look forward to it.)</p>
<p>Diablo closed the Thought Communication and went back to work. I guess he was no longer blamed for that murder, then—which meant I didn’t need to intervene in how Luminus decided to handle these Clergy guys. They were certainly a pain in the ass, but she had just apologized to me for it. Any further meddling would just complicate matters. Better just sit here and think about how to improve our future relations.</p>
<p>As I thought that, Luminus made her decision. She was judge, jury, and (as it turned out) executioner.</p>
<p>“I sentence all of you to death. At least allow me to guide you to your end by my own hand…”</p>
<p>(Have—have pity on us!)</p>
<p>(It was only for your sake, Lady Luminus…)</p>
<p>(I swear by our years of faith to you, please…)</p>
<p>They clung to her in the most pathetic way. She didn’t let them for long.</p>
<p>“…Death Blessing!!”</p>
<p>She spread her arms wide, and then the hand of an unseen god wrapped itself around the Clergy. It was, I suppose, one final act of pity for her servants.</p>
<p>A warm embrace of pity is all I could call it, but apparently it was much crueler than that, turning the living into the dead as it did. It was my first glimpse of the extent of Luminus’s power.</p>
<p>Thus, painlessly and all too easily, the Seven Days Clergy, who had attempted to trap us all in their cruel schemes, met their end. It came so quickly, I have to say. And here I was bracing myself for full war against the Holy Empire. Instead, it was now time to negotiate our future relations.</p>

<p class="tx1">It wouldn’t do to stand around outside like this, so I decided to change locations, staging a sort of victory march back to town as I guided Luminus, Louis, and Hinata along.</p>
<p>Soon, I spotted Veldora back in town—and then I remembered.</p>
