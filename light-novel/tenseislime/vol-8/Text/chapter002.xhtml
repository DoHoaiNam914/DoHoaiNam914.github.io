<p class="noindent"><a id="page-15"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Things became much, much harder after all that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">Getting everything settled was more exhausting for me than fighting Hinata—a fact I made sure remained a closely guarded secret.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">What had happened? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">Well…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">.........</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">......</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Luminus, the single god worshipped by the Western Holy Church, was none other than the demon lord Valentine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">Her real name was Luminus Valentine all along. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">She had been using a trusted confidant as a stand-in, giving him her name, Valentine, so he could fully play the part of demon lord in her stead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4">That, of course, was all in the past, now that Veldora had so breezily blown her cover at the last Walpurgis Council.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">The Crusaders, the team of paladin knights led by Hinata, stood in opposition to the demon lord Valentine, which earned the Empire the support of the general public. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">The entire setup was wholly contrived, something Hinata knew all along—but whatever rational sense the arrangement made, why did she go along with it?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“It was out of my hands,” she said, sighing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">“Lady Luminus defeated me when I tried to put a stop to things myself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">Not that she was much interested in the people’s support in the first place…”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-16"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">She must have sensed my skepticism. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">Reluctant or not, apparently Hinata was incapable of defying Luminus’s will. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">She did, however, extract a promise from her that no civilians would be harmed in the process. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.4">As long as she stuck to that, Hinata was willing to hold up her end of the bargain.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">But as the man who was with her then explained, this ploy wasn’t Hinata’s doing in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">“No, I was the one who came up with the plan. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">My brother Roy was all for it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">Lady Luminus had little to do with it, and Hinata was so against it at first that she tried to take us all down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.4">If anyone has an issue with it, they should complain to me, not her.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">This was Louis—the Holy Emperor, as he called himself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">“All right, so…um, Your Majesty? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">Mr. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">Emperor?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">He chuckled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">“Just Louis is fine, my demon lord.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">Even though the paladins were right in front of us, he apparently didn’t have much time for formality. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.4">Given how I was a demon lord just like his boss, Luminus, I suppose being casual with people like me came naturally.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Louis then embarked on a recap of recent events, loudly enough for the paladins to hear.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">“So the Valentine I met at Walpurgis was your brother?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“Indeed—my younger twin brother, to be more precise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">Unfortunately, it seems he was killed by unknown assailants on the way home from the Council.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“Huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">Killed?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">He didn’t look or sound too broken up about it, but this news was kind of a surprise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">I mean, stand-in or not, that demon lord Valentine was clearly a powerful dude.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">Roy had a tendency to be overly confident; he must have left himself exposed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">The Western Holy Church has many enemies. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.4">There are quite a few nations who see the Holy Emperor Lubelius as an eyesore. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.5">I imagine one of their assassins must have caught my brother unawares. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.6">It’s a great disappointment.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Despite his lack of grief, Louis didn’t seem wholly unmoved by the loss. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">Louis was pretty strong, too; I could see that much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">But if </span><a id="page-17"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">his demon lord–class brother was now dead, he must not have been too optimistic about his own future.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">“I’d been enlisting Roy to work with the new recruits lately, for on-the-field training,” said Hinata. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">“One time, Saare actually managed to overpower him in battle, so he’d clearly been off his game—but we still need to watch out for whoever killed him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">Not that any of that matters to you, I assume.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">She had a point. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">Roy had left hardly any impact on my life at all.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Now, at least, I had a handle on Louis, Valentine, and Luminus, as did the Crusaders listening in on us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">This was all news to them, and they were all shocked into silence.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Now Hinata turned to her soldiers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">You all heard us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.4">It wasn’t my intention to deceive you, but I suppose that’s how this worked out, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“L-Lady Hinata…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">She raised a hand to stop the question before it began. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">“I couldn’t tell any of you,” she coldly continued. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">“We needed to have as few people in on the plan as possible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.4">If any of you revealed it, we would’ve been forced to execute you.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">Wow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">Not mincing words, huh, Hinata?</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">“Heh… Heh-heh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">Well, you won’t trick old Arnaud here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">The god—or should I say, the demon lord Luminus—threatened you into doing this, didn’t she?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">This Arnaud guy was awfully brash. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">Hinata, however, swiftly shut him down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">“No. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.4">I told you—our citizens are under the protection of Lady Luminus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.5">That’s the truth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.6">So I’ve chosen to carry out her will, as long as she remains friendly to humanity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.7">You will not insult her around me, Arnaud.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">She shot her steely-eyed paladin a glare. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">I could see where this misunderstanding came from. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">No wonder Shizu had been concerned.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“Hey, now,” I said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">“C’mon, Hinata, why don’t you try being a bit kinder? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">That’s not nearly enough explanation for them.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“I’m sorry, does this involve you?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Her glare was on me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">Clearly, she wanted me to knock it off.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-18"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“I kind of think it does, doesn’t it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Because it’d be kind of annoying if you guys started infighting with each other here.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“I don’t need your concern, thanks. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">Besides—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“There is no need to worry,” Arnaud said, cutting her off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">“You have fully earned our trust, Lady Hinata!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“Arnaud is right,” his compatriot Renard echoed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">“Good demon lord Rimuru, we are led by Lady Hinata, not Luminus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">There is no disagreement that could possibly separate us.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">They might’ve all had their own thoughts about it, but none of that trumped the faith they had in Hinata. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">Having a trust-based relationship really is the most important thing, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">“Well, all right,” I said, nodding.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“Besides, after watching </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">…” Arnaud pointed up, pausing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">I knew what he was getting at. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">There, in the air above, Luminus and Veldora had just engaged in a battle that was nothing short of breathtaking—as much as I wished they hadn’t. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.4">I kept everyone on the ground safe through Uriel’s Absolute Defense skill, but they fought over such a large range, I couldn’t say if there’d be any outside casualties. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.5">Anyone who had seen Luminus’s ferocious attack would be just as flummoxed as Arnaud.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">Frankly:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“Looking at that battle, I can understand how Lady Hinata was defeated.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“No, she certainly doesn’t call herself a god for show. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">If she turned her back on humanity, there’d be nothing we could do about it…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">To the Crusaders, the sight of it was far more convincing than any speech I could have given them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“Well,” Louis said, “there is no need to concern yourselves about that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">Lady Luminus is a generous god. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.3">She has no interest in tormenting those under her divine protection. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.4">Why else has she proven to be so friendly toward the humans who do </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">not</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1"> try to defy her? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Of course, no one here is allowed to divulge her </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">true</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1"> identity, but…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Maintaining confidentiality about the whole demon lord thing was top priority to him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">It was Veldora who blew her cover anyway, so I saw no reason not to cooperate with that effort. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">And the other paladins seemed convinced this was a valid thing to do—mainly </span><a id="page-19"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">because Hinata wanted it, as far as I could tell. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">They must have loved her a lot more than I thought.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">So I didn’t think I had anything to worry about. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">Which was good. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">Because in my eyes, Hinata tended to be too terse, too blunt, too easily misunderstood for her own good—</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">“Were you thinking something rude about me again?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">“Huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">N-no, I wasn’t…”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">Does she have ESP or something?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">She’s got to be reading my mind…</span></em></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">At that very moment, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">he</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1"> came onto the scene—falling at terminal velocity from the sky, of course, and making a small crater on the ground. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">He stood right back up, though, none the worse for wear, and ran up to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.3">It was Veldora, obviously, and now he was sidling up behind me, using me as a shield as he glared up at the sky. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.4">Ahead of him, up above, I could see a beautiful silver-haired young woman, a mask of rage on her face as she floated in midair.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">“R-Rimuru, give that pigheaded woman a piece of your mind! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">I’m giving her as generous an apology as I can, but she refuses to listen!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">This time, at least, it was completely Veldora’s fault. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">Has it never </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">not</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1"> been, if you think about it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">He hadn’t even been resurrected for that long, and already I felt like he’d been a huge thorn in my side.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">I had been watching them, but the method Veldora chose for his apology only served to rile up Luminus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">She was trying to put her sword away, and then he went off like “Kwah-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">I had no bad intentions back then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.4">Call it a youthful mistake and forgive me with your most generous of hearts!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.5">That was easily enough to set her off.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">“All right.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">Without hesitation, I grabbed Veldora by the neck and presented him to Luminus.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">“Gehh?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">Rimuru! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.3">You’ve betrayed meeeee!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">At a time like this, it’s important you get your message across. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">I needed to make sure everything was crystal clear to everyone about this, if I didn’t want Luminus to have any lingering resentments.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">She gave me a surprised look, then let out a smile cold enough to freeze blood. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.3">I am glad to see, Rimuru, that you possess great senses of perception. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.4">Unlike that </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">lizard</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1"> over there.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">“Oh, it’s nothing that great. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">But I know he’s been a real thorn in your side this time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">If you agree to forgive him afterward, you can feel free to rake him over the coals as much as you like.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">Luminus grinned and nodded.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">“Mmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">I will give that some thought.”</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">That seemed to smooth things over with Luminus well enough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">Veldora was shouting things like “Wait! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">Does—does </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">my</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1"> opinion not matter at all?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">as she dragged him away, but neither she nor I was paying attention.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">“Time to let off all the steam I’ve been building up… Embracing Drain!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">“Gaaagghghhh!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">It looked like Luminus was giving Veldora a hug, but there was certainly no sweet sentiment behind it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">It was really more of a bear hug, despite the height difference.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">You’d think that wouldn’t be enough to hurt Veldora much, but…</span></p>
