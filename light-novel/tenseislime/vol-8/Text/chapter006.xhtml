<p><a id="page-39"></a>“Sir Rimuru, where are you looking?”</p>
<p>Shuna had paused her serving, looking at me with a smile. It was strange. Her voice sounded so gentle, but something about it seemed as frozen as ice.</p>
<p>“No, no, nowhere! But, Hinata… If that misunderstanding’s all cleared up, then we’re all good, I promise! If you could just drop your prejudices against monsters, then all the better!”</p>
<p>Hinata appeared lost for a moment at my forced change of subject, but then wordlessly nodded.</p>
<p>I knew I was asking a lot, really. A monster, in essence, was kind of like a violent offender with a gun in his hand. If you believe one without question and innocent people get killed later, you have to recognize that you set yourself up for failure. Maybe we could speak to each other, and maybe that didn’t mean we could <em>really</em> understand…but this town could make it work. People were believing me and trying to play nice with humans—even after Shion and Team Reborn had been killed by human hands.</p>
<p>“I mean, I know you won’t trust me that easily or anything. You never know what the other side’s <em>really</em> thinking, and I guess some monsters can be a lot slyer and more conniving than others. If you’re a defender of humanity, you can’t afford to be tricked <em>all</em> the time.”</p>
<p>“…True. Conversation is the first step to a common understanding, but it can lead to some dangerous transactions. You run the risk of making commitments that bind you, heart and soul.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I bet. But if you can at least not declare that all monsters are evil, we’re totally fine with that. And if you got a monster you’re iffy about, we’ll take ’em in. If human society can’t accept ’em, they’ll be fine here.”</p>
<p>That was about the best compromise I could give. Any monsters deemed suspect could easily be taken into Tempest. Here in town, at least, we could be sure they wouldn’t cause any trouble…assuming we could reason with the guy anyway.</p>
<p>“All right. I don’t think our thoughts are going to change if I snap my fingers, but I will prohibit my ranks from condemning all monsters as evil. Is that all right with you, Lady Luminus?”</p>
<p><a id="page-40"></a>“I care not for such trivial matters. But if it leads citizens to doubt their faith in me, I will <em>not</em> stand for that.”</p>
<p>“Very well. I will observe that as our first priority.”</p>
<p>Luminus seemed convinced. Given how the Holy Empire of Lubelius was wholly built around the people’s faith in the god Luminus, any cracks in that faith could affect the entire foundation of that belief. That religion holds great sway over the Western Nations. I could understand Hinata’s caution.</p>
<p>If anything, though, I feel like Luminus underestimated the influence she had on people. She goes on about how she “will not stand” for things, but then she acts like she’s above it all and none of it matters. Maybe being bandied around as a supreme being wasn’t Luminus’s intention at all. I could just have been overthinking it, but it seemed like Louis was the de facto head of government, and Hinata did pretty much all her errands for her. Even all <em>this</em> drama was perpetrated by the Seven Days.</p>
<p>But… Really, though? An old demon lord who’s ruled in the shadows for so long was really just a lazy girl palming off responsibility on others? No way, no how. She reminded me of the style I was aiming for with Tempest—“Let the king reign, not govern”—so I couldn’t help thinking about it.</p>
<p>Now Hinata’s eyes were turned toward my officials. “I must thank all of you as well. I promise I will not treat you as hostile enemies simply for being monsters.”</p>
<p>She bowed her head deeply, and the other paladins hurriedly followed her lead, shouting “We’re sorry!” together.</p>
<p>“Please, think nothing of it,” Rigurd said. “Were it not for Sir Rimuru’s orders, we would have considered humans our foes as well.”</p>
<p>In other words, my orders had changed their minds. For a goblin who’s just trying his best to stay alive, I’m sure anyone who doesn’t look like you is an enemy.</p>
<p>“I am just glad you aren’t against us,” said Benimaru with a bold grin. “I saw your battle against Sir Rimuru, and I doubt even I could have defeated you.”</p>
<p>The fact that his attention was devoted to combat was certainly very Benimaru-like. Soei nodded his solemn agreement next to him.</p>
<p><a id="page-41"></a>The world of monsters has always had a broad “survival of the fittest” streak to it; if you’re deemed the enemy and killed for it, it’s your own fault for being weaker. That’s how Soei’s mind worked, and he had no particular grudge against the paladins.</p>
<p>Shion, meanwhile, was dubious. Hinata’s apology must have confused her.</p>
<p>“Here, Shion, you forgive her, too. I understand your pain and anger, but it’s not like every human being on earth is evil. You have some bad guys and some good guys. That’s all there is to it. And monsters are the same way; you have to get a closer look if you want to really know anything. Plus, humans are capable of overcoming their mistakes. And not just them, either, right? Us too. What’s important is what’s in your soul, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Instead of dividing all living things into humans and monsters, it was more important to see how they lived, what existed in their souls. I wanted Shion to understand that, but my pleas seemed to just unnerve her even more. Humans, I suppose, really <em>were</em> evil to her. I just didn’t want her to think they were all that way. She was following my orders for now, but there’s no telling when her frustrations would explode. I couldn’t have that. Instead of just following my orders, I wanted her to move and act on her own free will.</p>
<p>But perhaps I was too worried. In a single moment, Shion threw away all her hesitation. She never was one for thinking about matters too deeply.</p>
<p>“All right!” she blurted out. “Just like you, Sir Rimuru, I will judge good and bad people based on their souls!”</p>
<p>She beamed, as if unshouldering some heavy burden. Maybe she had just climbed over some kind of tall barrier in her mind. It’s not like I could see anyone’s souls, exactly, but if that won over Shion, then great.</p>
<p>Team Reborn didn’t seem to have any issues, either. There was no apparent bad blood with the paladins, and like Shion, I think they had it in them to judge people on their own merits. Nice of them. I sure was proud.</p>
<p>So then it was settled. I accepted the apology and let the mistakes fall into the past. The borderline between forgivable and <a id="page-42"></a>unforgivable was always tricky to discern, but we had made up well enough this time. If you can speak the same language as the other side, it’s always possible for both of you to accept each other’s feelings.</p>

<p class="tx1">But enough of this gloomy stuff. All this food we prepared wouldn’t be nearly as good cold—and considering Veldora’s lack of a role so far, keeping him waiting any longer would just piss him off and make <em>my</em> life a hassle.</p>
<p>He wasn’t supposed to require food at all, I didn’t think, but from the moment of his resurrection, he had been demanding it for some reason. His love for cakes and such was already common knowledge, but he whined at me a lot about other types of cuisine as well. I knew he was revved up about the feast we had for tonight. Let’s get him involved.</p>
<p>But before that, a toast. I made one up on the spot to get things started.</p>
<p>“Well, here’s to the battles we’ve all fought—and all the ones to come. Cheers!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">A nice, cold mug, straight from the hot bath. No better moment in your life. And I was prepared, of course—we had all the treasured liquor my nation had to offer, and there would be no holding back. No mistake about it.</p>
<p>Wine was the staple drink in Englesia, I had learned. Beer existed, but it just wasn’t very good. It lacked carbonation and the aroma from the bubbles, and being served at room temperature did it no favors, either. My nation had conquered all those problems—don’t let anyone tell you I didn’t have a passion for food. After all this research, day and night, our selection of offerings was now far more robust than it was when I first visited the Dwarven Kingdom. Sheesh—it’s almost like I say something, and they immediately begin development on it. Was this because I was a demon lord now? Actually, I guess it was kind of always this way…</p>
<p><a id="page-43"></a>…Well, regardless, my beloved monsters were doing their very best for me, and as a result, my diet was now no different from when I lived in Japan. The food in Tempest is seriously good, trust me. I figured the paladins would be blown away, and I was right.</p>
<p>We kicked things off by having a group of women, all well versed in holding banquets like this, pour drinks for everyone. The first mouthful was a surprise to them, I could tell, but the moment they tucked into their food, they paused and looked at the others around them to gauge their responses. The taste must have astonished them. I grinned to myself, relieved.</p>
<p>Tempura was the main dish, but we also offered seafood—some freshly prepared sashimi. We had found something close to soybeans, so we even had some ersatz soy sauce to go with it—another fruit of Shuna’s labor. It wasn’t a perfect match flavor-wise, but you wouldn’t notice unless you knew the real thing. To someone trying it for the first time, <em>this</em> was what it was supposed to be. Soy sauce came in all kinds of varieties anyway, so maybe there was something like this produced by some local outfit in Japan, for all I knew. Either way, I was more than satisfied.</p>
<p>Preparing sashimi had become a specialty of Hakuro’s. He wasn’t with us tonight, but a number of chefs had been training under him. That whole process—developing the next generation of kitchen staff—was going pretty well, too. You could see them improve as time passed, their offerings growing more diverse and mouthwatering by the day.</p>
<p>It was an entirely Japanese-style meal, but nearly everyone in the hall seemed to enjoy it. Hinata, in particular, looked like she was having a life-changing moment, putting her inexperienced paladins to shame as she expertly used her chopsticks to eat. Then she turned to me, likely noticing my attention on her.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think this is going too far?”</p>
<p>“Too far <em>how</em>?!”</p>
<p>I wasn’t expecting this complaint. It kind of annoyed me, so I fired back. This triggered a rant that must have been building for a long time.</p>
<p>“We stopped at a tavern on the way here that had ramen and <a id="page-44"></a><em>gyoza</em> dumplings. You offer free fresh water on the highway. This is supposed to be a remote forest, and yet you’ve built these enormous bathhouses. And now this! How did you even <em>find</em> fresh sashimi in the middle of a huge forest? And going out of your way to find these wild plants for tempura… Don’t you find that crazy at all?!”</p>
<p>I had definitely broken her cool facade. Man. Wasn’t expecting <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>“Well, um, I wanted to eat it, so—”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I… I mean, I wanted to eat it, so I tried remaking it for myself. And the sashimi… You know, we’re on good terms with the Beast Kingdom of Eurazania, and they’ve got a coastline, so I had some fish brought over. We don’t really have the logistics for refrigerated transport yet, though, so that kind of thing’s still skill-dependent. But what’s the harm in splurging a little bit?”</p>
<p>“Skill-dependent?”</p>
<p>I gave her a reassuring nod.</p>
<p>The skill in question was Gourmet, a unique one possessed by Geld that granted him a Stomach to pass items between high orcs. Food couldn’t be ferried around with teleportation magic, but skills didn’t have any such restrictions. Of course, we still only brought enough over to cover this banquet; the high orcs were too busy with construction projects across the forest to handle every passing fancy of mine. A few of them taking some R &amp; R in town had offered their personal support for the project, but my reliance on individual skills for the job was a weak point I intended to address in the future.</p>
<p>Hinata listened to my defense, looking a bit exasperated. “…Right.” She sighed, resigned. “With a skill, you could transport that stuff without altering it at all…and you have a lot of people in this nation who can handle the job. I just can’t believe you’re using all this for yourself, as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world.”</p>
<p>That sounded a bit rude to me, but ah well. I suppose I had answered Hinata’s question, but I didn’t really see what her problem was with it. If something’s available to use, why not use it?</p>
<p><a id="page-45"></a>“Well,” interrupted Luminus, “what is the harm in it, Hinata? No matter the story behind it, there is no doubting how delicious this all is. I, for one, am very impressed.”</p>
<p>She had a cup in her hand and looked to be well on her way, alcohol-wise, as she scarfed down another piece of tempura. She was grabbing them with her fingers but still somehow managed to look elegant doing it. Which was fine. If you weren’t offending anyone, you could eat any way you liked. You can’t force chopsticks on someone who has never seen them before.</p>
<p>And speaking of which, that was actually kind of a thorny problem. Benimaru and the other ogres could work with chopsticks just fine, and the monsters of Tempest had largely learned by watching us. This wasn’t the case for the merchants and adventurers who came from foreign lands. I was contemplating inviting nobility from across the world to build ourselves into a travel hot spot, so I wanted to be sure chopsticks remained an optional selection for them.</p>
<p>Along those lines, Luminus was proving an interesting research subject. You could use a knife and fork, a pair of chopsticks, or your fingers, and while hot food required chopsticks, she otherwise had no qualms about eating with her hands. Different types of food were eaten in different ways, after all, and there was no reason to put our visitors off by insisting on some “foreign” way of eating. Maybe it’s best to just say “Hey, we can eat <em>this</em> way, too,” then wait as the habit gradually takes hold.</p>
<p>“Do you like our offerings?” I asked Luminus.</p>
<p>“I do. Very much. The food is extraordinary—and the drink as well.”</p>
<p>The observation made me realize that Luminus was downing the alcohol at an alarming speed. Milim was pretty strong, but Luminus was a powerhouse, knocking back any cup offered alongside her tempura.</p>
<p>“Glad to hear. But try to go easy, okay? Too much isn’t good for you.”</p>
<p>“Fool. I am impervious to all poisons—alcohol is no danger to <a id="page-46"></a>me. In fact, at the moment, I am trying my hardest to lessen the effect of Cancel Poison so I can get drunk off this!”</p>
<p>I suppose my warning was pointless. But “weakening” Cancel Poison?</p>
<p>“Y-you can do something like that?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Stop playing dumb.”</p>
<p>She must’ve thought I was kidding, but I insisted she teach me how that worked.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>…</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Oops. Sounds like Raphael is in a huff about something. Ignoring it, I followed Luminus’s instructions and attempted to shrink down my own resistances. The moment I did, I could feel the intoxication sneaking into my mind. Yes! <em>Yes!</em> This is what drunkenness feels like!</p>
<p>“Kwah-ha-ha-ha! You couldn’t even do <em>that</em>, Rimuru? I mastered <em>that</em> much eons ago!”</p>
<p>Veldora seemed proud of himself. I didn’t know where he practiced it, but he was now in a marvelous state of inebriation.</p>
<p>“Right!” I shouted. “Another round!”</p>
<p>“Yes. Let me join you.”</p>
<p>“Silly boys.” Luminus sniffed. “But if you two insist, I suppose I will have a refill as well.”</p>
<p>Now things were heating up. I could almost hear Shuna rolling her eyes as she said “Oh, Sir Rimuru…,” but she still grinned and poured out the drink. We were all much less formal now.</p>
<p>All the adult beverages we made locally were on offer, along with fresh water and as many ice cubes as you wanted. There was juice and tea available for the nondrinkers, too. Haruna was keeping Veldora’s cup full, while Louis did the same for Luminus. There was a drinking contest brewing between Benimaru, Shion, and Soei, as well as among the Lycanthropeers and between Arnaud and his fellow top paladin officers. Those paladins were pretty snooty at first, but once their commanding officer Arnaud began sampling all the wares on hand, they loosened up considerably. Some were <a id="page-47"></a>now amicably chatting with Rigurd and the rest, and a few of them asked the waitstaff for more food.</p>
<p>One demonstrated interest in trying some of the food the monsters on hand were enjoying. Fritz was his name, I think, a Crusader commander alongside Arnaud and one of the Ten Great Saints. Nicer guy than I thought at first blush, I guess. Expressing an interest in what other people are eating is the first step toward understanding them. It was a nice sight to see.</p>
<p><em>But that was…</em> I thought for a moment. The drink was starting to make it tough. <em>He’s talking about that black rice, isn’t he?</em></p>
<p>This “black rice” was made using a type of plant raised on magicule water—the highly magical water found inside the Sealed Cave. I suggested trying that out as an experiment, and it resulted in rice that looked like an octopus squirted ink all over it. For someone like me, who enjoyed his rice hot, white, and fluffy, it looked absolutely gross—but it tasted good. <em>Really</em> good, in fact. It was also packed with nutrients, surprisingly, so we called the crop blackspell rice and moved into full production of it.</p>
<p>It was now a staple of Tempestian cuisine, but I was pretty sure there was some kind of issue with it I was forgetting—</p>
<p>“Whoa!” I shouted, alarmed all the way back to sobriety. “That stuff’s poisonous to humans!”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was too late. Fritz already had some in his mouth. And his first reaction:</p>
<p>“Why, this… This is restoring my magical force!”</p>
<p>“Um, do you feel all right? Not sick or anything?”</p>
<p>A weaker being taking in large quantities of magic could have hazardous health effects. This blackspell rice was packed with magicules, which meant it was toxic to those with less-than-robust constitutions. Of course, it could also be a medicine in the right dosage—and like I said, potentially a dietary staple. Nobody in Tempest would have an issue with it, but I still hadn’t tested out what it did to humans. Finding test subjects wasn’t exactly easy.</p>
<p>Fritz’s reaction, however, was unexpected to me. I assumed it’d be harmful to <em>Homo sapiens</em>, but maybe it’s beneficial to you if you have enough magical force?</p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Understood. The subject Fritz’s magic power–recovery effect has been confirmed. Those with resistance to magicules seem to be able to convert them into energy.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1">Ah, I see. Maybe eating this now, after exhausting his magic in that huge fight, made it all the more effective.</p>
<p>The other paladins, seeing this, immediately clamored for tastes of their own. Having a few pints in you could be a dangerous thing sometimes; none were afraid of the side effects. So I agreed.</p>
<p>Hinata gave the blackspell rice a funny look, likely reacting the same way I did at first. But without further complaint, she sipped from the bowl of <em>chazuke</em>, consisting of the black rice with some tea poured on top of it. I also offered it in rice-ball form for those who wanted something a little heartier. Both selections were huge hits, and a second round was carried out to the party in very short order. Considering that I busted out my personal stash of white rice for this event, it was funny to see the blackspell rice be the toast of the night instead—but hey, if you aren’t conditioned to be turned off by the color like I was, it must’ve been much more acceptable.</p>
<p>So now I knew what this new breed of rice could do, and between that and all the other food and drink, I thought we were making a pretty good impression. I was starting to see monsters and paladins chatting with each other, taking advantage of the opportunity presented to them. Shion was even engaged in an impromptu arm-wrestling tournament with three of the paladins—dominating them, by the looks of it, but her opponents were all smiles regardless. I liked the trends I saw. Alcohol played no small role in it, perhaps, but if this became the natural flow of things, it wouldn’t be long before we’re all on friendly terms.</p>
<p>Good things to eat, enjoyable days to spend—that was my goal, and I wasn’t afraid to strive for it. If I have any job here, I suppose, it’s to make sure this sight doesn’t go extinct. It gave me new resolve.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>“What are you doing, Rimuru?! Drink up, drink up! Let me fill your cup!”</p>
<p><a id="page-49"></a>“Yes, yes! You have the demon lord Luminus accompanying you! Let us enjoy this evening as much as we can!”</p>
<p>“Wh-whoa,” I said, “chill out, Veldora. Also, aren’t you a vampire, Luminus? Why are you eating and getting drunk and—?”</p>
<p>“Silence, you fool! Once you grow powerful enough, even a vampire can gain sustenance enough from regular food. Now hurry up and empty your mug!”</p>
<p>That wasn’t what I was getting at, but she was in no mood to listen. So there I was, two drunken louts on both sides of me, feeling that newfound resolve disappear from my mind.</p>
<p>“Guys! Hey!”</p>
<p>Before I could stop them, they were taking shots from the sake we brewed from the blackspell rice. “Slow it down, you two,” I thought I heard Hinata curtly whispering at them—she had a faint smile, though, so maybe the booze was giving me auditory hallucinations. She was kind of cute, actually, when she smiled—not that I was gonna tell her.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">Morning came. God, my head hurt.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Understood. Of course it does. This is the backlash after deliberately weakening your resistances.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1">Thanks for the feedback, man. Raphael sounded a bit peeved, but I was sure I was imagining it. Nobody’s skills get mad at them.</p>
<p>I shook the mental cobwebs away. Today we had an important meeting to conduct—one that could decide how Tempest and the Holy Empire of Lubelius dealt with each other going forward.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I was now seated in our usual meeting hall, soldiering through my headache.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, if things had turned out differently, we might’ve been fighting both Lubelius and the Western Nations affiliated with it. The Papacy had given the Temple Knights stationed in <a id="page-50"></a>Farmus permission to act, and if worse came to worse, the casualties on our side would’ve been eye-popping. If you thought about it like that, we couldn’t afford to be too chill here.</p>
<p>On the other hand, though, I was done punishing Farmus. Not a single one of the Temple Knights who conspired against us was breathing today. We had a duty to govern over there, so I wasn’t exactly an impartial observer…but Hinata had already apologized to me, and the masterminds who schemed against us were already gone. If we could build friendly relations, we were golden. There wasn’t much point asking for reparations—we already had plenty of that from Clayman’s and Farmus’s coffers, and Farmus was physically far enough away from us that annexing it or making it into some kinda colony was too much of a pain. If the other side had admitted fault, money honestly wasn’t as important to me as working to build relations.</p>
<p>In time, Luminus and her people entered the hall.</p>
<p>Tempest was represented here by me, Shion, Rigurd, and Benimaru, along with Rugurd, Regurd, and Rogurd, the government ministers of justice, legislation, and administration, respectively. Veldora was there, too, but safely ignorable. He had some manga to read, and I doubted he’d even bother to pay attention.</p>
<p>From Lubelius, meanwhile, we had Luminus, Louis, Hinata, and the five top paladin officials. I had them all make their formal introductions. There was Vice Captain Renard, the Noble of Light. There was Arnaud of Air, the strongest of the force after Hinata, and under him was Bacchus of Earth, Litus of Water, and Fritz of Wind. I had us all seated facing one another, and with that, the proceedings began.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I wanted to start with a brainstorm session to see what each side’s takes were on this situation. Along those lines, I created a list of issues affecting all of us and passed them out to everyone to kick things off. This was just to ensure we were all on the same page; I didn’t want to turn this conference into a blame game, so if we disagreed on how we saw matters, I wanted it fixed as soon as possible, and so did Hinata.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Our respective stances were about what I figured.</p>
<p>To us, of course, the whole story began with Farmus’s invasion of our land. Our view of this hadn’t changed; all we did was respond to moves made by the other side.</p>
<p>On the Church’s end, Hinata told us that problems actually began before Farmus’s request to them. Essentially, acknowledging the existence of a nation of monsters went against the teachings of Luminism, a pressing issue that threatened to cast doubt on the faith of its believers. Leaving this unaddressed could trigger internal revolt and weaken the foothold the Western Holy Church had on the region. That’s why they had to destroy the monster nation, and that was why they needed a just cause, a good reason to conquer us.</p>
<p>“That was the situation when we received the request from Archbishop Reyhiem, who was in Farmus at the time,” Hinata explained. “Cardinal Nicolaus gave his approval, and I had no objections to it—and besides, I still wanted to get back at you.”</p>
<p>She intended, in other words, to take advantage of Farmus’s greed and seize the opportunity to annihilate us and gain revenge.</p>
<p>“Was that about Shizu?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it was. I suppose I was just being used, though, looking back. I don’t know who is operating behind the scenes, but there are definitely Eastern merchants involved.”</p>
<p>“Merchants? I knew it. Clayman had a merchant or two he was particularly close to as well. Given how well armed Geld and his orcish army was, I assumed they were connected to one nation or another. I guess it was the East, then.”</p>
<p>I nodded, convinced. Judging by the account books I had Shuna look into, Clayman was dealing in a vast amount of merchandise—mainly goods from the Empire, originally crafted in the Dwarven Kingdom. That wasn’t suspicious, since the Empire and kingdom had regular trade with each other—but there were no records at all of the middlemen involved in this. Shuna was thorough in her work, but she couldn’t find any of them, even after we asked the assorted officials we took prisoner. Clayman was careful, <a id="page-52"></a>no doubt drumming it into his force that no evidence should ever be left behind. We found absolutely nothing on the Moderate Jesters, either, the group closely affiliated with him.</p>
<p>Still, we could make educated guesses about who was involved. In Clayman’s castle, we found a collection of artwork, rare magic items, and other such goods, brought in from around the world. The weapons and armor we discovered, however, were chiefly hand-me-downs from the Empire. They had teleportation magic, so they could’ve procured weapons from anywhere they wanted, but they got almost all of it in from the East. That suggested close connections, and while the evidence was circumstantial, it was still persuasive.</p>
<p>That and their food supply. Clayman’s bases across the land held enormous stashes of fruit, bread, dairy, and luxury goods like alcohol. Being organic, they couldn’t be teleported; physical transport was a must with them. Clayman’s domain, the Puppet Nation of Dhistav, apparently used slave labor for most of its agricultural output, but not everything we found in these stores was domestically produced—according to Shuna, some of it had to be imported from beyond their borders. The only real candidate for this was the Eastern Empire, adjacent to Dhistav. Milim’s domain, after all, was self-sufficient to the point that she barely even considered international trade—hell, she and the ex–demon lord Carillon didn’t even have currency to exchange.</p>
<p>So I had my suspicions that Clayman was linked to people from the Eastern Empire.</p>
<p>“That’s right,” Hinata said. “They told me you killed Shizu, and you happened to be stationed in Englesia. That’s why I took the initiative to kill you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. You couldn’t have picked a worse time, either. Even now, it still pisses me off when I think about it.”</p>
<p>Hinata shivered a bit. Arnaud and the other paladins looked similarly cowed.</p>
<p>“Enough coercion, you upstart brat. I can feel the Lord’s Ambition coming from you.”</p>
<p>Whoops! As Luminus just pointed out, a bit of my aura was <a id="page-53"></a>leaking out. I was pretty good at keeping it perfectly under my control, but I guess it gets kind of loose whenever I’m angry.</p>
<p>“So,” I began after apologizing, “it’s pretty clear an Eastern merchant or merchants is behind this. Do we know any names?”</p>
<p>“I know one. He called himself Dahm, but I’m sure that’s an alias.”</p>
<p>An alias? Probably so. But the name didn’t really matter. What <em>did</em> matter was narrowing the culprit down to the Empire’s merchant class.</p>
<p>“So this merchant was connected to Clayman, and I’m willing to bet he and his people are the guys who set Farmus’s King Edmaris on us, too.”</p>
<p>“No, there’s no doubting that. Reyhiem made that much clear enough in our questioning.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Okay, so it’s clear Clayman was controlling Farmus from behind the curtain. Not in a cooperative kind of way, either. It seems more coercive to me.”</p>
<p>“And you think the Eastern merchants were his boots on the ground?” Benimaru asked.</p>
<p>“And I suppose I was just another cog in the machine,” whispered Hinata.</p>
<p>I could sense her anger. The question was: Who drew up the plans?</p>
<p>“Well, based on how these merchants were involved with every step of this, I’m sure this was more than just a convenient business relationship. Clayman was trying to ascend to ‘true’ demon lord level. Farmus was trying to take our land for its own expansionist purposes. And <em>someone</em>, we don’t know who, was engineering it all.”</p>
<p>“Someone, huh? The one Clayman mentioned?”</p>
<p>I nodded at Luminus.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Benimaru and the others already knew about this, but the humans in the room didn’t. Realizing this, I gave them a quick recap.</p>
<p>“Well, it looks like Clayman was doing the bidding of someone else himself.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Luminus added, “and he refused to divulge this someone’s <a id="page-54"></a>identity until the very end. Impressive for someone as small-minded as him.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>“Could this someone be the Seven Days, then?”</p>
<p>The idea came to me suddenly, and when I gave it voice, it felt even more plausible. But Luminus shot me a dirty look.</p>
<p>“What? Are you accusing the Seven Days of taking action unbeknownst to me?”</p>
<p>She might have wiped them off the planet by her own hand, but I guess she didn’t like people second-guessing her staff. That was fair. I was about to apologize when her associate Louis spoke up.</p>
<p>“Hmm… I cannot fully deny that possibility, no.”</p>
<p>“Now <em>you’re</em> spouting that nonsense, Louis?”</p>
<p>Her ire had turned on Louis, though he appeared unbothered.</p>
<p>“Lady Luminus, please, listen to me. The Seven Days Clergy craved your affection. I’m sure you sensed that?”</p>
<p>“How do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I am talking about the Love Energy, the energizing kiss you give in a special ceremony. The last time you did that for them, it was over a hundred years ago. At one point, it was a weekly rite, but the intervals between them grew longer and longer over time. Did you not notice?”</p>
<p>Luminus gave Louis an unpleasant look. “Aha. Yes, my eternal youth tends to make me forget, but they all <em>were</em> human. Without my energy, they may not die, but they would certainly grow old.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. That was why they worked so fervently to ensure no other ‘favorites’ besides them ever appeared.”</p>
<p>As Louis frankly put it, the Seven Days were once a very special presence in Luminus’s life. But as humans, they couldn’t live forever. This Love Energy rite must’ve been how they overcame that.</p>
<p>“…I subsequently imagine that they must have tried to curry favor with you. It wouldn’t be strange at all to imagine them working with the Eastern merchants to secretly entice Clayman into action. They weren’t about to let Clayman get a leg up on them—especially Gren, the Sunday Priest.”</p>
<p>It was just a passing thought, but it kind of surprised me how <a id="page-55"></a>well these puzzle pieces fit together. Scary stuff. I’m shocked at the sheer well of knowledge flowing out from me.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>…</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Raphael sounded like it wanted to say something, but I’m sure I was just imagining things. Maybe it was just envious of my genius, or maybe it thought I’d stolen its thunder because I didn’t ask any questions of it.</p>
<p>“Do you think,” an exasperated Hinata asked, “the Seven Days thought I was a thorn in their side because of <em>that</em>?”</p>
<p>“Sounds like it. They probably intended to help Clayman ascend, then have you get killed fighting him. <em>They</em> could never have defeated you, after all, so I don’t think they had much other choice.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a totally far-out concept. Step one, have Clayman defeat Hinata. Step two, either kill off Clayman somehow or operate him like a puppet. I couldn’t say what they wanted to do with him, but Clayman’s faith in them was genuine—if they could get Hinata out of the picture, Clayman would do anything the Seven Days wanted. Meanwhile, they’d have Farmus wipe us out and firm up the foundations Luminism worked with, naturally making sure everyone got to share in the resulting profits. A nation as big as Farmus mobilizing would mean big money for Eastern armor and weapon dealers. Plus, more than anything else, the Seven Days would be back on Luminus’s good side.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to jump to conclusions too early, but the possibility of all this seemed worthy of consideration to me.</p>
<p>“So you think they pitted me against you in hopes I’d be defeated?” Hinata asked, interested in Louis’s theory. “Between that and protecting the tenets of Luminism, I suppose it’d be two birds with one stone.”</p>
<p>This gave me another idea.</p>
<p>“But are we really sure the Seven Days were behind that?”</p>
<p>“There’s no doubting it,” replied Renard, seated next to Hinata. “It was the Clergy who introduced us to those merchants in the first place.”</p>
<p>That certainly cast more suspicion on them. Having such a <a id="page-56"></a>heroic band make the introduction, nobody would ever doubt their intentions—which would make it easier for the Clergy to reach their goals. I’m not sure they’d thought it out all the way like that when I fought Hinata for the first time, but the second? They definitely wanted me to kill her. Those conniving bastards. It scared me a bit, but they were all gone anyway, so it was water under the bridge.</p>
<p>“…But hang on. There were seven people in the Clergy, right? Isn’t one of them still left?”</p>
<p>Hinata seemed pretty at ease as far as the Clergy were concerned, but thinking about it, this wasn’t over yet at all. Whoever the final survivor was had to be up to their ears in this. It unnerved me, but Hinata just flashed me a cold smile.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha! Nothing to worry about there. Nicolaus contacted me from his sanctum to say the final one had also been eradicated. It happened after they discovered that the crystal ball you sent had been tampered with. That was enough evidence to execute him.”</p>
<p>The thin smile that accompanied her words would be enough to make anyone feel threatened. The sight of this beautiful woman talking about such sinister conspiracies was probably one reason it was easy to get the wrong idea about her. But anyway.</p>
<p>“Okay, but who <em>was</em> this last guy?”</p>
<p>I hated to think it, but it wasn’t Gren, right? The Sunday Priest fabled to be stronger than even Clayman? Because if so, it meant I’d need to keep a careful eye out for this Nicolaus guy, too.</p>
<p>“I was told it was Gren, the Sunday Priest and chief of the Clergy. He almost never took the initiative on anything by himself, so it made sense he was the last one left.”</p>
<p>Luminus’s ears perked up. “Oh? Old Granville was defeated? Nicolaus… That cardinal was infatuated with you, wasn’t he? How did he do it?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t the most heroic approach,” Louis replied, “but he had a Disintegration spell set up in advance, and it was enough of a surprise move to do him in.”</p>
<p>“Ahhhh… Granville must have aged terribly, if he fell for a trap like that.”</p>
<p>She sounded sad about it, but my mind was on other matters. <a id="page-57"></a>Unfortunately, it seemed that I would need to add a new entry to my mental list of people to watch out for. It might’ve been a surprise move, but I couldn’t let my guard down. Disintegration was lethal against most people. <em>Cardinal Nicolaus… Let’s remember that name.</em></p>
<p>“By the way, Lady Luminus, by <em>Granville</em>, do you mean Gren?”</p>
<p>Hinata had a thoughtful expression. The name Granville must have rung a bell.</p>
<p>“That I do,” Luminus replied. “His real name is Granville. He was known as the Hero of Light in his glory days. He even fought me once.”</p>
<p>For a god, Luminus acted so oddly innocent at times. I might’ve been imagining it, but sometimes it felt like she was trying to act all high and mighty and not quite succeeding all the time. Was all this, you know…an act?</p>
<p>Then I felt it: her eyes, dead upon me.</p>
<p>Yep, I <em>was</em> just imagining things! So much for that suspicion.</p>
<p>“Did he…? I-I’m sure it couldn’t be, but…”</p>
<p>Hinata seemed to have an idea in mind, but she must not have been fully sure about it, because she went no further.</p>
<p>“He <em>was</em> pretty strong in the past,” she instead recalled. “Up to my level, in fact.”</p>
<p>“You could say that,” answered Luminus. “Anyone who calls themselves a Hero usually finds themselves bound by fate soon enough. Perhaps he resented me, somewhere deep in his heart.”</p>
<p>Perhaps, indeed. Just like Milim told me, Heroes and demon lords often intertwined. Granville was defeated by the demon lord Luminus, opting to swear his allegiance to her instead. Deep down, though, he might’ve had mixed feelings about her—feelings he couldn’t escape from, even after becoming a living legend who brought many champions in their own right into the world. But at this point, it was all just guesswork.</p>
<p>“Well,” I said, “that’s a relief, at least. It means that everyone who picked a fight with us—Clayman, Farmus, the Seven Days Clergy—they’ve all met their end.”</p>
<p>Benimaru and my other officials nodded their agreement. “All’s well that ends well,” Rigurd eagerly commented with a smile.</p>
<p><a id="page-58"></a>“You said it,” I replied, returning the smile as I felt the tension escape the hall. “We had to deal with a lot of dangerous foes, but at this point, most of the problems are safely behind us. But I sure don’t want anyone controlling <em>me</em> behind the scenes. If we hadn’t noticed these merchants scheming in the shadows, I honestly would’ve started to suspect Yuuki.”</p>
<p>Yuuki <em>was</em> pretty suspicious. When it came to humans in Englesia with deep ties to Hinata, Yuuki was the prime candidate. I felt bad about it, but I couldn’t take him off the list.</p>
<p>“Yuuki?” Renard asked. “Yuuki Kagurazaka, the guild master?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I answered with a nod.</p>
<p>Thinking about it impartially, it made sense. He was the prime suspect at the time. But Yuuki had no reason to have Hinata and me fight each other. If there was no motive, it was pretty hard to picture him as the culprit.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>…</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">On the other hand, maybe someone was deftly scheming to frame Yuuki. The Eastern merchants could pull that off well enough, I thought—they’d proven more than capable of carrying out multiple operations remotely at the same time. If the Clergy were the main bad guys, the merchants would have a motive to take the heat off them a little. It made sense.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<p>“Yuuki, a suspect? Can’t say that’s out of the question, no.”</p>
<p>Right when I had convinced myself, Hinata threw me with that observation.</p>
<p>“Whoa, you’re doubting someone from your own homeland?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? I’m only considering every possibility. For that matter, it may be a bit early to assume the real mastermind is gone. The Moderate Jester that killed Roy is still on the loose, and those Eastern merchants still have deep roots all over the Western Nations.”</p>
<p>It felt like she was splashing cold water on me. She was right. It was too early to breathe easy. I braced myself anew.</p>
<p><a id="page-59"></a>“Yeah… I guess you’re right. It’s not over yet. We can’t afford to be too optimistic.”</p>
<p>“No, we can’t. We’d better inform everyone about this.”</p>
<p>Benimaru nodded, while the paladins facing him looked similarly convinced.</p>
<p>“As Hinata said,” I continued, “it’s very likely that the person or persons behind all this is still around. I know I said the Clergy might be the main bad guys, but that was just a passing idea more than anything. It’s no good to throw blame around without any conclusive evidence. Let’s keep a close eye on this as we go forward.”</p>
<p>Everyone murmured their agreement at this conclusion. No, it was a bad idea to cast judgment without merit. I was fairly confident in my supposition, but Raphael didn’t offer its agreement. It didn’t disagree, either, though, so I think the possibility was there; I just didn’t have the evidence to be sure. For now, I’d have to trust in Raphael—and with the paladins happy with this conclusion, I thought it best to leave it at that.</p>

<p class="tx1">That wrapped up our recap of past events. We knew we had to investigate the possibility of another mastermind out there, but that could wait for later. Today, we were here to figure out how we needed to work together to bury the hatchet for good.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that Shuna brought in coffee and snacks for us. It seemed that scones and French fries were on today’s menu. I had to hand it to her; she demonstrated impeccable timing. I immediately tackled my plate as the paladins sat there figuring out what to do.</p>
<p>“Oooh, snacks? I’ll take a double portion.”</p>
<p>And of course, Veldora chose this moment to finally delve into the conversation.</p>
<p>“Very well,” replied Shuna, well used to this act.</p>
<p>“Mmm, this is good.”</p>
<p>Hinata was sampling her plate as well, which was enough to set <a id="page-60"></a>the paladins to action. After our previous talk, we all needed to kick back and relax a bit like this.</p>
<p class="space-break1">A few minutes later, I suddenly spoke up.</p>
<p>“All right. So about our future relations…”</p>
<p>“Ah, before that,” Hinata interrupted, “I want to make one thing very clear to all of us. Should I assume you’ve accepted our apology for all these events?”</p>
<p>“Sure. I want us to become friends as nations going forward. I don’t intend to drag that problem along any further.”</p>
<p>This wasn’t my sole decision. I came to it after discussing matters with Benimaru and my other officials. There was no need to fight any longer, and all our misunderstandings were now worked out, so I felt it was time to make a deal.</p>
<p>But Luminus wasn’t convinced.</p>
<p>“Absolutely not. I hate owing anything to anyone. This entire incident was clearly our fault, and I wish to compensate for it in some way. We can strike a deal after that is done.”</p>
<p>She gave Veldora a hateful glare. Basically, I suppose, she didn’t want Veldora to feel like he could ask her for something later.</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied Hinata, “and if that is Lady Luminus’s will, then I must say that it troubles me to put you through such pain and not make up for it. I want to show you as much as possible that I am being sincere.”</p>
<p>Okay, sure, that’s great, but what kind of compensation are we talking about? Because if Luminus—well, Lubelius as a nation, really—if they were willing to acknowledge us as a nation, then I was good to go. Combine that with an oath of non-hostility, and what more could I ask for?</p>
<p>“Hmm… Well, how about you formally recognize our nation, and we open up diplomatic relations?”</p>
<p>Luminus casually nodded. “Fair enough. Although, I won’t expect us to be fast friends. And I <em>will</em> need to settle the score with that lizard sooner or later.”</p>
<p>Pretty much all of Luminus’s smoldering anger was pointed right at Veldora. If it really, <em>really</em> came to it, I was willing to offer him <a id="page-61"></a>as a sacrifice. If that was enough to usher in a century-long era of peace, it was a dead simple decision to make.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment, Rimuru,” I heard the dragon ask. “I hope you are not picturing anything…cruel for me.”</p>
<p>“Just your imagination, Veldora. As long you act smart and mature, there’s nothing to worry about.”</p>
<p>“No, I know what you’re thinking when you talk down to me like that. It <em>usually</em> means you’re up to no good!”</p>
<p>Tch. He’s getting sharp. But not as sharp as me.</p>
<p>“Now, now… Here, I’ll give you my scone, so play nice with Luminus, all right?”</p>
<p>“What? Well, in that case, I will do my level best. Although if I ever <em>truly</em> willed it, it’d be child’s play to make Luminus recognize my vast strengths! Kwaaaaah-ha-ha-ha!”</p>
<p>You see? Dealing with him is so simple. Luminus audibly sighed, but it looked like she would remain true to her word.</p>
<p>“Don’t get cocky with me, you! For now, though, let us call a truce. I will open international relations with you for a period of one hundred years. I think that would serve amply well as an apology?”</p>
<p>Well, <em>that</em> came more easily than expected. Like, really? We’re good? Benimaru, Rigurd, and the rest of my team looked just as shocked—to say nothing of Hinata. I doubt anyone expected this.</p>
<p>“So,” ventured Hinata, “you’re willing to open diplomacy with Tempest, if not necessarily go all the way with a nonintervention treaty?”</p>
<p>“Quit pestering me about this. I’ve said what I meant!”</p>
<p>With that, she reached for a second scone, content to let someone else work out the details.</p>
<p>“I suppose,” Louis dryly stated, “we will have to carry out her will—”</p>
<p>“Diplomatic relations? Are you sure?”</p>
<p>Renard, however, seemed unconvinced. He appeared ready to bring up an issue but not quite sure if he should go through it. He gave Hinata a quick glance, receiving a nod in return.</p>
<p>“What’s the issue?” chimed in Fritz. “If Sir Rimuru and his nation were truly evil, we would have been wiped off the map long ago.”</p>
<p><a id="page-62"></a>“True,” Arnaud said. “I can trust in Sir Rimuru, yes. We need to cast off our prejudices against monsters.”</p>
<p>“I agree with them,” added Litus. “Sir Soei was such a gentleman to us.”</p>
<p>Even the notably taciturn Bacchus was nodding. Renard, hearing them all, hesitated for a moment. As vice captain of the Crusaders, he couldn’t give his ready agreement just yet. If anything, this choir of support only firmed his resolve.</p>
<p>“Yes, but there remains one problem. How will we explain this in the framework of our faith’s teachings? Because depending on our approach, the Western Holy Church may face an onslaught of criticism, and I can’t allow that to happen.”</p>
<p>Their faith—a faith that refused to accept the existence of monsters. Yeah, if they accepted me now, it’d be like, hey, what about all the teachings from the past X number of centuries? I thought we were close to solving all our problems, but I suppose it never comes that easy.</p>
<p>But as I worried over this, Luminus dropped another bombshell.</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly. Those teachings are nothing <em>I</em> established. I don’t see why failing to protect them qualifies as betraying me. Those were <em>meant</em> to be guiding principles for those lost in their lives. Really, they’re only a bunch of rules thought up by the leaders at the time.”</p>
<p>This came as a shock to all the paladins in the room, Hinata included. “What?!” she shouted. “I’ve never heard that before…”</p>
<p>“Ah yes,” Louis blandly replied, “I suppose you might not have. The original texts defining the faith are open to anyone who might want to browse, but the first written drafts they’re based on have been lost long ago. If you read through those, then you’ll see how those tenets were crafted.”</p>
<p>As he put it, the doctrines of Luminism were put in place to protect those who worshipped Luminus. She, Louis, and other high-level vampires were one thing, but the lower ones lived off human blood, and the blood of those who lived happy, contented lives was apparently more attractive to them. In the bad old days when monsters ran roughshod over the world, the human race had <a id="page-63"></a>its hands full just surviving, which meant the poor quality of their blood created its fair share of problems among the vampire community. In response, Luminus took advantage of a move she had planned to switch gears and offer her protective hand to the humans. (This “move” was caused by Veldora, apparently, but I opted against asking for details. It’d just be stirring up a hornet’s nest.)</p>
<p>“Protecting the defenseless allows them to lead happy lives. By ‘spicing up’ their lives with fearsome demon lords, followed by the relief of being protected from them, we ensure they can savor as much happiness as possible. The citizens of Lubelius are kept safe under the name of their god.”</p>
<p>Humans, to put it in a rough way, were kind of like livestock to them. Vampires lived off their blood—but as it was described to me, they needed rather small quantities, enough that the human “victim” wouldn’t even notice. There were far more humans than vampires out there, so it made sense. A little blood donation now and then ensured a life free from existential threats. A real win-win situation.</p>
<p>“So did they write the holy scriptures of Luminism to help keep needless slaughter by the monsters at a minimum?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” Louis said to Hinata. “Precisely.”</p>
<p>“To me, the most important thing is the faith itself,” added Luminus. “All of you here—you can cast your holy magic thanks to the faith you have in me, correct? That is how the arrangement works—it is an absolute law. It is my family’s duty to protect my people, and to me, the rest matters little.”</p>
<p>So to sum up, the faith’s refusal to accept monsters stemmed from a need to grab the hearts of the people and bring them into the faith. No, maybe that tenet <em>doesn’t</em> need to be so strictly enforced. Bending too much along those lines would cause chaos in the Western Holy Church, but there was no need to go that far. Basically—the way I was reading this—if the people here could find a reason to accept us, the rest of the kingdom would fall in line.</p>
<p>It sounded like we had an agreement, then. But Renard’s frown said he still wasn’t convinced.</p>
<p>“I understand, then, that our doctrine is not based on the will of <a id="page-64"></a>our god, Lady Luminus. But practically speaking, that is the exact doctrine all of us have spent our lives following. I fear that simply doing away with it would create issues…”</p>
<p>He had a point. Completely ignoring everything built up to now would lead to a huge backlash from the faithful, not to mention the current Church organization. Even if Luminus herself came out in public to appeal to the masses, there was no saying if anyone would believe it was her—and there was no way Luminus would do anything <em>that</em> proactive anyway. There was every chance of rifts forming between the paladins assembled here and the more hardcore factions of the Church.</p>
<p>“But we have to do it,” Hinata solemnly said to the troubled-looking Renard. “I was hoping we could keep silent on this until things settle down, but we have a force of a hundred paladins here, and I’m sure the other nations are aware of us. Plus, those journalists were there to see a Battlesage be defeated, weren’t they?”</p>
<p>Her gaze went from Renard to me. She was right. Diablo said he had defeated a man named Saare, one of the Three Battlesages. Another one was on the scene but apparently fled in rapid order. If the press saw all that, it could ruin this force’s reputation as protector of humanity. If rumors started spreading that the paladins were defeated, it could lead to all kinds of needless confusion. Diablo said it was possible to coerce the media, if need be, but… Ugghhh, what a pain.</p>
<p>“Okay, well, how about we just say Hinata and I dueled to a draw? Then we signed a truce after discovering the Seven Days Clergy’s scheme. People already know I’m a slime for the most part, but if we spread the word that I’m an otherworlder, you think that would be a bit more convincing?”</p>
<p>“I do appreciate that proposal,” Hinata said, “but are you fine with that? Wouldn’t a demon lord fighting me to a draw affect your reputation?”</p>
<p><em>My reputation? Do I have much of one, really? I feel like I’ve done nothing but get yelled at by Shuna lately. Whenever problems come up, I toss them right into Rigurd’s lap. For the most part, my main <a id="page-65"></a>responsibility in town lately has been joining Gobta on his assorted jaunts. I didn’t think a draw or two is gonna trash my rep that much.</em></p>
<p>“I don’t see the problem. I mean, hell, you can say I lost for all I care.”</p>
<p>Who won, and who lost, didn’t really matter, I thought. But everyone on Hinata’s side stared at me in shock.</p>
<p>“Um, look, in all of history, there’s only been a tiny handful of times when a human defeated a demon lord, you know? If you just say ‘Oops, I lost’ like that, that really <em>will</em> wreck the balance of power around here. It’d create trouble for you.”</p>
<p>“She—she’s right!” bellowed Renard. “You are still just a fledgling demon lord. Let another force push you around right now, and that could invite interlopers aiming for your head!”</p>
<p>I suppose they are worrying for my sake, but… I dunno…</p>
<p>“Benimaru, can you think of any rival forces who might try to interfere with us at this point?”</p>
<p>“None, sir. If anyone was foolish enough to try, I would twist their heads off with my bare hands.”</p>
<p>Glad to hear.</p>
<p>Diablo seemed to be doing well over in the Western Nations. Rescuing the journalists’ lives let him proceed with his plan, even if it had involved a bit of extra force. It wouldn’t be long, he said, before reports would go around about Yohm being crowned the new king—and the smaller nations surrounding Farmus would pitch in to support this.</p>
<p>Assuming all went to plan, the only individual nation who could possibly try to tangle with us was Englesia. With Luminus giving us a hundred-year truce, the Western Nations were as good as ours, really. The same was true of the demon lords. Me killing Clayman was one stellar performance. If we spread rumors that I lost despite looking perfectly healthy to everyone, I’m not sure people would believe them. If anything, they might grow <em>more</em> careful dealing with me, fearing a trap or something.</p>
<p>“You sound pretty confident,” Hinata said. “Well, in that case, I don’t have any objection. If anything, I’ll be glad to take advantage of it.”</p>
<p><a id="page-66"></a>“Yeah! Let’s take this opportunity to announce to the world that the Tempestians aren’t evil at all!”</p>
<p>“Very true. Everyone here’s so nice to us! It’s so hard to believe they were all goblins and orcs not long ago.”</p>
<p>“There had been some internal debate over whether demi-humans counted as monsters or not…but nowadays, I think that’s far too narrow a view to take. It’s just prejudice talking.”</p>
<p>“You said it. Demi-humans are a formidable foe against humans, but dwarves, at least, are certainly human. If we started calling <em>them</em> monsters, then it’d be impossible to tell spirits apart from monsters, either.”</p>
<p>Ogres and lizardmen had normally been treated as demi-humans up to now, too, but thanks to their hostility against humankind, they had been branded as monsters. Oni and dragonewts—the next evolution up from each respective race—were treated not as monsters, but as local gods. All that really mattered, in the end, was whether you were friend or foe to humankind—and that meant it was hard to interpret Luminist doctrine as a carte-blanche condemnation of all monsters.</p>
<p>“Well,” I said, “we have formal relations with the Dwarven Kingdom. Why don’t we mix King Gazel into this and sign a hundred-year friendship treaty? If we can get him to guarantee that we won’t attack people, that ought to change a few minds, right?”</p>
<p>Hinata thoughtfully nodded, reaching her own conclusions in her mind. “Yes… If we can just build a little trust, that would make it easier to convince people. Plus, with things as they are, it’s probably about time to purge all the people who were poisoned by the Clergy.”</p>
<p>The Western Holy Church was hardly a monolith. No large organization is. And with Hinata putting it in such cold, blunt terms, all opposition was silenced. I guess she wanted to use this chance to lay all the guilt on the Seven Days Clergy—kind of dirty, I thought, but that was a Lubelius issue. Certainly nothing I had a right to comment on. We then began to work out some of the smaller details.</p>
<p class="space-break1">For our future interactions, it was agreed that Arnaud and Bacchus would stay here in Tempest. They’d go back home to prepare first, then return with a few civil bureaucrats in tow. I was planning to build a Luminist church in town in the meantime for their use, and I didn’t see it taking any longer than a couple weeks. Maybe we’d start to see some Luminists around here once we were done.</p>
<p>I was honestly a little anxious about allowing full freedom of religion, but…ahhh, I’m sure we’d figure it out. Monsters, frankly, are atheists. There was no such thing as a single god that was widely recognized by everyone across the world. My conventional wisdom from my own planet didn’t apply, really. There <em>was</em> religion, yes, but it was usually more like paying your respects to the local deity than anything very fervent—and these deities could quite literally help you out if you prayed to them, because, like, they were right there. The Dragon Faithful’s relationship with Milim is a prime example.</p>
<p>Along those lines, Luminism was really nothing more than the biggest player in an extremely crowded arena full of religions like that. The Crusaders served as Luminus’s servants, protecting the weak and earning new adherents to the faith. So if you look at it that way, I could see a church in Tempest as a kind of center for Western Holy Church–style support of the vulnerable. You gotta help out your neighbor and all that, although I doubt they could offer much help to us. It’d at least mean we could fight alongside paladins if some kind of threat appeared.</p>
<p>There was no real reason not to take this opportunity. We’d keep close tabs on the local church, of course, but I figured we could grant them a certain amount of freedom. That was the common ground we found.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">That was the end of the tough stuff. We had a deal with Luminus, more or less, and we had managed to get Lubelius to recognize us as a legitimate nation. That was more than enough compensation—now, <a id="page-68"></a>if we could just keep interacting and getting along, it’d be perfect. I’d like to use our century-long time limit to build a deeper understanding of each other, and that meant we’d be interacting regularly with the Crusaders.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The first effort along those lines involved providing skills and tech to each other. The battle earlier had smashed up a lot of the paladins’ weapons, so they needed someone to repair them. We offered our skills in response, but that was kind of a front—what we really wanted to do was see what their weapons were capable of.</p>
<p>This allowed us access to one of those strange light-based suits of armor I saw. As Raphael put it, it provided the wielder’s magical force to a spiritual life-form, letting them manifest it into a physical object. The one gifted to us had been overused and broken, so we traded it for a new Garm-produced armor set. The paladins, still feeling a bit indebted to us, gladly let us have it as part of their general apology, and while I expected Hinata to whine about it, she was actually fine.</p>
<p>I decided to reciprocate by giving her a sword I had made.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The sword Hinata used is called Moonlight. Luminus gave it to her herself, and it housed untold amounts of power—too much, really. I asked her, and she called it a Legend-class weapon, beyond even the Unique level that I thought was the highest.</p>
<p>Kaijin and Kurobe taught me that magisteel can evolve over many years, allowing well-worn, first-class weapons and armor to continue honing and polishing themselves. This evolution can provide a massive boost out of thin air, something proven by the way ancient weapons found in ruins sometimes boasted out-of-this-world abilities that modern technology couldn’t replicate. This was the so-called Legend class, and apparently they were usually kept away from general access.</p>
<p>It was Kurobe and Garm’s goal to craft equipment along these lines. They stared at Hinata’s Moonlight, transfixed by it. <em>I hope they’re up to the task.</em></p>
<p>The thing about a sword this all-powerful is that you can really <a id="page-69"></a>only use it when absolutely needed. If you decided to whip it out on the street in the afternoon, you could raze the entire city block to rubble before you realized what was happening. It’d be like carrying a machine gun instead of a pistol for self-defense—just not the kind of thing you’d go bandying around every day.</p>
<p>It was the equivalent of a pistol that I thought about gifting her, and she liked it much more than I anticipated. It was a new version of the broken rapier I had consumed earlier, analyzed and improved for her. It was in the Unique class feature-wise, and I’m sure it felt the same way in her hand. I even re-created the unique ability it had to always kill its target on the seventh attack.</p>
<p>They also gave me a broken longsword—the Dragonbuster is what they called it. It was even more feeble than I thought, and I wasn’t really sure you could slay someone like Veldora with it. I also inquired about her Holy Spirit Armor, but she sadly replied that she couldn’t show that to me. It was an original, one-of-a-kind piece made just for Hinata, and I really wanted to analyze it, but…</p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Report. It has already been analyzed and assessed from the information gathered during battle.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1">…Whuh?!</p>
<p>M-man, does anything ever get by Raphael? Should I start calling it Professor or what?</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>…</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Oops, got on its bad side again. Better just give it my thanks and move on.</p>
<p>I really had no idea, though. This is a huge feat. I can’t get enough of that guy. According to it, we could take the assessment from some inferior spirit armor, then combine it with Hinata’s battle data to re-create Holy Spirit Armor. This belonged to the holy element, but you could also tinker with the fundamentals of it to turn it into a demonic piece.</p>
<p><em>Sorry, Hinata. I guess this Holy Spirit Armor’s a national secret, but a <a id="page-70"></a>quick bit of Analyze and Assess and it’s mine.</em> I would need to think about who to grant it to, though. It seemed kind of difficult to use. Now, though, our battle gear would be more polished than ever before.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">Between this, that, and the other thing, we were now even with each other. It was evening, and with the day’s work behind us, I figured the paladins would hit the trail soon, but I thought I’d at least be polite and offer them one more meal.</p>
<p>“Hey, uh, it’s getting late, Hinata, so why don’t you and Luminus save your departure for tomorrow?”</p>
<p>It was kind of silly. Luminus could go home with Spatial Motion anytime she liked, and I’m sure Hinata had a Warp Portal set up somewhere in Lubelius. The same was true of all the paladins, each one an A-grade fighter; I’m sure the journey home was no great effort to them. I imagined they’d just say “Sorry, but our work’s done here, nice knowing ya” and be on their way.</p>
<p>“Sorry, but—”</p>
<p>Yep. There it is.</p>
<p>“—if you insist on it, would you be willing to host us this evening?”</p>
<p>“Ah yes, I <em>did</em> like that hot spring of yours, and the food was simply excellent. What fun will we have tonight?”</p>
<p>Huh? Huhhhh?</p>
<p>I suppose neither Hinata nor Luminus was in any hurry to go anywhere. The paladins saw this, of course, and now they’d all need quarters for another night, too. They were all smiles now, chatting over what could be on the menu tonight. I wanted to ask if the Crusaders were really a bunch of freeloaders like this all along, but it was too late to whine about it. If they expect that much from us, let’s give them the time of their lives.</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Okay, today’s banquet will feature <em>sukiyaki</em>, a big bowl of beef simmered in vegetable broth!”</p>
<p><a id="page-71"></a>“““Yeaahhhhh!!”””</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what this feeling in me was. The paladins and my staff, mortal enemies until the previous day, were now salivating over the hearty meal they’d share shortly. They were happy, no doubt about that… But part of me wondered if this was really the right thing for them. I guess there were no rules about religious figures giving up meat or whatever in this world—it was hard enough to keep yourself fed at times without inventing restrictions for yourself.</p>
<p>So we decided to treat them to the cowdeer and chiducken we had started to raise, pairing their meat with some fresh-picked veggies. Tossing all that into a pot of boiling broth would be perfect, and Shuna knew exactly how to pull it off. First, she used chiducken bones to make a soup stock, using the meat on them for sashimi purposes. Then, for the main course, she butchered up some marbled cowdeer, making for some downright decadent hot pot. After that, all she had to do was remove the poison from the chiducken eggs and pass them around to everyone. There was no way this wouldn’t taste awesome.</p>
<p>“Okay, here’s to our future friendship. Cheers!”</p>
<p>“““Cheers!!”””</p>
<p>We also had more fresh-cooked rice, the big hit of the previous day’s feast. Ignore the black color, of course. My beloved white rice would just go to waste on these guys. Hinata was staring longingly at my personal rice bowl last night, though, so I gave her a serving—from one otherworlder to another. When it comes to rice, plain white is where it’s at, although I’m no stranger to assorted seasonings, too. I was also getting some rice in from Blumund that I had them test out for me, but it still needed some improvement. It was a wholly different beast from the white rice before me.</p>
<p>“White rice, though… Don’t you find this almost selfish, in a way?”</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what Hinata was complaining about. Her voice was even shaking a little. What was she, jealous?</p>
<p>“Well, if you don’t like it, I’ll be glad to take it away—”</p>
<p>“I’m not talking about that,” she snapped back, protecting her <a id="page-72"></a>bowl with her life. <em>Geez, don’t get too worked up about this crap.</em> Not that I’d say that to her. “I just mean… Being able to so perfectly re-create food from that other world? It’s more exasperating than surprising, in a way. I can’t believe you’ve created such a life of luxury for yourself, in the space of just two years. Just casually achieving all these things none of us ever would’ve hoped to manage…”</p>
<p>“Hey, praise me all you want. I’m here all night.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid. I mean, I heard stories about you from Yuuki, but I took them all with a grain of salt. He was just relaying the reports he heard from his spies, after all. But <em>this</em>…” She shrugged. “I don’t think I’d ever believe it if I wasn’t seeing it with my own eyes.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure how to respond. I was nowhere near the finish line.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m far from done yet. Transport’s still super-slow, and it takes forever to transmit information from one place to the other. With magic, though, it was straightforward enough to improve our food and living conditions, more or less.”</p>
<p>“More or less…? <em>That’s</em> how you describe re-creating all this delicious food? You realize it makes you sound like you’re ridiculing all our hard work and sweat up to now?!”</p>
<p>I managed to set her off again. But really, if I was satisfied with this, then I’d never develop things any further. I’m a king, pretty much, and a king needs to be at least a little greedy. Not “king” so much as demon lord, but same difference.</p>
<p>“Well, I mean, we’re pretty good in the forest food-wise, you know? The real issue is the culture. There’s just way too little entertainment. I want to build the foundation for things like…you know, manga. Like what Veldora’s reading.”</p>
<p>“<em>Entertainment?</em> Do you realize how harsh a world this is? A world where the majority of people have to fight tooth and nail to see another day?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know. And that’s why we’re gonna make sure monsters and things are no longer a threat. I mean, I’m just gonna come out and say this ’cause there’s no point hiding it, but we’re trying to install Yohm as king, build a new kingdom from his domain, and use that to draw the Western Nations into our sphere of influence.”</p>
<p><a id="page-73"></a>“Just what exactly are you planning? I’d like to know more details.”</p>
<p>Does she? Well, let’s tell her.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking about a lot, actually. For starters…”</p>
<p>I pecked at the hot pot as I explained my vision of the future to her.</p>
<p>Our current project involved getting the human world to recognize us, and this was already halfway done, with the leaders of many nations aware of who I was. I’d received reports of apparent spies going in and out of Tempest, so I’d taken a few measures to show them how harmless we were. The merchants and adventurers were spreading rumors of their own, and before long, even the common people would know we could coexist with them. It’d take time for that to really take root, yes, but we were on the path. No need to hurry it along.</p>
<p>After that came our road infrastructure. This was also well underway, as we had worked to build safe, efficient trade routes across our territory. Highways to Blumund and the Dwarven Kingdom were now open, and plans were in progress for a new road linking us to the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion. There were no paved roads to Eurazania at the moment, so I thought we could tackle that afterward.</p>
<p>Running in parallel with all this was experimentation with communication methods. I didn’t know how radios and stuff worked, so I had to give up on that. Raphael could tell me if I asked, but I didn’t have the brainpower to help everyone <em>else</em> understand it. Kaijin and the three dwarven brothers might, maybe, but I didn’t want to rely on them for everything. Thus, I decided to leave that issue to the next generation and build schools to provide education for our children. These were simple one-room affairs for now, but I was having them learn basic reading, writing, and arithmetic. Before long, I intended to bring in some humans to provide more in-depth instruction.</p>
<p>But getting back to the subject, the communication crystals that served the world now could only be used by the magically inclined. They were magical items themselves, which meant they were <a id="page-74"></a>vulnerable to theft. That was hardly a theoretical problem, and more to the point, if you needed to send out an emergency message, you’d never know if a wizard was nearby to help.</p>
<p>We needed a system that anyone could use and where theft wasn’t an issue. It seemed beyond all probability, but it was actually pretty within reach. My idea involved the use of Sticky Steel Thread and magisteel. I tried the first out with Soei, but my transmission skills over the thread were honestly pretty astounding. Since it worked with magicules, you could get your voice and thoughts across with remarkable clarity.</p>
<p>Magisteel was packed with those same magicules as well, so I thought it could work largely the same way—and after some experimentation, it did. What we could do is work magisteel into wires about a half an inch thick, run them through the dimension used by Shadow Motion, and connect the world’s cities together with it. That alone wouldn’t accomplish anything, but attaching this network to the device Vester and his team were developing could convert waves of passing thought into real-life sights and sounds. This device required no magical force to use, so I wanted to get it running as soon as it was complete. In the meantime, we needed to gather the requisite amount of magisteel and get ready.</p>
<p>With the amount of monsters we had in this nation, regular iron ore kept in storage would transform itself into magic ore. This could then be processed into magisteel wire, with Shadow Motion practitioners doing the wiring work. Nothing would really serve as physical obstacles to this network, so installation wouldn’t be that terribly difficult. Once we really had the ball rolling, I also had plans to expand the network from the cities to the smaller villages. Now all we had to do was develop the necessary receivers.</p>
<p>Really, as someone who had lived in a data-driven society, communication speed was seriously important to me.</p>
<p>“What do you think? That’ll be super-useful when it’s done, won’t it?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but sound a little full of myself in front of Hinata.</p>
<p>Once this network was complete, it was time to start transmitting <a id="page-75"></a>entertainment and nurturing a nascent culture. There were so many dreams I had and a mountain of things left to do—and if I wanted to get any of it done, I had to provide safe and comfortable lives for my people.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, the meeting hall had grown quiet. The paladins were frozen in place, perhaps enraptured by my speech. My own officials, meanwhile, were practically smoldering with anticipation; listening to me inspired them more than ever before.</p>
<p>Then Hinata rolled her eyes. “Look,” she muttered. “That kind of information is <em>normally</em> kept confidential by governments, did you know that? I mean, matters related to communications, in particular… You just don’t go telling that to outsiders. Not that I’m complaining, but…”</p>
<p>Hmm. If you phrased it like <em>that,</em> then okay, maybe that was a mistake. Maybe I got carried away and said a little too much. Must have been the alcohol talking.</p>
<p>But even considering the possibility was a mistake. The moment I thought <em>Uh-oh, did I screw up?</em> Raphael jumped to conclusions.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Report. Resetting Cancel Ailments. This resistance cannot be adjusted for the time being.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>Wh-what?!</em></p>
<p>But it was already too late. Even worse, a “reset” wasn’t something you could do all the time. Whether I wanted it or not, the poison was being cleansed from my body. <em>But booze isn’t poison!</em> I thought to no avail. My skills were just merciless.</p>
<p>Of course, I suppose this happened because I still had a pounding headache from getting wildly drunk the day before. I cut a little too loose for my own good, and that was the cause of it. Maybe I’d be more tight-lipped toward Hinata if I wasn’t inebriated. Let’s just call it my just deserts and move on.</p>
<p>I glanced at Hinata, just in time to see the jolly man next to her—Fritz, was it?—steal a piece of top-grade beef from her plate. Looks like I’m not the only guy in this room who played with alcohol a little too much.</p>
<p><a id="page-76"></a>“Now, now, what’s the big deal, Lady Hinata? That just shows how much he trusts us! Oh hey, and if you aren’t eating that, I’ll take the rest!”</p>
<p>I think he was a top officer in this force. He certainly robbed Hinata’s plate with lightning-fast dexterity, at least. Still, it must have taken a few drinky-drinks to decide it was worth the risk.</p>
<p>The moment Fritz tossed the morsel into his mouth, I could see a vein throb in the vicinity of Hinata’s temple. Her natural paleness made it all the more visible, although it would’ve been impossible to miss no matter what color her skin was.</p>
<p>“Fritz… Were you looking to die today?”</p>
<p>“Um…? Lady Hinata, you’re looking so…serious…”</p>
<p>Now Fritz’s mind was perfectly clear, as he shot to his feet and attempted to run for it. But he couldn’t escape Hinata, who promptly landed a chop on his jaw that instantly sent him to the floor with a concussion.</p>
<p><em>Let this be a lesson on how to enjoy a drink responsibly.</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">The next day:</p>
<p>“Back to our conversation yesterday, you realize that if you draw too much attention with all of that, the angels are going to attack you, right?”</p>
<p>Hinata blurted it out just before leaving, as if she had just thought of it. It wasn’t really the kind of thing you could bring up at the drunken, festive feast we had last night, but since we weren’t going to be strangers any longer, I suppose she thought it important to mention.</p>
<p>Erald and Gazel mentioned those guys to me before—the angelic army. Each one of these “angels” or whatever, according to Hinata, was a B-plus threat, and they had a force that numbered a million strong, all ready to swarm me. It was quite a bit beyond what I pictured, and <em>that</em> was just the infantry—there were captains and commanders above them, with a full chain of command between. The generals in their force—yes, there were generals—had even tangled with demon lords, if you went far enough back in history. <a id="page-77"></a>Their ability in battle was a question mark, but if they were a good match for a demon lord, they must’ve been pretty strong.</p>
<p>The angels targeted monsters and cities with advanced civilizations. Not even the Western Holy Church saw them as allies of humankind—which made sense, given that their god, Luminus, was actually a demon lord.</p>
<p>“To me,” Luminus told me, “they are little more than annoying flies. I would love to do away with them all, but then everyone would know my identity…and that lizard’s already betrayed me to the paladins, as you know.”</p>
<p>The paladins, by the way, had sworn to keep this revelation a secret. Hopefully, they’d be a bit more accommodating with one another—and me—in the future.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ve heard about these angels. If they are out to poke at me, I’m ready to fight back.”</p>
<p>I had no intention of holding back, no. That angel force was free to think and do whatever they wanted, but if they thought they could force their will upon us, fending them off would be my only choice.</p>
<p>Hinata chuckled at me. “I thought you would say that. We might even be fighting on the same side, when the time comes.”</p>
<p>“That you may, and that <em>we</em> may,” Luminus said. “I have no intention of watching my city be destroyed a second time—not by those flies and not by that lizard. Rimuru, unless you enjoy having me as an enemy, I would recommend giving your lizard a <em>strict</em> education.”</p>
<p><em>This has been a very useful meeting</em>, I thought as they departed. I think we could build a pretty friendly relationship with Hinata and her forces, to say nothing of Luminus. The battle between us, Lubelius, and part of the Western Nations was over, and I’d say every side walked away happy from it.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Before long, and with next to no warning, Lubelius would give the Dwarven Kingdom more than tacit approval and officially recognize the nation as a land of humans it could potentially become allies with. They also formally announced diplomatic relations <a id="page-78"></a>with the Jura-Tempest Federation, a nation of monsters—one that included a nonaggression pact, albeit one with a time limit.</p>
<p>Now, in one fell swoop, both demi-humans and monsters had been granted acceptance by human minds. It was time to explore how to build our relations from there.</p>
