<p><a id="page-39"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">“Sir Rimuru, where are you looking?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Shuna had paused her serving, looking at me with a smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">It was strange. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.3">Her voice sounded so gentle, but something about it seemed as frozen as ice.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“No, no, nowhere! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">But, Hinata… If that misunderstanding’s all cleared up, then we’re all good, I promise! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">If you could just drop your prejudices against monsters, then all the better!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Hinata appeared lost for a moment at my forced change of subject, but then wordlessly nodded.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">I knew I was asking a lot, really. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">A monster, in essence, was kind of like a violent offender with a gun in his hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">If you believe one without question and innocent people get killed later, you have to recognize that you set yourself up for failure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">Maybe we could speak to each other, and maybe that didn’t mean we could </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">really</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1"> understand…but this town could make it work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">People were believing me and trying to play nice with humans—even after Shion and Team Reborn had been killed by human hands.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">“I mean, I know you won’t trust me that easily or anything. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">You never know what the other side’s </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">really</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1"> thinking, and I guess some monsters can be a lot slyer and more conniving than others. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">If you’re a defender of humanity, you can’t afford to be tricked </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">all</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1"> the time.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">“…True. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">Conversation is the first step to a common understanding, but it can lead to some dangerous transactions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">You run the risk of making commitments that bind you, heart and soul.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">“Yeah, I bet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">But if you can at least not declare that all monsters are evil, we’re totally fine with that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.3">And if you got a monster you’re iffy about, we’ll take ’em in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.4">If human society can’t accept ’em, they’ll be fine here.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">That was about the best compromise I could give. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">Any monsters deemed suspect could easily be taken into Tempest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">Here in town, at least, we could be sure they wouldn’t cause any trouble…assuming we could reason with the guy anyway.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">I don’t think our thoughts are going to change if I snap my fingers, but I will prohibit my ranks from condemning all monsters as evil. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">Is that all right with you, Lady Luminus?”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-40"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“I care not for such trivial matters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">But if it leads citizens to doubt their faith in me, I will </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">not</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1"> stand for that.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">I will observe that as our first priority.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">Luminus seemed convinced. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Given how the Holy Empire of Lubelius was wholly built around the people’s faith in the god Luminus, any cracks in that faith could affect the entire foundation of that belief. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">That religion holds great sway over the Western Nations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.4">I could understand Hinata’s caution.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">If anything, though, I feel like Luminus underestimated the influence she had on people. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">She goes on about how she “will not stand” for things, but then she acts like she’s above it all and none of it matters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">Maybe being bandied around as a supreme being wasn’t Luminus’s intention at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.4">I could just have been overthinking it, but it seemed like Louis was the de facto head of government, and Hinata did pretty much all her errands for her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.5">Even all </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1"> drama was perpetrated by the Seven Days.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">But… Really, though? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">An old demon lord who’s ruled in the shadows for so long was really just a lazy girl palming off responsibility on others? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">No way, no how. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.4">She reminded me of the style I was aiming for with Tempest—“Let the king reign, not govern”—so I couldn’t help thinking about it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Now Hinata’s eyes were turned toward my officials. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">“I must thank all of you as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">I promise I will not treat you as hostile enemies simply for being monsters.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">She bowed her head deeply, and the other paladins hurriedly followed her lead, shouting “We’re sorry!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">together.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“Please, think nothing of it,” Rigurd said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">“Were it not for Sir Rimuru’s orders, we would have considered humans our foes as well.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">In other words, my orders had changed their minds. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">For a goblin who’s just trying his best to stay alive, I’m sure anyone who doesn’t look like you is an enemy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">“I am just glad you aren’t against us,” said Benimaru with a bold grin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">“I saw your battle against Sir Rimuru, and I doubt even I could have defeated you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">The fact that his attention was devoted to combat was certainly very Benimaru-like. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">Soei nodded his solemn agreement next to him.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-41"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">The world of monsters has always had a broad “survival of the fittest” streak to it; if you’re deemed the enemy and killed for it, it’s your own fault for being weaker. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">That’s how Soei’s mind worked, and he had no particular grudge against the paladins.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Shion, meanwhile, was dubious. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">Hinata’s apology must have confused her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“Here, Shion, you forgive her, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">I understand your pain and anger, but it’s not like every human being on earth is evil. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">You have some bad guys and some good guys. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.4">That’s all there is to it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.5">And monsters are the same way; you have to get a closer look if you want to really know anything. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.6">Plus, humans are capable of overcoming their mistakes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.7">And not just them, either, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.8">Us too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.9">What’s important is what’s in your soul, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Instead of dividing all living things into humans and monsters, it was more important to see how they lived, what existed in their souls. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">I wanted Shion to understand that, but my pleas seemed to just unnerve her even more. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">Humans, I suppose, really </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">were</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1"> evil to her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">I just didn’t want her to think they were all that way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">She was following my orders for now, but there’s no telling when her frustrations would explode. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.4">I couldn’t have that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.5">Instead of just following my orders, I wanted her to move and act on her own free will.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">But perhaps I was too worried. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">In a single moment, Shion threw away all her hesitation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">She never was one for thinking about matters too deeply.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“All right!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">she blurted out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3">“Just like you, Sir Rimuru, I will judge good and bad people based on their souls!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">She beamed, as if unshouldering some heavy burden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">Maybe she had just climbed over some kind of tall barrier in her mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">It’s not like I could see anyone’s souls, exactly, but if that won over Shion, then great.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Team Reborn didn’t seem to have any issues, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">There was no apparent bad blood with the paladins, and like Shion, I think they had it in them to judge people on their own merits. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">Nice of them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.4">I sure was proud.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">So then it was settled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">I accepted the apology and let the mistakes fall into the past. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">The borderline between forgivable and </span><a id="page-42"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">unforgivable was always tricky to discern, but we had made up well enough this time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">If you can speak the same language as the other side, it’s always possible for both of you to accept each other’s feelings.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">He wasn’t supposed to require food at all, I didn’t think, but from the moment of his resurrection, he had been demanding it for some reason. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">His love for cakes and such was already common knowledge, but he whined at me a lot about other types of cuisine as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">I knew he was revved up about the feast we had for tonight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.4">Let’s get him involved.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">But before that, a toast. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">I made one up on the spot to get things started.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“Well, here’s to the battles we’ve all fought—and all the ones to come. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Cheers!”</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">A nice, cold mug, straight from the hot bath. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">No better moment in your life. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.3">And I was prepared, of course—we had all the treasured liquor my nation had to offer, and there would be no holding back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.4">No mistake about it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Wine was the staple drink in Englesia, I had learned. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">Beer existed, but it just wasn’t very good. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">It lacked carbonation and the aroma from the bubbles, and being served at room temperature did it no favors, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.4">My nation had conquered all those problems—don’t let anyone tell you I didn’t have a passion for food. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.5">After all this research, day and night, our selection of offerings was now far more robust than it was when I first visited the Dwarven Kingdom. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.6">Sheesh—it’s almost like I say something, and they immediately begin development on it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.7">Was this because I was a demon lord now? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.8">Actually, I guess it was kind of always this way…</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">We kicked things off by having a group of women, all well versed in holding banquets like this, pour drinks for everyone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">The first mouthful was a surprise to them, I could tell, but the moment they tucked into their food, they paused and looked at the others around them to gauge their responses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">The taste must have astonished them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.4">I grinned to myself, relieved.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Preparing sashimi had become a specialty of Hakuro’s. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">He wasn’t with us tonight, but a number of chefs had been training under him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">That whole process—developing the next generation of kitchen staff—was going pretty well, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.4">You could see them improve as time passed, their offerings growing more diverse and mouthwatering by the day.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Hinata listened to my defense, looking a bit exasperated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">“…Right.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.3">She sighed, resigned. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.4">“With a skill, you could transport that stuff without altering it at all…and you have a lot of people in this nation who can handle the job. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.5">I just can’t believe you’re using all this for yourself, as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">That sounded a bit rude to me, but ah well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">I suppose I had answered Hinata’s question, but I didn’t really see what her problem was with it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.3">If something’s available to use, why not use it?</span></p>
<p><a id="page-45"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">“Well,” interrupted Luminus, “what is the harm in it, Hinata? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">No matter the story behind it, there is no doubting how delicious this all is. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.3">I, for one, am very impressed.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">She had a cup in her hand and looked to be well on her way, alcohol-wise, as she scarfed down another piece of tempura. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">She was grabbing them with her fingers but still somehow managed to look elegant doing it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.3">Which was fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.4">If you weren’t offending anyone, you could eat any way you liked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.5">You can’t force chopsticks on someone who has never seen them before.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">And speaking of which, that was actually kind of a thorny problem. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">Benimaru and the other ogres could work with chopsticks just fine, and the monsters of Tempest had largely learned by watching us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.3">This wasn’t the case for the merchants and adventurers who came from foreign lands. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.4">I was contemplating inviting nobility from across the world to build ourselves into a travel hot spot, so I wanted to be sure chopsticks remained an optional selection for them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">Along those lines, Luminus was proving an interesting research subject. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">You could use a knife and fork, a pair of chopsticks, or your fingers, and while hot food required chopsticks, she otherwise had no qualms about eating with her hands. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">Different types of food were eaten in different ways, after all, and there was no reason to put our visitors off by insisting on some “foreign” way of eating. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.4">Maybe it’s best to just say “Hey, we can eat </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1"> way, too,” then wait as the habit gradually takes hold.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">“Do you like our offerings?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">I asked Luminus.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">The observation made me realize that Luminus was downing the alcohol at an alarming speed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">Milim was pretty strong, but Luminus was a powerhouse, knocking back any cup offered alongside her tempura.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">This “black rice” was made using a type of plant raised on magicule water—the highly magical water found inside the Sealed Cave. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">I suggested trying that out as an experiment, and it resulted in rice that looked like an octopus squirted ink all over it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.3">For someone like me, who enjoyed his rice hot, white, and fluffy, it looked absolutely gross—but it tasted good. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">Really</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1"> good, in fact. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">It was also packed with nutrients, surprisingly, so we called the crop blackspell rice and moved into full production of it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">It was now a staple of Tempestian cuisine, but I was pretty sure there was some kind of issue with it I was forgetting—</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">“Whoa!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">I shouted, alarmed all the way back to sobriety. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.3">“That stuff’s poisonous to humans!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">Unfortunately, I was too late. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">Fritz already had some in his mouth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.3">And his first reaction:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">“Why, this… This is restoring my magical force!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">“Um, do you feel all right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">Not sick or anything?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">A weaker being taking in large quantities of magic could have hazardous health effects. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">This blackspell rice was packed with magicules, which meant it was toxic to those with less-than-robust constitutions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.3">Of course, it could also be a medicine in the right dosage—and like I said, potentially a dietary staple. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.4">Nobody in Tempest would have an issue with it, but I still hadn’t tested out what it did to humans. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.5">Finding test subjects wasn’t exactly easy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">Fritz’s reaction, however, was unexpected to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">I assumed it’d be harmful to </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">Homo sapiens</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">, but maybe it’s beneficial to you if you have enough magical force?</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">Understood. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">The subject Fritz’s magic power–recovery effect has been confirmed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.3">Those with resistance to magicules seem to be able to convert them into energy.</span></em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">Ah, I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">Maybe eating this now, after exhausting his magic in that huge fight, made it all the more effective.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">The other paladins, seeing this, immediately clamored for tastes of their own. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">Having a few pints in you could be a dangerous thing sometimes; none were afraid of the side effects. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.3">So I agreed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">Hinata gave the blackspell rice a funny look, likely reacting the same way I did at first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">But without further complaint, she sipped from the bowl of </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">chazuke</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">, consisting of the black rice with some tea poured on top of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.2">I also offered it in rice-ball form for those who wanted something a little heartier. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.3">Both selections were huge hits, and a second round was carried out to the party in very short order. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.4">Considering that I busted out my personal stash of white rice for this event, it was funny to see the blackspell rice be the toast of the night instead—but hey, if you aren’t conditioned to be turned off by the color like I was, it must’ve been much more acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">So now I knew what this new breed of rice could do, and between that and all the other food and drink, I thought we were making a pretty good impression. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">I was starting to see monsters and paladins chatting with each other, taking advantage of the opportunity presented to them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.3">Shion was even engaged in an impromptu arm-wrestling tournament with three of the paladins—dominating them, by the looks of it, but her opponents were all smiles regardless. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.4">I liked the trends I saw. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.5">Alcohol played no small role in it, perhaps, but if this became the natural flow of things, it wouldn’t be long before we’re all on friendly terms.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">Good things to eat, enjoyable days to spend—that was my goal, and I wasn’t afraid to strive for it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">If I have any job here, I suppose, it’s to make sure this sight doesn’t go extinct. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.3">It gave me new resolve.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">Then:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">“What are you doing, Rimuru?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.2">Drink up, drink up! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.3">Let me fill your cup!”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-49"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">“Yes, yes! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.2">You have the demon lord Luminus accompanying you! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.3">Let us enjoy this evening as much as we can!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">“Wh-whoa,” I said, “chill out, Veldora. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">Also, aren’t you a vampire, Luminus? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.3">Why are you eating and getting drunk and—?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">“Silence, you fool! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">Once you grow powerful enough, even a vampire can gain sustenance enough from regular food. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.3">Now hurry up and empty your mug!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">That wasn’t what I was getting at, but she was in no mood to listen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.2">So there I was, two drunken louts on both sides of me, feeling that newfound resolve disappear from my mind.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">“Guys! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">Hey!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">Before I could stop them, they were taking shots from the sake we brewed from the blackspell rice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.2">“Slow it down, you two,” I thought I heard Hinata curtly whispering at them—she had a faint smile, though, so maybe the booze was giving me auditory hallucinations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.3">She was kind of cute, actually, when she smiled—not that I was gonna tell her.</span></p>

<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">Thanks for the feedback, man. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">Raphael sounded a bit peeved, but I was sure I was imagining it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.3">Nobody’s skills get mad at them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">I shook the mental cobwebs away. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.2">Today we had an important meeting to conduct—one that could decide how Tempest and the Holy Empire of Lubelius dealt with each other going forward.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">I was now seated in our usual meeting hall, soldiering through my headache.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">Honestly speaking, if things had turned out differently, we might’ve been fighting both Lubelius and the Western Nations affiliated with it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">The Papacy had given the Temple Knights stationed in </span><a id="page-50"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">Farmus permission to act, and if worse came to worse, the casualties on our side would’ve been eye-popping. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.2">If you thought about it like that, we couldn’t afford to be too chill here.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">On the other hand, though, I was done punishing Farmus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.2">Not a single one of the Temple Knights who conspired against us was breathing today. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.3">We had a duty to govern over there, so I wasn’t exactly an impartial observer…but Hinata had already apologized to me, and the masterminds who schemed against us were already gone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.4">If we could build friendly relations, we were golden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.5">There wasn’t much point asking for reparations—we already had plenty of that from Clayman’s and Farmus’s coffers, and Farmus was physically far enough away from us that annexing it or making it into some kinda colony was too much of a pain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.6">If the other side had admitted fault, money honestly wasn’t as important to me as working to build relations.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">In time, Luminus and her people entered the hall.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">Tempest was represented here by me, Shion, Rigurd, and Benimaru, along with Rugurd, Regurd, and Rogurd, the government ministers of justice, legislation, and administration, respectively. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">Veldora was there, too, but safely ignorable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.3">He had some manga to read, and I doubted he’d even bother to pay attention.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">From Lubelius, meanwhile, we had Luminus, Louis, Hinata, and the five top paladin officials. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">I had them all make their formal introductions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.3">There was Vice Captain Renard, the Noble of Light. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.4">There was Arnaud of Air, the strongest of the force after Hinata, and under him was Bacchus of Earth, Litus of Water, and Fritz of Wind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.5">I had us all seated facing one another, and with that, the proceedings began.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">I wanted to start with a brainstorm session to see what each side’s takes were on this situation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">Along those lines, I created a list of issues affecting all of us and passed them out to everyone to kick things off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.3">This was just to ensure we were all on the same page; I didn’t want to turn this conference into a blame game, so if we disagreed on how we saw matters, I wanted it fixed as soon as possible, and so did Hinata.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">Our respective stances were about what I figured.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">To us, of course, the whole story began with Farmus’s invasion of our land. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.2">Our view of this hadn’t changed; all we did was respond to moves made by the other side.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">On the Church’s end, Hinata told us that problems actually began before Farmus’s request to them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">Essentially, acknowledging the existence of a nation of monsters went against the teachings of Luminism, a pressing issue that threatened to cast doubt on the faith of its believers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.3">Leaving this unaddressed could trigger internal revolt and weaken the foothold the Western Holy Church had on the region. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.4">That’s why they had to destroy the monster nation, and that was why they needed a just cause, a good reason to conquer us.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">“That was the situation when we received the request from Archbishop Reyhiem, who was in Farmus at the time,” Hinata explained. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.2">“Cardinal Nicolaus gave his approval, and I had no objections to it—and besides, I still wanted to get back at you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">She intended, in other words, to take advantage of Farmus’s greed and seize the opportunity to annihilate us and gain revenge.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">“Was that about Shizu?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">“Yes, it was. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">I suppose I was just being used, though, looking back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.3">I don’t know who is operating behind the scenes, but there are definitely Eastern merchants involved.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">“Merchants? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.2">I knew it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.3">Clayman had a merchant or two he was particularly close to as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.4">Given how well armed Geld and his orcish army was, I assumed they were connected to one nation or another. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.5">I guess it was the East, then.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">I nodded, convinced. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.2">Judging by the account books I had Shuna look into, Clayman was dealing in a vast amount of merchandise—mainly goods from the Empire, originally crafted in the Dwarven Kingdom. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.3">That wasn’t suspicious, since the Empire and kingdom had regular trade with each other—but there were no records at all of the middlemen involved in this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.4">Shuna was thorough in her work, but she couldn’t find any of them, even after we asked the assorted officials we took prisoner. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.5">Clayman was careful, </span><a id="page-52"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">no doubt drumming it into his force that no evidence should ever be left behind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">We found absolutely nothing on the Moderate Jesters, either, the group closely affiliated with him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">Still, we could make educated guesses about who was involved. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">In Clayman’s castle, we found a collection of artwork, rare magic items, and other such goods, brought in from around the world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.3">The weapons and armor we discovered, however, were chiefly hand-me-downs from the Empire. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.4">They had teleportation magic, so they could’ve procured weapons from anywhere they wanted, but they got almost all of it in from the East. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.5">That suggested close connections, and while the evidence was circumstantial, it was still persuasive.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">That and their food supply. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.2">Clayman’s bases across the land held enormous stashes of fruit, bread, dairy, and luxury goods like alcohol. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.3">Being organic, they couldn’t be teleported; physical transport was a must with them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.4">Clayman’s domain, the Puppet Nation of Dhistav, apparently used slave labor for most of its agricultural output, but not everything we found in these stores was domestically produced—according to Shuna, some of it had to be imported from beyond their borders. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.5">The only real candidate for this was the Eastern Empire, adjacent to Dhistav. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.6">Milim’s domain, after all, was self-sufficient to the point that she barely even considered international trade—hell, she and the ex–demon lord Carillon didn’t even have currency to exchange.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">So I had my suspicions that Clayman was linked to people from the Eastern Empire.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">“That’s right,” Hinata said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">“They told me you killed Shizu, and you happened to be stationed in Englesia. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.3">That’s why I took the initiative to kill you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">“Yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.2">You couldn’t have picked a worse time, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.3">Even now, it still pisses me off when I think about it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">Hinata shivered a bit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.2">Arnaud and the other paladins looked similarly cowed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">“Enough coercion, you upstart brat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.2">I can feel the Lord’s Ambition coming from you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">Whoops! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.2">As Luminus just pointed out, a bit of my aura was </span><a id="page-53"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">leaking out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.2">I was pretty good at keeping it perfectly under my control, but I guess it gets kind of loose whenever I’m angry.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">“So,” I began after apologizing, “it’s pretty clear an Eastern merchant or merchants is behind this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.2">Do we know any names?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">“I know one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.2">He called himself Dahm, but I’m sure that’s an alias.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">An alias? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.2">Probably so. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.3">But the name didn’t really matter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.4">What </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1"> matter was narrowing the culprit down to the Empire’s merchant class.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">“So this merchant was connected to Clayman, and I’m willing to bet he and his people are the guys who set Farmus’s King Edmaris on us, too.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">“No, there’s no doubting that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.2">Reyhiem made that much clear enough in our questioning.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">I nodded. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.2">“Okay, so it’s clear Clayman was controlling Farmus from behind the curtain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.3">Not in a cooperative kind of way, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.4">It seems more coercive to me.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">“And you think the Eastern merchants were his boots on the ground?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.2">Benimaru asked.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">“And I suppose I was just another cog in the machine,” whispered Hinata.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">I could sense her anger. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.2">The question was: Who drew up the plans?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">“Well, based on how these merchants were involved with every step of this, I’m sure this was more than just a convenient business relationship. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.2">Clayman was trying to ascend to ‘true’ demon lord level. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.3">Farmus was trying to take our land for its own expansionist purposes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.4">And </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">someone</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">, we don’t know who, was engineering it all.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">“Someone, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.2">The one Clayman mentioned?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">I nodded at Luminus.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">Benimaru and the others already knew about this, but the humans in the room didn’t. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.2">Realizing this, I gave them a quick recap.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">“Well, it looks like Clayman was doing the bidding of someone else himself.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">“Yes,” Luminus added, “and he refused to divulge this someone’s </span><a id="page-54"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">identity until the very end. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">Impressive for someone as small-minded as him.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">“Oh…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">“Could this someone be the Seven Days, then?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">The idea came to me suddenly, and when I gave it voice, it felt even more plausible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">But Luminus shot me a dirty look.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">“What? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.2">Are you accusing the Seven Days of taking action unbeknownst to me?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">She might have wiped them off the planet by her own hand, but I guess she didn’t like people second-guessing her staff. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.2">That was fair. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.3">I was about to apologize when her associate Louis spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">“Hmm… I cannot fully deny that possibility, no.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">“Now </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">you’re</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1"> spouting that nonsense, Louis?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">Her ire had turned on Louis, though he appeared unbothered.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">“Lady Luminus, please, listen to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.2">The Seven Days Clergy craved your affection. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.3">I’m sure you sensed that?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">“How do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">“I am talking about the Love Energy, the energizing kiss you give in a special ceremony. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.2">The last time you did that for them, it was over a hundred years ago. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.3">At one point, it was a weekly rite, but the intervals between them grew longer and longer over time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.4">Did you not notice?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">Luminus gave Louis an unpleasant look. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.2">“Aha. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.3">Yes, my eternal youth tends to make me forget, but they all </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">were</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1"> human. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.2">Without my energy, they may not die, but they would certainly grow old.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">“Exactly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.2">That was why they worked so fervently to ensure no other ‘favorites’ besides them ever appeared.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">As Louis frankly put it, the Seven Days were once a very special presence in Luminus’s life. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.2">But as humans, they couldn’t live forever. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.3">This Love Energy rite must’ve been how they overcame that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">“…I subsequently imagine that they must have tried to curry favor with you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.2">It wouldn’t be strange at all to imagine them working with the Eastern merchants to secretly entice Clayman into action. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.3">They weren’t about to let Clayman get a leg up on them—especially Gren, the Sunday Priest.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">It was just a passing thought, but it kind of surprised me how </span><a id="page-55"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">well these puzzle pieces fit together. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.2">Scary stuff. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.3">I’m shocked at the sheer well of knowledge flowing out from me.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">…</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">Raphael sounded like it wanted to say something, but I’m sure I was just imagining things. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.2">Maybe it was just envious of my genius, or maybe it thought I’d stolen its thunder because I didn’t ask any questions of it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">“Do you think,” an exasperated Hinata asked, “the Seven Days thought I was a thorn in their side because of </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">“Sounds like it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.2">They probably intended to help Clayman ascend, then have you get killed fighting him. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">They</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1"> could never have defeated you, after all, so I don’t think they had much other choice.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">It wasn’t a totally far-out concept. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.2">Step one, have Clayman defeat Hinata. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.3">Step two, either kill off Clayman somehow or operate him like a puppet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.4">I couldn’t say what they wanted to do with him, but Clayman’s faith in them was genuine—if they could get Hinata out of the picture, Clayman would do anything the Seven Days wanted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.5">Meanwhile, they’d have Farmus wipe us out and firm up the foundations Luminism worked with, naturally making sure everyone got to share in the resulting profits. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.6">A nation as big as Farmus mobilizing would mean big money for Eastern armor and weapon dealers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.7">Plus, more than anything else, the Seven Days would be back on Luminus’s good side.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">I didn’t want to jump to conclusions too early, but the possibility of all this seemed worthy of consideration to me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">“So you think they pitted me against you in hopes I’d be defeated?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.2">Hinata asked, interested in Louis’s theory. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.3">“Between that and protecting the tenets of Luminism, I suppose it’d be two birds with one stone.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">This gave me another idea.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">“But are we really sure the Seven Days were behind that?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">“There’s no doubting it,” replied Renard, seated next to Hinata. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.2">“It was the Clergy who introduced us to those merchants in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">That certainly cast more suspicion on them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.2">Having such a </span><a id="page-56"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">heroic band make the introduction, nobody would ever doubt their intentions—which would make it easier for the Clergy to reach their goals. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.2">I’m not sure they’d thought it out all the way like that when I fought Hinata for the first time, but the second? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.3">They definitely wanted me to kill her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.4">Those conniving bastards. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.5">It scared me a bit, but they were all gone anyway, so it was water under the bridge.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">“…But hang on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.2">There were seven people in the Clergy, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.3">Isn’t one of them still left?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">Hinata seemed pretty at ease as far as the Clergy were concerned, but thinking about it, this wasn’t over yet at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.2">Whoever the final survivor was had to be up to their ears in this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.3">It unnerved me, but Hinata just flashed me a cold smile.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">“Ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.2">Nothing to worry about there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.3">Nicolaus contacted me from his sanctum to say the final one had also been eradicated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.4">It happened after they discovered that the crystal ball you sent had been tampered with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.5">That was enough evidence to execute him.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">The thin smile that accompanied her words would be enough to make anyone feel threatened. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.2">The sight of this beautiful woman talking about such sinister conspiracies was probably one reason it was easy to get the wrong idea about her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.3">But anyway.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">“Okay, but who </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1"> this last guy?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">I hated to think it, but it wasn’t Gren, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.2">The Sunday Priest fabled to be stronger than even Clayman? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.3">Because if so, it meant I’d need to keep a careful eye out for this Nicolaus guy, too.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">“I was told it was Gren, the Sunday Priest and chief of the Clergy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.2">He almost never took the initiative on anything by himself, so it made sense he was the last one left.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">Luminus’s ears perked up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.2">“Oh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.3">Old Granville was defeated? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.4">Nicolaus… That cardinal was infatuated with you, wasn’t he? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.5">How did he do it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">“It wasn’t the most heroic approach,” Louis replied, “but he had a Disintegration spell set up in advance, and it was enough of a surprise move to do him in.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">“Ahhhh… Granville must have aged terribly, if he fell for a trap like that.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">She sounded sad about it, but my mind was on other matters. </span><a id="page-57"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">Unfortunately, it seemed that I would need to add a new entry to my mental list of people to watch out for. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.2">It might’ve been a surprise move, but I couldn’t let my guard down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.3">Disintegration was lethal against most people. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">Cardinal Nicolaus… Let’s remember that name.</span></em></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">Hinata had a thoughtful expression. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.2">The name Granville must have rung a bell.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">“That I do,” Luminus replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.2">“His real name is Granville. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.3">He was known as the Hero of Light in his glory days. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.4">He even fought me once.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">For a god, Luminus acted so oddly innocent at times. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.2">I might’ve been imagining it, but sometimes it felt like she was trying to act all high and mighty and not quite succeeding all the time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.3">Was all this, you know…an act?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">Then I felt it: her eyes, dead upon me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">Yep, I </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1"> just imagining things! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.2">So much for that suspicion.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1">“Did he…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.2">I-I’m sure it couldn’t be, but…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">Hinata seemed to have an idea in mind, but she must not have been fully sure about it, because she went no further.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">“He </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1"> pretty strong in the past,” she instead recalled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">“Up to my level, in fact.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">“You could say that,” answered Luminus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.2">“Anyone who calls themselves a Hero usually finds themselves bound by fate soon enough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.3">Perhaps he resented me, somewhere deep in his heart.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">Perhaps, indeed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.2">Just like Milim told me, Heroes and demon lords often intertwined. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.3">Granville was defeated by the demon lord Luminus, opting to swear his allegiance to her instead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.4">Deep down, though, he might’ve had mixed feelings about her—feelings he couldn’t escape from, even after becoming a living legend who brought many champions in their own right into the world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.5">But at this point, it was all just guesswork.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">“Well,” I said, “that’s a relief, at least. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.2">It means that everyone who picked a fight with us—Clayman, Farmus, the Seven Days Clergy—they’ve all met their end.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">Benimaru and my other officials nodded their agreement. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.2">“All’s well that ends well,” Rigurd eagerly commented with a smile.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-58"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">“You said it,” I replied, returning the smile as I felt the tension escape the hall. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.2">“We had to deal with a lot of dangerous foes, but at this point, most of the problems are safely behind us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.3">But I sure don’t want anyone controlling </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">me</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1"> behind the scenes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.2">If we hadn’t noticed these merchants scheming in the shadows, I honestly would’ve started to suspect Yuuki.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">Yuuki </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1"> pretty suspicious. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.2">When it came to humans in Englesia with deep ties to Hinata, Yuuki was the prime candidate. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.3">I felt bad about it, but I couldn’t take him off the list.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">“Yuuki?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.2">Renard asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.3">“Yuuki Kagurazaka, the guild master?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">“Yeah,” I answered with a nod.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">Thinking about it impartially, it made sense. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.2">He was the prime suspect at the time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.3">But Yuuki had no reason to have Hinata and me fight each other. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.4">If there was no motive, it was pretty hard to picture him as the culprit.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">…</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">On the other hand, maybe someone was deftly scheming to frame Yuuki. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.2">The Eastern merchants could pull that off well enough, I thought—they’d proven more than capable of carrying out multiple operations remotely at the same time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.3">If the Clergy were the main bad guys, the merchants would have a motive to take the heat off them a little. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.4">It made sense.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">But:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">“Yuuki, a suspect? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.2">Can’t say that’s out of the question, no.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">Right when I had convinced myself, Hinata threw me with that observation.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">“Whoa, you’re doubting someone from your own homeland?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">“Hmm? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.2">I’m only considering every possibility. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.3">For that matter, it may be a bit early to assume the real mastermind is gone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.4">The Moderate Jester that killed Roy is still on the loose, and those Eastern merchants still have deep roots all over the Western Nations.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">It felt like she was splashing cold water on me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">She was right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.3">It was too early to breathe easy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.4">I braced myself anew.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-59"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">“Yeah… I guess you’re right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.2">It’s not over yet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.3">We can’t afford to be too optimistic.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">“No, we can’t. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.2">We’d better inform everyone about this.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">Benimaru nodded, while the paladins facing him looked similarly convinced.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">“As Hinata said,” I continued, “it’s very likely that the person or persons behind all this is still around. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.2">I know I said the Clergy might be the main bad guys, but that was just a passing idea more than anything. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.3">It’s no good to throw blame around without any conclusive evidence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.4">Let’s keep a close eye on this as we go forward.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">Everyone murmured their agreement at this conclusion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.2">No, it was a bad idea to cast judgment without merit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.3">I was fairly confident in my supposition, but Raphael didn’t offer its agreement. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.4">It didn’t disagree, either, though, so I think the possibility was there; I just didn’t have the evidence to be sure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.5">For now, I’d have to trust in Raphael—and with the paladins happy with this conclusion, I thought it best to leave it at that.</span></p>

<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">A few minutes later, I suddenly spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.2">So about our future relations…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">“Ah, before that,” Hinata interrupted, “I want to make one thing very clear to all of us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.2">Should I assume you’ve accepted our apology for all these events?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1">“Sure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.2">I want us to become friends as nations going forward. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.3">I don’t intend to drag that problem along any further.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">This wasn’t my sole decision. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.2">I came to it after discussing matters with Benimaru and my other officials. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.3">There was no need to fight any longer, and all our misunderstandings were now worked out, so I felt it was time to make a deal.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">But Luminus wasn’t convinced.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">“Absolutely not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.2">I hate owing anything to anyone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.3">This entire incident was clearly our fault, and I wish to compensate for it in some way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.4">We can strike a deal after that is done.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">She gave Veldora a hateful glare. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.2">Basically, I suppose, she didn’t want Veldora to feel like he could ask her for something later.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">“Yes,” replied Hinata, “and if that is Lady Luminus’s will, then I must say that it troubles me to put you through such pain and not make up for it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.2">I want to show you as much as possible that I am being sincere.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1">Okay, sure, that’s great, but what kind of compensation are we talking about? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.2">Because if Luminus—well, Lubelius as a nation, really—if they were willing to acknowledge us as a nation, then I was good to go. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.3">Combine that with an oath of non-hostility, and what more could I ask for?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">“Hmm… Well, how about you formally recognize our nation, and we open up diplomatic relations?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1">Luminus casually nodded. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.2">“Fair enough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.3">Although, I won’t expect us to be fast friends. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.4">And I </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1">will</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.1"> need to settle the score with that lizard sooner or later.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1">Pretty much all of Luminus’s smoldering anger was pointed right at Veldora. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.2">If it really, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">really</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1"> came to it, I was willing to offer him </span><a id="page-61"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">as a sacrifice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.2">If that was enough to usher in a century-long era of peace, it was a dead simple decision to make.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">“Wait a moment, Rimuru,” I heard the dragon ask. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.2">“I hope you are not picturing anything…cruel for me.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">“Just your imagination, Veldora. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.2">As long you act smart and mature, there’s nothing to worry about.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1">“No, I know what you’re thinking when you talk down to me like that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.2">It </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">usually</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1"> means you’re up to no good!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">Tch. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.2">He’s getting sharp. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.3">But not as sharp as me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1">“Now, now… Here, I’ll give you my scone, so play nice with Luminus, all right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">“What? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.2">Well, in that case, I will do my level best. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.3">Although if I ever </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">truly</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1"> willed it, it’d be child’s play to make Luminus recognize my vast strengths! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.2">Kwaaaaah-ha-ha-ha!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.1">You see? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.2">Dealing with him is so simple. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.3">Luminus audibly sighed, but it looked like she would remain true to her word.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.1">“Don’t get cocky with me, you! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.2">For now, though, let us call a truce. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.3">I will open international relations with you for a period of one hundred years. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.4">I think that would serve amply well as an apology?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.1">Well, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1"> came more easily than expected. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.2">Like, really? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.3">We’re good? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.4">Benimaru, Rigurd, and the rest of my team looked just as shocked—to say nothing of Hinata. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.5">I doubt anyone expected this.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1">“So,” ventured Hinata, “you’re willing to open diplomacy with Tempest, if not necessarily go all the way with a nonintervention treaty?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1">“Quit pestering me about this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.2">I’ve said what I meant!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1">With that, she reached for a second scone, content to let someone else work out the details.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.1">“I suppose,” Louis dryly stated, “we will have to carry out her will—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.1">“Diplomatic relations? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.2">Are you sure?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1">Renard, however, seemed unconvinced. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.2">He appeared ready to bring up an issue but not quite sure if he should go through it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.3">He gave Hinata a quick glance, receiving a nod in return.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">“What’s the issue?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.2">chimed in Fritz. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.3">“If Sir Rimuru and his nation were truly evil, we would have been wiped off the map long ago.”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-62"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">“True,” Arnaud said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.2">“I can trust in Sir Rimuru, yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.3">We need to cast off our prejudices against monsters.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">“I agree with them,” added Litus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.2">“Sir Soei was such a gentleman to us.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">Even the notably taciturn Bacchus was nodding. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.2">Renard, hearing them all, hesitated for a moment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.3">As vice captain of the Crusaders, he couldn’t give his ready agreement just yet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.4">If anything, this choir of support only firmed his resolve.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">“Yes, but there remains one problem. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.2">How will we explain this in the framework of our faith’s teachings? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.3">Because depending on our approach, the Western Holy Church may face an onslaught of criticism, and I can’t allow that to happen.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">Their faith—a faith that refused to accept the existence of monsters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.2">Yeah, if they accepted me now, it’d be like, hey, what about all the teachings from the past X number of centuries? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.3">I thought we were close to solving all our problems, but I suppose it never comes that easy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1">But as I worried over this, Luminus dropped another bombshell.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">“Don’t be silly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.2">Those teachings are nothing </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.1">I</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.1"> established. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.2">I don’t see why failing to protect them qualifies as betraying me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.3">Those were </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.1">meant</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.1"> to be guiding principles for those lost in their lives. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.2">Really, they’re only a bunch of rules thought up by the leaders at the time.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.1">This came as a shock to all the paladins in the room, Hinata included. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.2">“What?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.3">she shouted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.4">“I’ve never heard that before…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.1">“Ah yes,” Louis blandly replied, “I suppose you might not have. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.2">The original texts defining the faith are open to anyone who might want to browse, but the first written drafts they’re based on have been lost long ago. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.3">If you read through those, then you’ll see how those tenets were crafted.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.1">As he put it, the doctrines of Luminism were put in place to protect those who worshipped Luminus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.2">She, Louis, and other high-level vampires were one thing, but the lower ones lived off human blood, and the blood of those who lived happy, contented lives was apparently more attractive to them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.3">In the bad old days when monsters ran roughshod over the world, the human race had </span><a id="page-63"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.1">its hands full just surviving, which meant the poor quality of their blood created its fair share of problems among the vampire community. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.2">In response, Luminus took advantage of a move she had planned to switch gears and offer her protective hand to the humans. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.3">(This “move” was caused by Veldora, apparently, but I opted against asking for details. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.4">It’d just be stirring up a hornet’s nest.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">“Protecting the defenseless allows them to lead happy lives. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.2">By ‘spicing up’ their lives with fearsome demon lords, followed by the relief of being protected from them, we ensure they can savor as much happiness as possible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.3">The citizens of Lubelius are kept safe under the name of their god.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.1">Humans, to put it in a rough way, were kind of like livestock to them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.2">Vampires lived off their blood—but as it was described to me, they needed rather small quantities, enough that the human “victim” wouldn’t even notice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.3">There were far more humans than vampires out there, so it made sense. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.4">A little blood donation now and then ensured a life free from existential threats. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.5">A real win-win situation.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1">“So did they write the holy scriptures of Luminism to help keep needless slaughter by the monsters at a minimum?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">“That’s right,” Louis said to Hinata. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.2">“Precisely.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">“To me, the most important thing is the faith itself,” added Luminus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.2">“All of you here—you can cast your holy magic thanks to the faith you have in me, correct? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.3">That is how the arrangement works—it is an absolute law. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.4">It is my family’s duty to protect my people, and to me, the rest matters little.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1">So to sum up, the faith’s refusal to accept monsters stemmed from a need to grab the hearts of the people and bring them into the faith. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.2">No, maybe that tenet </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">doesn’t</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1"> need to be so strictly enforced. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.2">Bending too much along those lines would cause chaos in the Western Holy Church, but there was no need to go that far. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.3">Basically—the way I was reading this—if the people here could find a reason to accept us, the rest of the kingdom would fall in line.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1">It sounded like we had an agreement, then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.2">But Renard’s frown said he still wasn’t convinced.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.1">“But we have to do it,” Hinata solemnly said to the troubled-looking Renard. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.2">“I was hoping we could keep silent on this until things settle down, but we have a force of a hundred paladins here, and I’m sure the other nations are aware of us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.3">Plus, those journalists were there to see a Battlesage be defeated, weren’t they?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.1">Her gaze went from Renard to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.2">She was right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.3">Diablo said he had defeated a man named Saare, one of the Three Battlesages. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.4">Another one was on the scene but apparently fled in rapid order. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.5">If the press saw all that, it could ruin this force’s reputation as protector of humanity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.6">If rumors started spreading that the paladins were defeated, it could lead to all kinds of needless confusion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.7">Diablo said it was possible to coerce the media, if need be, but… Ugghhh, what a pain.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1">Who won, and who lost, didn’t really matter, I thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.2">But everyone on Hinata’s side stared at me in shock.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">Diablo seemed to be doing well over in the Western Nations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.2">Rescuing the journalists’ lives let him proceed with his plan, even if it had involved a bit of extra force. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.3">It wouldn’t be long, he said, before reports would go around about Yohm being crowned the new king—and the smaller nations surrounding Farmus would pitch in to support this.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">Assuming all went to plan, the only individual nation who could possibly try to tangle with us was Englesia. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.2">With Luminus giving us a hundred-year truce, the Western Nations were as good as ours, really. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.3">The same was true of the demon lords. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.4">Me killing Clayman was one stellar performance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.5">If we spread rumors that I lost despite looking perfectly healthy to everyone, I’m not sure people would believe them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.6">If anything, they might grow </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">more</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1"> careful dealing with me, fearing a trap or something.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">“You sound pretty confident,” Hinata said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.2">“Well, in that case, I don’t have any objection. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.3">If anything, I’ll be glad to take advantage of it.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">“There had been some internal debate over whether demi-humans counted as monsters or not…but nowadays, I think that’s far too narrow a view to take. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.2">It’s just prejudice talking.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1">“You said it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.2">Demi-humans are a formidable foe against humans, but dwarves, at least, are certainly human. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.3">If we started calling </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">them</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1"> monsters, then it’d be impossible to tell spirits apart from monsters, either.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1">Ogres and lizardmen had normally been treated as demi-humans up to now, too, but thanks to their hostility against humankind, they had been branded as monsters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.2">Oni and dragonewts—the next evolution up from each respective race—were treated not as monsters, but as local gods. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.3">All that really mattered, in the end, was whether you were friend or foe to humankind—and that meant it was hard to interpret Luminist doctrine as a carte-blanche condemnation of all monsters.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.1">“Well,” I said, “we have formal relations with the Dwarven Kingdom. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.2">Why don’t we mix King Gazel into this and sign a hundred-year friendship treaty? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.3">If we can get him to guarantee that we won’t attack people, that ought to change a few minds, right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.1">Hinata thoughtfully nodded, reaching her own conclusions in her mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.2">“Yes… If we can just build a little trust, that would make it easier to convince people. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.3">Plus, with things as they are, it’s probably about time to purge all the people who were poisoned by the Clergy.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.1">The Western Holy Church was hardly a monolith. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.2">No large organization is. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.3">And with Hinata putting it in such cold, blunt terms, all opposition was silenced. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.4">I guess she wanted to use this chance to lay all the guilt on the Seven Days Clergy—kind of dirty, I thought, but that was a Lubelius issue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.5">Certainly nothing I had a right to comment on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.6">We then began to work out some of the smaller details.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.1">For our future interactions, it was agreed that Arnaud and Bacchus would stay here in Tempest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.2">They’d go back home to prepare first, then return with a few civil bureaucrats in tow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.3">I was planning to build a Luminist church in town in the meantime for their use, and I didn’t see it taking any longer than a couple weeks. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.4">Maybe we’d start to see some Luminists around here once we were done.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.1">I was honestly a little anxious about allowing full freedom of religion, but…ahhh, I’m sure we’d figure it out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.2">Monsters, frankly, are atheists. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.3">There was no such thing as a single god that was widely recognized by everyone across the world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.4">My conventional wisdom from my own planet didn’t apply, really. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.5">There </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.1"> religion, yes, but it was usually more like paying your respects to the local deity than anything very fervent—and these deities could quite literally help you out if you prayed to them, because, like, they were right there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.2">The Dragon Faithful’s relationship with Milim is a prime example.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">Along those lines, Luminism was really nothing more than the biggest player in an extremely crowded arena full of religions like that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.2">The Crusaders served as Luminus’s servants, protecting the weak and earning new adherents to the faith. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.3">So if you look at it that way, I could see a church in Tempest as a kind of center for Western Holy Church–style support of the vulnerable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.4">You gotta help out your neighbor and all that, although I doubt they could offer much help to us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.5">It’d at least mean we could fight alongside paladins if some kind of threat appeared.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1">There was no real reason not to take this opportunity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.2">We’d keep close tabs on the local church, of course, but I figured we could grant them a certain amount of freedom. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.3">That was the common ground we found.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.1">Kaijin and Kurobe taught me that magisteel can evolve over many years, allowing well-worn, first-class weapons and armor to continue honing and polishing themselves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.2">This evolution can provide a massive boost out of thin air, something proven by the way ancient weapons found in ruins sometimes boasted out-of-this-world abilities that modern technology couldn’t replicate. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.3">This was the so-called Legend class, and apparently they were usually kept away from general access.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">It was the equivalent of a pistol that I thought about gifting her, and she liked it much more than I anticipated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.2">It was a new version of the broken rapier I had consumed earlier, analyzed and improved for her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.3">It was in the Unique class feature-wise, and I’m sure it felt the same way in her hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.4">I even re-created the unique ability it had to always kill its target on the seventh attack.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.1">I pecked at the hot pot as I explained my vision of the future to her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.1">Our current project involved getting the human world to recognize us, and this was already halfway done, with the leaders of many nations aware of who I was. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.2">I’d received reports of apparent spies going in and out of Tempest, so I’d taken a few measures to show them how harmless we were. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.3">The merchants and adventurers were spreading rumors of their own, and before long, even the common people would know we could coexist with them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.4">It’d take time for that to really take root, yes, but we were on the path. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.5">No need to hurry it along.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.1">After that came our road infrastructure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.2">This was also well underway, as we had worked to build safe, efficient trade routes across our territory. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.3">Highways to Blumund and the Dwarven Kingdom were now open, and plans were in progress for a new road linking us to the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.4">There were no paved roads to Eurazania at the moment, so I thought we could tackle that afterward.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.1">Running in parallel with all this was experimentation with communication methods. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.2">I didn’t know how radios and stuff worked, so I had to give up on that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.3">Raphael could tell me if I asked, but I didn’t have the brainpower to help everyone </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.1">else</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.1"> understand it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.2">Kaijin and the three dwarven brothers might, maybe, but I didn’t want to rely on them for everything. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.3">Thus, I decided to leave that issue to the next generation and build schools to provide education for our children. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.4">These were simple one-room affairs for now, but I was having them learn basic reading, writing, and arithmetic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.5">Before long, I intended to bring in some humans to provide more in-depth instruction.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.1">But getting back to the subject, the communication crystals that served the world now could only be used by the magically inclined. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.2">They were magical items themselves, which meant they were </span><a id="page-74"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.1">vulnerable to theft. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.2">That was hardly a theoretical problem, and more to the point, if you needed to send out an emergency message, you’d never know if a wizard was nearby to help.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.1">We needed a system that anyone could use and where theft wasn’t an issue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.2">It seemed beyond all probability, but it was actually pretty within reach. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.3">My idea involved the use of Sticky Steel Thread and magisteel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.4">I tried the first out with Soei, but my transmission skills over the thread were honestly pretty astounding. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.5">Since it worked with magicules, you could get your voice and thoughts across with remarkable clarity.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.1">Magisteel was packed with those same magicules as well, so I thought it could work largely the same way—and after some experimentation, it did. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.2">What we could do is work magisteel into wires about a half an inch thick, run them through the dimension used by Shadow Motion, and connect the world’s cities together with it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.3">That alone wouldn’t accomplish anything, but attaching this network to the device Vester and his team were developing could convert waves of passing thought into real-life sights and sounds. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.4">This device required no magical force to use, so I wanted to get it running as soon as it was complete. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.5">In the meantime, we needed to gather the requisite amount of magisteel and get ready.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.489.1">With the amount of monsters we had in this nation, regular iron ore kept in storage would transform itself into magic ore. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.489.2">This could then be processed into magisteel wire, with Shadow Motion practitioners doing the wiring work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.489.3">Nothing would really serve as physical obstacles to this network, so installation wouldn’t be that terribly difficult. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.489.4">Once we really had the ball rolling, I also had plans to expand the network from the cities to the smaller villages. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.489.5">Now all we had to do was develop the necessary receivers.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.1">Really, as someone who had lived in a data-driven society, communication speed was seriously important to me.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.492.1">I couldn’t help but sound a little full of myself in front of Hinata.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.493.1">Once this network was complete, it was time to start transmitting </span><a id="page-75"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.1">entertainment and nurturing a nascent culture. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.2">There were so many dreams I had and a mountain of things left to do—and if I wanted to get any of it done, I had to provide safe and comfortable lives for my people.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.495.1">Somewhere along the line, the meeting hall had grown quiet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.495.2">The paladins were frozen in place, perhaps enraptured by my speech. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.495.3">My own officials, meanwhile, were practically smoldering with anticipation; listening to me inspired them more than ever before.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.1">Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.2">If you phrased it like </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.1">that,</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.1"> then okay, maybe that was a mistake. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.2">Maybe I got carried away and said a little too much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.3">Must have been the alcohol talking.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.1">But even considering the possibility was a mistake. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.2">The moment I thought </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.1">Uh-oh, did I screw up?</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.1"> Raphael jumped to conclusions.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.1">Of course, I suppose this happened because I still had a pounding headache from getting wildly drunk the day before. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.2">I cut a little too loose for my own good, and that was the cause of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.3">Maybe I’d be more tight-lipped toward Hinata if I wasn’t inebriated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.4">Let’s just call it my just deserts and move on.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.1">The angels targeted monsters and cities with advanced civilizations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.2">Not even the Western Holy Church saw them as allies of humankind—which made sense, given that their god, Luminus, was actually a demon lord.</span></p>
