<p><a id="page-119"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">He looked a bit concerned. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.2">I must have left him too long without updates. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.3">Although I didn’t intend for it to turn into a fight, we had certain Luminism doctrine issues to deal with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.4">If we were going to continue dealing with the Western Nations, we couldn’t afford to ignore the Holy Church issues. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.5">Now, however, that was all taken care of. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.6">We had nothing left to worry about.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">“Hee-hee-hee… Yeah, I ‘worked them out,’ all right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">Hinata and I made amends peacefully, and I also worked things out with Lu…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“Lu?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">“Lu… Loose ends! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">We managed to set a few ground rules and tie up any loose ends, that’s all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">Everything’s peachy keen now!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">“Ahhh, I see! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">And here I thought the Western Holy Church was a much more intimidating group to work with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">Glad to see they’re more reasonable than that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">Maybe I was too worried for my own good!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Mjöllmile gave me a relieved smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">I politely smiled back, sweating on the inside about the mistake I just barely avoided making. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">If I had followed through there and said Luminus’s name, there’d be hell to pay—which I could deal with, but what if she decided to rub out Mjöllmile as well? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">I was inviting both Luminus </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">and</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1"> Hinata and her Crusaders to the Founder’s Festival, so I’d better not shoot my mouth off before then—not that I knew whether the demon lord would deign to grace my little event with her presence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">She’d probably be like “Why would I ever let myself be seen among the rabble?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">or something. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4">I’m sure she’d be an incredibly demanding visitor if she showed, so I honestly didn’t mind if she declined. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">Though, maybe I ought to encourage her to attend…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">I don’t know.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“In that case,” Mjöllmile happily exclaimed as I thought about this, “let me show you the results of our training so far!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">There was no point wondering about whether she’d come. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">I needed to consider my own program for now.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">“Oh, has it been going well?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">“Nothing less than perfect! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">We’ve trained them to the point that everyone can perform their tasks on the same level.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">“Ah, I knew you wouldn’t let me down, Mjöllmile!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">We grinned at each other. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">It sounded like making our debut at the fest wouldn’t be an issue.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-120"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“So can we put up a storefront offering burgers, hot dogs, fries, and the drink lineup we talked about?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“That we can. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">And I think we can attract customers with those beef skewers dipped in the ‘secret sauce’ you talked about. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">Pairing them with a rice bowl will definitely improve our bottom line.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">“It’s been getting good reviews?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">Mjöllmile briskly nodded. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">“It’s become a low-key staff favorite, that’s for sure.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Making yakitori skewers out of cowdeer and chiducken seemed to satisfy people.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“Great! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Let’s add that to the menu, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">Do we have enough employees to work with?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“Well, for the moment, I’m thinking we could launch with upward of twenty locations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">But starting that big would take a fair amount of money. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">We’d need backup personnel, which I’m training right now—that’s a necessary expense, the way I see it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.4">So along those lines, if we can deploy more gradually, say five locations at a time, that’ll put us well within budget.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">That’s Mjöllmile for you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">He fully understood my proposal, and already he was working out any staff issues involved. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">In that case:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">Well, sorry to trouble you for this, but can you bring over around five of your best employees?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">“Five? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">What did you want from them?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“Well, I’ve got this friend of mine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">His name’s Veldora.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">“V-Veldora?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“Yeah, and he’s, like, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">super</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">–worked up about opening a hibachi booth at the fest.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“Er, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">is</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1"> he…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Mjöllmile seemed to be growing visibly paler as I explained. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">It worried me, but I soldiered on.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“So you know, it’d be way too dangerous to leave him running that by himself, right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“I—I would say so, yes…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">I beamed at him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">“So that’s why I want five of your best staffers to help him!”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-121"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">Mjöllmile, watching me gleefully dump all the responsibility on him, turned his eyes toward the ceiling. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">“Would you be able to guarantee the…er, safety of this staff?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“Of course! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">Whenever they have any problems, they can come right to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3">If Veldora starts getting all uppity, I’ll put ’im in his place.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“I trust you will, yes, but… Um, we </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">are</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1"> talking about </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">the</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1"> Veldora, yes? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">The Storm Dragon?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">I suppose we were. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">Guess Mjöllmile knew the name, didn’t he?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“Is that bad?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“Ahhh… </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Bad</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1"> may not be the correct term. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">I just wonder if the crew will be, too, well, petrified to get any work done…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">I should’ve known. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">Yeah, if you haven’t met Veldora, you must think he’s crazy scary, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.4">Catastrophe-class, and all that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“Well…maybe that’s not a good idea, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">“No, perhaps not… If he could at least assume another name for himself, temporarily, our staff could work for him unawares…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">A</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">ha!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">“Yes! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">Brilliant, Mollie! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">Let’s give him another name so nobody knows who he is!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">“Huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">You—you can </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">do</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1"> that?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">“Sure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">If he whines about it, I’ll just tell him he can’t do the hibachi thing at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.3">Right, let’s do that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.4">And I’ll pay a special bonus to the five people you pick for me, so let them know I’m counting on ’em, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">Whether Mjöllmile was keeping up with me or not, I considered this problem as good as solved. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">Veldora was being as selfish as always, but we were entertaining world celebrities here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.3">Embarrassment would be the least of our worries if he gave all our guests food poisoning or whatever, so I couldn’t rest easy until I knew there were people who could watch over and direct him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.4">I didn’t want to dismiss him out of hand, but I was too nervous to let him off the leash completely, so it’s a lucky thing Mjöllmile had the staff trained like I asked him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">He looked like he wanted to tell me something, but probably nothing important. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">The ball was in his court now.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Rimuru looked supremely happy with himself at resolving this issue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">Mjöllmile, meanwhile, felt like someone had just thrown a lit bomb into his lap.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">L-Lord Veldora?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">I knew the seal had been undone, but he wants me to deal with</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1"> him?!</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">This was a major headache in the making, for sure.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Rimuru was talking sense at first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">Building a stand for the festival would be a good training opportunity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.3">But if they were babysitting Veldora as well, that was another story. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.4">Mjöllmile wondered what the hell he had just gotten himself into, but as he observed the smiling, carefree Rimuru in front of him, he decided to take the “Ah well” approach. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.5">Ever since Rimuru saved him, he had tried to live life with no regrets. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.6">He might’ve been conniving and obsessed with money, but he was nothing if not brave.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">“But a festival, though, eh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">If we’re talking a large-scale event, I imagine you must have people jumping up and down to join in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.3">A good opportunity for a merchant like myself, hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">He had reason to think so. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">Many people, merchants and adventurers in particular, were now filing in and out of Tempest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.3">It was starting to get heavily advertised; Mjöllmile was sure they were attracting curious travelers from the nearby towns and villages. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.4">That was exactly the kind of situation a merchant stood to profit from.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">“Oh, you’re interested?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">Rimuru took a sip from his tea, apparently picking up on Mjöllmile’s muttering. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.3">“You know, to tell the truth, I’m still wavering on a few things with this festival. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.4">I know you’ve helped us decide on some of our attractions already, but I’m still trying to think of a big, flashy centerpiece for the event.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">“A centerpiece?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">“Yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">Basically, my plan is to turn our town into a kind of health resort. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.3">We’ve got our hot-spring infrastructure in place, along with lodging and guest houses suitable for royalty…but I feel like we’re still lacking in entertainment.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">“I see,” Mjöllmile replied, figuring it wouldn’t hurt to hear him out.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-123"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">As the excited Rimuru then explained, Tempest already boasted a healthy amount of high-end accommodation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">Mjöllmile had stayed in it before, so he knew that much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">The rooms on offer ran the gamut, providing a selection of things to enjoy—a nice meal with a fine view of the gardens, an open-air hot spring to relax in, and so on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.4">In the smaller nations of the world, it’d be hard for even the nobility to maintain their own private baths. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.5">That went double if there wasn’t any water service, forcing you to physically dump water in a tub and heat it up manually.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">To Mjöllmile, who took that for granted, a facility with a hot spring you could enjoy any time you liked was nothing short of mind-blowing…but apparently Rimuru wasn’t satisfied with just that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">“I understand all that,” he said, “but if you already have good food and relaxing spaces, how much more of a resort do you need?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Rimuru shook his head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">“You aren’t thinking big enough, Mjöllmile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">Me, I think that won’t be enough on its own. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.4">I’d like some kind of project that everyone can have a little more fun with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.5">Like, for example…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">What Rimuru then laid out for him was a complete recreational tourism strategy for the Forest of Jura. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">They’d provide travelers with day-long walking tours deep into the forest, accompanied by a guide/bodyguard. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">They’d hold fishing tournaments at the nearby canyons, hunting tours amid untouched natural reserves, and so on and so on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.4">All the needed equipment would be available to rent for anyone interested.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">“That </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">does</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1"> sound exciting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">It’d certainly attract the kind of nobility with all the time in the world on their hands—and for those with more active work lives, it’d be a fine way to relax.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">“Right, you see? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">That’s what I’m hoping for, but I’m just wondering if there’s something we can get </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">everybody</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1"> in on, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">One of Rimuru’s aims with the Founder’s Festival, it seemed, was to encourage repeat visitors to Tempest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">He was coming up with all kinds of things to keep travelers engaged and interested in the area. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.3">Mjöllmile was both amazed and exasperated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.4">How many years ahead was he even thinking?</span></p>
<p><a id="page-124"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">“Well, why not use Englesia as an example to imitate? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">The theater is quite popular over in their capital, I hear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">They hold operas and stage plays nearly every day of the year there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.4">You also see fighting tournaments held live at the arena…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">“Oooh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">Oh, yes! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.3">Where the Hero Masayuki is, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.4">Isn’t he really popular?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">“He certainly is. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">Lightspeed Masayuki, as they call him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.3">He’s dominated the tournaments for years. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.4">I’m actually rather a fan of his.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">“You are?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">Even a hardened merchant like Mjöllmile had his sports allegiances. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">He began giving an in-depth explanation of the tournament system to Rimuru, failing to notice how he began to yawn almost instantly.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">It was obvious Mjöllmile’s interest would shift over to Benimaru and the rest of Rimuru’s officers, sooner or later. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">He had met Rigurd and the others several times, and to him, their muscles couldn’t have been just for show. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.3">Between them and all the other powerful magic-born he saw around town, he couldn’t help but wonder who was champion among them all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.4">Now seemed like a good time to ask, but Rimuru’s reaction was chilly.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">“Listen,” Rimuru said, voice lowered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">“Between you and me, if you start talking like </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1"> around them, it’s gonna cause some serious disputes, you know? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">There’s this paladin named Arnaud, and he actually asked the same question back when we were all negotiating earlier. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.3">It led to the most insipid argument you ever saw—they were all trying to rank themselves on some impossible-to-understand scale, and it was starting to get pretty heated before I stepped in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.4">I </span><a id="page-125"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">was lucky enough that only part of my staff was there, but seriously, better avoid topics like that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.2">It’s a real powder keg with those guys.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">The one official who’d likely pitch the biggest fit of all about the question wasn’t there, Rimuru said, so he’d managed to talk everyone down from their fervor. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">He’d been trying to avoid such delicate questions ever since. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.3">If his main staff ever got into a real fight with one another, it could affect everything he’d striven to build for his town, and he couldn’t afford to risk that.</span></p>

<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">He may not look it too often, but Rimuru’s a demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">As long as his plans are sound, it’d be simple for him to assemble everything he needed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.3">And now he’s relying on me…</span></em></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">Rimuru was picturing entertainment for the masses—and taking the masses’ money. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">A fifty-thousand-seat coliseum would compare to Englesia’s pretty favorably—in fact, it’d be five times that arena’s size. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.3">It showed how serious Rimuru was about this.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">“You see, we can have some standing-room sections that we’ll let people into at no charge. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.2">Meanwhile, we can direct rich people to </span><a id="page-127"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">the reserved seats and charge them appropriately. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">And then we’ll have royal boxes for the nobility with more money than sense. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.3">We’ll also need seats for special guests and invitees and things. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.4">I’d like you to figure out the ratios we need for all these seat types, if we want to make as much money as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">Once again, he was leaving it all to Mjöllmile with a smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">Not even Englesia’s arena allowed the farmer and citizen classes to watch arena events for free. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.3">Mjöllmile could see the logic to it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">“I see… I thought fifty thousand was too high a number to aim for, but if </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">that’s</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1"> what you’re picturing…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">“Right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">It’s important that we attract people’s interest with this stuff. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.3">And if we pack the standing-room sections, won’t that make a reserved seat look more attractive if you can afford it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">“I bet it would. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">Better to reserve a spot instead of vying for space you don’t know will be available. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.3">That’ll naturally make the seats more valuable.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">This was a completely different approach from the arena in Englesia’s capital, which was chiefly a diversion for the upper classes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.2">The aim here was to build buzz and pack as many people in as possible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.3">It sounded deeply compelling to Mjöllmile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.4">If admission was free, farmers and field laborers would come over to see the show when work didn’t occupy them—and when they spread the word about what they saw, that’d attract the middle classes from neighboring nations.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">Besides, having tens of thousands of visitors would no doubt fill up the inns along the highways to Tempest—it’d be kind of neat to build the “fast food” establishments Rimuru described at stops along the way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">When they arrived, of course, they’d need somewhere to stay. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.3">And if it could help advertise their food, their lodging, their baths, and so on, the arena wouldn’t even need to make a profit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.4">The business all these fans would bring to town could more than make up for it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">“I gotta hand it to you, Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.2">You had this all planned out from the start, didn’t you…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">“Huh?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.2">Um, yeah, kind of? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.3">Of course, yes!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">“You have enough hotel rooms for it, I think. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">The issue becomes </span><a id="page-128"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">how to attract guests on a regular basis. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.2">We’ll need to think about boosting our profit margins later, but spreading the word comes first, I think. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.3">And that’s what you’re counting on me to help with?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">“Y-yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">Pretty much.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">“…That’s exactly what I’m saying. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.2">I’m impressed you understand me so well, Mollie. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.3">You’re the only man I can trust with this job!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">This job—find ways to attract people to Tempest, using a battle tournament as bait—excited Mjöllmile to the core. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">And really, Rimuru had all but worked it out by himself before throwing it in his lap. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.3">He had to resist the urge to shout out loud with excitement.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">“Heh…heh-heh… This is just too much…”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">“Ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.2">Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.3">How harsh of you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.4">I never realized you had such a mean streak, Rimuru.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">They both laughed loudly at each other—then exchanged sly glances.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">“You realize how much money is going to change hands here, hmm? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">I’m sure you do.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">“Wha?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">“Oh, did you not think that far?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">Mjöllmile began to lay out idea after idea for him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">This turned into a volley of brainstorming and compliments on the ideas. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.3">One concept was advertising the healing potion at the tournament, then selling it on-site to adventurers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.4">Another involved weapon and armor rentals and sales.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">“Even Kurobe’s failures at the forge are pretty off the charts when it comes to raw power. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.2">We can’t sell those to just anyone, but he has a workshop full of apprentices these days. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.3">Offering </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">their</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1"> stuff shouldn’t be an issue.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">They decided to give it a shot.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">Another idea thrown around was state-run betting operations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.2">This also existed in Englesia, where even simple pick ’em bets were netting huge amounts of revenue at the arena. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.3">They could do the same thing pitting warriors against captured monsters—which had its risks, of course, but Rimuru had a small army of powerful fighters at this point, so it wasn’t nearly the hazard Mjöllmile pictured. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.4">Maybe they could even offer training courses for beginner adventurers, reserving part of the arena’s space as a dojo of sorts. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.5">The lessons would be paid, of course, but they’d come with qualified instructors to guide newbies through the basics.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">The ideas came rolling one after the other from Mjöllmile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.2">As long as Rimuru was providing his full support, he felt like he’d never run out of them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.3">He couldn’t stop thinking about how huge his role was, dreaming up possibilities and being responsible for </span><a id="page-130"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">making them happen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.2">It was a bit daunting, but far more than that, exciting.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">“I’ll do it,” he said with a shiver. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.2">“I’ll do it all for you! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.3">My merchant’s soul is telling me we’re going to make a massive pile of money on this!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">Rimuru’s praise embarrassed Mjöllmile a bit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.2">But he wasn’t done yet.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">“Also, um, if you’re interested, of course, if this whole tournament turns out well, you wanna come live in my town? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">I could make a trade department for you—or maybe a PR firm or general financial office. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.3">It doesn’t matter what we call it, actually, but I could let you run it all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.4">I got a pretty big population to govern these days, and once the tournament’s over, I think it’s high time we reorganize our administration. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.5">I’m sure everyone will agree to it, as long as you can pull this off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.6">What d’you think?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">“You don’t have to exaggerate.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.2">Rimuru laughed, but the more they got into details, the more Mjöllmile felt like he was going to jump out of his skin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.3">Pulling this event off, and becoming Rimuru’s trusted associate, was his new ambition in life, and he was ready to fight tooth and nail to make it happen.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">Once Rimuru left, Mjöllmile called over his retainers and servants.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-131"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">“What did Sir Rimuru want from you, Sir Mjöllmile?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">asked Bydd, the former C-level adventurer who was now the merchant’s personal bodyguard.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">“Bydd,” Mjöllmile replied with an elated nod, “things are about to get </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">very</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1"> busy.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">“Oh, did he give you another impossible task? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">I like all the ideas he has, but I wish he understood how much he puts you through the wringer, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">He laughed, but he didn’t really mean it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.2">Just like Mjöllmile, Bydd owed Rimuru his life. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.3">He was one of the demon lord’s greatest fans, and while he described it as a wringer, Bydd probably enjoyed the wringing more than anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">Mjöllmile chuckled back at him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">“Bydd, this is gonna be nothing like you’ve ever seen before. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.3">Everything I’ve done up to now was like selling pencils on the street corner compared with what’s coming. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.4">I’ll be wagering my destiny on this one.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">He already looked like a mob boss, but Mjöllmile’s smile only added to his foreboding presence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">His retainers were used to it, but none could hide their surprise upon hearing this declaration.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">“What d’you mean by that, Boss?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.2">his chief butler asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.3">His boss gave him a quick recap—running a battle tournament alongside the Founder’s Festival, together with a test run of their upcoming fast-food concept. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.4">The festival itself would be a show of force for the newly ascended Rimuru, an effort all of Tempest was pitching in for, and the scope of it was likely beyond even Mjöllmile’s imagination. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.5">His excitement at receiving such a vital assignment was plain as he explained to the staff.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">“Thus, I’ve decided,” he concluded, “that I want to become part of Rimuru’s team. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.2">No matter what, I have to make sure this is a huge success!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">His servants began to chatter among themselves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.2">Mjöllmile, it seemed, had no intention of returning to Blumund. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.3">It caused quite a stir.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">“Heh-heh… You ain’t planning on going alone, are you, Sir Mjöllmile? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.2">Maybe I’m just some punk off the street, but I’m still </span><a id="page-132"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">your bodyguard. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.2">The gang I got under me practically worships Sir Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.3">Take me along with ya!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">“You wouldn’t be able to guard so much as a flea over there.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">“Aw, come on!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">“But if you would like to assist me in </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">other</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1"> ways, I suppose I could bring you alone.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">“Sure thing, Boss! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.2">I’ll do anything for you! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.3">I ain’t exactly intelligent, but I got street smarts, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">Bydd likely did, given his swindler past, although it left Mjöllmile less than convinced.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">“Bahhh, all right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.2">The more the merrier, I suppose! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.3">And I bet that gang of yours could provide at least a </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">little</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1"> security, if they know they’ll get a meal out of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.2">Let’s take ’em along. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.3">Now,” he continued, turning toward his retainers, “what about you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.4">You’re free to continue using this manor if you like.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">“Let us join you, sir!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.2">they said in near unison. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.3">There was no hesitation among them; after all, Mjöllmile had trained them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.4">Nothing was keeping them in this nation.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">It was decided…and now, the real work began. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.2">As a full-fledged citizen of Blumund and member of the Free Guild, Mjöllmile had the freedom to travel to other nations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.3">But as a man who believed in fast action once he made a decision, he felt a duty to the business he had remaining in town. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.4">There was no need for anxiety about the future.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">“You,” he said, pointing out one of his most talented employees. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.2">“You’ve proven yourself qualified enough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.3">D’you think you could run things here for me?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">“S-Sir?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.2">This is so sudden…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">“Well, I mean… I appreciate that you’d like to join me, but think about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.2">We’ll be starting completely from scratch in Sir Rimuru’s domain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.3">I’m planning to be a big success and win over his trust, but I don’t want you to run that gauntlet, too.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">This was a cover story. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.2">In truth, he didn’t want to sell this manor and lose his base of operations in Blumund. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.3">Ideally, a few of his people would remain here, keeping the lights on whenever his work brought him back.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-133"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">The leader he picked, a man named Bach, was brought here by his father, a relative of Mjöllmile’s who’d asked him to train his son in the business. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.2">He proved quick-witted enough to live up to his end of the bargain; however, Bach’s family had faced difficulty after his father’s business failed, leaving him with nowhere to return to, so Mjöllmile decided to formally hire him as head clerk. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.3">At the moment, that family was living off Bach’s income, and Mjöllmile felt too guilty about having him go off on this risky venture. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.4">He had no complaint about his work; no doubt the business would work fine under his watchful eye.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">“B-Boss… I couldn’t be happier to receive this offer from you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.2">But I hoped that we could perhaps join you…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">Bach, no doubt, was too young to readily accept this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.2">He was reluctant to go fully independent yet; perhaps he thought he still had things to prove to Mjöllmile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.3">It was cute of him, but Mjöllmile didn’t like it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.4">If Bach wanted to stand out on his own, he had to be let out in the wild sooner or later. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.5">This was a golden opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">“Bach, I am not your father. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.2">I’m offering you a position running this business, but I’m not </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">giving</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1"> it to you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.2">Listen: Even after I leave here, you better not do anything that puts this business on the rocks, all right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.3">In fact, once you’re able, I’d like to see you buy this outfit out from under me! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.4">So make it a big success and bring your parents back here someday, all right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">He gave him an affectionate smile and patted him on the shoulder. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.2">It was a tender moment, even if he still intended to work out a contract with Bach and keep a piece of the proceeds. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.3">He was a merchant, occasionally a hard taskmaster, but never a philanthropist. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">Besides</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">, he reasoned, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">if he can’t even pay me for my share of the business, he’d never have what it takes to succeed in the first place.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">“Thank you,” Bach said, choking up a bit, “thank you… I promise you that I’ll make a man out of myself and repay this favor!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">“I hope you do,” replied Mjöllmile, smiling ear to ear.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">Now he went to work, choosing who to bring and who to keep behind.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">“If you ever have any problems,” he advised Bach, “tell me about </span><a id="page-134"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">them, and I’ll help. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.2">But I believe in all of you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.3">I know you’ll do just fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.4">Don’t disappoint me!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">The group remaining in Blumund all nodded at him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.2">Mjöllmile had trained them thoroughly; none of them would fall out of line. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.3">Even if they were dealing with high nobility, he was sure they’d never do anything ill-advised.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">“You’ve taught them all well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.2">Rest assured they will not let you down!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.3">Bach said in return.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">“Well said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.2">Also, while I’m sure you’re aware of this…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">“Do not worry, sir. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.2">I promise we will maintain the sales markets you’ve built up here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.3">If you ever need access to them, we’ll give you first priority.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">“Good. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.2">I hope you will!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">Just in case, Mjöllmile wanted to be sure he got first dibs on any goods he might need. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.2">He always kept an eye on every facet of the situation, and Bach was in perfect sync with his thoughts.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">He’s still a little green, but he’s starting to look the part, at least…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">Now he was sure Bach wouldn’t let him down.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">The last of his affairs were now squared away, and it was time for Mjöllmile to make the journey to Tempest with his retainers in tow.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">That’s why Mjöllmile came to mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.2">His brain revolved around money in ways few people ever experienced, he had connections </span><a id="page-135"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">with nobility, and he was running businesses in multiple countries. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.2">It seemed a waste for him to remain a merchant forever; I was sure he’d be a great help to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.3">Besides, we had a good working relationship. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.4">If he could handle finances for us, maybe he’d allow me a little more spending money to work with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.5">I had been running a few side hustles with him before, but now I could picture that extra income ballooning.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">I mean, our treasury’s pretty well-endowed, you know? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.2">But taking money out of it for myself, despite not paying any salary to my staff, seemed kind of low. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.3">Everyone always said “Oh, it’s all yours, Sir Rimuru,” but that just made me all the more reluctant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.4">It felt wrong, and I wanted that money to help with expanding our nation.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">Still, I needed some of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.2">I wanted to take people like Gobta out at night every now and then, even if I didn’t have much interest in it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.3">Veldora was whining at me about that, too, and you know how you go through cash pretty quick at nightclubs…not that I had much interest, that is. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.4">(No, really.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">But while it was a drop in the bucket for our treasury, if it was my personal money, I’m sure Gobta and Veldora would burn through it like it was nothing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.2">Plus, Shuna usually provides me with money, but if I tell her where I’m going, she snaps that wallet shut, and I can’t really tell her it’s “my” money then, so…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">This was why I was running a few side jobs for extra spending cash. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.2">And with my future expansion, I had a feeling money wouldn’t be a worry for much longer.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">That battle tournament was a pretty neat idea, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.2">Mjöllmile is such a talented guy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.3">I wasn’t sure how he would take it, but he demonstrated some real enthusiasm as we brainstormed the plan. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.4">It barely took him a moment to suggest running a tournament to attract visitors, then take advantage of the crowds to sell potions and equipment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.5">He’s got a forward-looking eye and a knack for great ideas, that’s for sure.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">Once I get back, I’ll need to get ourselves an arena to work with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.2">Geld was busy with urban-planning work over in the Beast Kingdom, and Mildo was supporting him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.3">Without our two main </span><a id="page-136"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1">building specialists, I’d have to oversee the operation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.2">But that’s fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.3">After running all these construction projects, one after the other, we were starting to build a well-trained staff, enough so that I was mostly giving orders and not doing much else. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.4">I knew about this craftsman named Gobkyuu, who worked under the tutelage of Mildo, and he was involved with town architecture enough that I thought an impressive circular arena would be in his wheelhouse.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1">The job would normally take a decade or so, I’d imagine, but if you run the job with monster muscle, I thought we could cut that down a lot…like, down to maybe the two months or so we had until the festival. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.2">Even I had to admit that was far too little time to get everything done, so for now, I at least wanted the central fighting stage to be completed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">But how would we design it?</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">Understood. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.2">From my master’s memories, I have found the Colosseum of Rome. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.3">Building blueprints using it as a base… Completed.</span></em></span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">Now I had my plans. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.2">Next I’d have to discuss them with Gobkyuu— But before that, while I was here in Blumund, I may as well stop at the Free Guild. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.3">I could forward the plans over to Gobkyuu in the meantime; once I was free, I could assemble a team of craftsmen on-site to get down to business.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">“Ranga, you there?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">“Here, my master!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">He popped his head out from my shadow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.2">With things settled </span><a id="page-137"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">over in Farmus, everyone except Diablo was back home, with Ranga lurking in my shadow like it was his personal den. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.2">I gave him the arena blueprints I had just whipped up.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">“Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.2">But are you not returning, Sir Rimuru?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">Sounded like Fuze leaned toward atheism. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.2">Of course, this was a world where a real-life monster with superhuman powers could get worshipped as a god by the locals. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.3">They, at least, you could meet up with and see for yourself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.4">That must’ve made them seem more reliable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.5">Even Luminus only offered protection to the people she knew, at first, and she didn’t figure in Fuze’s life at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.6">He just relied on himself instead—a little self-serving but certainly easier to come to grips with.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1">“Yeah, well, I can certainly understand why people want to pray to a higher power. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.2">But in life, you get what you’re dealt, you know? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.3">Anyway, regardless of what Luminus may or may not bless us with, the Church and I are even now, and that’s all I need.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">Knowing Luminus personally taught me just how meaningless praying to her was—but not much point saying that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.2">Sometimes prayer really </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">can</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1"> give a person strength. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.2">It wasn’t for me to comment on.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">Fuze smiled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.2">“Very true. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.3">It’s a load off my shoulders as well.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">I got the feeling he was depressed about failing to stop the Church after I asked him to put the screws to them a bit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.2">I just appreciated him looking out for me.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">We chatted for a while more over past events before I stood up, recalling something.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1">“What’s that?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1">“Well, I’m gonna be holding my demon lord coronation soon, and I figured it’d be a good opportunity to advertise my town to the world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.2">We’re calling it the Founder’s Festival, and the way I picture it, it’s gonna be a huge blast. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.3">We’re sending invites to all the royalty and nobility in the region, and I’d love for you to attend, too.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">“Huhhh?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.2">Wait a minute, Sir Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.3">What would inviting someone like me accomplish—?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1">“No, no, it’s no big deal! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.2">I have an invite here for the king of Blumund, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.3">Can you make sure he gets it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">“Well, couldn’t you give it to him directly—hmm? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.2">Maybe not, eh…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1">“Nah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.2">I gave the dwarven king and Archduke Erald their invites personally, but I don’t have many contacts in the other nations.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.3">I smiled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.4">“I’ve met your king once, but I don’t think a demon lord would be invited to his throne room, would he?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1">“It’s distressing enough for a demon lord to be in Blumund at all.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.2">Fuze snickered back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.3">“But thank you for this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.4">I’ll be sure this reaches the king.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.1">My errand was now done, and I was about to depart but was stopped at the door. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.2">“Oh, right! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.3">I needed to mention that the grand master was concerned about you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.4">Negotiating with the Western Holy Church was a huge headache for him, so I’ll be sure to say you’ve worked things out.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.1">Yuuki was worried? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.2">A lot had happened since we last met. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.3">I was starting to miss him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.1">“Ah yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.2">I must have put a lot on his plate.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.1">“Oh, not really. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.2">The Guild has no interest in making an enemy out of the Church, after all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.3">If you were able to settle your differences without a fight, we couldn’t ask for anything more.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.1">“Well, I can give him an escort to and from the event, so I’m sure he can attend at least one day, you know? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.2">If not, I can stop by to see him sometime soon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.3">So give him this for me…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.1">As Fuze watched, I wrote out a letter to him and included it in the envelope with the invites. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.2">Fuze winced at me a little as he accepted it.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.1">“Oh, and Milim’s coming, too.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.1">I felt it best to be just as casual with that bombshell as he took the envelope.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1">A lieutenant, in Tempest’s armies, was an officer who could be assigned a unit to lead if needed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.2">They didn’t necessarily have one </span><a id="page-145"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1">to lead, which meant that captains were naturally above them, but it was still a much higher rank than the sergeants leading teams of five to ten people.</span></p>
