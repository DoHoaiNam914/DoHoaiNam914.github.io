<p class="noindent"><a id="page-149"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">In a hastily prepared meeting room, two suspicious-looking people sat quietly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">Or not exactly—upon closer inspection, there was also a third, smaller figure, a foot or so tall, with dragonfly-like wings on her back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">The two other people in the room were seated facing her—Ramiris and two of her servants, Beretta and Treyni.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">The small pixie bashed a fist against the small desk in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">“This is exactly why I thought none of this was working!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">she groused, rubbing her hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">“I </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">told</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1"> you we needed to move outta here!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">“Correct as always, Lady Ramiris,” Treyni agreed, watching her affectionately. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">“Truly, a most brilliant idea!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“Right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">Isn’t it, though?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Ramiris gave Treyni a satisfied nod.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">Beretta was less than convinced. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">“One moment, please. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">Brilliant though the idea may be, where do you intend to move to? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.4">And could you explain why?”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">Why do</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1"> I </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">have to do this?</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1"> he thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">Treyni, his colleague, was a thoughtful, detail-oriented, hardworking woman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">She had a good reputation among the spirits, allowing her to manage Ramiris’s labyrinth all by herself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.4">That was something Beretta couldn’t do, </span><a id="page-150"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">and there was no doubting her usefulness to Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">But there was an issue: Treyni, ever the loyal servant to Ramiris, spoiled her far too much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">She agreed with everything Ramiris said, never doubting it for a moment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.4">Someone needed to stop this before it led to trouble.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">The ex-demon Beretta couldn’t help but laugh at himself a little. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Oh dear… I am not here serving Lady Ramiris because I want to serve that role…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">To someone like him, who did enjoy Ramiris’s company very much, getting bossed around all the time wasn’t a concern. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">What </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1"> concern him—albeit only slightly—was how his lone coworker here was an unabashed yes-man. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Unfortunately, it was an ironclad rule of life that the hardest-working people tended to be the ones who lost out in the end. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">If you blow the whistle and warn about the dangers ahead, it’s usually your job to clean up the mess that results—something Beretta was about to learn the hard way.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“Great question, Beretta! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">Listen, aren’t you </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">bored</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1"> being in here at all? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">There’s nothing to do for fun in this place. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">The only diversion we have is building golems, and that’s about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.4">Barely anyone even comes to visit us! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.5">But over </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">there</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">, they’ve got all kinds of stuff. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">So I figure, you know, I’ll just invite myself over!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Ramiris put forth what she must’ve thought was a convincing case. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">It just made Beretta sigh inside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">He wasn’t dead set against it himself, but he remembered what the demon lord Rimuru was like and suspected getting his permission would be a problem. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.4">If she tried moving there now, he could easily envision her getting thrown out on her ear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.5">Treyni must have known that, but all she had to offer was her unequivocal agreement.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“But, Lady Ramiris, didn’t Sir Rimuru already turn you down once?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">Beretta had to say it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">She had already tried it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">Without a better excuse, all she’d do was incur Rimuru’s wrath. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.4">Maybe Ramiris was oblivious to this fact, but to Beretta, that was the biggest problem of all.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">“Come now, Beretta,” his unreliable coworker said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">“You’re overthinking this! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">Sir Rimuru is </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">such</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1"> a nice young man. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">He’d never be cruel enough to deny the dreams of someone as cute ’n’ lovable as her!”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-151"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Treyni was being far too optimistic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">If Ramiris wasn’t involved, Treyni was a capable woman of action, but there was no counting on her now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">So since the other two people in the room weren’t using their brains, he tried to find a good way to navigate this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.4">After all, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">he</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1"> wouldn’t mind living alongside Rimuru, either.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">I suppose that’s why I find even a situation as ridiculous as this exciting…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">And it was a lucky thing he had a mask on, because under it was a smile almost childish in its glee.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">The moment I was back, Ranga sent me a Thought Communication.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">(Master, Gobkyuu and the craftsmen have gathered at the western gate. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">However…)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">He didn’t finish the sentence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">What happened? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">Concerned, I headed for the gate, using Dominate Space despite promising myself to lay off a moment ago. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.4">Activating Universal Detect to gain a broader vantage point than what my eyes could give me, I spotted Ranga at the site—and if my destination was within sight, Dominate Space made it easy to rush over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.5">Just a matter of changing my coordinates, really. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.6">Really convenient, but kind of hard to use in battle, since it takes a little time to set off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.7">I’m always scared of leaving myself open like that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.8">Besides, I’m trying to conserve it, remember?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">This, on the other hand, was an emergency, so I reappeared right next to Ranga. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">We were outside the west gate, and immediately I </span><a id="page-152"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">spotted Gobkyuu arguing with someone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">Universal Detect already told me who it was.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“No, you see, like I just said, we’re officially taking over this place!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">I took cover, listening in on the conversation.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“N-no ma’am, I… This area is officially the territory of the demon lord Rimuru, you see, so you will need to obtain his permission first—”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">She was avoiding eye contact, clearly understanding she was in big trouble. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">Whatever she was up to, the small hut behind us clearly had to do with it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.3">Ramiris was claiming the structure as her territory—she had to be hiding something inside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.4">But how did she even bring it over here?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">“Lady Ramiris! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">I’ve brought over some new wood!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">The riddle was solved by Treyni, coming over with an armload of wooden beams.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">The Treyni I knew always had this air of authority. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">Serving Ramiris had completely torn that apart. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.3">Like master, like servant, I guess. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.4">The only person here who could guide me through matters was likely Beretta, who was currently kneeling before me.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">According to Beretta, Ramiris absolutely insisted on moving to my town, with Treyni in full agreement. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">I glanced at Treyni; she was staring into space and looking supremely awkward. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.3">Apparently, she spoiled Ramiris at all times, which I could see from the last time we met, so I believed it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.4">Neither she nor Beretta would dare defy this lady, so they were all but forced into this would-be invasion of my land.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">“And also, as Lady Ramiris stated, we came here after sealing off the entryway to the labyrinth we called home before.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">“Right! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">Exactly! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">So come on! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.4">If you kick us out, we’ll be homeless, Rimuruuuuu!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">She tried to sound as forlorn as possible, despite this being entirely her own doing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">“Oh, poor, poor Lady Ramiris,” I heard Treyni lament. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Please don’t keep encouraging her…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Either way, though, now I knew the situation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">This wasn’t Gobkyuu’s fault at all—it was all on Ramiris and her servants.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">“Sorry you went through that, Gobkyuu.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">“No, no, we were fine, but the gate guards had the worst of it…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">He eyed a nearby hobgoblin by the gate, sleeping soundly.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">“…Um.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">“Yeahhh, uh, sorry. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">I got a little excited…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">“That wasn’t Lady Ramiris’s fault! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">That guard was saying terrible things to her, so I used magic to put him to sleep for a little while.”</span></p>
