<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter008"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">THE INVITEES</span></a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page-81"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">You could try hiding it all you wanted, but it was doomed to spread. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">In short order, the rumors had reached the ears of leaders in the nations surrounding the Forest of Jura—</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Hinata, the Saint, was defeated by Rimuru, the demon lord.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">The news came across several routes, delivered with careful precision, ensuring it would reach the people it was intended for. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">It sounded so eminently plausible, and of course, someone was behind its spreading—but in another moment, the word had traveled so far that nobody would ever know who.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">No matter how secret the Crusaders’ invasion was, there was no way to keep everyone in the dark forever. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">The reason was obvious: Tempest was now the center of attention, and to the nations that had relations with it, they had to be constantly vigilant about intelligence collection. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">The Crusaders’ deployment to Tempest was an open secret by this point, and that helped make this new rumor seem even more believable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">And this news was interpreted in many different ways by many different people. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.5">Some feared the demon lord Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.6">Some angrily dismissed Hinata as a feckless fraud. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.7">Others proceeded with caution, trying to decide how best to keep their homelands safe.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-82"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">But along with these flowing rumors, news was also coming from official sources: Hinata, the Saint, and Rimuru, the demon lord, fought to a draw. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">The result of this: a truce between Lubelius and the Jura-Tempest Federation, along with the signing of a nonaggression treaty.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Things were getting complicated—and that wasn’t the only problem giving world leaders headaches. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">Those very same leaders were receiving invitations from Rimuru himself, the demon lord at the core of this crisis.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">None of these nations were about to accept the Council of the West’s official announcement as the whole story. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">It would turn all common sense on its head—and alter the fabric of the world itself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">Every leader could smell it in the air, and even if they lacked the whole story, they knew that the paladins had suffered no casualties. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.4">That told them everything they needed to make a decision.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">And in the midst of all these wild, twisting motives, the Western Nations were about to experience earth-shattering change.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">In a corner of the Dwarven Kingdom, the Armed Nation of Dwargon, a group of ministers and top officials had settled down into a meeting.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">“Ah, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">now</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1"> he’s done it.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">The dignified voice of Gazel Dwargo, the Heroic King of the land of dwarves, rumbled through the chamber.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">The kingdom’s dark agents, their network of spies, had been busy lately. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">Intelligence was flowing like a torrent, and their agents had to spend sleepless nights analyzing it all, deciphering recorded images and crafting dossiers from the finely mined details. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">Multiple copies of these reports were written out for the ministers, and with all the data involved, the number of pages in each one stacked upward and upward.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">It was grueling work, but it was still better than the situation a few months ago, back when that slime Rimuru became a demon lord and immediately pivoted into a duel with Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">The dark agents, the agency behind them, and Gazel and his officials—they </span><a id="page-83"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">had all suffered terribly from a lack of sleep. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">Compared with those days, this was a walk in the park.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“Heh…heh-heh-heh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">I find it hard to believe, but believe it I must. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">It would appear your sparring partner has defeated the Saint.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“You are being disrespectful, Vaughn,” chided Dolph, the hardheaded captain of the Pegasus Knights. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">“This is a public meeting hall, not your personal chamber. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.3">Remember where you speak!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">Vaughn shrugged and gave him a languid nod before turning a more vengeful eye toward the ministers and coughing once.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“Do not berate him too much, Dolph,” King Gazel said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">“I am as surprised by this as anyone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">I am sure Vaughn couldn’t help but laugh.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">The assembled members had no choice but to accept this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">The news had shocked them all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">Now was no time to go on about Vaughn’s lack of decorum.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">The reports in their hands laid out all the details behind recent events, and it was a roller coaster of a read from start to finish. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">Over a hundred Crusaders, the strongest force among humankind, had staged a clandestine violent assault on the nation of monsters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">Even Henrietta’s dark agents, the pride of Gazel, had only picked up the news the other day—or really, only found out once battle began. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.4">And if the dark agents knew, there was no doubting every other nation’s secret service did. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.5">Tempest, after all, was crawling with spies. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.6">Rimuru seemed to be aware of them, but essentially left them be, perhaps to better advertise his moves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.7">Once full-bore combat began, even the most amateur intelligence organization would know what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">In the end, the Crusaders lost. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">The demon lord Rimuru had won—and without killing a single one of them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">The dark agents sadly failed to witness the battle for themselves, but that was the report they gave.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“But Your Majesty,” Henrietta said, “I saw it happen myself…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">As she explained, she was around to see the fight eventually devolve into a one-on-one duel between Hinata and Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">However, due to an onrush of out-of-control magicules, the dark agents were blocked from magically eavesdropping on the event.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“…We also detected a powerful aura surrounding the area, and we believe that was the cause of this.”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-84"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“So someone triggered a magicule storm powerful enough to block all monitoring magic?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">“It was not a magicule storm, Lady Jaine, so much as a clash of opposed energy waves triggering a jamming signal.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“Hmm,” mused Jaine, the elderly arch-wizard of the kingdom. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">“So you didn’t see how this duel ended yourselves? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">Why are you so sure Hinata lost?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">Hinata, all-powerful head of the Crusaders, required no introduction to Jaine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">She had personal insights into the Saint’s strength, and she found it hard to believe Hinata tasted defeat.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">“I can only offer circumstantial evidence in my defense,” replied Henrietta. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">“But after centuries of refusing to side with monsters, the Western Holy Church has overturned its own doctrine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">They’ve even sent us word about opening official connections with us, the dwarves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.4">The nation of Lubelius is also moving to establish relations with Tempest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.5">Word of this has been sent to governments worldwide, and we are now awaiting the official proclamation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.6">These are drastic changes, and I believe they offer the clearest evidence yet that Hinata was defeated.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“Mmmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Certainly, if those human-supremacist blockheads so quickly changed their tune like that…I suppose it means something must have forced their hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">But… King Gazel, you know this means there’s a greater chance than ever that the demon lord Rimuru has grown more powerful than you, do you not?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.4">Jaine seemed to find even asking the question painful.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Hinata, the Saint, and Gazel, the Master of the Sword, were an even match, whether Gazel wanted to admit it or not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">If Hinata just lost, simple logic dictated that Rimuru now outclassed Gazel.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“Ridiculous!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“How dare you insult His Majesty, Lady Jaine!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">The ministers howled at Jaine, but she refused to budge. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">As far as she was concerned, the truth was the truth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">And Gazel agreed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“That much growth in the space of a few months?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">Vaughn casually asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3">The question was greeted by a snort from the king. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">It’s no longer a matter of growth, my good man!</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1"> he thought.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Even the last time they met, something about the demon lord </span><a id="page-85"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">Rimuru seemed strange. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">This wasn’t some gushing geyser of pure force in front of him—everything was calm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">He couldn’t feel a thing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.4">Gazel’s own power—the unique skill Tyrant, which let him see through everything, even other people’s thoughts—gave him no insight at all into the creature. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.5">It meant Rimuru was able to completely restrain his force. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.6">Maybe he didn’t know everything about the outcome of the duel, but Hinata surviving the ordeal was an achievement in itself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“It is likely so,” he said, considering this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">“The evolution into demon lord means his powers now rival mine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">Him defeating Hinata wouldn’t be unusual at all.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“B-but, Your Majesty! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">You, the hero of generations, on an even keel with a monster born but a few years ago…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“I agree wholeheartedly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">Surely my liege must be mistaken?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“And even if it is so, wouldn’t that make the demon lord Rimuru far too dangerous?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">The ministers were uproarious once more. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">Gazel sighed to himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">If that was how the logic went, Rimuru was far from the only threat.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">He looked down at his dossier. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">In it, the dark agents described how the officers under Rimuru fought against the Ten Great Saints—and according to their report, not one of the monsters fell. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">Each one scored a complete victory, some of them even overwhelming several Saints at once. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.4">It was amazing news, and if it could be believed, there was no denying that Tempest’s overall ability to wage war surpassed Dwargon’s.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">The magically recorded video evidence from the battle was hazy at best, making it hard to discern much detail. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">That was a shame, given how these devices were the height of dwarven technology—but with the unstable magicules in the air, they failed to function properly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">Only the visual images survived, the audio failed to be recorded, and the quality of this imagery made it impossible to analyze the subjects’ abilities. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.4">You could barely make out what was happening, as valuable an asset as this evidence was.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">Still, Gazel could make out a few familiar figures in the images—the magic-born he had spoken with before.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-86"></a><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">They’ve grown stronger. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">Our full force may not be enough to defeat them now…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">Some of the minsters were prattling on about the potential danger, others loudly disagreeing with them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">They were both correct, most likely. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">Gazel tuned out the noise, pondering to himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.4">Maybe, he began to think, he should have wiped him out before he became this much of a threat.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">…No. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">Rimuru was a monster with reason. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">He hoped for amicable relations with human countries. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.4">The town he built, the people he saved, the nations he’d connected with were all ample proof of that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.5">If Rimuru was this unthinking brute who couldn’t empathize with people, humankind would be exposed to unprecedented threats right now.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">But there’s no need to worry about that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">Heh-heh-heh… He wouldn’t ever think about wiping out humankind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">Not Rimuru!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Gazel was convinced of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">Rimuru killed the demon lord Clayman; he did not kill Hinata. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">That alone indicated to Gazel that Rimuru went out of his way to avoid antagonizing humankind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.4">It was easy for him to drone out the minister’s concerns with laughter.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">“Heh-heh-heh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">No need to worry! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.3">I will remind you that Rimuru remains my erstwhile partner in the martial arts. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.4">It would also behoove you to remember that we have backed the nation of Tempest earlier than any other nation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.5">From him, we have earned the most trust he has given anyone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.6">Do you intend to do away with that trust and doubt his intentions?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">He glared at the ministers, using some of his majesty to cow them into submission. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">It did the trick, restoring them to civility.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">“Y-yes… Think of it that way, and it would be foolish to abandon our trade with them…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">“Quite. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">The goods we take from them have immeasurable appeal. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.3">And we’ve even transferred recovery potion manufacturing to them.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">“Whether in the form of technology exchange or anything else, a relationship must be based on trust. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">Why is there any need for us to panic?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">“Yes, no need to worry at this point…”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-87"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">They glanced at each other and smiled somewhat sheepishly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">Gazel grinned at them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">To the Dwarven Kingdom, which valued fairness as a core tenet, being a demon lord was no reason for discrimination. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">All the ministers seemed to remember that now, and Gazel was glad to see it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.3">Yes, Rimuru had obtained astonishing strength, but looking back at past events, there was no doubting his trustworthiness as a person. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.4">They were still building a friendly relationship—keeping that going was the obvious choice.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">Besides, Rimuru said he was an otherworlder, bringing with him knowledge of other planets and the drive to bring it to life with his vast litany of skills. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">The fact that he was pushing all this development forward mainly to satisfy his own self-centered cravings for luxury was nothing short of fascinating.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">Plus, his followers always carried out his orders with a smile, no matter how outlandish. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">Tempest and the Dwarven Kingdom were already connected with a highway, winding its way over mountains and through valleys and providing safe passage for anyone who used it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.3">Rimuru’s monsters blazed that trail, and all it took was an idea and a simple word or two from him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.4">Things that otherworlders of the past abandoned as being too costly or labor-intensive were no obstacle to Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.5">He had the core strength needed to brute-force it all to life.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">He had a drive, a drive backed by an army of loyal monsters. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">How envious I am</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">, Gazel mused. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">No matter how difficult the problem, Rimuru could just offhandedly say “Figure it out! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.3">Good luck!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.4">and his monsters would do their level best. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.5">They all assumed that was normal; none doubted him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.6">Maybe it was that slime’s most fearsome asset of all—that genius-level ability to trick people into doing his bidding.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">For better or for worse, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1"> demon lord was an entertaining one.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">And perhaps he’s been tricking me, too, this whole time…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">But, Gazel reasoned, that was just fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">If Rimuru was pursuing the kind of world he saw as ideal, what would result from that? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">Gazel was keenly interested in finding out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.4">He wanted to see it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.5">It’d trigger a Temma War, a struggle between mortals and angels, </span><a id="page-88"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">and Rimuru knew that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">But he’d probably just fight back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">Tempest had a terrifying military force backing it up—perhaps terrifying enough to fend off a horde of angels. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.4">And Gazel was willing to cheer him on.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">“The demon lord Rimuru and I may not be related by blood, but we are brothers,” he growled, his voice dominating the meeting hall. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">“As long as he does not lose his heart for humanity, let us provide him with as much support as we can—and let us welcome a new era and the budding of a new civilization. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.3">If anyone objects to this, let them speak now.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">That was, in effect, the king of the dwarves announcing his decision.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Vaughn, the admiral paladin on the force, smiled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">“You’ve got me on your side, King Gazel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">You’re the boss!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">“My lord,” stated the night assassin Henrietta, “I will always serve as your shadow and follow every whim of your heart.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">“Yes, do what you like. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">I am old, with little time left to live, but if my last few years may be happy ones, I will follow you as far as you may go, my lord.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Jaine still looked pretty healthy, despite her words. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">This was just her way of saying that Gazel enjoyed her support no matter what happened.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">Finally, Dolph, leader of the Pegasus Knights, sighed and shook his head.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">“If that’s what you all have to say, I suppose I’ll have to clean up the mess that results. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">You’ll need someone to keep him in check, won’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">That was his role, most of the time, and Dolph didn’t resent it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">The heroes of dwarfdom were in unison, and a new policy was forged. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">But while nobody would defy their supreme leader’s decision on the surface, some of the ministers were still of different minds. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.3">They would nonetheless offer their support, hiding their own intentions under the protective front of the administrators’ decisions.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">There was just one reason for that: As part of a nation leading the world in technology, something about “budding new civilizations” struck a chord with them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">Toiling away at their research, making </span><a id="page-89"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">only piecemeal advances, offered no hope of major developments. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">This demon lord, meanwhile, was pushing the envelope and demonstrating zero fear of anyone stopping him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.3">Vester, their former colleague, reported as much to them, and some in the room had started to envy the freedom the man enjoyed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">“How dare Sir Vester just leave and join that band! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">Unforgivable!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">“Yes! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">Did you hear about the new barriers built on the highways to ward off monsters?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">“And the lighting, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">I hear of new communication devices under development as well.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">“Potions weren’t enough for him, were they? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">I can’t believe how jealous—er, how outraged I am!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">It was starting to become clear where the ministers’ hearts and minds truly were. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">Gazel snickered, then cleared his throat—a signal for everyone to stay quiet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.3">The ministers’ eyes focused on him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">“Our conclusion is clear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">Our nation must trust in the demon lord Rimuru and walk forward in unison with him! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">Let us receive the fruits of their labor, keeping the technology they develop for ourselves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.4">Thus, if they ever are defeated by the heavenly army, that technology will never be lost! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.5">Such is the will of the Armed Nation of Dwargon!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">Nobody was ever going to complain about that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">King Gazel always prioritized his own nation above all else. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.3">The ministers bowed their heads at once, expressing their agreement.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">“Heh-heh-heh… Not letting go of the goods, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">I appreciate how you aren’t couching it in rosy vocabulary, at least.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Vaughn was speaking—or muttering, really—for most of the people in the hall.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">It wasn’t long before the conference ended, with the final item on the itinerary—the acceptance of Lubelius’ request—treated almost as an afterthought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">Now the bureaucracy would go to work, drafting up new treaties with both Lubelius and Tempest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.3">It wouldn’t happen overnight, but the three of them, plus the rest of the Western Nations, would all need to prepare together for the Temma War. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.4">There was no way of telling yet whether this was the right move, but at the very least, Gazel was content.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">Once things settled down a bit, one minister raised his hand.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">“Your Majesty, a word?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">Gazel, preparing to leave the chamber, settled back in his seat and eyed him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">“My liege, we have received a letter of invitation from Sir Rigurd. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.2">It seems that Sir Rimuru is holding an event to officially mark his debut as demon lord…and he seeks your attendance.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">“His debut? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">What could </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1"> be about?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">The minister was just as in the dark as Gazel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">He blinked helplessly a couple times, giving the other ministers enough time to raise yet another hue and cry.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">“Just a front, I’m sure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">He no doubt bids you to be present so he can boast to the world about how friendly we are with him.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">“I think that boat has long left port, good sir.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">Vaughn gauged the ministers, a thoughtful look in his eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">“How interesting! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.3">I do recall how wonderful their accommodations were. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.4">I was allowed to bask in a hot spring, the food was excellent, and the conduct of their servants impeccable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.5">I knew Vester was training them, but plainly he did his job well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.6">And I can imagine how grandiose these ‘festivities’ might be!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">He certainly sounded enthusiastic about it to Gazel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">If the king turned down the invite, Vaughn seemed likely to go in his stead.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">“What is your bidding, my liege?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">a minister ventured to ask the silent king. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.3">“Sir Rigurd sends word that, while attending may pose some difficulty for you, if you are able to grace them with your presence, they will provide you treatment truly befitting a king. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.4">Similar invitations have apparently been sent to leaders around the world, and there are only a limited number of seats available. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.5">He also warned us to reply as quickly as possible, as Tempest will be crowded on the dates of the event.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">It sounded polite enough, but it was no way to talk to the ruler of a great, powerful nation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">The minister knew as much, fearing how his lord would respond as he spoke. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.3">But it was nothing that fazed Gazel—if anything, it perplexed him that anyone thought it would. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.4">His Tyrant skill made it easy for him to read the minds of his ministers, so he smiled a bit as he attempted to correct them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">“Let us accept the invitation, then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">I look forward to touring Tempest anew.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">“My liege! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">No matter how friendly Sir Rimuru is with you, I seriously question the validity of this event. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.3">We do not know what manner of entertainment there might be, but surely they could prepare a seat for you any time they wanted!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">“Indeed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">And they did not specify how long the invite list was, but do they think the world’s great leaders have all the time in the world on their hands? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.3">No, they will not accept such a sudden request so readily.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">“And Your Majesty personally traveling to the event presents some serious issues, if I may say so!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">The ministers weren’t in the wrong. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">But Gazel paid them no mind.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">“I am not so sure about your concerns. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">If anything, this move shows supreme confidence on his part. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.3">You see, my minsters, you only know of him from the time he traveled to our gates. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.4">Now, as a demon lord, he is another creature entirely. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">This</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1"> is the Rimuru so confidently holding this event, and it will no doubt be quite a fascinating one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">Besides, I am sure many of us would like to explore the internal workings of Tempest, now that it has become a great </span><a id="page-92"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">military power. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">If they are sending out invitations, I have no doubts that many will be accepted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.3">Just as Vaughn said, the lodging provided is superb, and if they want to establish a guest list sooner rather than later, it must surely be so they can provide the best service possible to their visitors.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">“Very true,” Vaughn agreed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">“He certainly </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1"> strike a bolder image as demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">Very few people indeed could get away with treating Sir Rimuru like a fool nowadays. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.3">And I can’t help but wonder what sort of festival the monsters would want to hold. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.4">Whether representing our kingdom or not, I most certainly wish to participate.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">Vaughn had intended to be a part of this from the moment he heard of it, perhaps expecting to ask Vester for an invitation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">Gazel certainly didn’t want him to have all the fun. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.3">He knew full well the ministers would be dead set against their king’s attendance, though, so he searched for a method to make them see things his way.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">“Besides, I am Rimuru’s partner in battle—and as such, I must guide him to ensure he is not being ridiculed by his own people. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">I must make it known to his neighbors that we of Dwargon are the first nation to make friends with Tempest.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">Some of the ministers began to understand Gazel’s true intentions.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">“Ah… Y-yes, yes! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">We have the closest ties of all to Sir Rimuru, and we should be sure other nations are aware of it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">“Agreed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">I understand that those scoundrels in Thalion are attempting to butter him up, now that he is a demon lord.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">“Now would be a good time to show His Majesty in close consort with Sir Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.2">It would do wonders to keep our rivals in check.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">So far so good</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">, thought Gazel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">He opened his mouth a little, preparing to conclude this debate, when:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">“I fail to see why we are even discussing this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.2">We know full well that if we defy His Majesty, he will simply slip past our borders again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.3">Instead of that, I feel it far safer for Dwargon to provide its full support to its leader.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">This was the chief elder of Dwargon’s senate chiding the ministers, a man who rarely participated in public debate. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.2">The time </span><a id="page-93"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">Gazel employed a body double to escape the kingdom undercover still grated at him, apparently.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">Oh, brother. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">Well, at least I can join in the festivities now…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">This wasn’t exactly the way Gazel meant to gain support, but it was good enough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">It kind of put him off a little, but he was willing to accept it.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">Now, the Dwarven Kingdom was 100 percent committed to the Tempest invite, no matter how bewildered the ministers were by it, and with that, more and more people in the hall began expressing their desire to join in.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">Before long, Gazel had quite another problem: </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">How am I ever going to pare down the list of attendants joining me?</span></em></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">On the grounds of the royal palace of Thalion was a large, impressively beautiful garden, expansive enough to house a variety of plants and creatures rare to find in the wild. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">This park was personally funded by the emperor, who enjoyed a vast fortune thanks to the many streams of revenue she enjoyed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.3">A very small percentage of that income was all it took to keep this masterpiece of natural beauty going. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.4">And not just the garden—nothing in and around the palace was funded by tax revenue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.5">That was how impossibly rich the head of the Sorcerous Dynasty was.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">Two people were currently relaxing within these gardens. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.2">One was Archduke Erald Grimwald, father of the adventurer Elen and one of the nation’s most powerful officials. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.3">Facing him was the only person in Thalion who wielded more authority than he—Emperor Elmesia El-Ru Thalion herself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">On paper, the emperor was of ambiguous gender with beautiful features that were only vaguely feminine—at least, that was the act she put on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">In truth, Elmesia was female through and through.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">Her age, however, was unknown. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.2">She was among the most </span><a id="page-95"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">pure-blooded of elves, meaning her elven qualities were stronger than most; she simply didn’t age. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.2">That made her a living witness to history, and asking how many years she had lived was a taboo. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.3">She looked elegant and noble, but she still hadn’t lost her youth—in fact, her compact frame could cause one to mistake her for a child. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.4">Her jade-green eyes were sharp and intelligent, and her vibrant skin was like a fresh coating of snow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.5">Her long silver hair shone as it flowed down her head, brushing past the light redness of her cheeks, and her unique, pointed ears poked out from underneath.</span></p>
