<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-epilogue"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">THE FINAL BRIEFING</span></a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page-283"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">It was evening by the time we wrapped up our talks with the tengu on the final day. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">After an earlyish dinner, we decided to hold our first administrative meeting in a while.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Since we had all my officials here for a change, I figured it’d be a good chance to brief each other on recent events. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">We also had a few visitors—Veldora, Ramiris, and her servants Beretta and Treyni. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">Milim would be “officially” coming to town three days from now, and I guess she was really starting to feel the heat from Frey, so she decided to head back home in the meantime. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.4">Smart girl. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.5">I don’t know how pissed off Frey was, but if Milim stayed here for much longer, I bet the answer would be </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">very</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">, and I didn’t want to be caught in the cross fire.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Plus, we had another new face:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">“Now, before we begin this conference, there’s someone I’d like to introduce to you all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">This is Mjöllmile, or Mollie, and I am considering a government post for him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">He’s been intimately involved with arrangements for the Founder’s Festival in three days, and if it turns out successful, I’d like to name him chief of our financial affairs. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4">I want all of you to treat him well.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">I had wanted to do this when everybody was around. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">Plus, I wanted Mjöllmile to handle the final pre-festival briefing for me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“Er, my name is Gard Mjöllmile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">Sir Rimuru has been kind </span><a id="page-284"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">enough to give me a crucial duty in the upcoming festivities, and frankly I’m rather tense, but I hope I will earn good favor from all of you here today.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">As an ever-so-slightly overweight fellow, Mjöllmile didn’t look “tense” at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">Still, it must’ve taken guts, introducing himself to a room full of monsters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.3">Even </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">he</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1"> gets nervous sometimes, I guess. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">Dealing with mafia types in the big city was probably a far cry from going face-to-face with high-level magic-born like us.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">With our introductions now concluded, I jumped right into the topic at hand.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“All right, Mollie, if you could go over how things are looking for us right now…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“Yes sir. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">If you’ll excuse me, then—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Taking my cue, Mjöllmile got up from his seat next to Rigurd and went over our preparations for the Founder’s Festival.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">Two days from now, on the night before opening ceremonies, we would be holding a citywide launch party. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">This would be open to everyone, including not just event invitees but the merchants (and the adventurers bodyguarding them) visiting town, with free food and drink for all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">The news had already gone out, of course, and I heard about farmers and the like from nearby cities traveling over for it—the exact sort of tourism I wanted to attract, so I wanted to be damn sure they had a great time.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">In the reception hall, meanwhile, we’d hold a palatial banquet for the visiting royalty and nobility. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">Everything served here would be a tandem effort between Shuna and Yoshida the baker; they were debuting a lot of new dishes, I knew, so I couldn’t wait. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.3">This would be a standing buffet-type thing, since I wanted guests to enjoy smaller bits of as many different kinds of food as we could offer.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">Then the Founder’s Festival officially began. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">On the morning of the first day, I would hold a speech. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">Yes, yet another speech, but I needed </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">some</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1"> kind of event to officially proclaim that I was a demon lord, so this was kind of unavoidable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">I suggested skipping this, since everyone knew already, but my advisers all just smiled and said no.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-285"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">Right after that, we’d kick off the battle tournament at the coliseum. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">I, however, would not be in attendance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">This festival was meant to help VIPs from other nations get to know Tempest, so I couldn’t just sit around watching the preliminary rounds all day.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Instead, my itinerary included a seat at our newly refurbished and extremely fancy-looking theater. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">Nobody’s told me what kind of performance to expect, which made me a bit anxious, but Mjöllmile seemed really enthusiastic about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">“I feel this will be a chance to show the world that you are a </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">cultured</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1"> demon lord,” he’d said with a grin.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Shion was smiling right along with him, which did nothing to calm my nerves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">But no point stewing over it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">If it had Mjöllmile’s stamp of approval, I’d have to trust in him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">After lunch came a technological exhibition, including panels like Gabil and Vester’s history of healing potions, Kurobe and Garm’s grand tour of their weaponry, and so on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">This would take place at our museum—which, like the theater, would be open to the general public from day two onward; for today, it was open to nobility only, so they could take their time with everything on display. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">I thought that staggering the schedules like that would be best for security purposes.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">Speaking of day two, that’s when I’d begin to take in the battle tournament. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">Later that afternoon, I’d also hold a series of chats—or to put it another way, it was some unscheduled free time for me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">Basically, I’d be in my VIP box at the arena, and if anyone wanted to talk to me, I’d take their questions one by one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.4">Mjöllmile was arranging all that for me, so really, it’d just be a pleasant distraction as I took in the tournament. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.5">Everyone who received paper invites would have a guide provided for them, and they’d be free to enjoy the fest any way they wanted—peruse the stalls, enjoy our luxurious hot baths, or check out the tournament themselves.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">Then, on day three, we’d finally open up our long-awaited Dungeon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">The final matches of the tournament would take place that morning, and in the afternoon, you’d get to watch as adventurers tried their hand at conquering the labyrinth.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">“You’ve completed quite an impressive coliseum while I was </span><a id="page-286"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">gone,” marveled Geld, no doubt impressed that there was a whole generation of talented craftsmen below him now.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“That we have. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">You and Mildo have a great apprentice in Gobkyuu. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">It’s a perfectly sound structure; you wouldn’t even know this was a rush project. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.4">If our top magic-born fought in here, I’d be worried, but any fights between competitors ranked below A shouldn’t be a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">In terms of safety, the arena could </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">juuuust</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1"> about withstand a high-level spirit like Ifrit raging inside it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">Which, I mean, if someone focused the full brunt of their attacks on the arena itself, I couldn’t do much about that, but I’d be there for the main battles, and I planned on putting a light Absolute Defense barrier over the stadium. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">Barring a catastrophe, the audience would be perfectly safe, probably.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“Kwah-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">And I’ve discovered the ultimate in gourmet bliss with my hibachi grill. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">It will be a can’t-miss delight, trust me on that!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">Oh, I almost forgot. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">He </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">really</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1"> wanted to run a stand, so there wasn’t much to do for it except let him participate in disguise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">It’s funny, though—somewhere along the line, Mjöllmile and Veldora had really started to get along with each other. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">All the impossible demands I had given them, and it looked like he was now fully used to things. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.4">Amazing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.5">This guy may be more of a monster than I thought.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">That was all for Mjöllmile’s rundown. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">Diablo, Hakuro, and Geld—who weren’t around for all the lead-up work—listened intently to it all, no doubt saddened that they couldn’t be a part of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">I should probably give each of them a reward of some sort. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.4">Geld’s could wait until he was done with his current job, but Diablo and Hakuro had wrapped up theirs with flying colors.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">Making a mental note of that, I turned to my officials. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">“So far, everything’s been going smoothly,” I said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">“Have any of you run into any issues?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">If nobody had, I was going to turn it over to Soei, but—</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“Yes sir!”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-287"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">That was Ramiris’s cheerful voice sounding out as she raised her hand. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">Ramiris, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">I’m sure it’s nothing serious, then.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“What’s up, Ramiris?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“Well, um, I got a problem?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“Yes? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“Okay, well, you see, it’s about the bottom floors of the Dungeon…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">She fell silent, glancing at Veldora.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">“Kwaaaah-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Yes, erm, it is nothing serious. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">You recall the forest installed in Floor 95 of the labyrinth? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.4">Well, for some reason, it has started growing its way up into higher floors, and it now covers everything up to Floor 71!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.5">Veldora said.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">He sounded so </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">casual</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1"> about it, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">Floors 91 to 94 were thankfully sealed off, so they apparently weren’t affected. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">But the rest of the levels were now lush forest, thanks to the plant life making its way up the magicule ventilation ducts.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">“Uh, that’s gonna be a pretty big pain in the ass to clean up, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">“It sure is! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">That’s why I’m bringing it up with you!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">Ramiris cried.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">I hated to say it, but she had a point. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">Eesh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.3">If this was anyone’s fault, it was Veldora’s.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">“And erm, we do have one more small issue,” the dragon added.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">“…What would that be?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">“Sir Rimuru, why don’t you let them take care of this?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">“My master, I can think of someone suitable…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">It was Shuna, Treyni, and Ranga.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Shuna suggested that Adalmann the wight would work as a boss; Gabil rapidly agreed with her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">“Adalmann’s forces are weak against sunlight,” she reasoned, “so they would thrive in cave-like environments. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">I think the labyrinth would be perfect for them.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Indeed, while Adalmann could leave the cave in the day, none of his forces could. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">I heard they liked to wander outside at night, much to the consternation of passing merchants. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.3">I had a stack of complaints from them in my office. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.4">Yeah, if I ran into a walking skeleton in the dead of night, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">I’d</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1"> probably pee my pants, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">Putting them down in that maze seemed like a good idea.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">“Besides,” Shuna glumly continued, “he </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">is</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1"> a little pushy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">Praising you as a god and everything…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">In Adalmann’s eyes, I was a god, and Shuna my shrine princess. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">That </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1"> pretty annoying, yes.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">We’ll stick Adalmann in Floor 60 as the boss. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.3">And Ramiris, I’ll get some stuff to make an Elemental Colossus with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.4">Have Adalmann help you out.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">“Are you sure?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">“Yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">He’s got a lot of intelligence, if not much else. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.3">He ought to help out with your research.”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-289"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">Thanks, Rimuru!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">So we had bosses for Floors 60 and 70.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Now it was Treyni’s turn, and she suggested leaving Floors 71 through 80 (where the vegetation was still relatively sparse) to Zegion and Apito. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">“Those two can summon their underlings,” she said, “so they should be able to reclaim those floors in quick order. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">Plus…” She flashed a look at Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.4">“I think that Zegion would make a fine boss for Floor 80,” she said, smiling. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.5">“He’s done a wonderful job protecting the treant homeland up to now.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">“I see…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">“That sounds like a splendid idea,” chimed in Veldora. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">“I would be happy to train him up to a fighter worthy of making Floor 80 proud!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Yeah, Zegion was definitely a lot stronger than one might guess. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">Definitely stronger than a tempest serpent, or at least he was the last time I saw him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.3">But this is still Zegion we’re talking about—he’s just a bug the size of a squirrel or something, you know? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.4">I’m not sure how much you could “train up” something like that, but oh well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.5">I already knew Veldora was a weirdo, so I could just let him do what he liked.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">“Okay. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">Let’s go with that.”</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">Then for Ranga.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">“Master, the fox spirit I have been tending to has awoken and claims to be gifted at clearing out forests in any way requested. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">I would suggest accepting the offer, perhaps,” he said, poking his head out from my shadow.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">And sitting between his ears was what looked like a fox pup with four golden tails swaying behind it. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">So</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1"> cute.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">Essentially, this kit’s offer was to blaze animal trails through the vegetation, creating a sort of maze with them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">If that was what it wanted to do, I saw no reason to say no. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.3">If it proved not up to the task, I could just raze the forest then.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">Then I noticed a problem of my own. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">This fox, nicknamed Nine-Head back when it was under Clayman’s control, still didn’t really have a name.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">“Well, wait. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">Before that, lemme give you a name. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.3">From this day forward, your name is Kumara.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">It was totally casual, like giving a dog a name. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">But I wasn’t stupid. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.3">I had learned my lesson by now, and I wasn’t gonna have all my magical energy sapped away </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1"> time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">No, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1"> time I could control— Wait, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">whooaaaaaaa</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">I was suddenly seized by a flooding sort of lethargy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">This was soon followed by panic.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">Soei smiled a little. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.2">This Hero—Lightspeed Masayuki, a name familiar to me—was now being lauded as the strongest man in the Western Nations, a reputation no doubt buoyed by the news of my victory over Hinata. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.3">Did this mean anyone who lost to a demon lord wasn’t worth pinning the hopes of humankind to? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.4">I felt like I did something bad to her now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.5">Hope she doesn’t take it personally.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-292"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">But back to Masayuki. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.2">There wasn’t a lot of hard intel on this guy, so we didn’t know much about him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.3">However, he was confirmed to have destroyed Orthrus—and freed the elven slaves they were holding.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">“Several elves were among the slaves, and it seems Masayuki is now accompanying them back toward our nation.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">Sounds like I owe him a word or two of gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">…But there was a problem.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">“What should we do, Sir Rimuru? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">If you like, I could dispatch him before he causes any trouble for us…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">“…No, better not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.2">Let’s try talking with him first.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.2">Anyone who professes to slay a demon lord needs to be taught a lesson, in my personal opinion, but…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">…Yes, as could be surmised from this conversation, there were rumors in the Western Nations that Masayuki intended to topple me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">Soei already had an inhumane-looking smile—just </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">imagining</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1"> what he’d do with the guy, no doubt—but he still followed my orders.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">But…man, I </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">really</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1"> didn’t wanna have to face a Hero right in the middle of the Founder’s Festival, one of the most important events in the history of Tempest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">I was worried the battle-obsessed members of my staff—Shion and Diablo, to say nothing of Soei—would defy orders, run off, and do something terribly unwise.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">“Let me take care of Masayuki. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.2">Absolutely no touching him, you got it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">“““Yes sir!”””</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">Well, at least they knew how to say “yes sir” in unison.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">But with three days to go until the Founder’s Festival, I now had a thorny problem at hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">It was like rain on my parade, and it made me feel a lot gloomier about the future.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">But not long from now—a massive, intense party was about to kick off and throw all my trivial worries to the wind.</span></p>
