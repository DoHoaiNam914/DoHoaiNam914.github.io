<p class="noindent"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“You are quite a spiteful man, Granville. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">I came very close to dying, I’ll have you know.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">“Don’t be absurd. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">You fled before you could even get involved, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">“I had no choice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">Did my protégé deliver the news to you?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">“More or less, yes…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">“That demon was more of a monster than I ever imagined. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">The Empire’s regular forces would hardly stand a chance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">We would need the most powerful army I know, the Imperial Guard, to defeat him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.4">But enough about that…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Damrada and Granville were seated facing each other, each sizing up their partner as they calmly chatted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">In Damrada’s eyes, their plan had failed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">Thus, he felt it prudent to keep his distance from the Rozzo family until the heat died down a little. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4">If their scheme had worked, that would have given them an advantage in the negotiations, but if not, he was likely to face demands he found singularly unreasonable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.5">Right now, he simply wanted to cut his losses and move on.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">But things had changed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">On his way to Tempest, he had received a magical call, reporting the news to him:</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-4"></a><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“Hinata is defeated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">She and the demon lord Rimuru have agreed to terms.”</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">Damrada had pictured this happening. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">But it was still the worst possible outcome imaginable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">Hinata’s survival made it harder to do business in the nations where the Western Holy Church held sway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.4">If she had made peace with Rimuru, it was unlikely anyone could rile that demon lord up once again to kill her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.5">Damrada and Granville joined forces on this scheme because they both stood to gain from it, but it was now safe to say the whole thing failed miserably.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">…Although, depending on how you view this, you could call it fortuitous…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">Their strategy had failed, but to Damrada, this was at best a glancing blow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">It meant losing part of their foundation in the Western Nations, but there were other trade routes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">Cerberus was a group as enormous as it was shadowy, operating several different trade organizations as fronts for its activities. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.4">Furthermore, Damrada had no personal interest in whether Hinata lived or died. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.5">Granville’s failure was therefore not all that irritating to him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.6">And thanks to that, Damrada was currently trying to work out his and Granville’s future relationship to his advantage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.7">After a hasty change of plans, Damrada had come to meet with Granville once again.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">“But what about you, Granville? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">Were you all bark and no bite? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.3">Not only did you fail to take care of Hinata, her connection to Rimuru is even stronger than before…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">Blind to his own involvement in their failed strategy, Damrada moved to criticize Granville instead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">But Granville himself was likely expecting as much.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“Yes,” Granville replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">“I must admit to that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">There will be no rebalancing the scales now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.4">Farmus, for all its history, has fallen, and I imagine a new nation will replace it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.5">It is exactly what Rimuru wanted, and it means your project is in shambles.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">He didn’t hesitate to agree with Damrada and went on to expound on his own theory before getting right to the point.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Damrada, well aware of the current situation, chose to respond with silence.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-5"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“So what will you do?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“Rimuru seems to want the Forest of Jura to become the financial center of the world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">We of the Rozzos will not stand for that.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“Mmm…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Damrada coldly calculated how to respond. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">He had no intention of deliberately getting on the Rozzos’ wrong side. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">As far as he was concerned, if they could both just put this state of affairs behind them, all was well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.4">And Granville, to his credit, seemed to be of the same mind, going ahead of Damrada and turning his eyes toward the future.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“So what would quarreling with each other accomplish? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">Now that a fight between the demon lord and Saint Hinata is unlikely to happen, any further public activity would be ill-advised. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">The same is true for your side, too, is it not?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Granville seemed to be reading his mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">“Heh-heh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">I see there is no outwitting you, my good man. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.4">No, there is no point trying to assign blame for this failure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.5">The Five Elders have been more than kind to us up to now, and I know this remains the case. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.6">We may not have been able to profit off a potential war, but so be it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.7">As long as we remain alive, other opportunities will come.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“Well said, Sir Damrada. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">I do appreciate how quickly you understand me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">Let us continue to work together to block this new economic threat before it begins!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">It went without saying that Damrada’s mission was to protect his interests in the Western Nations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Maribel, Granville’s treasure, had predicted that this nation in the Forest of Jura would potentially become a financial juggernaut. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">If it did, that would inevitably weaken the Rozzo family’s influence on the world.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Granville would never allow cracks to open on the system of rule his ancestors spent thousands of years building up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">That was why he wanted to interfere with Rimuru, to crush his ambitions—but without his status as part of the Seven Days Clergy, he could no longer use the name of the god Luminus to his advantage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">Thus, no matter what it took, he needed support from Cerberus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.4">The other Five Elders—Granville’s descendants and comrades—supported </span><a id="page-6"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">him on that, applying pressure to the Council of the West and ensuring that the postwar cleanup over on Farmus took as long as possible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">They couldn’t stop that country from crowning a new king, but they </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">could</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1"> do whatever it took to delay the inevitable.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">The Rozzo family still had a few aces up their sleeve, but it was too premature to use them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">Better to take advantage of Cerberus instead, Granville thought.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">“Ah, one moment on that…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">But Damrada wasn’t ready to agree with him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">The Rozzos, and the Five Elders they controlled, were excellent business partners; he truly had no intention of doing away with their relationship. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">But thinking this meant Damrada was their lapdog would be a mistake. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.4">He was a merchant, motivated by money, and he had a flexible mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.5">Cerberus had grown fabulously rich thanks to the exclusive control it held over trade between the East and West, yes, but the arrival of a new customer to work with was nothing that hurt Cerberus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.6">The Five Elders’s loss of influence over the Western Nations was no business of theirs.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“…I truly do desire to maintain friendly relations with you and your family. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">However, I’m afraid I cannot readily agree to your suggestion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">After all, our organization has no reason to be hostile to Rimuru.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“How dare you…!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“Heh-heh-heh… As you yourself said, now that Hinata knows me, any further activity in the Western Nations is out of the picture. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">Instead, I will return home and provide you with someone else.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">The message Damrada gave was clear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">If Granville had eliminated Hinata as promised, he </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">could</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1"> be more active right now…but that hadn’t happened.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">“For now, we will continue our transactions as before. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">As for </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1"> incident, I suggest that we should just forgive and forget.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">Damrada stood up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">Granville had misread him, and he could no longer force the point. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.3">The Cerberus group had an iron grip on the Eastern Empire’s underground. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.4">Angering Damrada, one of their </span><a id="page-7"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">bosses, enough to sever their relations for good was too much of a loss for the Rozzos to bear right now.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“…Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">We will handle it ourselves, then, so I do hope you will at least refrain from interfering in the matter.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“That much goes without saying,” Damrada replied with a smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">“Look back at our previous dealings. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">You are safe trusting us.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">With a polite bow, he left the room.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">From start to finish, Damrada had been sincere in everything he said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">On the surface, he was the very picture of an honest merchant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">But if Hinata had been killed as planned, he would have reached out to Rimuru long ago, pitting the Rozzos against the demon lord and profiting off the eventual clash. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.4">But an impartial observer never would have suspected any of that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.5">People called him Damrada the Gold for a reason.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">But Granville was a sly old dog himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">He had a (mostly) accurate grip on Damrada’s motivations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.3">Yes, he was unlikely to interfere—but he didn’t say anything about </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">not</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1"> courting Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">He had told no lies, which was the minimum anyone would want to see from a merchant, but Granville was the leader of a family who ruled over much of the world’s business. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">Damrada’s attitude wasn’t something he was willing to abide.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">“…I detest him so much,” Granville whispered, now alone in the room. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">“He thinks he can take advantage of me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">Once this matter is done with, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">you’re</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1"> next.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">The humiliation in his eyes darkened into surging rage…</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">Damrada was the height of arrogance while dealing with the Rozzos. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">With this boy, he was far more self-deprecating. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">It was to be expected. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.4">After all, this boy—broadly nodding his approval at </span><a id="page-8"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">Damrada’s report—was both his master and the leader of the Cerberus group.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">“Heh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">Yes, that was quite a stroke of luck. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.3">His name was…Diablo, if I recall. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.4">A fearsome demon, one who might even be the equal of Blanc over in the Empire. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.5">Rimuru himself is far from the only threat.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">“Yeah… I got a feeling Rimuru’s gonna grow stronger before we can get ourselves fully back in order.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">“I agree. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">That demon lord has the uncanniest luck working for him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.3">He’s assembled quite a number of magic-born, and he’s even tamed the Storm Dragon himself…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">“To tell the truth, I think a frontal assault would be a pretty bad idea.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">“Well, no point fretting about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">We’ve got time to work with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.3">We can think about it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">“That we can. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">Things will remain rather chaotic for a while to come. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.3">Joining in the fray could burn us badly.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">“Mm-hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">I used Hinata to get back at ’em a little, but that sure didn’t work out, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">It’s too dangerous to make any other moves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.4">Better to lay low for a while.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">The boy smiled, not seeming to care too much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">Damrada thought things over as he returned the smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">Then, he seemed to remember something.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">“Still,” he glumly stated, “I have to say, the Five Elders were all bark and no bite. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">Going on about how they would destroy Hinata—and look how </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1"> worked out, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">With both surviving, I’m sure they’ll work out their misunderstandings. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">That could end the whole rift between Tempest and the Holy Church before too long.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">“I thought that would happen,” the boy replied with a chuckle. </span><a id="page-9"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">“Rimuru is too generous to humankind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">I didn’t think he had it in him to kill Hinata. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.3">I was kind of hoping that generosity would spell his downfall, sooner or later…but perhaps he wasn’t </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1"> generous.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">“I think the Five Elders were aiming to conspire with Rimuru so they could keep a lid on the Storm Dragon.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">“Well, if </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1"> was all it took, we wouldn’t have any problems right now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">I had you keep close tabs on them precisely </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">because</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1"> I figured they’d screw it up.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">“Ah, I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">But that saved me in the end. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">If you hadn’t contacted me, sir, I would’ve had to duel Hinata herself in front of Rimuru.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">Perhaps, with some more luck, he wouldn’t have blown his cover. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">But he wasn’t optimistic about his chances fighting Hinata. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.3">He deeply appreciated the boy’s advance warning about the danger… Although, of course, the danger only came about because of the boy’s orders. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.4">If Hinata hadn’t been fed false information, Damrada never would’ve been revealed at all.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">Still, this was nothing that troubled Damrada deeply. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">The orders of the boy who led Cerberus took precedence over everything else. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.3">His mission, after all, was no less than to conquer the entire world—a goal Damrada shared. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.4">He adored the boy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.5">With him, he felt, this childlike dream of world domination could really happen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.6">That was why he never questioned any of the orders he received.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">“If I had lost you,” the boy casually said, “my plan would’ve been sabotaged beyond repair.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">“Well,” Damrada replied with a bold grin, “at least I managed to escape for you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">One did not become the leader of Cerberus solely through business acumen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">It took real talent to make the powers that be in the underground bow to you.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">The boy, perhaps knowing this, let a devilish grin creep onto his face. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">“Ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.3">But don’t go all out or anything, all right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.4">Because </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">that’s</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1"> the absolute last resort. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">So let’s just sit and watch a bit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.3">I look forward to seeing how this struggle plays out—especially since there’s no </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">real</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1"> power involved.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">Going all out, as he put it, meant calling upon every asset Cerberus had on hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">That required bringing the two underbosses not </span><a id="page-10"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">in the room, people directly below the boy himself, into the fold. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.2">There would be nothing “covert” about the results. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.3">It could lead to a full-blown war that involved all the Western Nations.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">Damrada nodded at the boy, knowing that wasn’t what he wanted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">“In that case,” he said, “it might be best for me to return to my native land.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">“Yeah, probably. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">You said she didn’t see your face, but this is Hinata we’re talking about. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.3">She’s probably got her sights on you, and that makes open activity difficult. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.4">No, better to have someone else step up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.5">Although…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">Damrada knew what the boy was getting at. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">Cerberus had three underbosses—Damrada and two others—and one of those two was a problem.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">“Let’s not ask Vega to fill in for you, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">“Very well,” a convinced Damrada replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">“In that case, Misha, then?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">“Yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">Let’s go with that.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">The bosses were nicknamed the Gold, the Lover, and the Power, the three symbols of a man’s greed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">Misha, the Lover, was someone you never wanted to let your guard down around, but she at least listened to reason. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.3">Vega, the Power, was a handful. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.4">He was a living, breathing personification of violence, as his name suggested. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.5">Damrada could do nothing to sway his mind; he only listened to direct orders from the boy, who knew that well enough and didn’t want Damrada to deal with him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">“That sounds good, sir. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">So how should we wind down the slave trade I had been working on here?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">“…Oh, right, there was that, wasn’t there? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">The Orthrus Slave Market always was a pain to deal with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.3">Let’s shut it down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.4">I never liked slavery anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">“Mmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">I have no objections, but are we just going to release all the rare monsters we circulate around Misha’s Echidna Club?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">“No, anything designated confidential should be treated the same as always. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">We still have a link to the Rozzo family; we might as well use it.”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-11"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">“Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">I’ll leave the rest in your capable hands,” said Damrada before he took his leave.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">The boy closed his eyes, gleefully moving the mental chess pieces around in his brain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">Then he heard the tapping of footsteps. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.3">His lips curled into a smile as he spoke to the woman behind him, a secretary.</span></p>
