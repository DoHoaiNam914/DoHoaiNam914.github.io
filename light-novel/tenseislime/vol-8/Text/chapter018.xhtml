<p><a id="page-181"></a>I promised I’d bring her some next time I stopped by. I wasn’t sure what to do about sizing it for her, but judging from how Ramiris was already spread out on the sofa and reading manga, I guess I didn’t need to worry… And whoa, there’s Veldora sprawled in bed and doing the same thing. Guess I made him happy. If anyone saw him in here, the solemn majesty of the main chamber would totally go to waste. I really hoped no adventurers would see him like this, as unlikely as that’d be.</p>
<p>Well, no need to go overboard. We spent the afternoon getting Veldora’s room in order before wrapping up the day.</p>
<p class="space-break1">One week later—the pace had dropped a bit toward the end—the labyrinth was complete down to the hundredth floor. The interior, as I directed, was made out of blocks whose structure could be altered freely, allowing us to switch the paths around once every few days. This way, even if anyone memorized the way down, they’d have to start all over next time. I’m talking truly demonic difficulty here. Selling maps would be sacrilege, I thought. I wanted this to be a true gauntlet, and this way, it’d be a new quest every time—always fresh, retaining its difficulty, never getting boring.</p>
<p>As a kind of fail-safe, I did provide “save points” every tenth floor. It turns out that Spatial Motion was possible in Ramiris’s labyrinths, under certain conditions. This wasn’t affected by the local magicules, amazingly. It made it possible to do things like transport food in and out—super-useful—and it also worked on people, letting them freely travel back to these preset locations. In other words, save points, through and through. Reach one, and you get to start from there next time.</p>
<p>It works on your fellow party members, too; you could cheat a little and bring someone below where they’ve been before. There was some debate about that quirk, but I decided to go with it, see how people used (or abused) the feature, and adjust as needed. Besides, even if you cheat your way down a few floors, you’ll still have to deal with the challenge waiting down there. There’s a boss stationed at every level, guardians that work along the lines of the local boss warlords dotted around the Forest of Jura. I was thinking <a id="page-182"></a>of making the ones located before save points particularly powerful; if you wanna take <em>those</em> guys down, save points weren’t going to help you.</p>
<p>Basically, someone would need to be strong enough to reach a save point in the first place before they could take others down there, so I didn’t think anyone would try anything too stupid with them. If a problem came along, we could always reconsider. We had some nice bonuses in the treasure chests, after all, so I hoped our visitors would try hard to defeat the bosses on each floor.</p>
<p>Was it okay for our bosses to kill (or be killed), by the way? Sure, that was another key point. Ramiris’s Mazecraft had the power to revive life itself, resurrecting any adventurers who came into the Dungeon. This could be done only with the subject’s permission, but as long as he or she existed as a consenting part of Ramiris’s realm, it was all good. Ramiris was, in essence, the eternal leader of anything made with Mazecraft. If she was killed, the whole thing would disappear, but otherwise, any of her servants could get revived at a save point, and a “servant” was anyone she had forged a pact with or otherwise agreed to the presence of. I still couldn’t believe the power of this skill.</p>
<p>Now I see why she wanted Beretta so bad. Ramiris was no big deal out on the surface, but in <em>her</em> world, she was invincible. It’s just that the invincibility only worked on people who were <em>part</em> of that world. It didn’t work on golems with no free will, including that Elemental Colossus that vanished. Beretta, meanwhile, wasn’t just a puppet—and that meant he was invincible, now that he served Ramiris. She had Treyni, too, now, which made me begin to wonder if I should start worrying about them. Treyni was kind of strong, after all, and if she couldn’t be destroyed, not even Benimaru or Shion could beat her. Beretta and Treyni were still outside, beavering away at the arena construction work, but still…</p>
<p>Thanks to Ramiris’s hard work, the labyrinth was smoothly approaching completion. Once things calmed down a bit, I’d need to talk to her and her servants about keeping the maze defensible. But that’d be later.</p>
<p>“Ramiris, did you make the thing I asked for?”</p>
<p><a id="page-183"></a>“Oh, this, right? Here it is.”</p>
<p>This was a resurrection item.</p>
<p>In order to receive the immortal attribute within a Mazecraft world, you needed to give your express permission. But we planned to have tons of people storming in, and if it was open to the general public, it’d be a pain to get everyone’s agreement on paper. Maybe Ramiris could keep track of a small handful of visitors, but if multiple parties were running around at once, she couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p>That’s why I asked if there was a disposable item for single-use resurrection purposes. What she gave me now looked like a regular old armlet, knotted together like a friendship bracelet.</p>
<p>“Did you check to see if this works?”</p>
<p>“Sure did! I tried it out on Beretta last night!”</p>
<p>“Whoa, what are you <em>doing</em> to him…?”</p>
<p>Apparently, Beretta willingly agreed to this, his reasoning being <em>“I am a demon, so even in the worst case, I will not truly die.”</em> I know I asked and all, but this was ridiculous. Thanks to that, however, I knew we had a working bracelet. Treyni had taken Beretta’s core out of his body, and within ten seconds, the corpse was transported out of the Dungeon and fully revived.</p>
<p>“Perfect. I appreciate Beretta being brave enough to try it.”</p>
<p>Ramiris smiled and nodded. “Oh, yes! This was the first disposable item I ever tried to make, after all. I figured it was possible, but I’m just glad it worked!”</p>
<p>This was her first time? So what if it <em>didn’t</em> work? I shuddered at the thought. She could’ve at least tested it on animals or something. I wish she wouldn’t be so rash.</p>
<p>Regardless, we now had Resurrection Bracelets. Ramiris reported that she’d also prepare return whistles that brought you back to the surface in an emergency. We could sell both of these at the labyrinth entrance—buy them or don’t; it’s your choice. Don’t blame us if you die or get lost down there, though. Me, I’d definitely buy ’em. We could work out the prices we’d charge later, but for now, we were all set.</p>
<p>If you think about it, though, these Resurrection Bracelets are just Ramiris’s power in a handy physical form. All it did was put you back at the Dungeon’s entrance in the state you entered it in, <a id="page-184"></a>assuming you died within the labyrinth. I think we’d better carefully explain to customers that it wouldn’t revive you just <em>anywhere</em> in the world. Some people out there, you know, it’s in one ear and out the other. If they die outside somewhere because they assumed the wrong thing, that’s their problem—but I’d still feel bad for them, so I ought to make sure I get the message across.</p>
<p class="space-break1">So the basic framework of the Dungeon was complete. Not bad for a single week’s work. I asked Raphael out of curiosity if it could make something like this for me, but:</p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Report. The subject Ramiris’s intrinsic skill Mazecraft cannot be replicated.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1">It sure didn’t take its time providing <em>that</em> answer. No, only Ramiris could do this, and really, I ought to thank her for camping out on my doorstep.</p>
<p>“Great job, Ramiris. Now we can finally move on to part two of the plan.”</p>
<p>She flitted her wings as she replied, “Hee-hee! Of course! I’m a hard worker when I wanna be, y’know!”</p>
<p>I turned to Veldora. “Well, sorry this took so long, but I think it’s time for you to let your aura out.”</p>
<p>“Ahhh, the time has come, has it? Kwah-ha-ha-ha! I am ready!”</p>
<p>Yes, the moment was here.</p>
<p>The Dungeon had ducts and stairways connecting all one hundred floors to one another. How did they keep things ventilated all the way to the bottom? With magic—and that’s the best answer you can get from me. Maybe we didn’t need those ducts at all, but they were there to ensure magicules would make their way to each floor. And that rush of magicules would happen once Veldora came to that central chamber in Floor 100, assumed his original form, and cut loose.</p>
<p>“All right. Here I go. <em>Hraaahhhh!!</em>”</p>
<p>I didn’t need the theatrical shouting, but I suppose he felt better that way.</p>
<p><a id="page-185"></a>Instantly, a spectacularly evil aura engulfed Ramiris and me. I had enclosed us in an Absolute Defense barrier, just in case, but for a moment, it felt like a bomb went off in front of us.</p>
<p>“Phew… Sh-sheesh, that was dangerous,” a shaky Ramiris said. “If you didn’t protect me, I might’ve been blown right outta here…”</p>
<p>Yeah, that was stronger than I thought. The shock wave was packed with an intense concentration of magicules, easily enough to kill a normal person.</p>
<p>“Kwaaaaahhhh-ha-ha-ha! Make way for Veldora!!”</p>
<p>The boss chamber—er, sorry, Veldora’s underground lair—was pretty large, but with the Storm Dragon back to his normal size, it actually seemed a tad cramped. I hadn’t seen him in dragon form in a while, and the sight was just as stately and magnificent as I recalled.</p>
<p>Seriously, if he would just keep his mouth shut, he’d be so <em>majestic</em>.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, such a relief! But <em>oooh</em>, what an onrush that was. If I did that outdoors, there might have been a little trouble!”</p>
<p>He made it sound so casual, but that scenario would’ve been a disaster. And if it was such a “relief,” why were there <em>still</em> magicules coursing out of him?</p>
<p>“W-wow, Master… I didn’t think you’d wreck the labyrinth itself…”</p>
<p>Ramiris was right. The explosion had caved in the walls a bit; the internal pressures had been too much to withstand. And this wasn’t even him attacking!</p>
<p>“Guess you really <em>were</em> holding in a lot, weren’t you? Can you maybe, you know, loosen the valve on it a bit now and then, so it doesn’t come to <em>that</em> again?”</p>
<p>That was just the magicules mixed in with the aura blast, after all, and they came in <em>dense</em>. Veldora’s total energy count must’ve been off the charts. No wonder releasing it was so dicey. Definitely gotta vent a bit more often than <em>that</em> from now on.</p>
<p>Then I was struck with a brilliant idea. Why don’t we build another room in Floor 100 to serve as storage? We could put in the iron ore and so on that we get from the mines, then infuse it with magicules to transform it into magisteel ore in a flash. That stuff’s <a id="page-187"></a>worth its weight in gold, far more in demand than regular metal ore, and it could become a huge resource for us.</p>
