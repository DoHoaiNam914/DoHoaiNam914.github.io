<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">“Of course not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">I’m inviting demon lords to this event, y’know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.3">I’m not about to piss them off for no reason.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Milim looked a bit peeved, although contented that I didn’t forget about her request.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">“Wait a minute, Rimuru!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">Ramiris shouted, livid about this treatment at Milim’s hands. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">“I’m a demon lord, too, you know! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.4">Part of the Octagram with you and Milim!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">“Oh yeah, Ramiris, I didn’t even </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">need</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1"> to send you an invite, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">Not after you decided to just up and </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">move</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1"> here!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“What? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">You </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">moved</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1"> here? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">Wait a second… Ramiris, are you living with Rimuru?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">Ramiris began to a panic a bit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">“Y-yes! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">Yes, I moved here, okay? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.4">So the invitation doesn’t even matter! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.5">I’m not alone any longer, and I’m living with Rimuru and everything, too!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Great. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">Panic or not, that statement was bound to be misunderstood.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">“Aw, that’s no fair! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">I wanna live here, too!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“Ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">Tough luck! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">I’ve got a job here, remember? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.4">I’m helping out Rimuru! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.5">I’m not some overbearing, unwelcome houseguest like you!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“What? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">How </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">dare</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1"> you say that! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">Why, I oughtta—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Milim was ready to duke it out right now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">Ramiris, despite how hopeless her chances were, refused to stand down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.3">Me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.4">I just watched it unfold.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">Fortunately, this was just a verbal spat, limited to the two trading insults with each other. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Neither had the vocabulary for this kind of contention, which made it kinda cute in a way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">Ramiris occasionally accentuated her disses with a flying kick to Milim, who kept trying to grab her out of the air. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.4">It was kind of like a game of tag, and from the side, this almost looked like they were playing at recess. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.5">Apparently, they’ve known each other for a while, so perhaps this was just their way of expressing affection.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">Their squabbling came to a close within moments, however—Shuna had just arrived with some sweets in tow, took one look at the two demon lords, and shot them a firm rebuke.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">“No sweets for anyone who’s bickering!”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-197"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">That immediately shut them both up.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">A couple slices of cake later, and everything was roses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">They were awfully chummy now—but more importantly, I needed to grill Milim over why she came here in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“So, Milim, what are you doing here?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">I asked.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">“Hee-hee! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">I told you! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">You looked like you were up to some fun stuff!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“Um, is that really it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“Uh-huh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">But now I’m really glad I came. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">This cake tastes </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">so</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1"> good, and I like what you’re doing with this labyrinth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">I had no idea Ramiris could make herself so useful!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">“Ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">Sure showed </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">you</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">I’ve got untold powers at my disposal, you know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">You just never noticed!”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">You didn’t, either, Ramiris</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">, I thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">But…man, Milim really has a keen nose for underground scheming like this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">You literally can’t hide anything from her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.4">She had two ex–demon lords in Carillon and Frey to deal with, but she still had the time and wherewithal to look into stuff all the way over here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.5">Logic just didn’t work with her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.6">She shouldn’t be able to get in here, but maybe it wasn’t unusual at all for Milim. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.7">Maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">We have had our dessert— How about we get back to work? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">You can enjoy this, too, Milim, if you stay out of the way.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">Veldora was being unusually mature and accommodating. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Come to think of it, a fight between him and Milim would be a </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">serious</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1"> problem. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">Milim was going easy on Ramiris, I could tell, but it’d be a different story with this dragon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">If </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">they</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1"> started to tangle, this whole labyrinth would fall apart. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">Good thing she was on Veldora’s good side for now.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">“No complaint there, Master,” Ramiris said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">She and Milim actually got along pretty well, in my eyes—that fight just now must’ve just been some friendly teasing.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“All right!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">exclaimed an excited Milim. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">“I won’t get in your way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.4">Gimme all the work you want!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">I figured I was safe in accepting that offer, but one concern remained—something I needed confirmation for.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-198"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“Well, I don’t mind if you join in, but—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“Great! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">This looks like so much fun! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">I wish you called for me back when you were planning it!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“Right, right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">But Milim, what about the people working under you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">Did you get permission from Carillon or Frey to come here?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">She was a free spirit, to be sure, but she was also a demon lord—one with two ex–demon lords in her stable and all of Clayman’s old land to rule on top of her own. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">Even with Carillon and Frey running things in her territory, she had to be a lot busier than before. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">Did she really have the time to go poking around my domain for fun?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">…Huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Me, you ask? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">Hey, I got talented people working under me, so I got time for projects like this, yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.4">I’d just get in their way if I bothered them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.5">Besides, I had a fully valid motive for this plan—a desire to attract more visitors to Tempest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.6">This wasn’t playtime for me, I promise.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">But who cares about me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">Milim was the issue right now, and my question had just caught her out.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">“Well…y’know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">I’m really smart and stuff, so… Not like I ran away from my place ’cause I don’t like studying or anything!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">…Aha. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Frey must’ve been researching the state of Milim’s domain and teaching her about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">That must’ve bored her so badly that she fled her own country.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">“Wait, no!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">she blurted out before I could even answer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">“Don’t say it! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.4">I’m staying here and helping you, and that’s </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">Sharp as a tack, that girl. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">I should really contact Carillon or Frey about this, but…ah, who cares? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.3">Not like they’ll get angry at </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">me</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">I’ll just pretend I didn’t know any better.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">But back to what she said earlier…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">“All right! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">That’s your mess to clean up, as far as I’m concerned. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">You’re the one who’s gonna get yelled at, not me,” I said to her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.4">“But what about those dragons you mentioned? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.5">You said you could bring them over and tame them? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.6">Is that really possible?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">“Huh?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">Y-you really think they’ll be angry at me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.3">Um… Eh, whatever. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.4">It’s not an adventure without a little danger, as they always say!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">She was acting like a child willing to do anything to avoid doing </span><a id="page-199"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">their homework. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">But that was the path she’d decided to take, and I suppose it was my job to watch over her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.3">She may’ve been conflicted over it, but she elected to goof off anyway.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">Basically, the difference between regular dragons and Veldora’s kind involved the difference between a material life-form and a spiritual one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">Regular dragons, as monsters, have a physical presence in the world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.3">They were called dragons since they resembled the ones of myth and legend, but in essence, they were closer to dinosaurs—big, mean lizards.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">There were only four </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">True</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1"> Dragons in the history of the world, three of which currently existed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">The Star-King Dragon Veldanava—Veldora’s older brother and Milim’s father—perished following certain unspecified events, and he hadn’t shown any signs </span><a id="page-200"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">of reviving ever since. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">Dragons had eternal life, so something </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">really</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1"> serious must’ve gone down with that guy…but that was outside the scope of this conversation.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">Veldanava was the origin of the monsters known as dragons—or to be exact, the Spirit Dragon that he gave Milim as a pet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">With what I heard from Elen before, I suppose this Spirit Dragon died and subsequently became a Chaos Dragon, and then the essence of its body spread far and wide. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">The remnants of this essence were still birthing Lesser Dragons to this day in areas with high magicule concentrations; if you had enough bits from the Spirit Dragon to work with, they could even create Arch Dragons.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">The most powerful among these Arch Dragons were called Dragon Lords, which came in four types depending on the element it was affiliated with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">These Dragon Lords, who boasted human-level wisdom, had spent several centuries as Arch Dragons before making the evolution, and with their strength, they could tap into some of the powers of the original Spirit Dragon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.3">With their extended life spans, Dragon Lords were a step closer to spiritual life-forms, although they couldn’t resurrect themselves from death the way Veldora and his ilk could.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">The Sky Dragon I defeated a while back was one of these Arch Dragons, classified as a Calamity-level threat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">A Dragon Lord would be even stronger than that, maybe up to a demon lord’s powers—about as strong as Clayman or a high-level spirit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.3">That level of magicule energy should be more than enough to wrangle the floor effects I wanted for this labyrinth of mine.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” Milim interjected. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">“I may be incredible, but not even </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">I</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1"> can tame a Dragon Lord!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">Getting an intelligent being like a Dragon Lord to cooperate with us would be pretty fruitless, now that she mentioned it. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Maybe we could get one to agree to the job if we asked them nicely, but it wasn’t</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1"> that </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">worth it to try</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">, I thought.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">“Guess not, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">So what’d you mean when you said you could catch one?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">“Well, there </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">are</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1"> some Arch Dragons with elemental attributes to ’em, even if they aren’t quite Dragon Lords. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">If we catch some and </span><a id="page-201"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">let them run free in this dungeon, they’ll eat up the magicules and change the landscape around them, I think.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">Dragons were in the habit of creating nests for themselves, so wherever they decided to set up shop, they’d transform the local environment for us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.3">We had tons of magicules for them to chow down on, so no issues there. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">Let’s go with Milim’s offer.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">Can you do that for me?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">“You got it! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">I’ll grab you one from each type, right on the cusp of becoming a Dragon Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">As she explained, dragons derived from that original Spirit Dragon came in just four types. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">At the top of the pyramid, you had your earth, water, fire, and wind Dragon Lords, with the element-infused dragons below them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.3">They also came in four types, known as Earth Dragons, Frost Dragons, Fire Dragons, and Wind Dragons, respectively. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.4">The Sky Dragon I tangled with was a rarer case, a would-be evolution into a Wind Dragon that missed the mark for some reason. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.5">There was no sky type to these guys, unlike with elemental spirits, although there </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">were</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1"> other variations and special types—little things that occasionally made the resulting dragon unique, kind of like with humans.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">This sounded like the perfect engine for giving our labyrinth some nature-based spice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">Let’s put those dragons in the deeper floors once Milim picks them up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.3">These element-infused dragons, by the way, were stronger than offshoots like the Sky Dragon, maybe a Special A in terms of ranking—not a match for Charybdis, but still packing a big punch. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.4">I hadn’t really thought about it, but I supposed one of those rarer offshoots would be a good, even match for six paladins. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.5">Upgrade that to an element-infused one, and you’d need a whole Crusader platoon to stand a chance, apparently… But hey, this is my dungeon, and </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">I</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1"> get to decide what goes in there.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">With spirits, the five elemental attributes work like this: Earth is strong against sky, sky against wind, wind against water, water against fire, and fire against earth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">This, however, didn’t apply to dragons. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.3">Battle experience was more important than elemental attributes—in essence, older dragons were stronger than younger ones.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-202"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">As a result, I decided to order the elemental floors like so:</span></p>

<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">These four element-themed floors would serve as the last challenge before the final boss, Veldora himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">It was perfect. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.3">I saw absolutely no way anyone could beat it.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">All three seemed to like the concept. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">Good to see—but we still needed to get those dragons worked out for it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.3">Flattering Milim ought to ensure she’ll get the job done.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">Oh, right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">Clayman’s greatest masterpiece, or whatever it was? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.3">Viola, I think was the name. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.4">Beretta stripped all the weapons from it, and he meant to present them to me, but I turned them down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.5">He wanted to pay me off with that stuff so they could move here, after all, and I wasn’t up for that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">“Weren’t you going to offer that stuff to Ramiris?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">“Ha-ha!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.2">Ramiris said, butting in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.3">“There’s no way I could use it right, and I don’t really care about it anyway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.4">I think it’s a pretty fancy piece of weaponry, but that’s about it—not much else you can do with it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.5">So I talked to Beretta to see if we could make better use of it!”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-204"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">“Are you sure about this? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">Because it’d be worth a lot if you sold it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">“It’s fine, it’s fine! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.2">All part of my job! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.3">And I’m gonna make a ton of money before long, so why quibble over the little stuff? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.4">Besides, we finally have somewhere to live!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">So the weapon and armor were mine—and thus, I decided to put them to work for me.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">It was time to put the treasure chests in place and see how the labyrinth was shaping up.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">From Floor 1 on down, we checked our work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">That topmost floor was kind of a demo of things to come. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.3">I made it so even beginners could proceed without too much hassle; the chamber and its hallways were broad, wide, and hard to get lost in.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">Still, eight hundred feet to a side was big. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">I worried that people would spend all afternoon mapping out every nook and cranny, only to be rewarded with nothing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.3">That might cause people to start dissing the maze, but with all the weak monsters prowling around, I figured there’d be enough excitement for everyone—the magic crystals and other useful stuff they dropped would make it worth novice adventurers’ time.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">I intended to buy this loot from those adventurers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">There wasn’t a Free Guild post in Tempest, so the nearest one would be Blumund’s. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.3">Going all the way there could be a tall order for some people, so I thought we could function as a pseudo-Guild, accepting their loot for discount prices and pocketing the difference to cover expenses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.4">Or could I talk with Yuuki about building an official Guild post here? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.5">Maybe, but until that came up, we’d kind of function as them with this labyrinth.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">This was the basic scheme of things up to Floor 5; the mazes gradually got trickier, but otherwise, no difference. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.2">Floor 6, though, is where things got tough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.3">The traps would make their debut here, although nothing truly vicious up to Floor 9, so nobody would die from them (probably). </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.4">A seasoned adventurer would cruise past them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.5">If I made things too hard too fast, it’d discourage repeat traffic, and that was out of the question. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.6">I wanted to be kind with the first nine floors’ design.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-205"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">That all changed with Floor 10. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.2">Here, I placed a single monster who was, shall we say, kind of strong. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.3">In other words, this was a boss room. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.4">Defeat it, and a door would open to the floors below.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">“What kind of monster did you go with, Rimuru?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">asked Ramiris.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">“I’ll decide on that once I see how these guys are spawning, but… We haven’t seen </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">any</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1"> so far, have we?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">No, we had yet to encounter a single monster, all the way down to Floor 10. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">Veldora released his aura a week and a half ago, but it still hadn’t resulted in any baddies.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">Understood. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.2">Even with his aura hidden, monsters can still detect the presence of the subject Veldora. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.3">Few would want to approach him.</span></em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">Oh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.2">I see.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">“I guess monsters born from the magicules you released can pick up on his presence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">They’re too scared to go near him.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">“What?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">So </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">that’s</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1"> why!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.2">said Veldora, convinced. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.3">“No wonder I never saw many in my presence inside the cave I was sealed in.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">I think it’s more like the weaker monsters literally couldn’t take the heat from him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">But regardless:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">“Well, I’ll figure something out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.2">One way or another, I want just a </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">kinda</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1"> strong monster in here, ranked B or thereabouts.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">“Hmm… All right,” said Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.2">“I don’t want any unintelligent beings among my lackeys, but if you find the right monster, bring it in here and put this collar on it!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">I accepted the collar, which apparently let the wearer be resurrected even if they hadn’t forged a formal pact with Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.2">That helped a lot. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.3">It meant I didn’t have to find a replacement every time someone killed the guy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">“Wow, convenient. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.2">That’ll save us a lot of trouble.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">“Right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.2">Remember, in this labyrinth, what I say goes!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">It probably did, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.2">Her skill let her change the effects of pretty much any item in here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.3">I realized once again how much of a pity it was that I couldn’t learn it for myself.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-206"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">That took care of the boss issue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.2">The boss room formed the entirety of Floor 10, making it perfectly safe after the battle was over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.3">Beyond the room lay a save point and a simple stairway down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.4">And let’s not forget about the treasure chest! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.5">The one in the boss room had no trap installed, but I did carefully adjust the rates at which you’d find certain weapons or armor inside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.6">In subsequent floors, however, there’d be both hidden chambers and chest traps.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">Mimics would debut in Floor 20 and below—pretty diabolical, but that’s the thrill of a labyrinth like this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">Being able to experience something like this in real life was something I thought I deserved praise for.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">But it wasn’t all threatening stuff. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.2">With abundant magicules all over the labyrinth, the swords and lances found inside could start to get a bit magical themselves. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">Getting your hands on stuff like</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1"> that </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">was worth risking your neck a little</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">, I thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.2">With a Resurrection Bracelet, nobody was going to die, so I figured revving up the difficulty would make it more fun and exciting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.3">I couldn’t wait to see how the adventurers would react to all this.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">Finally, we wrapped up our inspection of the first ten floors. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.2">“Well, now what? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.3">Should we set up someplace on this floor where you can sell the stuff you found or put it in storage for safekeeping?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">“Oh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.2">Do we really need that? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.3">Because then we wouldn’t be able to sell any return whistles.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">Ah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.2">Right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.3">Ramiris actually had a great point. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.4">She was always sharp with issues related to money, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">“True. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.2">Not much point putting ones up in floors with save points. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.3">How about safe zones starting in the middle dungeons, say one every five levels?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">“Oooh, that could work!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">We could offer storage for items found, sell healing potions at marked-up prices, and offer some simple fare to eat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.2">The labyrinth could have doors at regular levels that connected to a single zone, so we wouldn’t need to construct separate zones all across the maze. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.3">It wouldn’t be that much work to implement. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.4">Would more people opt to go outside when they needed a break, though? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.5">It’d depend, </span><a id="page-207"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">I suppose. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">Return whistles were meant as insurance, after all, so maybe we could price them on the higher side. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.3">I decided to reconsider that once this labyrinth made its debut.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">There were still a lot of ideas left to implement, but for now, this was fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.2">I flashed an evil grin at the others, sharing a nod with them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.3">We had our labyrinth all prepped and ready.</span></p>
