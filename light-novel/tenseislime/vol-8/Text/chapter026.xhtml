<p>Diablo and Hakuro, by the way, still weren’t back from Farmus. According to Gobta, Ranga, and Gabil (who came home before them), they said they’d wrap everything up before the Founder’s Festival. Apparently, they were pretty disappointed that they couldn’t see me make my royal debut like this—but they had Yohm’s own coronation to handle over there. With it, Farmus would be reborn as a new country, and I’m sure they had a million things to do, so I couldn’t blame them for missing out. Even Diablo was showing up here only on rare occasions, and Hakuro didn’t have access to Spatial Motion, so I hadn’t seen him at all lately. I’d definitely need to thank them once they’re back.</p>
<p>I wasn’t the only one suffering right now. It was all so tremendously embarrassing, but I resolved to put up with it and get this stupid, exaggerated, bombastic presentation ceremony over with.</p>
<p>What was funny was how each of the monster races reacted to me. I had nothing to do, so I sat there like the conversation piece I was and looked down at the assorted monsters giving speeches.</p>
<p>Generally, the monster reactions were divided into three camps—worship, observation, or fear. On the observation side were a few people who openly looked down on me. The new guys from the other side of the Great Ameld River were particularly notable on this front. But it was no big problem. Show off some of my strength, and I’m sure they’ll acquiesce to me.</p>
<p>The monsters who feared me, however, were the real issue…</p>
<p class="space-break1">Here, for example, was a contingent of rabbitfolk in front of me right now, a race of demi-humans who were honestly pretty cute—human, basically, but with long, pointy rabbitlike ears. Unlike lycanthropes, they were degraded beastmen, unable to transform and possessing the same amount of strength as an average human. The equipment they had on didn’t look too sturdy, either, but they were all gifted in the Detect Danger skill, which I’m sure was a must to survive in the Forest of Jura. My own cutesy exterior must not have fooled them at all.</p>
<p><a id="page-230"></a>“Um, tha-thank you for i-inviting us here today…”</p>
<p>Dealing with someone who was petrified of you was kind of tough. Some of the rabbitfolk were visibly quaking, so we had to calm them down before they could begin.</p>
<p>“Very well,” echoed Rigurd’s voice. “You are hereby granted an audience with our ruler, the great demon lord Rimuru. Lift your head up!”</p>
<p>The rabbitfolk leader didn’t move. Or maybe he couldn’t. This darling little slime was simply too much of a threatening presence to look in the eye—not that I had eyes. But that wasn’t the issue. I didn’t <em>want</em> to oversee a reign of terror with these guys; I wanted a frank and open relationship…but to races like this, a demon lord who <em>looked</em> wimpy on the outside was nothing short of horrifying. Too much of a gap, I suppose. We had worked hard with guys like these, earning their support for our transportation and logistical efforts all over the forest. Maybe it wasn’t possible from the outset, but I really wished I could interact normally with them sometime.</p>
<p>The halflings and kobolds were like this when I first launched the federation, although the kobolds started trusting us once we agreed to let them continue their merchant trade. Koby, their representative, and I were old war buddies by now, constantly sharing potential business leads with each other.</p>
<p>These rabbitfolk were equals to me, and so was every other weaker race in the forest. I’d just have to stick to my guns and try to explain that I didn’t value my citizenry strictly on their ability to fight. Maybe they wouldn’t believe me at first, but we could work it out. So I sat, looking at the twitching ears of the rabbitfolk kowtowing to me.</p>
<p>“There is nothing to fear. Sir Rimuru is a fair, generous leader, one who says he will treat everyone in his domain as equal. Please, feel free to share a few words with him,” intoned Rigurd.</p>
<p>The representative finally held his head up. He was young and fairly handsome, but there were deep rings under his eyes. Out of overwork or nervousness?</p>
<p>“O—O great demon lord Rimuru, please accept the sincere loyalty of the rabbitfolk…”</p>
<p><a id="page-231"></a>I gave him a firm nod. It seemed to relieve the guy. I could practically see a literal weight lift from his shoulders.</p>
<p>“See?” Rigurd beamed. “I told you. There is no need to be nervous!”</p>
<p>“Ha…ha-ha…! Um, I’ve actually brought my daughter along, but she got so restless once we entered town, I’m afraid I’ve lost sight of her…”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! Yes, the whole town’s in a festival frenzy right now. I can imagine a young girl would let her curiosity get the best of her!”</p>
<p>“Ah, this is so embarrassing… I let her out of my sight for a single moment, and she runs away to who knows where. I had wanted to leave her behind in the village, lest she offend Lord Rimuru, but she insisted…”</p>
<p>This leader must’ve been panicking about his daughter causing some kind of ruckus in town. So all those nerves weren’t just from being in awe of me? That’s good to know. I didn’t want the weaker races any more scared of me than they already were. But a young rabbitfolk girl, huh…? A pretty lass with rabbit ears <em>would</em> be a sight to see, I bet. Hopefully I’d get a chance.</p>
<p>As I thought over it, I began speaking a bit more honestly than I perhaps should have.</p>
<p>“If she’s that curious, then she must be taking in all the trends and different things around here, isn’t she? I bet she’ll make a wonderfully reliable successor to you.”</p>
<p>The direct compliment from me visibly moved the leader.</p>
<p>“Such…such kind words, my lord! If I have the chance, I would be delighted to introduce my daughter Framea to you.”</p>
<p>He bowed to me. It seemed like we had broken the ice a little. Rigurd then briefed him on political matters a bit, and they agreed on the spot that the rabbitfolk were officially part of my domain. He bowed several times again before finally leaving the altar. <em>Hopefully</em>, I thought as the next visitor was brought to me, <em>this’ll show people that I’m not such a scary guy</em>.</p>
<p class="space-break1">This visitor kneeled before me, turning an eye toward the other monsters seeking an audience. I knew this guy—it was Abil, Gabil’s <a id="page-232"></a>father and chief of the lizardmen. Seeing him reminded me of the good old days—or it would have, if he didn’t look virtually like another person by now. He had transformed into a square-jawed warrior in the prime of his life. Giving him a name must’ve evolved him to this point—to a dragonewt, one far closer to humanoid than before. Gabil sure didn’t change that much, but Soka had gone almost entirely human, so maybe it depended on what the individual wanted.</p>
<p>“It has been far too long since we last spoke, Sir Rimuru. It pleases me greatly that you have risen to demon lord, er, the status of demon lord, and all of us er, are…”</p>
<p>Abil was acting oddly stiff. He was probably more on the “worship” side of matters. Gabil himself said demon lords weren’t <em>that</em> worth freaking out about. He already should’ve known what I was like, so why all the nerves?</p>
<p>I tried to be informal with my response. “Hey, Chief. Good to see you again. No need for the formalities here. We’re all part of the same federation, right? Keep up the good work.”</p>
<p>Benimaru snickered, and Shuna sighed at me, but I didn’t care.</p>
<p>“It is not that simple, Sir Rimuru. As a demon lord, you have grown into something extraordinary. You are not only our lord, but the de facto ruler of the entire Forest of Jura…”</p>
<p>As always, Abil was too serious for his own good. But that’s what I liked about him.</p>
<p>“All right, all right. There aren’t any other races in this chamber we’re in right now. You don’t have to be all nervous. Your son, Gabil, is working hard under my leadership. He’s become a full-fledged part of my administration. I couldn’t have done this without him.”</p>
<p>I decided to name-drop Gabil to ease the tension a bit, reminding Abil of his son and indirectly hinting that he ought to let him back into the family already.</p>
<p>“Ah, there is no fazing you, Sir Rimuru. So that no-good son of mine has been of service to you? He’s such an incorrigible fool, so…”</p>
<p>He must’ve noticed my intentions. The fact of the matter was, Gabil had still been kicked out of Abil’s family, so he must’ve thought it improper to ask how his son was doing without some <a id="page-233"></a>kind of prompting. Now that I brought him up, that wasn’t an issue. I could already see his usual bold attitude coming back.</p>
<p>“Incorrigible? Hardly! I’m having him lead our research and development department, and he’s doing an excellent job for me. Aren’t you, Gabil?”</p>
<p>“Wha? Ah—<em>yes</em> !!”</p>
<p>Gabil, meanwhile, was frozen solid through all this, blushing all the way back to his ears, and when he was suddenly expected to join the conversation, his voice cracked.</p>
<p>“That stupid kid of mine…”</p>
<p>As Gabil continued to work himself into a panic, I unleashed just a little bit of Lord’s Ambition. That was enough to turn everyone’s attention back to me.</p>
<p>“Abil, chief of the lizardmen… Though I may be demon lord, I request your continued support as a member of my federation.”</p>
<p>“It shall be done! By the name you’ve given me, I will never forget my allegiance to you!”</p>
<p>He bowed down, head nodding deeply at me. He was the classic noble warrior, and he looked the part, even in this strictly formal setting. I nodded back, then glanced at the still-panicking Gabil.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p><em>He can be so dense sometimes. I guess he didn’t see what that glance meant.</em> I’m sure it wasn’t because I was in slime mode and didn’t have eyes, either.</p>
<p>Rigur, exasperated, jogged over to Gabil and whispered in his ear. “Sir Rimuru would like you and your father to speak to each other privately. If he doesn’t let you back into the family now, you won’t have another chance for quite some time to come, you realize? And having an estranged son accomplishing so many great things puts Sir Abil in a delicate position, too, no doubt…”</p>
<p><em>Nice one, Rigur. Way to perfectly understand what I meant, unlike Gabil here.</em></p>
<p>The step-by-step explanation finally shook the fog out of Gabil’s brain. He saluted me, still a little flustered, and accompanied Abil out of the chamber.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Next up were the assorted high orc tribal chiefs, each with a little entourage along for the ride. They must’ve trusted me enough to not bring guards in; the entourages were composed of children and grandchildren. With their food situation much improved, life had plainly gotten a lot easier for them. They were fathering children now, and these children were themselves high orcs, which surprised and elated them so much that they wanted to show them off to me.</p>
<p>Well, why <em>wouldn’t</em> they be high orcs? Apparently, that wasn’t as much of a given as I thought. Normally, they’d just be regular orcs; the mutation into high orc was seen as a one-and-done kind of thing, generation-wise. With birth rates going down among them, they’d be able to devote more time and effort into raising each one, I imagined. I wanted to be sure of that, so they’d become the next generation of manpower for us. Children really <em>are</em> treasures, thinking of it that way—a fact that remains true no matter what world, or species, you’re talking about.</p>
<p>I was a little concerned about how their names were being passed on, but apparently it was going well. I had given those names almost at random, but I guess they all sounded natural enough to them, so…great? It’s all about getting used to it, I suppose. Call someone anything long enough, and it’s bound to stick. They didn’t really <em>need</em> names anyway, so maybe I was over-worrying it.</p>
<p>Fully reassured, I saw off the high orcs and their entourage.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Next came the final group of the day—the treants, the other major players in the Forest of Jura Alliance after the lizardmen and the high orcs. Actually, the only individuals who made an appearance were the dryads Traya and Doreth, Treyni’s younger sisters. But hey, treants can’t move anyway. No helping that. Besides, the dryads acted as the treants’ representatives, so no issues there.</p>
<p>I had been visiting the treant colony on regular occasions; Zegion and Apito had been keeping it well protected, and we were receiving regular shipments of high-quality honey from them. Thus, the atmosphere at this audience was pretty casual.</p>
<p><a id="page-235"></a>“Charmed to see you again, Sir Rimuru. Congratulations on being appointed a demon lord.”</p>
<p>“We hope you will continue to provide us with your benevolent protection.”</p>
<p>They both smiled at me without hesitation. That saved me a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>So we filled each other in on recent happenings. For now, nothing was particularly amiss. The only real concern to report was the thinning out of magicules around the Forest of Jura, which made transport a tad inconvenient.</p>
<p>They both looked exactly like Treyni, and I could feel vast amounts of magical force in them, but apparently they were still affected by the lower magic concentrations around them. In fact, Doreth <em>did</em> look a little thinned out to me.</p>
<p>“Hmm… I didn’t think that far. That’s probably the magic barriers along the highways doing their work. Better think of something for that…”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, it’s not that serious a problem.”</p>
<p>“We sisters use magicules to form the magical bodies you see before you, and they are merely more susceptible to the barriers, is all.”</p>
<p>“But outside of that, Sir Rimuru…”</p>
<p>“We have important matters to discuss!!”</p>
<p>They didn’t see it as important. Very few creatures around Jura would be affected by magicule concentrations like that, dryads and treants among them. Thus, since they were the last people I was seeing today, I offered to continue our talk in a private room that night.</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The moment I entered the room, the two spoke in unison.</p>
<p>“So what we wanted to talk to you about…”</p>
<p>“We wish to serve the beautiful fairy queen just as our great elder sister does.”</p>
<p>You know, now that I think about it, I don’t like that “fairy queen” <a id="page-236"></a>name. It was overblown, way too fancy for such a teensy little thing. And <em>beautiful</em>? I recalled a smiling Ramiris in my mind. No way. Not beautiful. We were picturing totally different things, I was pretty sure about that. If Ramiris was beautiful, you could describe Shizu, the base for my own looks, as a goddess. I’m used to it now, but even I was a bit taken by my own appearance in the past.</p>
<p>Benimaru and Shion, who joined me in here, seemed to agree with me—but Traya and Doreth paid them no mind.</p>
<p>“This is not just our opinion, but that of all the treants.”</p>
<p>“And we hear that, in this very town…”</p>
<p>“…Lady Ramiris has built her residence.”</p>
<p>“If so, we can only hope to be of some service to her…”</p>
<p>In their uniquely sequential manner of speaking, they begged me to let them serve Ramiris. If they had already requested a different master, that’d make it hard to ask them to serve me, I suppose. Besides, Treyni, their big sister, was already Ramiris’s. I had no real reason to be opposed.</p>
<p>“Um, you wanna ask her?”</p>
<p>“…What?!”</p>
<p>“Is that all right?”</p>
<p>The reaction was swift and forceful.</p>
<p>So off we went to Ramiris’s place, where we found Beretta silently working and Treyni falling over herself to cater to the fairy’s whims. Man, Beretta must have it pretty tough.</p>
<p>But as I thought that:</p>
<p>“Ahhh, Lady Ramiris, you are so ravishing…”</p>
<p>“As beautiful as always—and so elegant! The perfect master for us to serve!”</p>
<p>Just as before, Traya and Doreth were crying their eyes out over her.</p>
<p>Treyni just nodded in response. I wasn’t sure who they were talking about at this point. “Elegant” was one of the last words I’d ever use to describe her.</p>
<p>“Did you hear that?” Ramiris huffed, tossing her head. “Hey—hey, did you hear that? Better not look down on me any longer, you hear?”</p>
<p><a id="page-237"></a>Man, shut <em>up</em>. Now she was flying around the room, lording it over us as best she could with her size. Ah well. Everybody likes a compliment. But judging by this, the answer to the dryads’ question seemed pretty clear.</p>
<p>“Well, Ramiris? I think all the treants want to serve you, too, not just these two.”</p>
<p>“Huh? But…”</p>
<p>Ramiris gave me a hesitant look. I suppose she still felt like a freeloader in my city. So I threw her a life preserver.</p>
<p>“How about we have them move into your labyrinth? We moved the beastmen’s camp without breaking a sweat, so could it be much harder to move the treant colony?”</p>
<p>Or did the distance involved create an issue? I felt like she said she could build a corridor into the maze from anywhere she wanted…</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” She beamed, nodding at me. “In that case, I’ll head out as soon as tomorrow! Expanding this labyrinth was a snap when I borrowed some power from my master, and I feel like <em>I’ve</em> gained some power, too. It’d be kind of fun to make some of the empty floors into a jungle section!”</p>
<p>That part about borrowing power from Veldora concerned me a little, but whatever.</p>
<p>“But as creatures who live in the Forest of Jura, shouldn’t they be placed under Sir Rimuru’s rule?” Treyni pointed out.</p>
<p>She must have been worried about that. But there was eager anticipation written all over her face. Clearly she would love to live with her sisters—and like I’ve said before, I had no reason to deny them. Ramiris <em>did</em> rule the labyrinth, a unique space with her living quarters and a zone left to my management. For the parts under her control, perhaps I should recognize them as extraterritorial from Tempest.</p>
<p>I explained this to them, showing how I wouldn’t question their moving here. Her rule over the labyrinth was unstoppable, and besides, it’d be nice for them to be reunited with their original master.</p>
<p>“We, the treants and dryads, wish to reposition ourselves under the blessed protection of Lady Ramiris.”</p>
<p><a id="page-238"></a>“We know it is selfish of us, but would we be able to receive permission for this?”</p>
<p>They’d have it, of course.</p>
<p>The treant colony would be placed on Floor 95, the level on which the beastmen camp was located. It was the largest floor in land area, a circle with a radius a bit over three miles, so we had space to work with. I was intending to build the rest stop on that floor, too, so this worked out well for that, too. People talk about how refreshing a walk in the woods is, and I didn’t want our resting post to be this depressing, clinical thing.</p>
<p>Moving day went pretty fast. It was more of a moving <em>moment</em>, really. Ramiris just opened a door to the labyrinth at the treants’ location, then moved them right inside. The actual process took a few hours, but all it took was opening a door next to each treant, so it was pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Now Ramiris had an even greater domain to rule over, and I had a more stable labyrinth to work with. Managing the magicules was much easier now, to say nothing of the air conditioning, and the treants couldn’t have asked for anything more. Thanks to the high levels of magic concentration in the air, they were all brimming with energy.</p>
<p>None of the beastmen living in their temporary quarters had any complaints, either. Treants are generally pretty chill, usually asleep and looking like plain old trees—and besides, the beastmen would be going back to the Beast Kingdom sooner or later, so they didn’t mind having some neighbors for the time being. If anything, they welcomed them, since it made the whole floor more comfortable to live in.</p>
<p>They had also extracted a promise from the dryads to help maintain the labyrinth—or really, the dryads volunteered to help. “We’ve had a paradise made for us, so that much would be simple,” Treyni said. Her sisters, and the other dryads, all nodded their agreement.</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>With that, we had a small forest village in the labyrinth, along with some very unexpected helpers.</p>
<p><a id="page-239"></a>Floor 95, being a multiple of five, was a safe zone. Since we had a bunch of extra floors anyway, I decided to use Floors 91 through 94 as a storage site, a greenhouse for gardens, and a processing facility. To be more specific, Floor 91 would contain storage for metal ore; Floor 92, a plant for producing magisteel; Floor 93, a garden; and Floor 94, another facility for producing honey. There was also free passage all the way to Floor 95, which made movement easy, and the save point in the center of 95 included doors back to other floors above and a single, foreboding stairway going down.</p>
<p>This was a pretty convenient setup, one that cheerfully ignored all the laws of physics but still seemed to work just fine.</p>
<p>By the way, defeating the boss at Floor 90 granted you access to stairs down to Floor 95—if you somehow made it <em>this</em> far, I was happy to give you a bit of a shortcut. Your final, hellish challenge would begin on Floor 96, and before journeying onward, you’d naturally want to rest up and inspect all your equipment. I made sure to put up a door before the stairway down, along with a notice explaining the dangers below, and I also planned to provide an inn and weapon/armor shop near the door.</p>
<p>This inn would be connected to the other safe zones in the labyrinth. The doors were all connected, which helped with this setup a lot. The shop, meanwhile, could offer valuable equipment not available anywhere else, all lined up in front for sale. We were unlikely to see much in the way of customers, so I imagined the shop would be more of a hobby of mine than anything else.</p>
<p>I fantasized about putting some of my own creations in the shop down there as I decided to discuss my idea with Mjöllmile.</p>
<p>So after talking to monster species all day in the audience room, I spent much of the evening helping Ramiris and her new subjects with their move.</p>
<p class="space-break1">This new floor we built would eventually blossom into a forested city of its own. We called it Labyrinth City—a final oasis for those who made it through the Dungeon, a fantastic town that granted visitors more power than they ever thought possible…</p>
<p>…but at that time, I hadn’t imagined that far down the line yet.</p>

<p class="tx1">My itinerary for the following day involved meeting with the relatively stronger species, including the biggest factions in my recently conquered territory. <em>Guess most of ’em will be in the “observing” camp again</em>, I thought, only to notice a commotion in front of my audience chamber.</p>
<p>A couple of different factions were having a verbal argument. Shuna was staring at them, scowling, while Shion’s eyes were flashing with barely repressed rage. Hoo boy. Hopefully this all works out…</p>
<p>These were the bovoids and equinoids. They had each brought along about a dozen warriors, currently attempting to intimidate one another. It turns out they didn’t get along too well—in fact, they had been at war for over a century. They were fighting to see who would get an audience with me first. I guess they thought being granted my protection ahead of their rival would give them a leg up, but I really didn’t want to get involved. It was all just an annoyance to me.</p>
<p>The two races stood by the door, keeping each other at bay. The situation looked ready to devolve into physical combat at any moment—and given their positions high up the Forest of Jura food chain, they were both intimidating presences.</p>
<p>A magic-born with bullhorns spoke to me first. “Ah, the demon lord! If you want a stout ally in battle, turn to us first! Let the bovoids join your side, and you’ll get to strut around the forest with <em>authority</em>! And once we wipe out those wimpy equinoids once and for all, you won’t find any race in the forest to defy us!”</p>
<p>He certainly was bold, making this proclamation to me without a hint of fear, and he had the strength to back it up. He had more magical energy to him than the ogres and lizardmen I first ran into, that’s for sure. Conservatively, I’d say there were a few A rankers in the group. You’d need that kind of force to wage a hundred-year war, and in terms of pure fighting ability, they may have been the best the Forest of Jura had to offer.</p>
<p>But before I could answer, one of the equinoids erupted in anger. <a id="page-241"></a>“Hmph! Fool! Any demon lord would have the perception to see that pairing with the equinoids is clearly the decision to make. We’ll destroy any race who dares to claim otherwise, from those bovoids on down!”</p>
<p>Pretty harsh words. These guys sure were hotheaded…and exhausting. At least the rabbitfolk were smart enough not to be fooled by my slime exterior.</p>
<p>But…hold on. Yes, they <em>were</em> exhausting, but the moment I laid eyes upon them, I came up with an idea. What labyrinth was complete, after all, without a minotaur or two?</p>
<p>Those creatures were celebrated in Greek mythology, hailed as the stuff of legend—but in the early twentieth century, when people discovered the ancient temple of Knossos in Crete, they found a complex maze of passages, along with an underground section that suggested the labyrinth really existed. Maybe there wasn’t a bullheaded maze guardian inside, but there were many bull-themed frescoes and such inside. Even back then, labyrinths and minotaurs went hand in hand with each other.</p>
<p>And…I had to say, the bovoids before me appeared <em>exactly</em> how you’d expect a minotaur to look in real life. Their leader, a measure larger than the others, practically oozed with evil energy. Our labyrinth was a little sparse when it came to bosses. I only had creatures selected for Floors 10, 20, and 30—but this leader guy, I thought, had what it took to occupy Floor 40 or 50. I wanted him, no matter what. I just couldn’t fight the feeling.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these monsters didn’t seem like they’d be too loyal to me. They probably just thought of me as a nice patron, or employer, to have. It was clear they wanted to leverage this relationship so they could annihilate their current foes. If I was honest with myself, that was the only conclusion to make.</p>
<p>So I busted out just a little Lord’s Ambition on them. If they saw how awesome I was, maybe they’d get in line and— Whoa. They didn’t seem to notice at all. I was right in front of them, and they’re still glaring and yelling at each other. Should I take more drastic measures and “tame” them down?</p>
<p>But as I weighed my options, a clearly miffed Rigurd stepped <a id="page-242"></a>forward. “How <em>dare</em> you show such rudeness before our lord! I see that I, Rigurd, need to show all of you your place!”</p>
<p>He was normally quite gentle, doggedly pursuing administrative tasks around town, but I knew Rigurd had secretly been working out. He was stronger than the younger guys, at least, like Gobta and Rigur—and given his performance against the paladins when they attacked, he definitely had something of a warrior inside him. The way I saw it, he was stronger than the leaders of both factions here.</p>
<p>“What? Look at this bureaucrat who thinks he’s the lord of all things!”</p>
<p>“We don’t need some demon lord flunky to bad-mouth <em>us</em>!”</p>
<p>The leaders quickly barked back, while their younger hangers-on bleated their agreement.</p>
<p>I’ve had people look down on me before, but I don’t think I’ve ever been treated <em>this</em> badly. Just a little Lord’s Ambition was enough to humble everybody before these guys. They were just so worked up, oblivious to what was going on around them. I thought being dissed was better than being feared, but if it gets <em>this</em> bad, I might have to reconsider.</p>
<p>Still, a little lesson ought to help them see the light. Rigurd looked at me. I nodded, just about ready to give permission, when:</p>
<p>“Wha?!”</p>
<p>“…What on…?”</p>
<p>“…Oh dear, some trouble?”</p>
<p>“Hmph. Not a problem.”</p>
<p>We felt a tremendous wave of pressure from outside town. Someone had broken through Shuna’s barrier around it, and soon we felt the massive aura and vast magical energy of a monster— No, likely a magic-born. Judging by this act, we doubted this guy was here to make any friends. The bovoids and equinoids might not have noticed my Lord’s Ambition, but they sure noticed <em>this</em>, judging by their panicked gasps.</p>
<p>“Such power…”</p>
<p>“Wh-whoa, Demon Lord, are you getting attacked by another of your kind?”</p>
<p>Up until now, the Forest of Jura had been protected by a pact <a id="page-243"></a>between the demon lords. These guys here talked a big game, but they were in way over their heads. Against a <em>real</em> threat, they had to face up and admit how powerless they really were.</p>
<p>I no longer had time to deal with them. I hated to throw out the idea of having them serve as bosses—it just felt so epic to me—but there were other things to do. Instantly, I transformed into my human form and shouted “Let’s go!” to Benimaru and the rest.</p>
<p>“Yes sir!”</p>
<p>“As you say.”</p>
<p>I ran toward the source of the disturbance.</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Upon reaching the site, I saw ten or so members of Team Kurenai surrounding three men. Several security guards, gatekeepers, and Team Reborn troops were on the ground.</p>
<p>…Oops, I saw Gobzo among them. I was sure he gave them a fight, but it was crazy to even fight them at all. Meanwhile, the survivors were busy directing the townspeople and visitors to evacuation sites. They were acting just as they’d been trained to, which was nice. Things weren’t too chaotic yet, but I hated to see casualties this early on.</p>
<p>I turned to the three men behind this. One was tall, well-formed, and wore an earring. The second was enormous, a virtual slab of meat, and sported a nose ring. The third was smaller, but his frame going beyond merely “large” and venturing into “heavy” territory, and he had a lip piercing. They sported colorful hair in strange styles, which only added to their stereotypical street-punk look.</p>
<p>“You realize you’ve perpetrated this violence in the domain of the demon lord Rimuru?!” shouted Shion, who had been following behind me.</p>
<p>The earring guy stepped up, grinning fiendishly. “Outta the way. I’m not here to deal with minions. We wanted to rub out Clayman and seize his demon lord spot, but you got in our way, and we’re pissed off about it. I ain’t here to kill for fun, but mess with us, and we ain’t gonna go easy, all right?”</p>
<p>He was being rude and intimidating, but looking around me, I <a id="page-244"></a>realized nobody was dead. Judging by the difference in magic force, if they hadn’t been going easy, even Team Reborn would’ve been wiped out. He must’ve been telling the truth, kind of.</p>
<p>Maybe they weren’t as bad as they looked—but if they wanted a fight, they’d get one. We were in the middle of my public unveiling as a demon lord. The Founder’s Festival was just around the corner, and we had merchants from all the world over going in and out. It’d be tough to let an incursion like this go without comment.</p>
<p>It was annoying, but so be it. I’ll just have to take them on—</p>
<p>“Wait, Sir Rimuru. Let me handle this.”</p>
<p>Shion stopped me from stepping forward. Benimaru was trying to step up, too, but I guess they had looked at each other and silently decided which would go first. The casualties among Shion’s forces were the likely decider.</p>
<p>“Oh, you one of the demon lord Rimuru’s aides? Dad told me about you—the ogre woman who whipped Clayman’s ass? I like it. Let’s warm up with you first—”</p>
<p>“Wait, Big Bro. Can we take her? You can have the demon lord.”</p>
<p>“Fwehhhh-heh-heh! Yes, yes! I’m getting hungry, you know. I could use a girl or two right now!”</p>
<p>Sounded like they were all brothers. The earring guy must’ve been the eldest, and their dad told them about not just me, but Shion and Clayman’s battle. Their father must’ve been either a demon lord or a close associate, but judging by their energy levels—each equivalent to a pre-awakened Clayman—I assumed the former.</p>
<p>But who? I immediately crossed Guy, Milim, Ramiris, and Luminus off the list. That left Daggrull, Deeno, or Leon…but the last two seemed pretty unlikely. Was Daggrull my prime suspect?</p>
<p>Shion, meanwhile, took a step forward. “Silence. Sir Rimuru is busy with his audiences right now. To save on time, I will handle all three of you at once.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Whoa, are you picking on us?”</p>
<p>“I wanted to go easy on a girl, but forget it. I’m gonna make you cry, I swear.”</p>
<p><a id="page-245"></a>“Fweh-heh-heh, that sass is like a punch in the gut. I bet you’re gonna make me feel the fullest I’ve been in a while!”</p>
<p>I groaned. Taking on three foes more powerful than you at the same time was insanely reckless, even by Shion’s standards. I tried to stop her, but this trio was already far too worked up to call time-out. Why does Shion always get so freaked out like this…?</p>
<p>“B-Benimaru?”</p>
<p>“Just let Shion do what she wants. If we’re going easy on them, Shion is more suited to that than I am.”</p>
<p><em>…</em></p>
<p>His casual response stunned me into silence. Guess I’d just have to give up. I decided to believe she’d win and just let her have her fun.</p>
<p class="space-break1">That said, I didn’t want my town wrecked. I suggested that we all move elsewhere, and surprisingly, the trio agreed to it and followed me, curiously checking out their surroundings as I led them into our freshly built battle arena.</p>
<p>“Whoa, lady,” earring guy said. “You got guts, I’ll admit that, but if you wanna take back what you said, now’s the time.”</p>
<p>“Let me show you magicules aren’t the only deciding factor in a battle!” she snorted back.</p>
<p>I remember a certain red-colored ogre saying something similar a while back. But regardless, we now had an audience of rubberneckers here in this arena, ready to watch Shion fight off these three would-be pretenders coming for my throne.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Shion wiped the floor with them.</p>
<p>The fat guy with the lip piercing moved far more nimbly than looks would suggest, charging at Shion like a cannonball. Shion just kicked him away and sent him flying straight into the earring dude. Then, seizing that single open moment, she plunged her fist into the stomach of the nose-ring man, too stunned to react in time. Grabbing earring man by the arm and collar, she executed a perfect judo throw on him, smashing his head against the stone floor. He lay there, motionless.</p>
<p>“Arrrgh! What did you do to my brother?!”</p>
<p><a id="page-246"></a>The fat man with the lip piercing grabbed Shion from behind, attempting to lift her up. Shion’s brute strength stymied him.</p>
<p>“Wh-what the—?! But I’m so much stronger than you…!”</p>
<p>Shion glared at the man and snickered. Shifting position, she locked arms with him, and the test of strength began.</p>
<p>“Hnn…nnnnggghh…”</p>
<p><em>Snap!</em></p>
<p>Sadly, it wasn’t long before the fat man’s arms both bent in ways they shouldn’t have. They <em>were</em> all magic-born, so I figured they’d be all right, but judging by the way he was screaming and writhing around, it must’ve done a lot of damage.</p>
<p>But Shion didn’t even take a moment to marvel at her work before another pistonlike fist slammed home. Before the fat man could shout anything else, she landed a one-two finish on him like none other. The earring guy attempted a screamer of a kick on her body, but Shion simply bent backward and let it whiz past her. But the guy was smiling. His leg, still in the air, came down like a vicious battle ax, aimed squarely at Shion’s head.</p>
<p>There was a loud, dull <em>thuddd!</em> Shion’s stonelike head had just shattered the man’s leg. She executed a low kick to shatter the other one and sent him crashing to the ground. Without missing a beat, Shion straddled him, landing a flurry of punches on his head and body.</p>
<p>That sealed the deal.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Without even needing to take out her enhanced Goriki-maru sword, Shion had beaten the crap out of those three guys. Clearly, she had grown stronger. Smashing these opponents, all of whom equaled or beat her in magic force, didn’t even quicken her breathing. And she took all three down at the <em>same time</em>, no less.</p>
<p>“B-Benimaru?! Shion’s…?”</p>
<p>“Yes, this is quite a surprise. I see she went quite easy on them after all.”</p>
<p>That’s not what I’m <em>talking</em> about! This isn’t Milim there, on the arena stage! Benimaru clearly had a different definition of “going easy” than me. That wasn’t at all what I meant, but…ah well. No point wasting my breath.</p>
<p><a id="page-247"></a>Seriously, though, Shion’s amazing. No joke. She just proved that you can easily overwhelm an opponent otherwise your equal through prudent use of your magical force. Whipping Clayman must’ve helped her grow a lot. Benimaru’s non-reaction to it indicated he was expecting this all along, too.</p>
<p>I didn’t like it much, but Shion was now as powerful as an ex–demon lord—and by definition, Benimaru as well. Hell, maybe even Soei and Geld. Or maybe I’m overthinking it? Watching Shion grow must be wrecking my mind or something. Or not. Better stop thinking too much about it.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, was that not enough?”</p>
<p>Shion must have been taking my disturbed look wrong, as she eyed the three heaps sprawled on the ground.</p>
<p>“No, no, that’s fine!” I hurriedly shouted. That was <em>more</em> than enough, yes. “And if <em>you</em> guys have had enough, then stop getting in our way! Also, the <em>other</em> demon lords are even worse than that, so try not to fall out of line again, okay?”</p>
<p>The earring guy (the first to regain consciousness) rapidly nodded. That advice was for their own good, really. I guess they got cocky enough to think they could take on a demon lord, but good thing they picked me first. If they went to someone else, their punishment would’ve been a lot harsher than Shion’s.</p>
<p>“You guys are even stronger than Dad said,” the earring guy muttered.</p>
<p>“So Rimuru himself is…?”</p>
<p>“Yeah… He’s even better.”</p>
<p>“Fwehhh-heh-heh! I’m getting hungry.”</p>
<p>Now all three beheld me with respect. One of them was still acting a little strange, but no point worrying about it. I really didn’t want to bother with them any longer, but I felt it prudent to at least look into their backgrounds.</p>
<p>“So who pointed you here?”</p>
<p>I hoped they would be honest with me. I didn’t have to hope for long.</p>
<p>“Ah yes! We’re the sons of the demon lord Daggrull. I am Daggra, the eldest.”</p>
<p><a id="page-248"></a>“I am Liura, the second oldest.”</p>
<p>“And I’m Chonkra, the youngest!”</p>
<p>Just as I thought.</p>
<p>“Um, you sure you want to be so open with your identities like that?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Daggra replied. “Dad actually ordered us to go train under you, the demon lord Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“We kind of caused a ruckus back home, and he got royally mad…”</p>
<p>“Fweh-heh! So he kicked us out!”</p>
<p>That was…refreshingly honest of them. So basically, Daggrull had had it up to here with his problem children, so he was forcing them on me. What the hell? It’s not like we knew each other that well or anything. Where did <em>he</em> get off?</p>
<p>…But maybe I could make him owe me a favor now, huh? It’s not like we were that stable of a presence yet—I didn’t think it wise to make an enemy out of one of the strongest people in the world. Plus, while I didn’t want to spend another minute with these guys, I had the perfect drill sergeant in Shion right here. I’d seen her train Gobzo and the others, but she was so mean to those guys (way worse than Hakuro, even) that it had taken me aback a bit. If I left them to her, I figured they’d get sick of it and run away—and if they did, hey, I’d held up <em>my</em> end of the deal. Daggrull would have no right to complain.</p>
<p>“All right. Let’s have you train under Shion, then.”</p>
<p>I gave Shion a glance, knowing she’d probably hate it but hoping she would take this ticking time bomb off my hands. But Shion nodded back at me with an evil grin. Wait a minute. <em>This</em> wasn’t what I expected.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee… I have received my orders from Sir Rimuru. And trust me—I, Shion, can even take a pack of weaklings like <em>you</em> and build you into first-rate warriors. You may follow me with confidence!”</p>
<p>“I-I’d hope for nothing else!”</p>
<p>“Yeah! We’re gonna do our best for you, lady!”</p>
<p>“Me too! But can you give me something to eat first?!”</p>
<p>I was expecting some sass back, but Shion was pretty up for it. <a id="page-249"></a>Which, okay, if she’s cool, I’m cool. I decided to head back to the audience chamber, hearing cries like “Let us call you our teacher… No, our <em>master</em>!” and “I’ll expect all of you to follow my commands to the <em>letter</em>!” behind me. I figured I’d just ignore them for now.</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Back at the chamber, the bovoids and equinoids were now kneeling before me, visibly quivering. The younger fighters were following their leaders’ example, prostrating themselves as well. The high-and-mighty attitudes of the past were gone; now they reminded me of some of the weaker races I saw the previous day.</p>
<p>“We—we were awaiting your return!”</p>
<p>“Our loyalty shall forever be with you, Sir Rimuru!!”</p>
<p>I wondered what made them have a change of heart like that. It’s certainly a new attitude, coming from them. I climbed up to my throne, reverting to slime form and expecting them to get huffy with me again, but they didn’t.</p>
<p>“Do you <em>mean</em> it?”</p>
<p>“Of—of course, my lord!”</p>
<p>“Please, use our powers however you like!”</p>
<p>I guess this was a sincere change of heart. Judging by how frantic they looked, they really were trying to curry as much favor as possible with me. That little bout just now must’ve shown them how scary Shion can be, huh? In that case, no need to hold back. I’d have no qualms with taking advantage of these guys. They had been fighting for a century, which was <em>really</em> something I didn’t need in my domain, but I suppose that meant they loved combat. Would anyone complain if I just moved their battlefield into the labyrinth?</p>
<p>“Well, by the looks of things, you guys have more power than you know what to do with. How about I prepare an arena for you guys to duke it out in?”</p>
<p>“Y-you’re going to forgive them?” a saddened Rigurd asked. “I was thinking I could provide them with their divine punishment for you, Sir Rimuru…”</p>
<p><a id="page-250"></a>Yeahhh… I had forgotten, what with all this nonsense going on, but both races had pissed off Rigurd pretty good. But I thought it better to give them a chance and see if they could be useful.</p>
<p>“Now, now, Rigurd. They were just ignorant of us, I think, so why not forgive them just this once? If they try that stuff again, though, go right ahead.”</p>
<p>“If you say so, sir, I have no complaints. How good for all of <em>you</em>, hmm? If Sir Rimuru wasn’t such a forgiving lord, you may all have breathed your last just now. If you dare to defy us a second time, all that awaits is your final destruction. Give up your resistance and know your place!”</p>
<p>I was glad Rigurd got me, at least.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you guys are lucky,” chimed in Shion, who was already back from the arena. “If it wasn’t for those unwelcome visitors just now, I would’ve joined with Rigurd to do you all in. Why, for all the unbearable things you said, I would have plucked your tongues out so you could never speak again! So thank Sir Rimuru for his mercy, and try to show some obedience from now on!”</p>
<p>The bovoids and equinoids all nodded, shaking uncontrollably. “We—we promise we’ll live up to your expectations! Please forgive our disrespect!” And given how they were acting, I could believe they wouldn’t try it again.</p>
<p>“If you swear loyalty to me, I will consider it. First, though, stop your fighting and be quiet until you hear from me.”</p>
<p>I didn’t need to speak to them directly, but I thought it best to be doubly sure. I wanted to invite the bovoid leader over later under one pretense or another, so I could negotiate with him about working in the labyrinth. Given the (unintentional) fright we gave them, he ought to be cooperative.</p>
<p>Really, the chance at getting such a great boss for my project made all the stress of the day just fly out of my mind.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">The audiences went smoothly after that. Rumors of Shion taking control of Daggrull’s sons spread like wildfire, enough to make <a id="page-251"></a>even the powerful bovoids and equinoids lie low, so nobody was looking down on me now.</p>
<p>I was hoping things would end on a high note, but…</p>
<p class="space-break1">Soon after, an elder from the elven race and a few of his men arrived. I say elder, but he looked like a regular young man to me. No women were among them, which was kind of a shame, given how gorgeous lady elves tend to be.</p>
<p>Elves, of course, had a reputation for living practically forever. Both they and dwarves were originally spirits brought to physical life (or fallen from higher planes of existence), who became fairies and were eventually granted material bodies. Apparently, you could trace the genealogy of goblins back to the fairies, too: Fairies bearing the earth element eventually became dwarves; those with the water element became merfolk; fire became goblins; and wind became elves. Their ancestors were the results of fairies intermingling with creatures from other races long ago.</p>
<p>Apparently, goblins had little in the way of fairy blood left, which made their lives comparatively short. Even ogres, the next evolution up from them, only made it up to a hundred or so. When you got to ogre mage level, that reenergized the power from your spiritual ancestors, giving you skills that bordered on the divine.</p>
<p>But back to elves. Their lives were said to span between five and eight hundred years. Even elves with human blood mixed in could make it up to almost three hundred. This could vary a lot, though, since the more fairy blood you had in you, the longer you tended to live. Elves grew into maturity around the age of twenty, and beyond that, the passage of time simply did nothing to them. Only when on death’s door did they suddenly begin to rapidly age, and in about twenty years, infirmity would finally take their lives.</p>
<p>Staying young for a few centuries might sound like a dream to most humans. But another trait of theirs was how you never really saw them produce a lot of children. Living such long lives, they didn’t have much of a natural inclination to keep their bloodline going. That’s why they still numbered relatively few. (Bear in mind, of course, that I learned all this from the ladies at the Night <a id="page-252"></a>Butterfly, a nightclub in the Dwarven Kingdom I was well familiar with, so I couldn’t say how much of it was true.)</p>
<p>By the way, fairies themselves still existed—they were pretty common monsters, actually. These were smaller spirits given monster form by the effects of magicules around them; they were about the size of Ramiris and had a reputation as pranksters. They had intelligence, but they couldn’t procreate and didn’t live long. The personification of a major spirit was a far cry from them, enough so to be classified as a different monster entirely.</p>
<p>Ramiris tended to be bunched in with these fairies, but she was actually something different. She was fallen from an upper-level existence known as a spirit queen, which meant she may’ve been higher up the evolutionary ladder than the ancestors of elves or dwarves. It sounded like she went through an eternal pattern of reincarnation, although it didn’t seem like she understood the process herself too much…</p>
<p>…But I’ve gotten way off track. I lent an ear to the elder.</p>
<p>“It is an honor to lay eyes upon you,” he said with a salute. “We have come here today to celebrate you and offer our heartfelt gratitude…”</p>
<p>Normally, this would be the time when they’d offer their loyalty to me. Some of the races—the initial entries into the Federation—even expressed their thanks at their safety being guaranteed. But this was the first time I had ever met this elder. I wasn’t sure what he had to thank me for, so I had Rigurd ask for me.</p>
<p>“Ah, that would be—”</p>
<p>As the elder put it, it had to do with the bad blood between the bovoids and equinoids. It turned out the biggest victims of their hundred-year war were the elves.</p>
<p>According to him, elves, a race that lives off the blessings of the forest, fear the expansion of war zones more than anything else. To protect their hidden enclaves from outside enemies, the elves install “barriers” that scramble one’s sense of direction, but these barriers had fallen with the trees in the midst of the wars. Directional confusion didn’t mean much, after all, if the enclaves were in plain sight.</p>
<p><a id="page-253"></a>They tried to move their settlements, keeping casualties as low as they could, but the war kept growing bigger and bigger. It made the forest’s animals and monsters flee for their lives, it razed the local fruits and vegetables before they could be harvested, and some elves even resorted to taking work in the Dwarven Kingdom. (I guess that was what the ladies at the Night Butterfly were up to.)</p>
<p>Over time, the loss of population grew to become a crisis, making it hard to keep the enclaves going. Some of the elves considered making yet another move elsewhere, but as large as the Forest of Jura is, it wasn’t that easy to find a suitable destination.</p>
<p>“Thus,” the elder continued, “we considered appealing to those violent thugs to see if we could reach some kind of agreement. But before we could, my lord, the events of just now transpired. Now all we need is somewhere to move to…”</p>
<p>Hopefully, as he said, that would convince the elves who left to come back.</p>
<p>This gave me an idea. Someplace to move to? Yeah, I got that. Right here in town.</p>
<p>There were fewer than three hundred elves in the forest. At one point, there was a lot more, enough to build a prosperous kingdom in ancient times, but those glory years were long past. The elves were forced to turn nomadic, spreading to the four corners of the world—but regardless, I knew a place that could fit three hundred just fine. Remember that little forest I had just built down in Floor 95 of the Dungeon? There you go.</p>
<p>I could even put them to work—helping Apito run our honey operations, cultivating rare plants that only grew in magicule-rich forests, maybe running the inn I planned to open on Floor 95. They could run the weapon shop down there, and if any monsters appeared on that floor (not that I expected it), it’d be great for this town to have a little elven protection. I heard that elves and treants got along well, so I doubted Treyni or the others would be against this.</p>
<p>Plus, with all the jobs on offer, I figured it’d help attract the more distant elves back here. Maybe the ladies from that nightclub would venture back, too—and then I could build an elf-run VIP room down there, maybe…?!</p>
<p><a id="page-254"></a>Yes. This was excellent. There was already a tavern in town, but that was more of a gastropub geared for adventurers. If you wanted someplace for a quiet drink and relaxation, you’d have to go to our administration-exclusive dining halls. I’m sure Shuna would be glad to serve me in my own room, but I didn’t need alcohol <em>that</em> badly. I’m just talking about, you know, taking a breather. It’s not that having Shuna around would make it impossible to relax or anything—or impossible to BS with Gobta, or have private discussions with Mjöllmile, or whatever.</p>
<p>…No, <em>really</em>!</p>
<p>I’m just saying, if we had something like the Night Butterfly on the ninety-fifth floor, it’d be useful for a lot of different situations.</p>
<p>I decided to offer this idea to the elder at once. “Elder, I think I know someplace that’d be able to accept you…”</p>
<p>When Rigurd realized I was speaking, he took a step back and listened. I don’t how he got trained to do it, but he could calmly handle just about any situation by this point. If I ever went off script during an event like this, he could keep up without any blank stares. I loved that.</p>
<p>“Ah! You do, Lord Rimuru?”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm. If it’s about three hundred of you, we’d be able to fit you all in…”</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“…Thank you so much! I will inform my people of this the moment I return.”</p>
<p>“Great. I’ll get it all set up so it’s available for move-in when you’re ready. But do you mind if I ask a favor in return?”</p>
<p>“Of course not, my lord. If our powers can be of help to you, nothing could make us happier!”</p>
<p>The elven elder was even happier about it than I thought. It’d save them from having to wander the forest in search of a safe haven, which I’m sure came as a relief. It sounded like he was sending an envoy over right now to get people ready.</p>
<p>So now we had elves moving into our labyrinth.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-255"></a>I figured that was the end of the conversation, but one thing did concern me. The elder mentioned that elves had been leaving their enclave to work and not coming back. With a race as tightly knit as the elves, it seemed odd to me that any of them would abandon their homeland. Some elves even reportedly went out hunting and never returned, which disturbed me.</p>
<p>Elves could be very individualistic by nature, the elder said, so perhaps a passing whim drove them away from home. But then I remembered what I heard in Mjöllmile’s shop—the proposal from Viscount Cazac of Englesia. A place that dealt in elven slaves, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>Maybe it wasn’t a matter of these younger elves <em>choosing</em> not to go back. If my hunch about the criminal group Cazac was fronting turned out to be true… Well, hopefully it wasn’t, but if it was, that would be a big problem.</p>
<p>My dream of launching an elf nightclub was so close at hand. Seeing the elder off after we said our goodbyes, I thought that I’d better investigate this thoroughly.</p>
<p>Thus, I gave Soei behind me a Thought Communication message.</p>
<p>(Soei, I want you to investigate a man named Viscount Cazac in Blumund.)</p>
<p>(Yes, my lord!)</p>
<p>In a moment, he sent out a Replication of himself, beginning his work at once. That should be enough. He’d probably find something out before my audiences were over.</p>
<p><em>I’ll probably want to ask Mjöllmile what he knows about criminal slave merchants, too.</em> If it turns out Cazac’s involved, there’d be no mercy for him. It was an affront to the deep love I had for elves—a love that drove me to open my very own elven nightclub. I wasn’t about to let anyone keep me from that dream.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">The long, long audience period was finally in its last day. Once I was through this, I’d kick off the Founder’s Festival in three days.</p>
<p>No problems of note occurred after the elven contingent. It was <a id="page-256"></a>going smooth as silk, and there were no major issues among the monsters staying in town. The little scuffle with Daggrull’s kids was the talk of the town in pretty short order, which probably kept anyone who wanted to show off their strength in line.</p>
<p>Geld had taken some time off, which let him return to Tempest a few days ago, and Diablo and Hakuro also arrived back the previous day.</p>
<p>“Ah, Sir Rimuru! You are as stately and dignified as always. My heart bursts with joy at being able to see you again!”</p>
<p>Diablo was buttering me up once more, punctuating the flattery with his usual ominous snickering. There was nothing “dignified” about a slime, so I reasoned that he probably needed glasses or something. I wanted a report from him, but that could wait—which disappointed him, but I needed to keep today free for an important discussion.</p>
<p><em>That</em> was how major today’s visitor was to me. No letting my guard down around them, that’s for sure. As I saw it, it’d be my toughest audience yet. That was why I had my whole crew in attendance for today’s sessions.</p>
<p>Right now, this entourage was being welcomed into town by Benimaru, my right-hand man. (This should also say something about how crucial this was to me.) Already, on the other side of the door, I could sense a violent force approaching like a tidal wave. The rumors, I realized, were true.</p>
<p>The door opened, revealing a posse clad in full armor. These were the tengu, an independent force residing in the Khusha Mountains on the horizon of the Forest of Jura—outside my jurisdiction. While Benimaru had met with them once before, this was less of an audience and more of a summit between two factions.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Standing in front of this armored crew was a beautiful young woman. The tengu were humanoids known for their almost comically long noses, but this girl looked like any normal human. Tengu, bearing the same name as the figures of Japanese mythology, were apparently a hybrid species between angels and wolfmen—</p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Report. To be more accurate, they are not a hybrid. They are angels incarnated into the bodies of wolfmen.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-257"></a>Right—a type of incarnation. That.</p>
<p>Wolfmen were a type of beastman—a proud, isolated race who held an almost divine presence in people’s minds. Thus, calling the tengu long-nosed was often more a metaphor than anything else, a way of referring to the supernatural sense of smell they boasted.</p>
<p>Now then, for this species worshipped as the gods of the mountains—</p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Report. To be more accurate, they are not a species. They are a group born from a single individual, much like the subject Ranga.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1">Um, sure. Right. Honestly, I don’t really follow it all, but anyway, a bunch of crazy-powerful gods decided to create a bunch of crazy-powerful wolfmen, and then an angel incarnated themself in one, creating a new sentient species. The single individual that led to this species was the tengu elder—the mother of the girl before me. And since creating all these children apparently weakened the elder to the point of powerlessness, this girl was essentially the tengu leader.</p>
<p>This is why it’s more accurate to call this a summit. And not even <em>that</em> fully described how important this meeting was.</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Benimaru had come to the tengu’s domain once. They had been kind to us at times, permitting the migration of high orcs through their territory, but they were also proud, and if I floated the idea of enforcing my rule over the mountains to them, it’d almost certainly result in war.</p>
<p>I, of course, didn’t want that. I didn’t see any need to fight this race revered as mountain gods. Benimaru understood that, so he was on strict instructions to just get their permission to build a highway on their lands between Tempest and Thalion.</p>
<p>“The negotiations went successfully,” Benimaru had said when he later reported back. “Everything went well with them. Not even <a id="page-258"></a>the tengu can afford to ignore you, Sir Rimuru, so they mentioned plans to come see you sometime.”</p>
<p>The news sounded good, but Benimaru looked exhausted.</p>
<p>“You sure there weren’t any problems?”</p>
<p>“No, not exactly, but…”</p>
<p>He was dodging the question. And Alvis, whom I sent along with him, had seemed off her game—or at the very least, miffed about something—ever since she got back. It seemed like something I was better off not asking about.</p>
<p>So I decided to force it out of Benimaru anyway—in private, over a few drinks, since he didn’t seem interested in telling the rest of our administration about it. The way he described it…</p>

<p class="tx1">Benimaru had headed over to the tengu’s hidden homeland with Alvis and a dozen or so members of Team Kurenai. The journey over went smoothly, but in front of a cave near the peak of the Khusha Mountains, they were stopped by a young tengu warrior, dressed in white with a katana on his belt. On his back were two white wings, and he also bore a tail and doglike triangular ears.</p>
<p>Based on the refinement of his posture, he was clearly trained in battle, Benimaru thought. Speaking with him, they asked for permission to go through the “barrier” placed within the cave. The warrior agreed but allowed only Benimaru and Alvis to follow him inside.</p>
<p>On the other side, they found a flowery paradise. It was neither hot nor cold, the temperature always pleasant—a beautiful land, befitting the powerful race who called it home. In the courtyard they were taken to, Benimaru was greeted by a beautiful woman—one who looked human, unlike any of the other tengu. Her hair came down to her shoulders, pure white at the roots and fading into a crimson red around her ears. Her small, soft lips were the color of cherry blossoms, but her long, sharp eyes were the eyes of a wolf, watching Benimaru like a beast sizing up its prey.</p>
<p>Benimaru realized he couldn’t let his guard down. The <a id="page-259"></a>commanding presence she had over the room was reminiscent of the demon lord Carillon—or perhaps even stronger than that.</p>
<p>“My name is Benimaru. I come on behalf of the demon lord Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“Welcome, kind messenger. I am Momiji, daughter of the tengu elder. What brings you to us? Are you aiming to take over this land?” the girl asked with a beguiling smile.</p>
<p>Her words were poison-tipped. Benimaru could tell he wasn’t welcome at all. But he didn’t let that bother him.</p>
<p>“I have no such intentions. What we seek is permission to venture over the Khusha Mountains along the border with the Forest of Jura. And, if possible, we’d like to request permission to dig a tunnel into this mountain.”</p>
<p>“Hmph. No ambitions of a land grab, then? You may pass through the mountains all you like…but what is this tunnel you speak of?” Momiji seemed less than enthusiastic about this conversation, but the word <em>tunnel</em> piqued her interest.</p>
<p>Benimaru didn’t know a great deal about it, either, apart from my vague description of boring a hole into the mountain. In fact, the idea had already been shot down by my team. A tunnel would be the shortest route between Tempest and the Thalion capital, but the highway would only lead to the nearest large town on the Thalion border, so no tunnel was strictly needed. Benimaru knew that, but he wanted to bring up the concept in his negotiations regardless.</p>
<p>“A tunnel involves digging a hole in the mountain to allow passage through to the other side. If you do not wish to permit this, we will not—”</p>
<p>“Wait. Dig a hole in the mountain? Are you quite serious?”</p>
<p>“I am. That’s what the project plan called for. But no tunnel is necessary for the route we have now, so I only wanted to ask in case it <em>does</em> become necessary in the future. If you don’t like it, I will not force the question.”</p>
<p>To a race who treats the mountains as divinity, digging a hole through one was seen as anathema.</p>
<p>“That is <em>very</em> ill-advised. You are free to let a slime become a <a id="page-260"></a>demon lord, but as long as you do not interfere with us, I see no harm. I am even willing to shut my eyes to that slavering half-snake you’ve brought along with you. But if you wish to make a mockery of our glorious mountains—that I cannot abide.”</p>
<p>As if to prove the point, Momiji stood up.</p>
<p>Benimaru had no intention of making an issue out of this, but now it seemed like the discussion was over. Had he failed? He stayed in his seat, reasoning that any reaction would force the other side to up the ante—but not everyone was willing to remain silent.</p>
<p>“A slavering half-snake? Are you talking about me?”</p>
<p>A fuming Alvis leaped out of her chair instead, staring Momiji down. The two seemed ready to come to blows at any moment.</p>
<p>“Whoa, stop—”</p>
<p>Just as Benimaru spoke, Alvis’s eyes met Momiji’s. Her extra skill Snake Eyes could cause paralysis, poison, insanity, and many other ailments. But none of that fazed Momiji.</p>
<p>“Such a silly move,” she said as she took out a folding fan with both hands. “Mere status ailments won’t work on the daughter of the tengu elder.”</p>
<p>Tengu are half-spiritual life-forms and as such bear a high resistance to status ailments. In addition, Momiji had the extra skill Godwolf Sense on at all times, giving her information beyond what her five senses provided—a sort of powered-up version of Magic Sense that picked up on illusions and illusory magic. Thus, sneak attacks like that didn’t work on her.</p>
<p>Then it was Momiji’s turn. She brought her fan down on Alvis in a sort of dance. Alvis blocked the first blow with her golden staff, but the second one hit her on the side and sent her flying to the far end of the open-air courtyard.</p>
<p>“Kffhh…?!”</p>
<p>Momiji’s moves were simple but refined. The blow had shut the fan; now she reopened it, elegantly hiding her lips with it.</p>
<p>“Are you done? I see the Lycanthropeers are all bark and no bite.”</p>
<p>“You better not rile me, country girl. I went easy on you because we were here to negotiate, but perhaps I didn’t need to?” replied Alvis, her pride hurt.</p>
