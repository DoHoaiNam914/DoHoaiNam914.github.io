<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">Diablo and Hakuro, by the way, still weren’t back from Farmus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.2">According to Gobta, Ranga, and Gabil (who came home before them), they said they’d wrap everything up before the Founder’s Festival. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.3">Apparently, they were pretty disappointed that they couldn’t see me make my royal debut like this—but they had Yohm’s own coronation to handle over there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.4">With it, Farmus would be reborn as a new country, and I’m sure they had a million things to do, so I couldn’t blame them for missing out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.5">Even Diablo was showing up here only on rare occasions, and Hakuro didn’t have access to Spatial Motion, so I hadn’t seen him at all lately. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.6">I’d definitely need to thank them once they’re back.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">I wasn’t the only one suffering right now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">It was all so tremendously embarrassing, but I resolved to put up with it and get this stupid, exaggerated, bombastic presentation ceremony over with.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">What was funny was how each of the monster races reacted to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">I had nothing to do, so I sat there like the conversation piece I was and looked down at the assorted monsters giving speeches.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Generally, the monster reactions were divided into three camps—worship, observation, or fear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">On the observation side were a few people who openly looked down on me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">The new guys from the other side of the Great Ameld River were particularly notable on this front. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.4">But it was no big problem. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.5">Show off some of my strength, and I’m sure they’ll acquiesce to me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">The monsters who feared me, however, were the real issue…</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Here, for example, was a contingent of rabbitfolk in front of me right now, a race of demi-humans who were honestly pretty cute—human, basically, but with long, pointy rabbitlike ears. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">Unlike lycanthropes, they were degraded beastmen, unable to transform and possessing the same amount of strength as an average human. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">The equipment they had on didn’t look too sturdy, either, but they were all gifted in the Detect Danger skill, which I’m sure was a must to survive in the Forest of Jura. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">My own cutesy exterior must not have fooled them at all.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-230"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">“Um, tha-thank you for i-inviting us here today…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Dealing with someone who was petrified of you was kind of tough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">Some of the rabbitfolk were visibly quaking, so we had to calm them down before they could begin.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“Very well,” echoed Rigurd’s voice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">“You are hereby granted an audience with our ruler, the great demon lord Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">Lift your head up!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">The rabbitfolk leader didn’t move. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">Or maybe he couldn’t. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">This darling little slime was simply too much of a threatening presence to look in the eye—not that I had eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.4">But that wasn’t the issue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.5">I didn’t </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">want</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1"> to oversee a reign of terror with these guys; I wanted a frank and open relationship…but to races like this, a demon lord who </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">looked</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1"> wimpy on the outside was nothing short of horrifying. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">Too much of a gap, I suppose. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.3">We had worked hard with guys like these, earning their support for our transportation and logistical efforts all over the forest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.4">Maybe it wasn’t possible from the outset, but I really wished I could interact normally with them sometime.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">The halflings and kobolds were like this when I first launched the federation, although the kobolds started trusting us once we agreed to let them continue their merchant trade. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">Koby, their representative, and I were old war buddies by now, constantly sharing potential business leads with each other.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">These rabbitfolk were equals to me, and so was every other weaker race in the forest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">I’d just have to stick to my guns and try to explain that I didn’t value my citizenry strictly on their ability to fight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">Maybe they wouldn’t believe me at first, but we could work it out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.4">So I sat, looking at the twitching ears of the rabbitfolk kowtowing to me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“There is nothing to fear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">Sir Rimuru is a fair, generous leader, one who says he will treat everyone in his domain as equal. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">Please, feel free to share a few words with him,” intoned Rigurd.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">The representative finally held his head up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">He was young and fairly handsome, but there were deep rings under his eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">Out of overwork or nervousness?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“O—O great demon lord Rimuru, please accept the sincere loyalty of the rabbitfolk…”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-231"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">I gave him a firm nod. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">It seemed to relieve the guy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.3">I could practically see a literal weight lift from his shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“See?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Rigurd beamed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">“I told you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.4">There is no need to be nervous!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“Ha…ha-ha…! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">Um, I’ve actually brought my daughter along, but she got so restless once we entered town, I’m afraid I’ve lost sight of her…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">“Ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">Yes, the whole town’s in a festival frenzy right now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">I can imagine a young girl would let her curiosity get the best of her!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“Ah, this is so embarrassing… I let her out of my sight for a single moment, and she runs away to who knows where. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">I had wanted to leave her behind in the village, lest she offend Lord Rimuru, but she insisted…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">This leader must’ve been panicking about his daughter causing some kind of ruckus in town. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">So all those nerves weren’t just from being in awe of me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">That’s good to know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.4">I didn’t want the weaker races any more scared of me than they already were. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.5">But a young rabbitfolk girl, huh…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.6">A pretty lass with rabbit ears </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">would</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1"> be a sight to see, I bet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Hopefully I’d get a chance.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">As I thought over it, I began speaking a bit more honestly than I perhaps should have.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“If she’s that curious, then she must be taking in all the trends and different things around here, isn’t she? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">I bet she’ll make a wonderfully reliable successor to you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">The direct compliment from me visibly moved the leader.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“Such…such kind words, my lord! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">If I have the chance, I would be delighted to introduce my daughter Framea to you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">He bowed to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">It seemed like we had broken the ice a little. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">Rigurd then briefed him on political matters a bit, and they agreed on the spot that the rabbitfolk were officially part of my domain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.4">He bowed several times again before finally leaving the altar. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Hopefully</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">, I thought as the next visitor was brought to me, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">this’ll show people that I’m not such a scary guy</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">This visitor kneeled before me, turning an eye toward the other monsters seeking an audience. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">I knew this guy—it was Abil, Gabil’s </span><a id="page-232"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">father and chief of the lizardmen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Seeing him reminded me of the good old days—or it would have, if he didn’t look virtually like another person by now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">He had transformed into a square-jawed warrior in the prime of his life. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.4">Giving him a name must’ve evolved him to this point—to a dragonewt, one far closer to humanoid than before. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.5">Gabil sure didn’t change that much, but Soka had gone almost entirely human, so maybe it depended on what the individual wanted.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“It has been far too long since we last spoke, Sir Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">It pleases me greatly that you have risen to demon lord, er, the status of demon lord, and all of us er, are…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Abil was acting oddly stiff. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">He was probably more on the “worship” side of matters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">Gabil himself said demon lords weren’t </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1"> worth freaking out about. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">He already should’ve known what I was like, so why all the nerves?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">I tried to be informal with my response. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">“Hey, Chief. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">Good to see you again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.4">No need for the formalities here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.5">We’re all part of the same federation, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.6">Keep up the good work.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">Benimaru snickered, and Shuna sighed at me, but I didn’t care.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“It is not that simple, Sir Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">As a demon lord, you have grown into something extraordinary. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.3">You are not only our lord, but the de facto ruler of the entire Forest of Jura…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">As always, Abil was too serious for his own good. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">But that’s what I liked about him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“All right, all right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">There aren’t any other races in this chamber we’re in right now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">You don’t have to be all nervous. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.4">Your son, Gabil, is working hard under my leadership. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.5">He’s become a full-fledged part of my administration. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.6">I couldn’t have done this without him.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">I decided to name-drop Gabil to ease the tension a bit, reminding Abil of his son and indirectly hinting that he ought to let him back into the family already.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“Ah, there is no fazing you, Sir Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">So that no-good son of mine has been of service to you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">He’s such an incorrigible fool, so…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">He must’ve noticed my intentions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">The fact of the matter was, Gabil had still been kicked out of Abil’s family, so he must’ve thought it improper to ask how his son was doing without some </span><a id="page-233"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">kind of prompting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">Now that I brought him up, that wasn’t an issue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.3">I could already see his usual bold attitude coming back.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">“Incorrigible? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">Hardly! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">I’m having him lead our research and development department, and he’s doing an excellent job for me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.4">Aren’t you, Gabil?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">“Wha? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Ah—</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">yes</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1"> !!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Gabil, meanwhile, was frozen solid through all this, blushing all the way back to his ears, and when he was suddenly expected to join the conversation, his voice cracked.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">“That stupid kid of mine…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">As Gabil continued to work himself into a panic, I unleashed just a little bit of Lord’s Ambition. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">That was enough to turn everyone’s attention back to me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">“Abil, chief of the lizardmen… Though I may be demon lord, I request your continued support as a member of my federation.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">“It shall be done! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">By the name you’ve given me, I will never forget my allegiance to you!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">He bowed down, head nodding deeply at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">He was the classic noble warrior, and he looked the part, even in this strictly formal setting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">I nodded back, then glanced at the still-panicking Gabil.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">“…?!”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">He can be so dense sometimes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">I guess he didn’t see what that glance meant.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1"> I’m sure it wasn’t because I was in slime mode and didn’t have eyes, either.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">Rigur, exasperated, jogged over to Gabil and whispered in his ear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">“Sir Rimuru would like you and your father to speak to each other privately. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.3">If he doesn’t let you back into the family now, you won’t have another chance for quite some time to come, you realize? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.4">And having an estranged son accomplishing so many great things puts Sir Abil in a delicate position, too, no doubt…”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">Nice one, Rigur. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">Way to perfectly understand what I meant, unlike Gabil here.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">The step-by-step explanation finally shook the fog out of Gabil’s brain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">He saluted me, still a little flustered, and accompanied Abil out of the chamber.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">Next up were the assorted high orc tribal chiefs, each with a little entourage along for the ride. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">They must’ve trusted me enough to not bring guards in; the entourages were composed of children and grandchildren. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.3">With their food situation much improved, life had plainly gotten a lot easier for them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.4">They were fathering children now, and these children were themselves high orcs, which surprised and elated them so much that they wanted to show them off to me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">Well, why </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">wouldn’t</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1"> they be high orcs? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">Apparently, that wasn’t as much of a given as I thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">Normally, they’d just be regular orcs; the mutation into high orc was seen as a one-and-done kind of thing, generation-wise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.4">With birth rates going down among them, they’d be able to devote more time and effort into raising each one, I imagined. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.5">I wanted to be sure of that, so they’d become the next generation of manpower for us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.6">Children really </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">are</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1"> treasures, thinking of it that way—a fact that remains true no matter what world, or species, you’re talking about.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">I was a little concerned about how their names were being passed on, but apparently it was going well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">I had given those names almost at random, but I guess they all sounded natural enough to them, so…great? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">It’s all about getting used to it, I suppose. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.4">Call someone anything long enough, and it’s bound to stick. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.5">They didn’t really </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">need</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1"> names anyway, so maybe I was over-worrying it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Fully reassured, I saw off the high orcs and their entourage.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Next came the final group of the day—the treants, the other major players in the Forest of Jura Alliance after the lizardmen and the high orcs. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">Actually, the only individuals who made an appearance were the dryads Traya and Doreth, Treyni’s younger sisters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">But hey, treants can’t move anyway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.4">No helping that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.5">Besides, the dryads acted as the treants’ representatives, so no issues there.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">I had been visiting the treant colony on regular occasions; Zegion and Apito had been keeping it well protected, and we were receiving regular shipments of high-quality honey from them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">Thus, the atmosphere at this audience was pretty casual.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-235"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">“Charmed to see you again, Sir Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">Congratulations on being appointed a demon lord.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">“We hope you will continue to provide us with your benevolent protection.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">They both smiled at me without hesitation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">That saved me a lot of trouble.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">So we filled each other in on recent happenings. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">For now, nothing was particularly amiss. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.3">The only real concern to report was the thinning out of magicules around the Forest of Jura, which made transport a tad inconvenient.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">They both looked exactly like Treyni, and I could feel vast amounts of magical force in them, but apparently they were still affected by the lower magic concentrations around them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">In fact, Doreth </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1"> look a little thinned out to me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">“Hmm… I didn’t think that far. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">That’s probably the magic barriers along the highways doing their work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.3">Better think of something for that…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">“Oh, no, it’s not that serious a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">“We sisters use magicules to form the magical bodies you see before you, and they are merely more susceptible to the barriers, is all.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">“But outside of that, Sir Rimuru…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">“We have important matters to discuss!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">They didn’t see it as important. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">Very few creatures around Jura would be affected by magicule concentrations like that, dryads and treants among them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.3">Thus, since they were the last people I was seeing today, I offered to continue our talk in a private room that night.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">.........</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">......</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">The moment I entered the room, the two spoke in unison.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">“So what we wanted to talk to you about…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">“We wish to serve the beautiful fairy queen just as our great elder sister does.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">You know, now that I think about it, I don’t like that “fairy queen” </span><a id="page-236"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">name. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">It was overblown, way too fancy for such a teensy little thing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.3">And </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">beautiful</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">I recalled a smiling Ramiris in my mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.3">No way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.4">Not beautiful. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.5">We were picturing totally different things, I was pretty sure about that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.6">If Ramiris was beautiful, you could describe Shizu, the base for my own looks, as a goddess. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.7">I’m used to it now, but even I was a bit taken by my own appearance in the past.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">Benimaru and Shion, who joined me in here, seemed to agree with me—but Traya and Doreth paid them no mind.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">“This is not just our opinion, but that of all the treants.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">“And we hear that, in this very town…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">“…Lady Ramiris has built her residence.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">“If so, we can only hope to be of some service to her…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">In their uniquely sequential manner of speaking, they begged me to let them serve Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">If they had already requested a different master, that’d make it hard to ask them to serve me, I suppose. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.3">Besides, Treyni, their big sister, was already Ramiris’s. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.4">I had no real reason to be opposed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">“Um, you wanna ask her?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">“…What?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">“Is that all right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">The reaction was swift and forceful.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">So off we went to Ramiris’s place, where we found Beretta silently working and Treyni falling over herself to cater to the fairy’s whims. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">Man, Beretta must have it pretty tough.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">But as I thought that:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">“Ahhh, Lady Ramiris, you are so ravishing…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">“As beautiful as always—and so elegant! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">The perfect master for us to serve!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">Just as before, Traya and Doreth were crying their eyes out over her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">Treyni just nodded in response. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">I wasn’t sure who they were talking about at this point. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.3">“Elegant” was one of the last words I’d ever use to describe her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">“Did you hear that?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">Ramiris huffed, tossing her head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.3">“Hey—hey, did you hear that? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.4">Better not look down on me any longer, you hear?”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-237"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">Man, shut </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">up</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">Now she was flying around the room, lording it over us as best she could with her size. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.3">Ah well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.4">Everybody likes a compliment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.5">But judging by this, the answer to the dryads’ question seemed pretty clear.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">“Well, Ramiris? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">I think all the treants want to serve you, too, not just these two.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">“Huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">But…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">Ramiris gave me a hesitant look. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">I suppose she still felt like a freeloader in my city. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.3">So I threw her a life preserver.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">“How about we have them move into your labyrinth? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">We moved the beastmen’s camp without breaking a sweat, so could it be much harder to move the treant colony?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">Or did the distance involved create an issue? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">I felt like she said she could build a corridor into the maze from anywhere she wanted…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">“Are you sure?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">She beamed, nodding at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.3">“In that case, I’ll head out as soon as tomorrow! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.4">Expanding this labyrinth was a snap when I borrowed some power from my master, and I feel like </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">I’ve</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1"> gained some power, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">It’d be kind of fun to make some of the empty floors into a jungle section!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">I explained this to them, showing how I wouldn’t question their moving here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">Her rule over the labyrinth was unstoppable, and besides, it’d be nice for them to be reunited with their original master.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">They’d have it, of course.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">The treant colony would be placed on Floor 95, the level on which the beastmen camp was located. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">It was the largest floor in land area, a circle with a radius a bit over three miles, so we had space to work with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.3">I was intending to build the rest stop on that floor, too, so this worked out well for that, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.4">People talk about how refreshing a walk in the woods is, and I didn’t want our resting post to be this depressing, clinical thing.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">Moving day went pretty fast. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">It was more of a moving </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">moment</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">, really. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">Ramiris just opened a door to the labyrinth at the treants’ location, then moved them right inside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.3">The actual process took a few hours, but all it took was opening a door next to each treant, so it was pretty straightforward.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">Now Ramiris had an even greater domain to rule over, and I had a more stable labyrinth to work with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.2">Managing the magicules was much easier now, to say nothing of the air conditioning, and the treants couldn’t have asked for anything more. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.3">Thanks to the high levels of magic concentration in the air, they were all brimming with energy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">None of the beastmen living in their temporary quarters had any complaints, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.2">Treants are generally pretty chill, usually asleep and looking like plain old trees—and besides, the beastmen would be going back to the Beast Kingdom sooner or later, so they didn’t mind having some neighbors for the time being. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.3">If anything, they welcomed them, since it made the whole floor more comfortable to live in.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">They had also extracted a promise from the dryads to help maintain the labyrinth—or really, the dryads volunteered to help. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">“We’ve had a paradise made for us, so that much would be simple,” Treyni said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.3">Her sisters, and the other dryads, all nodded their agreement.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">.........</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">With that, we had a small forest village in the labyrinth, along with some very unexpected helpers.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-239"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">Floor 95, being a multiple of five, was a safe zone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">Since we had a bunch of extra floors anyway, I decided to use Floors 91 through 94 as a storage site, a greenhouse for gardens, and a processing facility. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.3">To be more specific, Floor 91 would contain storage for metal ore; Floor 92, a plant for producing magisteel; Floor 93, a garden; and Floor 94, another facility for producing honey. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.4">There was also free passage all the way to Floor 95, which made movement easy, and the save point in the center of 95 included doors back to other floors above and a single, foreboding stairway going down.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">This was a pretty convenient setup, one that cheerfully ignored all the laws of physics but still seemed to work just fine.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">By the way, defeating the boss at Floor 90 granted you access to stairs down to Floor 95—if you somehow made it </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1"> far, I was happy to give you a bit of a shortcut. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">Your final, hellish challenge would begin on Floor 96, and before journeying onward, you’d naturally want to rest up and inspect all your equipment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.3">I made sure to put up a door before the stairway down, along with a notice explaining the dangers below, and I also planned to provide an inn and weapon/armor shop near the door.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">This inn would be connected to the other safe zones in the labyrinth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">The doors were all connected, which helped with this setup a lot. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.3">The shop, meanwhile, could offer valuable equipment not available anywhere else, all lined up in front for sale. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.4">We were unlikely to see much in the way of customers, so I imagined the shop would be more of a hobby of mine than anything else.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">I fantasized about putting some of my own creations in the shop down there as I decided to discuss my idea with Mjöllmile.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">So after talking to monster species all day in the audience room, I spent much of the evening helping Ramiris and her new subjects with their move.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">This new floor we built would eventually blossom into a forested city of its own. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.2">We called it Labyrinth City—a final oasis for those who made it through the Dungeon, a fantastic town that granted visitors more power than they ever thought possible…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">…but at that time, I hadn’t imagined that far down the line yet.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">The two races stood by the door, keeping each other at bay. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">The situation looked ready to devolve into physical combat at any moment—and given their positions high up the Forest of Jura food chain, they were both intimidating presences.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">A magic-born with bullhorns spoke to me first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">“Ah, the demon lord! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.3">If you want a stout ally in battle, turn to us first! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.4">Let the bovoids join your side, and you’ll get to strut around the forest with </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">authority</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.2">And once we wipe out those wimpy equinoids once and for all, you won’t find any race in the forest to defy us!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">He certainly was bold, making this proclamation to me without a hint of fear, and he had the strength to back it up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">He had more magical energy to him than the ogres and lizardmen I first ran into, that’s for sure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.3">Conservatively, I’d say there were a few A rankers in the group. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.4">You’d need that kind of force to wage a hundred-year war, and in terms of pure fighting ability, they may have been the best the Forest of Jura had to offer.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">Those creatures were celebrated in Greek mythology, hailed as the stuff of legend—but in the early twentieth century, when people discovered the ancient temple of Knossos in Crete, they found a complex maze of passages, along with an underground section that suggested the labyrinth really existed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.2">Maybe there wasn’t a bullheaded maze guardian inside, but there were many bull-themed frescoes and such inside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.3">Even back then, labyrinths and minotaurs went hand in hand with each other.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">And…I had to say, the bovoids before me appeared </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">exactly</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1"> how you’d expect a minotaur to look in real life. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">Their leader, a measure larger than the others, practically oozed with evil energy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.3">Our labyrinth was a little sparse when it came to bosses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.4">I only had creatures selected for Floors 10, 20, and 30—but this leader guy, I thought, had what it took to occupy Floor 40 or 50. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.5">I wanted him, no matter what. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.6">I just couldn’t fight the feeling.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">Unfortunately, these monsters didn’t seem like they’d be too loyal to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.2">They probably just thought of me as a nice patron, or employer, to have. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.3">It was clear they wanted to leverage this relationship so they could annihilate their current foes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.4">If I was honest with myself, that was the only conclusion to make.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">So I busted out just a little Lord’s Ambition on them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.2">If they saw how awesome I was, maybe they’d get in line and— Whoa. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.3">They didn’t seem to notice at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.4">I was right in front of them, and they’re still glaring and yelling at each other. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.5">Should I take more drastic measures and “tame” them down?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">But as I weighed my options, a clearly miffed Rigurd stepped </span><a id="page-242"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">forward. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.2">“How </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">dare</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1"> you show such rudeness before our lord! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.2">I see that I, Rigurd, need to show all of you your place!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">He was normally quite gentle, doggedly pursuing administrative tasks around town, but I knew Rigurd had secretly been working out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.2">He was stronger than the younger guys, at least, like Gobta and Rigur—and given his performance against the paladins when they attacked, he definitely had something of a warrior inside him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.3">The way I saw it, he was stronger than the leaders of both factions here.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">“What? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.2">Look at this bureaucrat who thinks he’s the lord of all things!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">“Y-you’re going to forgive them?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.2">a saddened Rigurd asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.3">“I was thinking I could provide them with their divine punishment for you, Sir Rimuru…”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-250"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">Yeahhh… I had forgotten, what with all this nonsense going on, but both races had pissed off Rigurd pretty good. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.2">But I thought it better to give them a chance and see if they could be useful.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">“Now, now, Rigurd. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.2">They were just ignorant of us, I think, so why not forgive them just this once? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.3">If they try that stuff again, though, go right ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">“If you say so, sir, I have no complaints. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.2">How good for all of </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">you</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">, hmm? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.2">If Sir Rimuru wasn’t such a forgiving lord, you may all have breathed your last just now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.3">If you dare to defy us a second time, all that awaits is your final destruction. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.4">Give up your resistance and know your place!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1">I was glad Rigurd got me, at least.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">“Yeah, you guys are lucky,” chimed in Shion, who was already back from the arena. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.2">“If it wasn’t for those unwelcome visitors just now, I would’ve joined with Rigurd to do you all in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.3">Why, for all the unbearable things you said, I would have plucked your tongues out so you could never speak again! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.4">So thank Sir Rimuru for his mercy, and try to show some obedience from now on!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.1">The bovoids and equinoids all nodded, shaking uncontrollably. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.2">“We—we promise we’ll live up to your expectations! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.3">Please forgive our disrespect!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.4">And given how they were acting, I could believe they wouldn’t try it again.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.1">“If you swear loyalty to me, I will consider it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.2">First, though, stop your fighting and be quiet until you hear from me.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.1">I didn’t need to speak to them directly, but I thought it best to be doubly sure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.2">I wanted to invite the bovoid leader over later under one pretense or another, so I could negotiate with him about working in the labyrinth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.3">Given the (unintentional) fright we gave them, he ought to be cooperative.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.1">Really, the chance at getting such a great boss for my project made all the stress of the day just fly out of my mind.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.1">The audiences went smoothly after that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.2">Rumors of Shion taking control of Daggrull’s sons spread like wildfire, enough to make </span><a id="page-251"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.1">even the powerful bovoids and equinoids lie low, so nobody was looking down on me now.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.1">I was hoping things would end on a high note, but…</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">Soon after, an elder from the elven race and a few of his men arrived. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.2">I say elder, but he looked like a regular young man to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.3">No women were among them, which was kind of a shame, given how gorgeous lady elves tend to be.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.1">Elves, of course, had a reputation for living practically forever. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.2">Both they and dwarves were originally spirits brought to physical life (or fallen from higher planes of existence), who became fairies and were eventually granted material bodies. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.3">Apparently, you could trace the genealogy of goblins back to the fairies, too: Fairies bearing the earth element eventually became dwarves; those with the water element became merfolk; fire became goblins; and wind became elves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.4">Their ancestors were the results of fairies intermingling with creatures from other races long ago.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1">Apparently, goblins had little in the way of fairy blood left, which made their lives comparatively short. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.2">Even ogres, the next evolution up from them, only made it up to a hundred or so. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.3">When you got to ogre mage level, that reenergized the power from your spiritual ancestors, giving you skills that bordered on the divine.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">But back to elves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.2">Their lives were said to span between five and eight hundred years. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.3">Even elves with human blood mixed in could make it up to almost three hundred. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.4">This could vary a lot, though, since the more fairy blood you had in you, the longer you tended to live. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.5">Elves grew into maturity around the age of twenty, and beyond that, the passage of time simply did nothing to them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.6">Only when on death’s door did they suddenly begin to rapidly age, and in about twenty years, infirmity would finally take their lives.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">Staying young for a few centuries might sound like a dream to most humans. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.2">But another trait of theirs was how you never really saw them produce a lot of children. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.3">Living such long lives, they didn’t have much of a natural inclination to keep their bloodline going. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.4">That’s why they still numbered relatively few. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.5">(Bear in mind, of course, that I learned all this from the ladies at the Night </span><a id="page-252"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1">Butterfly, a nightclub in the Dwarven Kingdom I was well familiar with, so I couldn’t say how much of it was true.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">By the way, fairies themselves still existed—they were pretty common monsters, actually. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.2">These were smaller spirits given monster form by the effects of magicules around them; they were about the size of Ramiris and had a reputation as pranksters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.3">They had intelligence, but they couldn’t procreate and didn’t live long. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.4">The personification of a major spirit was a far cry from them, enough so to be classified as a different monster entirely.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1">Ramiris tended to be bunched in with these fairies, but she was actually something different. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.2">She was fallen from an upper-level existence known as a spirit queen, which meant she may’ve been higher up the evolutionary ladder than the ancestors of elves or dwarves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.3">It sounded like she went through an eternal pattern of reincarnation, although it didn’t seem like she understood the process herself too much…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1">…But I’ve gotten way off track. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.2">I lent an ear to the elder.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1">“It is an honor to lay eyes upon you,” he said with a salute. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.2">“We have come here today to celebrate you and offer our heartfelt gratitude…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.1">Normally, this would be the time when they’d offer their loyalty to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.2">Some of the races—the initial entries into the Federation—even expressed their thanks at their safety being guaranteed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.3">But this was the first time I had ever met this elder. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.4">I wasn’t sure what he had to thank me for, so I had Rigurd ask for me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.1">“Ah, that would be—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.1">As the elder put it, it had to do with the bad blood between the bovoids and equinoids. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.2">It turned out the biggest victims of their hundred-year war were the elves.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.1">According to him, elves, a race that lives off the blessings of the forest, fear the expansion of war zones more than anything else. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.2">To protect their hidden enclaves from outside enemies, the elves install “barriers” that scramble one’s sense of direction, but these barriers had fallen with the trees in the midst of the wars. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.3">Directional confusion didn’t mean much, after all, if the enclaves were in plain sight.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-253"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.1">They tried to move their settlements, keeping casualties as low as they could, but the war kept growing bigger and bigger. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.2">It made the forest’s animals and monsters flee for their lives, it razed the local fruits and vegetables before they could be harvested, and some elves even resorted to taking work in the Dwarven Kingdom. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.3">(I guess that was what the ladies at the Night Butterfly were up to.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.1">Over time, the loss of population grew to become a crisis, making it hard to keep the enclaves going. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.2">Some of the elves considered making yet another move elsewhere, but as large as the Forest of Jura is, it wasn’t that easy to find a suitable destination.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.1">“Thus,” the elder continued, “we considered appealing to those violent thugs to see if we could reach some kind of agreement. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.2">But before we could, my lord, the events of just now transpired. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.3">Now all we need is somewhere to move to…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.1">Hopefully, as he said, that would convince the elves who left to come back.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.1">This gave me an idea. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.2">Someplace to move to? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.3">Yeah, I got that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.4">Right here in town.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">There were fewer than three hundred elves in the forest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.2">At one point, there was a lot more, enough to build a prosperous kingdom in ancient times, but those glory years were long past. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.3">The elves were forced to turn nomadic, spreading to the four corners of the world—but regardless, I knew a place that could fit three hundred just fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.4">Remember that little forest I had just built down in Floor 95 of the Dungeon? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.5">There you go.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1">I could even put them to work—helping Apito run our honey operations, cultivating rare plants that only grew in magicule-rich forests, maybe running the inn I planned to open on Floor 95. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.2">They could run the weapon shop down there, and if any monsters appeared on that floor (not that I expected it), it’d be great for this town to have a little elven protection. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.3">I heard that elves and treants got along well, so I doubted Treyni or the others would be against this.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1">Plus, with all the jobs on offer, I figured it’d help attract the more distant elves back here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.2">Maybe the ladies from that nightclub would venture back, too—and then I could build an elf-run VIP room down there, maybe…?!</span></p>
<p><a id="page-254"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.2">This was excellent. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.3">There was already a tavern in town, but that was more of a gastropub geared for adventurers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.4">If you wanted someplace for a quiet drink and relaxation, you’d have to go to our administration-exclusive dining halls. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.5">I’m sure Shuna would be glad to serve me in my own room, but I didn’t need alcohol </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1"> badly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.2">I’m just talking about, you know, taking a breather. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.3">It’s not that having Shuna around would make it impossible to relax or anything—or impossible to BS with Gobta, or have private discussions with Mjöllmile, or whatever.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1">…No, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">really</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">!</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1">I’m just saying, if we had something like the Night Butterfly on the ninety-fifth floor, it’d be useful for a lot of different situations.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">I decided to offer this idea to the elder at once. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.2">“Elder, I think I know someplace that’d be able to accept you…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">When Rigurd realized I was speaking, he took a step back and listened. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.2">I don’t how he got trained to do it, but he could calmly handle just about any situation by this point. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.3">If I ever went off script during an event like this, he could keep up without any blank stares. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.4">I loved that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">“Ah! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.2">You do, Lord Rimuru?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">“Mm-hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.2">If it’s about three hundred of you, we’d be able to fit you all in…”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1">“…Thank you so much! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.2">I will inform my people of this the moment I return.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">“Great. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.2">I’ll get it all set up so it’s available for move-in when you’re ready. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.3">But do you mind if I ask a favor in return?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1">“Of course not, my lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.2">If our powers can be of help to you, nothing could make us happier!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">The elven elder was even happier about it than I thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.2">It’d save them from having to wander the forest in search of a safe haven, which I’m sure came as a relief. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.3">It sounded like he was sending an envoy over right now to get people ready.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1">So now we had elves moving into our labyrinth.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-255"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1">I figured that was the end of the conversation, but one thing did concern me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.2">The elder mentioned that elves had been leaving their enclave to work and not coming back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.3">With a race as tightly knit as the elves, it seemed odd to me that any of them would abandon their homeland. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.4">Some elves even reportedly went out hunting and never returned, which disturbed me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.1">Elves could be very individualistic by nature, the elder said, so perhaps a passing whim drove them away from home. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.2">But then I remembered what I heard in Mjöllmile’s shop—the proposal from Viscount Cazac of Englesia. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.3">A place that dealt in elven slaves, wasn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.1">Maybe it wasn’t a matter of these younger elves </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.1">choosing</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.1"> not to go back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.2">If my hunch about the criminal group Cazac was fronting turned out to be true… Well, hopefully it wasn’t, but if it was, that would be a big problem.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.1">My dream of launching an elf nightclub was so close at hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.2">Seeing the elder off after we said our goodbyes, I thought that I’d better investigate this thoroughly.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.1">Thus, I gave Soei behind me a Thought Communication message.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.1">(Soei, I want you to investigate a man named Viscount Cazac in Blumund.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">(Yes, my lord!)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1">In a moment, he sent out a Replication of himself, beginning his work at once. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.2">That should be enough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.3">He’d probably find something out before my audiences were over.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.1">I’ll probably want to ask Mjöllmile what he knows about criminal slave merchants, too.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.1"> If it turns out Cazac’s involved, there’d be no mercy for him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.2">It was an affront to the deep love I had for elves—a love that drove me to open my very own elven nightclub. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.3">I wasn’t about to let anyone keep me from that dream.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.1">Geld had taken some time off, which let him return to Tempest a few days ago, and Diablo and Hakuro also arrived back the previous day.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.1">Diablo was buttering me up once more, punctuating the flattery with his usual ominous snickering. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.2">There was nothing “dignified” about a slime, so I reasoned that he probably needed glasses or something. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.3">I wanted a report from him, but that could wait—which disappointed him, but I needed to keep today free for an important discussion.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.1">That</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1"> was how major today’s visitor was to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.2">No letting my guard down around them, that’s for sure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.3">As I saw it, it’d be my toughest audience yet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.4">That was why I had my whole crew in attendance for today’s sessions.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1">Right now, this entourage was being welcomed into town by Benimaru, my right-hand man. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.2">(This should also say something about how crucial this was to me.) Already, on the other side of the door, I could sense a violent force approaching like a tidal wave. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.3">The rumors, I realized, were true.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">The door opened, revealing a posse clad in full armor. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.2">These were the tengu, an independent force residing in the Khusha Mountains on the horizon of the Forest of Jura—outside my jurisdiction. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.3">While Benimaru had met with them once before, this was less of an audience and more of a summit between two factions.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.1">Standing in front of this armored crew was a beautiful young woman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.2">The tengu were humanoids known for their almost comically long noses, but this girl looked like any normal human. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.3">Tengu, bearing the same name as the figures of Japanese mythology, were apparently a hybrid species between angels and wolfmen—</span></p>

<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-257"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.1">Right—a type of incarnation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.2">That.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1">Wolfmen were a type of beastman—a proud, isolated race who held an almost divine presence in people’s minds. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.2">Thus, calling the tengu long-nosed was often more a metaphor than anything else, a way of referring to the supernatural sense of smell they boasted.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">Now then, for this species worshipped as the gods of the mountains—</span></p>

<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">Um, sure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.2">Right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.3">Honestly, I don’t really follow it all, but anyway, a bunch of crazy-powerful gods decided to create a bunch of crazy-powerful wolfmen, and then an angel incarnated themself in one, creating a new sentient species. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.4">The single individual that led to this species was the tengu elder—the mother of the girl before me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.5">And since creating all these children apparently weakened the elder to the point of powerlessness, this girl was essentially the tengu leader.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.1">This is why it’s more accurate to call this a summit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.2">And not even </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1"> fully described how important this meeting was.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.1">Benimaru had come to the tengu’s domain once. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.2">They had been kind to us at times, permitting the migration of high orcs through their territory, but they were also proud, and if I floated the idea of enforcing my rule over the mountains to them, it’d almost certainly result in war.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.1">I, of course, didn’t want that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.2">I didn’t see any need to fight this race revered as mountain gods. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.3">Benimaru understood that, so he was on strict instructions to just get their permission to build a highway on their lands between Tempest and Thalion.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.1">“The negotiations went successfully,” Benimaru had said when he later reported back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.2">“Everything went well with them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.3">Not even </span><a id="page-258"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.1">the tengu can afford to ignore you, Sir Rimuru, so they mentioned plans to come see you sometime.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.1">The news sounded good, but Benimaru looked exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.1">“You sure there weren’t any problems?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.1">“No, not exactly, but…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.1">He was dodging the question. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.2">And Alvis, whom I sent along with him, had seemed off her game—or at the very least, miffed about something—ever since she got back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.3">It seemed like something I was better off not asking about.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.1">So I decided to force it out of Benimaru anyway—in private, over a few drinks, since he didn’t seem interested in telling the rest of our administration about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.2">The way he described it…</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.1">Benimaru had headed over to the tengu’s hidden homeland with Alvis and a dozen or so members of Team Kurenai. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.2">The journey over went smoothly, but in front of a cave near the peak of the Khusha Mountains, they were stopped by a young tengu warrior, dressed in white with a katana on his belt. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.3">On his back were two white wings, and he also bore a tail and doglike triangular ears.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.1">Based on the refinement of his posture, he was clearly trained in battle, Benimaru thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.2">Speaking with him, they asked for permission to go through the “barrier” placed within the cave. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.3">The warrior agreed but allowed only Benimaru and Alvis to follow him inside.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.1">On the other side, they found a flowery paradise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.2">It was neither hot nor cold, the temperature always pleasant—a beautiful land, befitting the powerful race who called it home. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.3">In the courtyard they were taken to, Benimaru was greeted by a beautiful woman—one who looked human, unlike any of the other tengu. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.4">Her hair came down to her shoulders, pure white at the roots and fading into a crimson red around her ears. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.5">Her small, soft lips were the color of cherry blossoms, but her long, sharp eyes were the eyes of a wolf, watching Benimaru like a beast sizing up its prey.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1">Benimaru realized he couldn’t let his guard down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.2">The </span><a id="page-259"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1">commanding presence she had over the room was reminiscent of the demon lord Carillon—or perhaps even stronger than that.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.1">Benimaru didn’t know a great deal about it, either, apart from my vague description of boring a hole into the mountain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.2">In fact, the idea had already been shot down by my team. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.3">A tunnel would be the shortest route between Tempest and the Thalion capital, but the highway would only lead to the nearest large town on the Thalion border, so no tunnel was strictly needed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.4">Benimaru knew that, but he wanted to bring up the concept in his negotiations regardless.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.1">“A tunnel involves digging a hole in the mountain to allow passage through to the other side. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.2">If you do not wish to permit this, we will not—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.1">“Wait. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.2">Dig a hole in the mountain? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.3">Are you quite serious?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.1">“I am. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.2">That’s what the project plan called for. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.3">But no tunnel is necessary for the route we have now, so I only wanted to ask in case it </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.1">does</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.1"> become necessary in the future. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.2">If you don’t like it, I will not force the question.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.1">To a race who treats the mountains as divinity, digging a hole through one was seen as anathema.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.1">“That is </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.1">very</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.1"> ill-advised. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.2">You are free to let a slime become a </span><a id="page-260"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.1">demon lord, but as long as you do not interfere with us, I see no harm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.2">I am even willing to shut my eyes to that slavering half-snake you’ve brought along with you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.3">But if you wish to make a mockery of our glorious mountains—that I cannot abide.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.1">As if to prove the point, Momiji stood up.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.466.1">Benimaru had no intention of making an issue out of this, but now it seemed like the discussion was over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.466.2">Had he failed? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.466.3">He stayed in his seat, reasoning that any reaction would force the other side to up the ante—but not everyone was willing to remain silent.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.467.1">“A slavering half-snake? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.467.2">Are you talking about me?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.468.1">A fuming Alvis leaped out of her chair instead, staring Momiji down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.468.2">The two seemed ready to come to blows at any moment.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.1">“Whoa, stop—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.1">Just as Benimaru spoke, Alvis’s eyes met Momiji’s. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.2">Her extra skill Snake Eyes could cause paralysis, poison, insanity, and many other ailments. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.3">But none of that fazed Momiji.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.1">“Such a silly move,” she said as she took out a folding fan with both hands. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.2">“Mere status ailments won’t work on the daughter of the tengu elder.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.1">Tengu are half-spiritual life-forms and as such bear a high resistance to status ailments. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.2">In addition, Momiji had the extra skill Godwolf Sense on at all times, giving her information beyond what her five senses provided—a sort of powered-up version of Magic Sense that picked up on illusions and illusory magic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.3">Thus, sneak attacks like that didn’t work on her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.1">Then it was Momiji’s turn. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.2">She brought her fan down on Alvis in a sort of dance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.3">Alvis blocked the first blow with her golden staff, but the second one hit her on the side and sent her flying to the far end of the open-air courtyard.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.1">“Kffhh…?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.1">Momiji’s moves were simple but refined. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.2">The blow had shut the fan; now she reopened it, elegantly hiding her lips with it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.1">“Are you done? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.2">I see the Lycanthropeers are all bark and no bite.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.1">“You better not rile me, country girl. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.2">I went easy on you because we were here to negotiate, but perhaps I didn’t need to?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.3">replied Alvis, her pride hurt.</span></p>
