<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">“Sure! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">No problem!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">She was already hopping to it. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Next time I stop by, I’ll bring in some of the metal ore we have in storage around town.</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">As I schemed internally, the magicules gradually began to distribute themselves around the Dungeon, just as planned. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">Most floors still didn’t have walls or internal structures, so there was nothing stopping them from diffusing into every corner of the labyrinth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">The magicule count on Floor 50, even, still surpassed what you saw in the deepest part of the Sealed Cave.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Now we’d just have to wait for monsters to start appearing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">At this rate, I could expect some real juggernauts.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Veldora spent the rest of the day releasing his magic and chilling dragon-style in his lair, and the next day, I brought Beretta and Treyni with me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“Ah, Rimuru,” he purred to me, “last night was the most enjoyable one for me in ages.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">“Kwah-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">Oh, I understand.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1"> he? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">I wasn’t sure, but I had to take him at his word.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">Discussing matters like this would be awkward, so I had him go into human form for a moment as I explained the current situation to Beretta and Treyni. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">I wanted to get right to work, but before that, I needed to make one final check with Beretta.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“Beretta, you swore to Guy that you’d serve Ramiris, correct? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">You still feel the same way now?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">He gave me a surprised look. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">I wondered if, under the mask, his expression actually changed a bit.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-188"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“…Sir Rimuru, I apologize if this is rude, but as I stated before, I wish to serve both you and Lady Ramiris.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“Yeah, I remember, but doesn’t that go against what you promised Guy?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“…It does. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">I was alone at the time, and—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“No, no, don’t worry about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">Ramiris wound up here in town anyway, just like you wanted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">She’s gonna help run this labyrinth for a while, and I expect you’ll be happy to help us out, right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">“Of course!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“Great, then serving her is pretty much the same as serving me anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">I had been thinking about this ever since I heard about that—the idea of having Beretta just switch his allegiances to Ramiris, if he wanted to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">That’s what he promised Guy, likely the strongest of all demon lords, and I don’t think Guy appreciated people who broke their promises to him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“If that is what you wish,” he briskly replied, “then I will work under Lady Ramiris.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Wow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Everything turned out the way he wanted, didn’t it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">Ah well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.4">I wonder where he learned to scheme like that…</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Understood. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">The answer, of course—</span></em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">I didn’t need to hear that. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">Raphael just doesn’t let up, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">Who does it think it is? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">Ugh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.4">Maybe Raphael’s the real schemer here.</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">…</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">It sounded a bit sulky about that, but I wasn’t about to start caring.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">“Excellent. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">From now on, Beretta, you will work as Ramiris’s servant!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“And her servant I shall be, but I still remember the great debt I owe to you, Sir Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">If you seek anything from me at any time, please, just say the word.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“I will. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">Thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">I then undid the master lock set in Beretta’s core, handing the </span><a id="page-189"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">role over to Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">With that, I could only take credit for creating him from now on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">I’d get to give him orders again if something happened to Ramiris, but otherwise, Ramiris was his sole master. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.4">That came as a relief. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.5">Now Guy had nothing to whine at me about, and I could certainly trust Beretta to keep Ramiris safe.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">Besides, this labyrinth was proving useful in many more ways than I originally guessed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">On the surface, it was advertising to get adventurers to visit town. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">Underneath, it helped Veldora let off steam—and generate the massive magicule counts needed to turn metal ore into magisteel ore as a byproduct of the process. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.4">The maze would be a great springboard for future research into the nature of magicules, and all in all, this was a much more vital asset for Tempest than I thought at first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.5">Treyni protecting this asset alone made me nervous, so having Beretta around put my mind very much at ease.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">As for Ramiris herself, the new master of Beretta… Well, this sudden event was making her weep tears of joy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“My little Beretta, now my full proper servant…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">Now I’m no longer all by my lonesome forever…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“Um, Lady Ramiris, you have me as well?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">“Oh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">Yes, I do, Treyni! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">We’re turning into a really big family now!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">She loved the concept, darting around and flying circles around Beretta. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">Treyni watched on with a warm smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">Being alone must’ve pained that demon lord for a long time, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.4">Her “family” was just two people, still, but it must’ve been big enough by her standards?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">The sight worried me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">I could rely on Treyni well enough, but she spoiled Ramiris </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">way</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1"> too much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">It’d be a tough job, I knew, but I wanted Beretta to be the one “sane” person keeping this crew together. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">He had his conniving side as well, but I was sure he wouldn’t let me down.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“Beretta, don’t worry about me as much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">Take care of Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">Protecting her is job one for you now.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“Yes sir! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">I swear it on my life!”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">I’ll trust him on that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">He’s trustworthy enough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">Ramiris and Treyni alone might find it rough going, managing all the monsters we’ll find in this maze—with Beretta around, all problems are solved.</span></em></p>
<p><a id="page-190"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">This was perfect. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Veldora and I watched as Ramiris carried on with her little happy dance—silly, but charming in a way.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">With the master-servant relationship set in stone, Beretta was now immortal inside Ramiris’s labyrinth, no Resurrection Bracelet necessary. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">The same was true of Treyni. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.3">Resurrection Bracelets and return whistles were temporarily infused with Ramiris’s skills, but as her servants, the two had no use for those items at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.4">They were free to revive themselves at any of the pre-positioned save points available, so they wouldn’t be flung out of the labyrinth after every death. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.5">In addition, they could teleport, more or less, between any save point in the Dungeon.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">In some ways, it felt like Ramiris’s Mazecraft was more beneficial to her servants than herself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">I mean, being able to resurrect yourself as many times as you like… That’s downright scary. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">She had only two people working for her now, but what if that number started going up? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.4">The labyrinth was going to be teeming with monsters shortly; if she had full control over them, they’d be a virtual army for Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.5">There wouldn’t be any calling her a pip-squeak then—not without serious consequences! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.6">And oh man, what if </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">they</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1"> had the immortal attribute, too? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">You just couldn’t downplay this threat.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">Really, in terms of the defense it offered, Ramiris’s skill couldn’t be more superior. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">People just never worried about it because, you know, this was Ramiris we’re talking about. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">No big problem—just a lovable, lonely, tiny pixie. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.4">I’m sure she’d never even think of commanding an unstoppable army of invincible monsters or anything. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.5">Probably.</span></p>
