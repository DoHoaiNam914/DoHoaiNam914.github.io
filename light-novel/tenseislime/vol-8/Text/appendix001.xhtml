<p class="noindent">Thanks for your patience. Volume 8 is finally here.</p>
<p>I think at least some of you have already read the web-series version of this content—it’s actually part of the Demon Capital Opens arc. Why did the title of this volume change? Well, there’s a good story behind that…</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Don’t worry! I promise I’ll keep it nice and compact this time!”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard that one before. I don’t bother worrying much about the length by this point.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">That’s how I kicked off this volume, and then when the deadline drew closer…</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Um, we need to talk.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, what is it?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s starting to get a little long, actually…”</p>
<p>“It is, huh? I figured as much.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">My editor, Mr. I, was wholly unmoved. But my turn wasn’t over yet!</p>
<p class="space-break1">“Could we make this a two-volume story arc?”</p>
<p><a id="page-296"></a>“Huhhh?!”</p>
<p>“Because I could write a hundred more pages, and it’ll still end in kind of a half-assed position. How about we shake things up and go with a two-parter?”</p>
<p>“No! Why’d it come down to this?!”</p>
<p class="space-break1">It was a very heartwarming conversation, one that ended with Mr. I’s eyes rolling all the way back inside his head.</p>

<p class="tx1">So yeah. I have some regrets.</p>
<p>Not even I am entirely sure why it turned out like this, but lately I’ve started to think it’s a little impossible to condense this story. Thus, I’m working hard to finish up the Demon Capital Opens arc in Volume 9. I’m trying to make sure this doesn’t turn into a trilogy, so I hope you’ll come along for the ride.</p>
<p>See you in the next volume!</p>
