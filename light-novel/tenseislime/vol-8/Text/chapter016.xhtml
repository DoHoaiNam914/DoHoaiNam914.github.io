<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">I would listen to Ramiris’s and Treyni’s excuses later. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">I wanted to learn more from Beretta, but he didn’t have much else to offer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">They showed up here, Treyni brought in wood, and Beretta fashioned it into the log hut before me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.4">Apparently, they had been interrupted just as he began work on a terrace in front of the door. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.5">This hut was meant to be the entrance to a new labyrinth.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">It certainly wasn’t the first time Ramiris had demonstrated a desire to move here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">This hut—which served as an entrance to her full residence—was all the real estate she really needed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">“Okay. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">So you tried building it here, and the gate guard stopped you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">He was getting in your way, so you commanded Treyni to put him to sleep, and then Gobkyuu and these other craftsmen spotted you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">Do I have this right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">“Um… No, that’s not… Well, not </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">exactly</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1"> the case, I don’t think… Maybe?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“Okay, so I do. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">Ramiris…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">“Um… Ha-ha-ha-ha…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">Ramiris must not know the meaning of the word </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">no</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">She knew this was my territory, as recognized by the other demon lords, and that what she did was tantamount to staging an invasion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.3">If war broke out over this, she’d have nothing to whine about.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">But I paused a moment to think it over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">Having this hut presented to me gave me an idea. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">Perhaps I should encourage this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.4">Maybe give her permission to make a labyrinth here, even.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">My conversation with Mjöllmile flashed before my eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">We needed attractions that’d keep visitors coming again and again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">These could be theaters, arenas, health spas, you name it, but I was still fishing around for other ideas. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.4">Do the same thing enough times, and you’re bound to get bored. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.5">We wouldn’t hold daily arena battles—I figured the tournaments would be more seasonal, maybe four a year. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.6">We could hold beginner-level matches daily, like with horse racing, but I didn’t see that attracting the connoisseurs among </span><a id="page-156"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">the nobility. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">We’d mainly be appealing to mass audiences—or maybe the adventurers stopping by.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">If this town turned into the trade mecca I was planning, waves of merchants would be visiting, with adventurers serving as bodyguards. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">I wanted Tempest to turn into a base of operations for people like that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">Adventurers could make money in assorted ways, one being monster hunting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.4">Perhaps we could build a labyrinth for them and release some monsters inside? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.5">Would that attract a decent amount of daily traffic? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.6">A labyrinth is a dungeon, after all; if we invited people to help clear it out, that might attract adventurers with a completist bent.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">This could work.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">I looked at Ramiris, still smiling awkwardly up at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">I wasn’t too sure—okay, I was </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">completely</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1"> sure I couldn’t trust her, but maybe we could make something out of this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">It was time to talk things over.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">First, I asked Gobkyuu’s craftsmen to dismantle the hut for me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">Since we already had the materials and everything, I decided to have it relocated for use as a break room for the gate guards.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Next, it was time for a strategic conference. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">We filed into the usual meeting hall, Gobkyuu in tow.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“Um, what is going to be the, er, happening to us?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Ramiris’s anxiety was making her less and less coherent. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Her eyes were fixed on me now, gauging my temper.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“You don’t have to be so nervous. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">If you’re trying to be polite, you’re failing miserably.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">I didn’t intend to </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">do</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1"> anything to her, no. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">If she was willing to accept my offer, I was willing to overlook her excessively bold overtures. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">But before that, we had to go over a few things.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">“Gobkyuu, I was thinking we could build an emergency shelter space under the arena. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">Is that possible?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">“I’m not sure it’d be safe to have one directly under the arena stage, no matter how we try to work out the structural calculations. </span><a id="page-157"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Any empty space under the floor would cause a cave-in at the first shock wave. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">But if we move this space a little, I think we can avoid that problem.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">I’d also like to have a door built down there.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“…?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“A door, sir?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“Right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Make it thick and heavy—and maybe put a bunch of carved stone tablets around the frame and stuff. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">It needs to look foreboding.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“Would there be another shelter beyond the door?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“Nah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">No need for that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">We just need the door, is all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.4">Right, Ramiris?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“R-Rimuru?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Are, are you saying that—that…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Gobkyuu was questioning my sanity, while Ramiris buzzed happily in the air next to him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">My proposal was simple. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">Basically, I wanted to have Ramiris build a dungeon and let her manage it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">If she was gonna build an entrance in a simple wood hut, better to give her something that looked more the part instead, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.4">And given how all good dungeons extend deep underground, having it beneath a battle arena just seemed right to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.5">We could use the arena to train rookies during the off days, and I planned to have a potion shop on the premises. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.6">If we ran a dungeon on-site as well, I bet a tavern for adventurers looking for a quick pint on the way back from work would be a big hit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.7">We’d make money off them, and Ramiris would have a home, a job, and a little spending money from me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.8">It’d require mutual cooperation from both of us, but I thought it was a pretty neat idea.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">Once I finished explaining all this, Ramiris burst into a flurry of shouting.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“Wh-what?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">So—so do you mean that, maybe, not only could I build a labyrinth and live here, but you’ll even give me a full-fledged </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">job</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“I guess so, if you’re willing to accept that.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“Huh?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">Okay, okay, so you’re saying that, uh, I no longer have to be the ‘jobless shut-in’ people accuse me of being?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">The proposal must’ve been a big shock. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">She opened her eyes wide, babbling on like she had been struck by lightning. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">“I’m so glad, </span><a id="page-158"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">Lady Ramiris,” Treyni whispered, eyes welling up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">Beretta, oddly enough, seemed to be smiling at me—I wondered if that fatigue I felt before was just an act. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.3">Did he </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">want</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1"> this? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Maybe, maybe not, but either way, if he’s happy, no worries.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">After calming down a bit, Ramiris swallowed nervously. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">“Um… And you’ll give me an allowance as well?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">she carefully asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.4">“Do you really mean that?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">She must’ve been afraid I’d take it back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">I’d never do that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">I’m not </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1"> much of a sadist. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">Although, I couldn’t give her an exact figure on her allowance yet, since that depended on sales proceeds. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.3">Better put her mind at ease for now.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">“I really mean it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">But I don’t know how much profit we’ll make until we get things going. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">How about we say you get twenty percent of the profits after I deduct advertising expenses, rent, and other needed expenses?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">“How, er, how much do you think that would add up to?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">“Well, if we can attract, say, a thousand adventurers in a day, that could net you as much as two gold coins, maybe?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">“Gahhh!! </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">That</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1"> much?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">“That’s just an estimate, keep in mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">There’s no guarantee it’ll work out that way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.3">None of what I say means anything until we see some real, paying customers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.4">But if you’re planning to live here anyway, it’s not a bad deal for you, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">Ramiris bobbed her head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">If she was going to squat on my property either way, she’d be maintaining her labyrinth no matter what I told her to do. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.3">It’d be smarter for her to listen to my offer, for sure—it’d grant her permission to stay </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">and</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1"> be a way to make money. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">Really, she only had one choice.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">Thus, she latched on to my head and did a little dance of joy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">I took that as a yes, and I was sure Beretta and Treyni wouldn’t complain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.3">In fact, they were smiling at Ramiris, who was currently busy tripping off to her own little world.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">“Eh-heh-heh… I’m gonna be filthy rich now! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">No more ungrateful bums calling me a deadbeat and a destitute demon lord!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">Ah well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">No harm in that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.3">It’d certainly do nothing to damage the faith her two servants had in her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.4">Her sheer enthusiasm for the </span><a id="page-159"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">offer made me wonder just how often she had been picked on in the past. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">She was more excited than I was about it, so I doubt I had to worry about compliance.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">What’s with her obsession over money, though? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">I didn’t think a lust for riches was a common trait for a demon lord, myself excluded. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.3">Was her lack of a decent job the main issue? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.4">Her labyrinth wasn’t exactly teeming with visitors. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.5">She must have been lonely, with way too much free time on her hands. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.6">It’d be great if we could attract crowds of adventurers to this dungeon—for my sake, as well as hers.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">We better work out a plan of action fast.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">Calling Ramiris back from her mental head trip, I decided to have her help rework our arena plans with Gobkyuu.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">The way I saw it, we should expand the open area outside the western gate, where the highway ended, and build the arena there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">There was ample pasture space for travelers’ horses, as well as a vast tract of empty land to work with.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">Sometime in the future, I’d like to lay rails on top of the highway and run trains up and down it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">Ever since I decided to target noble customers for this, I had been considering what to do about our transportation issues. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.3">If I could guarantee safe passage for them, I thought it’d be much easier to attract richer tourists. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.4">But that wasn’t the only goal. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.5">A rail system would make it possible to transport vast amounts of goods in one go, improving convenience and greatly contributing to town development.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">That was what I had in mind for the town’s future expansion, so I wanted a spot for the arena that wouldn’t get in the way later on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">I could establish a rail station near the spot, hopefully within an hour’s walk of the gate—any farther would be asking a lot from our tourists. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">Having the arena within walking distance of town also made it possible to offer more hotel options in a smaller area. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.4">Unlike my old world, people here did a lot of their traveling by foot. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.5">If a journey was up to around six miles round trip, most folks wouldn’t hesitate to hoof it, so a little distance wasn’t a daunting obstacle.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Those were my thoughts behind my proposal for a location, but Ramiris had other ideas.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-160"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">“Why, though? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">Didn’t you have empty space within town limits?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">“Yes, but it’s occupied by beastman refugees right now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">We have streets of temporary housing laid out for them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.3">I can’t build an arena over that.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">“No,” added Gobkyuu, “we can’t throw the beastmen out of town. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">I think development will have to wait until after Sir Geld completes work on the new Eurazanian capital.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">“Okay, well, how about we just move them into my labyrinth? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">I could transplant the entire layout of that area inside it, so it wouldn’t be too much of a burden on them.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">That sounded, to be frank, absolutely bonkers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">Gobkyuu and I exchanged glances, unsure we were hearing correctly.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">“Er, you mean we’d move the inhabitants in there as well?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">“Um, I can’t move living things around without permission, no. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">They’d need to willingly go in there for me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.3">But anything inanimate or unconscious? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.4">I can whisk it all right over, no prob!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">“Are you serious? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">So you can move all the beastmen’s houses and belongings inside your labyrinth anytime you want?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">“Yep! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">You got it!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">She sounded proud of it, as she should. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">That’s the kind of skill anyone deserved to brag about.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">Pressing her for more detail, I learned that this was Mazecraft, one of Ramiris’s intrinsic skills. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">As the name suggested, it basically made Ramiris the supreme god of any labyrinth she created. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">It worked over astonishing distances, too, even affecting people and things near the maze entrance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.4">She could even take the weapons and armor off people close by.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">It was a crazy power to think of, but it did have its limits. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">If the target’s equipment had its own consciousness—a sword infused with its user’s magic, for example—Ramiris couldn’t affect it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.3">You weren’t exactly stumbling over sentient objects like that every day, though, so if you picked a fight with Ramiris, you’d better be prepared to get stripped naked first thing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.4">Maybe she really </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1"> deserve the demon lord moniker.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">“Wow… I mean, honestly, I thought you had, like, zero ability to defend yourself in battle.”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-161"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">“Sheesh, way to be super-mean! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">You’re talking to the woman they call the strongest demon lord in the world!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">“C’mon, Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">Calm down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.3">Tell me what else you can do with it!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Upon further prodding, she revealed some more details behind her abilities. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">Essentially, I had five questions for her:</span></p>
<div class="top">
<p class="nl-list"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">1. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">How many floors down can you build your underground labyrinths?</span></p>
<p class="nl-list"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">2. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">How many days do you need to build them?</span></p>
<p class="nl-list"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">3. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">What kind of monsters are inside?</span></p>
<p class="nl-list"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">4. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">Can you change their internal structure at will?</span></p>
<p class="nl-list"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">5. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.2">What happens if someone dies in there?</span></p>
</div>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">For a change, Ramiris gave me sincere answers to all of them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">For question one, there was no strict floor limit, but realistically speaking, she could max them out at around a hundred.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">As for question two, one floor takes approximately an hour to complete. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">This figure remained steady for subsequent floors, so a hundred-floor labyrinth took around a hundred hours to complete. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.3">Any floors beyond that consumed exponentially greater sums of magical energy, hence the answer to question number one.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">For question three, you wouldn’t find monsters, let alone insects or other creatures, just arbitrarily inhabiting a labyrinth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">Her previous labyrinth had “monsters” in the form of spirits—spirits who remained as part of the floor structure, partitioned off from the physical world but able to come and go as they pleased.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">However, it was possible to “seed” a labyrinth with monsters for adventurers to test their skill against. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">Fill a maze with magicules, and monsters would spring to life from them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.3">Adjusting the labyrinth’s magicule density made it easy to predict the strength of the monsters who resulted, as well as restrict monsters to a certain floor or floors. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.4">That made it possible to fine-tune a labyrinth’s difficulty level with some precision. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.5">I had an idea of how this magicule infusion process worked, so I’d give that some thought once I had the right container for it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">Regarding question four, the sheer power of Ramiris’s Mazecraft </span><a id="page-162"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">skill meant she could change the entire structure of a floor in about an hour, although floors could not be edited for twenty-four hours after the last revamping.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">There were conditions, of course. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">She couldn’t make something—plants or other organic matter, for example—out of nothing, so structural changes would chiefly result in staid-looking mazes of blank walls. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.3">However, if you simply wanted to redecorate a floor with some materials at hand instead of changing its structure, that wasn’t too terribly difficult.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">It was also simple enough, by the way, to rearrange a labyrinth’s floor order. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">This, too, was set in stone for twenty-four hours afterward, but that made it no less useful a tool.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">And last but not least, question five. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">Astonishingly, this depended entirely on Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.3">If she was keeping tabs on things, she could snap her fingers and resurrect the dead inside her labyrinth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.4">I was just wondering how she handled the corpses of monsters and hapless adventurers, but this sounded like nothing short of voodoo to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.5">Apparently, she wasn’t sure what happened to monsters born inside the labyrinth, since she had no examples to work with yet, but she had already resurrected quite a few adventurers in the past.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">This was why she emphasized not being able to move organic creatures inside “without permission” earlier. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">This “permission” was nothing too formal; what mattered was that the subject in question knew he or she was </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">going into</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1"> the labyrinth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">Without that understanding, any visitors would be refused entry. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.3">In other words, when I went into Ramiris’s labyrinth a while back, that was because I actively tried to do so. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.4">If I was carrying a sleeping companion on my back as I ventured inside, we would’ve been blown back at the entrance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.5">(One exception to this was infants. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.6">Children young enough to not have their own free will yet were essentially treated as “things” by this rule.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">You </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">could</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1"> drag someone kicking and screaming into a labyrinth, but only at a great burden to Ramiris, so it was impossible if she resisted you at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">“You wouldn’t want to try it,” is how she put it to me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">So there you have it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">Essentially, anyone who goes into a labyrinth </span><a id="page-163"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">was under the tyrannical rule of Ramiris—something they agreed to the moment they stepped through the entrance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">If they accepted the rules, Ramiris would keep careful tabs on their status.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">“And you </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">know</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1"> how much we like playing pranks, don’t you?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">she said, puffing out her chest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.3">“I just like surprising people and seeing their reactions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.4">If they died, you know, that’d kind of weigh on my conscience. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.5">So I do what I can to keep ’em alive and set them back on their way.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">Sometimes, there’d be an unlucky subject who really did die on Ramiris, but it sounded like those deaths occurred outside of her labyrinth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">At the very least, she didn’t want to kill </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">me</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1"> when I was in there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">That golem who looked ready to stomp me to oblivion was only there because she knew she could fix me up, good as new, if called to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.3">That made sense to me, although it seemed to lower the stakes of what I went through quite a bit.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">“So if a band of adventurers goes in on a monster-hacking run, you can revive them if they die?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">“Yep! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">Once they’re booted out of the labyrinth, I can resurrect them like nothing happened. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.3">It’s a bit tougher if we’re talking a whole party at once, though, so we might need to send them in with some of my revival equipment.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">Equip a specified item from her Mazecraft labyrinth, and dying would just transport you back outside intact. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">That solved my safety concerns, which was really the biggest problem.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">“Excellent! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">That’s wonderful, Ramiris!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">“R-really? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">You mean it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.3">I’m really that great, aren’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">“You sure are! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">Our ambitions are as good as accomplished!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">“They are? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">Yeah, they are! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.3">I was just thinking that myself!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">We looked at each other and nodded.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">“I’ll be counting on you, Ramiris.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">“And I’ll hold up my end of the bargain! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">It’ll be nothing but smooth sailing ahead!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">Smooth sailing, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">Hopefully the boat isn’t made out of mud. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.3">We couldn’t shake on the deal, given our size difference, but I think our minds were linked up well enough anyway.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">Accepting Ramiris’s offer, we decided to build the battle arena in the empty space on the southeast side of town, a dungeon spread out beneath it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">Our theater, meanwhile, would be put up on the northwest side, near where all our high-end spa facilities were. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.2">We had actually put up a gym, a museum, and so forth among all the luxury lodging over there, so all we really had to do was refurbish a previously built structure for the purpose.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">So the dungeon and theater were in place, but we still had no arena. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">Geld wasn’t around, but I’m sure I could rely on Gobkyuu and his crew. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.3">With them, we’d doubtlessly have something in place by the Founder’s Festival—</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">“I’m not sure we can do this, Sir Rimuru.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">Oh, no? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.2">Yeah, guess not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.3">I mean, any normal project like this would require several years of work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.4">Asking for a finished arena in a month or so was kind of insane. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.5">Even with monster-level muscle on our side, I wasn’t so sure we could do it, either.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">“Yeah… All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">Let me lend a hand, then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.3">I’ll help move dirt around and process the metal infrastructure.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">I may not look it, but I </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1"> used to work for a general contractor. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">I didn’t have </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1"> much on-the-field construction experience, but with what I learned imitating the veterans, I wasn’t a total amateur. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">Besides, I had Raphael.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">“Me too! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.2">Let me help!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">“In that case, allow me to help, too.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">“As you wish, Lady Ramiris.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">I suppose that meant I had the support of Ramiris and Beretta and Treyni, too.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">Let’s get right to work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.2">I opened up my blueprints among the tents that lined the area.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">“Hmm… All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.2">I don’t see a problem with this.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">“Great. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">Better explain things to your beastmen, then.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">A lot of our nation’s beastmen were out working on remote </span><a id="page-165"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">projects, so I decided to give Alvis and Sufia the full explanation for now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">We would meet together this evening.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">“If that is what you seek, Sir Rimuru, it shall be done.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">“It sure will. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.2">We’ve got no right to complain!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">Once I explained my whole plan to them, they accepted with surprising speed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">They also stated that I wouldn’t need to explain it again to the other beastmen.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">“Um, really?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">“Sure, Sir Rimuru,” Sufia said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.2">“You’ve given us all food to eat and a place to stay. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.3">We’d all be glad to help out with building this arena or whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">“Besides,” Alvis added, “I hear that Sir Carillon will be involved in the festival you’re holding. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.2">We all would be delighted to help you out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.3">I am a tad under the weather, so I will leave the rest to you, Sufia.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">“You got it!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">So Sufia would lead the beastmen on this job—and once that was decided, things proceeded at blazing speed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.2">One order from Sufia was all it took to get the beastmen out of their tents. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.3">As they all lined up in formation, Ramiris nimbly transported all the tents into her labyrinth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.4">We now had a large patch of empty land to work with.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">Still a little wowed by this feat, I used Belzebuth, Lord of Gluttony, to consume parts of the lot I didn’t need and pare it down to a square, flat expanse. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.2">The steel framing came up soon after, and once it did, Gobkyuu and his crew stacked up preprocessed stones to fill in the walls. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.3">Within the day, we had walls so hardy that not a single hole could be found in any of them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.4">This gave us a sturdy-looking underground space with a large door in the front of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.5">For someone from my “modern” era, the whole thing was wrapped up with unbelievable speed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">“W-wow,” Ramiris gushed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">“My new castle… Oh, right! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.3">If you touch this door, it’ll take you to the labyrinth floor where the tents are!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">We all took a trip inside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">There, we saw the beastmen’s living space, exactly as it looked up on the surface. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.3">Alvis and Sufia couldn’t hide their astonishment—especially since the air was kept refreshingly cool down here.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-166"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">“Do we even need these tents now, I wonder?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">“I dunno, yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.2">I assume it doesn’t rain in here, so I bet we could just sleep on the ground…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">They didn’t seem at all dissatisfied with this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">I could see them and the other beastmen experiment with going back and forth between the real and labyrinth dimensions—all it took was a moment’s thought for them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">“So does it get dark in here at night?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">“Sure does,” replied Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.2">“We’re linked to the outside from here, so I can even make it rain if you like!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">Man. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.2">She could do just about anything, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.3">But it wasn’t like they were farming crops in here, so I just asked her to set up a normal day-night cycle for me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.4">This whole space seemed a lot more useful than I guessed at first; I bet I could adapt it to other needs, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.5">We’d have to brainstorm some ideas.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">Apparently reassured, the beastmen went off to help with the outside work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.2">They’d pitch in with the arena, evidently, under the command of Gobkyuu. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.3">A lot of them were women and children, but that’s beastmen for you—they all wanted to work, and each one was stronger than a human, at least. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.4">Gobkyuu was giving them the basic manual-labor jobs, it looked like, but better-trained beastmen were on-site as well now, aiding in construction.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">Treyni was supplying logs for the building (don’t ask me how she got them), while Beretta’s precision carpentry turned them into usable boards. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.2">He could even cast a spell to dry the wood, which slashed the time involved dramatically. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.3">I thought I had abandoned my common sense long ago in this world, but it was sights like these that occasionally made me think </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">Wow, I really</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1"> am </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">in a whole different world, huh?</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">If this keeps up, we truly </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">could</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1"> make it in time for the Founder’s Festival. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.2">I had spit out the land I ate earlier to create a small mountain, too, so perhaps we could use that as a field feature in the arena. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.3">It should work great.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">“Leave the rest to us, Sir Rimuru!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.2">said Gobkyuu.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">I nodded, full of excitement over the arena’s imminent completion.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-167"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">With the main construction now in full swing, Ramiris had been left to her own devices. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.2">She needed a job, if only so she wouldn’t start pestering everyone else. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.3">And what was she good at? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.4">Why, expanding the labyrinth, of course. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.5">Better use her while I got her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">“I gotta say, Ramiris, your Mazecraft skill amazes me.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">She had transported everything within a pretty broad stretch of land in the blink of an eye. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.2">I didn’t want to compliment her </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">too</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1"> much, but I had to hand it to her here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.2">The labyrinth itself was pretty amazing, too.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">“Hee-hee! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.2">Aw, it’s nothing! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.3">But right now, though, it’s only this room, the deepest depths where my spirit friends live, and a connecting corridor. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.4">I’ll have more levels for you tomorrow!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">It took one hour to build a level, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.2">Building a vast underground labyrinth that went down a hundred floors would be a pretty tall order even on modern-day Earth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.3">Building up, after all, is a hell of a lot easier. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.4">Ramiris’s skill, though, made that possible—and suddenly, some pretty fantastic dreams seemed within reach.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">“Okay, let’s go with your limit, then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.2">One hundred floors.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">“Huh?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">Do you </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">need</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1"> that many?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">“I mean, that’s fine by me, but can I ask you something?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">“I was just wondering: How do you plan to expand the number of monsters in there? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">Are you gonna catch them somewhere?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">“Well, between you and me…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">I let her in on the secret of how I wanted to structure this dungeon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.2">As she listened, I could see her eyes begin to twinkle.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">“Wait, so—so…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">“Right—right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.2">So then, Ramiris…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">We began offering suggestions to each other as we whispered. </span><a id="page-168"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">This was getting exciting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.2">And given it was the two of us involved, we naturally began to go off on tangents we never should have. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.3">Before long, we had worked out the concept for our Advanced Dungeon, as we called it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.4">I honestly wondered if we could get away with it, but there’s no turning back now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.5">We had to do it—and Ramiris was itching to start, promising me that she’d build this labyrinth with everything she had.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">My next stop was Kurobe’s workshop so I could have him give me some of the weapons and armor he couldn’t sell on the market—stuff that was more to his personal tastes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.2">The southwest side of town was currently an industrial kind of area, and Kurobe’s place was there, along with workshops owned by his apprentices. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.3">There was also dorm space for the newer pupils without their own sites yet, along with lines of warehouses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.4">There were inns and restaurants for all these craftsmen and apprentices, of course, and overall it was a fairly lively place.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">Kurobe’s workshop was dead in the middle of it, and when I popped in, he warmly greeted me, showing me to his storage building after wrapping up dinner.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-169"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">“Right here, Sir Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.2">The stuff I have locked up in this warehouse is all pretty unique—not the kinda thing anyone can handle easily, you know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.3">Are you all right with that?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">I nodded my approval. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.2">Kurobe was right—not all of it was very user-friendly or accessible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.3">Some of it was locked up because it was too powerful, but a lot of it was just a total handful to use. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.4">The armor was a great example—like the suit of mail that sucked the wearer’s magical force to erect a magic barrier. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.5">That might sound useful, but it continually sapped your power whether you wanted it to or not, eventually killing the hapless owner. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.6">Great defense, but a pretty damn pointless piece of equipment.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">There was also a sword that attracted all magicules in the local area like a magnet, making it impossible to cast any spells, and transformed them into explosive force. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.2">You definitely got a bang out of it, but it didn’t exactly spare the wielder from the blast. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.3">I’d be way too scared to use that thing or the suit of armor that granted the wearer extraordinary physical strength for a limited time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.4">Once that time expired, your muscles all ruptured, rendering you motionless and dead unless you had healing magic on hand…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">So basically, you had a room full of equipment that could kill you if you weren’t paying attention. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.2">I doubted anybody in town was dumb enough to try any of this unevaluated stuff out—especially because I didn’t want to take responsibility for the fallout—but I thought it’d all work just fine in Ramiris’s labyrinth.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">“Yeah, it’s fine,” I told Kurobe. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.2">“These actually seem really valuable if you take into account all their different features.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">This </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1"> decent stuff, after all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.2">Much of it was valued at Rare or above, with a few Uniques scattered here and there—in the same lineup as the Scale Shield and Tempest Dagger I gifted Kabal’s party.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">I picked up one of the items—the Tempest Sword—as I turned to Kurobe.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">“It seems like kind of a waste, doesn’t it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.2">Keeping all this high-quality stuff in here just because it’s still in the test stage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.3">Don’t you want to pair some of it with the kind of people who could really take advantage of it?”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-170"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">I was trying to lead him to the answer I wanted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.2">Kurobe took the bait.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">“Oh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.2">Well, you can take whatever you like from here.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">I wasn’t tricking him, exactly, but I </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1"> feel kinda bad about it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">Soon, Kurobe’s warehouse was a fair bit emptier. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.2">Now I had a set of weapons I could populate the treasure chests in the labyrinth with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.3">They’d be obtained by adventurers who earned the right to them by reaching the level I put them in, so I didn’t lie to Kurobe at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.4">No need to look a gift horse in the mouth.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">Still, I was amazed at his sheer output. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.2">There was more here than the last time I had stopped by; I’d say it was at over a hundred items now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.3">Much of it was dicey, yes, but some pieces were just difficult to master. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.4">The one common link among them was that they were all superior to anything you’d see in the capital at Englesia, the kind of thing you’d normally only see at auction.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">During the Harvest Festival that marked my ascension to demon lord, Kurobe received the unique skill Mastercraft. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.2">This was a force that stacked on top of his previous Researcher skill, polishing it further. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.3">By this point, he was way past Kaijin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.4">Whenever he got serious about a project, it wasn’t uncommon for a Unique-grade piece of equipment to result. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.5">Rare level for sure, at least. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.6">That was much of the reason why only his apprentices’ work appeared at public showings.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">“Gotta say, though, I’m impressed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.2">I’ve learned forging myself, but no way could I make any of this.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">“Heh-heh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.2">High praise from you, Sir Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.3">Oh, but lemme give you this before I forget.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">Suddenly serious, the ever-modest Kurobe returned to the tatami-mat room in the rear to fetch something.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">“What’s this?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">“Well, it’s something I’ve made you wait far too long for.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">He handed me a long, straight sword, the blade a jet-black in color. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.2">Not too long, but not too short—made just for me, at truly the ideal length.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">“So this is…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1">“Yep. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.2">My greatest masterpiece yet.”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-171"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">At first glance, the only unusual thing about the sword was its black body. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.2">There wasn’t some ultra-powerful aura shooting out; it wasn’t generating its own magic or anything. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.3">But that’s what I wanted. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">This</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1"> blade’s focus was squarely on durability. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.2">It’d never break, never bend, and would fully adjust itself to my magical force—without wreaking havoc around me, like with Hinata’s Moonlight sword. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.3">It allowed me to be wholly unrestrained in a fight.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">“Well done. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.2">You’ve made me proud, Kurobe.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">“I’m just as proud of it as you, trust me on that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.2">But the sword isn’t complete just yet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.3">As you know, my weapons usually have a hole at the base, the way you suggested they should.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">I looked at the base. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.2">“Oh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.3">I don’t see any here.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">“No. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.2">The other weapons get that hole when they’re complete, but not this one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.3">Because once it acclimates to your magic force, it’ll grow…and evolve. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.4">And despite that, I built it so it’ll always look like just another sword otherwise.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">He had a right to be proud. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.2">As he put it, this sword in its complete state could be a piece of Legend-class material…not that it </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1">felt</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1"> that way presently. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.2">The other equipment in the family was still under development, and the magic crystal meant to go into the hole he mentioned wasn’t done yet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.3">No point having a hole if there was nothing for it yet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.4">I would just look forward to that forthcoming moment.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">I left Kurobe’s workshop with a spring in my step. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.2">I had my own sword, and I also got all the other stuff I wanted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.3">Now I could seed those treasure chests and spread them all around the Dungeon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.4">It’d be kinda fun to insert boss monsters to protect the particularly nice pieces, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.5">This was almost like designing a real-life dungeon-crawl RPG, and it was unbelievably exciting.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">Yeah, you could probably make a mint selling these test items and failed experiments at auction—I’m sure Mjöllmile or Fuze could hook me up with the right people for that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.2">It’d be a surer way of earning income, but I didn’t want that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.3">The key here was to get humans interacting with monsters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.4">I wanted to bring people </span><a id="page-172"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">over here and have them experience everything that made Tempest great—and if they liked what they saw, I’m sure they would come back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.2">This was just one part of that effort.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">Plus, this wasn’t just a matter of bribing adventurers with loot and sending them on their way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">I already had the next step of the process in mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.3">Let’s say you have someone hacking their way through the Dungeon, collecting assorted items and bringing them back to the surface. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.4">Using non-appraised weapons or armor, I had heard, was considered extremely dangerous. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.5">That’s where my little friend Assess comes in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.6">This stuff was made in Tempest, so I naturally knew all about their traits and features. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.7">A lot of it would be quite useful to adventurers, assuming you used it right—yeah, some of it was downright dangerous, but we’d offer a buyback service for that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">Money’s meant to be circulated, not kept in a vault or whatever. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.2">As long as we purchased the materials we needed and paid for necessary upkeep, we could give back the rest to the adventurers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.3">Word would spread about this over time, and I was sure it’d make our land famous. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.4">Besides, filling adventurers’ wallets would improve the outlook for our inns and lodging houses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.5">More people coming to Tempest meant less downtime for places like that, which was important—for business and for advertising.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">So the southeast side of town would have a battle arena, with Ramiris’s dungeon underneath. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.2">On the southwest, we’d have discount inns and hostels. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.3">Unlike the high-end facilities to the northeast, we’d keep things cheap down there, attracting primarily adventurers to help delineate our offerings. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.4">Their location would be convenient to the labyrinth, and I was positive it’d be a booming success.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">I was worried at first when Ramiris talked about moving here, but maybe that was the right thing to do all along, huh?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">We also planned to have at least one or two large-scale events at the arena each year. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.2">Mjöllmile was no doubt filling in the rest of the year’s schedule with other things, too—military training, test-your-mettle events for adventurers, and so on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.3">There could be a lot of demand for that kind of thing, I thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.4">We could have people try to use that training in the Dungeon—a kind of standardized </span><a id="page-173"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">exam, you could say. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.2">If you can’t die in there, you could try some crazy stuff you’d ordinarily never dream of attempting.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">Realizing how many options were open to us—not just commercial, either—I decided to talk with Benimaru later about them.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1">“I’ll even put some units in place for you to fight off the adventurers with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.2">That’s right—I’m gonna re-create that game you wanted to try out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.3">Sounds like fun, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">This, in a nutshell, was what I wanted to make—a real-time (also, real-life) strategy game set in a dungeon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.2">The idea came to me out of nowhere as I’d talked with Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.3">I’d have units (monsters) in place to tackle adventurers, along with bosses to protect the loot chests. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.4">The Dungeon would be filled with Veldora’s magicules, growing thicker as you approached the hundredth floor. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.5">The force in the air would be pretty thin up top, so you’d only see minion-level monsters at first, but the deeper you got, the more higher-level foes you’d find patrolling the halls. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.6">Even in his former prison, enough magic leaked out to create tempest serpents (rank: A-minus) and </span><a id="page-176"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">other powerful creatures—I couldn’t even imagine what he’d create at this point.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">Frankly, the whole “gate guardian” thing didn’t matter to me; I didn’t really expect anyone to make the hundredth floor in the first place. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.2">The key to all this was getting Veldora’s aura released. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.3">It felt to me like I couldn’t get away with making him keep it in much longer, but if I just left him to his own devices, he might decide to blow it all out in some empty corner of the world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.4">I couldn’t take my eyes off him for a moment, because if he erupted closer to town, maybe my administration and I could withstand it, but nobody else would. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.5">With enough magicule concentration, anything below a B in rank would die.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.1">I found it dangerous to rely solely on Veldora’s willpower to keep us safe, so Ramiris’s labyrinth was really a lifeboat in the nick of time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.2">It was a completely sealed space, something I confirmed when I explored it myself earlier, so there was no worrying about magicules leaking out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.3">Veldora’s full aura unleashed shouldn’t faze it at all.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.1">Even in the Sealed Cave, it’d be impossible to resist the aura of a fully revived Veldora—not that I’d bring him down there now, what with our research facility and all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.2">The Dungeon was perfect for him, and for the purposes of my true goal. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.3">I wanted him to whip out that aura and go to town with it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.1">My “true goal,” you see, was to use the large, dense cloud of magicules he’d create and generate monsters with it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.2">The whole plan rode on that idea—Veldora releasing his aura, and me making good use of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.3">An excellent plan, if I do say so myself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.4">Two birds—no, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">three</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1"> birds—with one stone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.2">Not only would it keep him from crashing my house uninvited, it’d also make him useful as a magicule generator for my new monster factory, giving him a job to do so he wouldn’t be such a freeloader. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.3">Not that I thought anyone would actually make it all the way to his floor, though…</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1">But what did </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1">he</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1"> think? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.2">Veldora stood up, placing his manga in a pocket, then extended a hand toward me, offering to shake.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.1">The next day, Veldora and I went to Ramiris.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">Construction of the arena began early in the morning, and the site was alive with activity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.2">Some of the beastmen that were out on training had come back to pitch in, following Gobkyuu’s orders as they ran to and fro. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.3">I didn’t want to wreck their concentration, so we headed for the labyrinth.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.1">The moment we entered, we emerged in the room Ramiris was in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.2">As she promised, she had been busy expanding the Dungeon.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1">“Hello, Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.2">Doing well?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">“Ahhh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.2">Hello, Master! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.3">It’s good to see you again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.4">I’m doing fine!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">Ramiris looked a tad fatigued but eminently satisfied with herself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.2">I advised her not to overdo it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.3">She was now seated on Veldora’s shoulder; I was glad to see they were still getting along.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1">I was glad, but it was also a problem, because the sight of Veldora was making Ramiris totally forget my advice.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">“Just leave this to me! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.2">I’ll do it! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.3">I can totally pull this off, guys!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1">To calm her down a bit, I decided to start with breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="page-178"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1">After that, I asked her about her progress. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.2">For now, she had expanded the labyrinth down to Floor 15; at the current pace, she’d reach one hundred several days later. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.3">I could decorate the interior along the way, so there was no need to hurry her further.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1">“The subsequent floors will formulate themselves at this point,” she said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.2">“I’ve got nothing to do right now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.3">Would you like to mess around with the floors that are done?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.1">Apparently, the floor-making work would proceed on its own, as long as Ramiris had remaining magic strength.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.1">“All right, how about we set up Veldora’s room first?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.1">The domain of Veldora would be on the bottommost floor. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.2">I wanted to get it all set up for him, if only so I could kick him out of my place pronto. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.3">For now, that floor was still an empty space—no walls, no hallways, no stairs; just a door in the middle of nothing.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.1">“Wow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.2">Literally starting from zero, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.1">Veldora wasn’t a fan. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.2">I saw his point. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.3">I’d feel kind of bad for him like this.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.1">“Not to worry, Master!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.2">Ramiris smiled at Veldora. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.3">“I can add stairs and other things easily enough, just by thinking about it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">“All right,” I said, “how about we all use Thought Communication to figure out what we want this place to look like?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1">We connected our minds together, and I showed them what I was currently picturing.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">“Sounds like Veldora’s all for it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.2">Think you can make it into this?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">“You got it! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.2">This much isn’t a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">Ramiris wasn’t kidding. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.2">In another instant, the space transformed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.3">We were quickly surrounded by walls of thick stone, forming a large chamber with several smaller rooms coming out from it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.4">The main chamber was a square three hundred feet or so on each side, impassive and looking every bit like a boss room. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.5">She did it up exactly like I pictured it in my mind.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-179"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1">“Whoa! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.2">This is perfect…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">“That it is, Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.2">I am eminently satisfied!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">Ramiris didn’t get compliments often enough, I guess, because she looked beside herself with joy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.2">I really </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1"> impressed, though. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.2">If you tried to physically construct this, it’d take decades, not even years—and she was done in an instant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.3">Plus, since this whole space was under her jurisdiction, she could customize it pretty freely. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.4">Astounding. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.5">I really started to see her in a new light.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1">But I couldn’t marvel at her forever.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">This chamber was meant to be the reception area for any adventurer who made it here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.2">But it wasn’t </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1">just</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1"> that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.2">In reality, it was a space large enough for Veldora to return to his original form. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.3">He needed to be able to fully relax and get comfortable in this space, or we’d never get anywhere. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.4">Of course, looking at him lately, he was chill enough in pretty much any physical form, I felt… If anything, being human made it easier to play games and read manga. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.5">He liked that form enough to use it to hang out uninvited in my home, after all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.6">Maybe we’d need to build a human-Veldora room, too.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">In the chamber was two doors, a large one that connected to the upper floors and another that connected to his private chambers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.2">Ramiris did such a good job crafting my vision, it was literally just as I thought it’d be.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1">“Hoh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.2">This is my room?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">Letting the curious Veldora look around a little, I took out a set of furniture from my Stomach. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.2">Deftly, I laid down a carpet woven by our town’s goblinas, placing a handmade desk and chair set on top of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.3">There was also a sofa in case he wanted to lie down, as well as a bed that I wasn’t sure would be used very much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.4">The place looked comfy enough to me, and I even copied some manga I knew Veldora would like and filed it all into a bookshelf on the wall. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.5">The main chamber was dark and foreboding; this one was a cheerful little studio perfect for young, urban singles.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1">“Oh, how nice!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.2">chirped Ramiris, looking a bit envious. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.3">“I’d like some furniture like this, too, y’know.”</span></p>
