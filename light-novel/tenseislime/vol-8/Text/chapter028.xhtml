<p><a id="page-262"></a>She stood back up, her wound already healed, and glared coldly at Momiji. Her presence was formidable indeed, as befitting one of the most powerful magic-born in Eurazania.</p>
<p>“Went easy? <em>I</em> was going easy on <em>you</em>. It’s taken quite an effort to avoid killing an envoy like yourself, I’ll have you know. Or do you want to make me <em>truly</em> angry?”</p>
<p>It felt like their face-off was literally freezing the air around them. The younger tengu warriors at the side of the courtyard tensed up as the concentrated auras filled the area. And in the midst of it, Benimaru sat drinking his tea, musing about how this had gone beyond the realm of a gaffe and into truly painful territory.</p>
<p>“Yes, you may be strong, but if you think a little girl as inexperienced as you in battle has a chance, think again.”</p>
<p>“Would you care to try? I was hoping to build some battle experience, as you so kindly pointed out. I think you would make a fine test case!”</p>
<p>The stare down grew ever more heated—and then they both moved at once. The next moment, a flash of light streaked through the air, and the fan flew out of Momiji’s hand. Silence fell over the courtyard. Faster than anyone could have reacted, Benimaru stepped into the fight.</p>
<p>“Enough,” he blankly stated. “I apologize for her offense, but I really can’t have my companion killed.”</p>
<p>“S-Sir Benimaru?! You thought I would <em>lose</em>?!”</p>
<p>“Yes. If I didn’t stop you, you would’ve been cut in two.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense!” Momiji said. “I put none of my force into—”</p>
<p>“No. You’re careless with holding your aura back. You put too much power into it.”</p>
<p>“I—I didn’t…”</p>
<p>“I… I lost…?”</p>
<p>Both Momiji and Alvis fell to their knees. As they did, the doors on one end of the courtyard opened, revealing a large, beautiful, canine-eared woman. The young tengu in the audience kneeled before her.</p>
<p>“M-Mother?!”</p>
<p><a id="page-263"></a>The tengu elder smiled at the panicking Momiji, ambling over to her daughter. When she reached her:</p>
<p>“You fool of a daughter!”</p>
<p>The roar echoed like a thunderclap.</p>
<p class="space-break1">In another few moments, the group had relocated themselves to an inner chamber, one in the classic Japanese style with tatami mats and flat floor cushions for kneeling on. A door ahead led to an alcove, allowing the ill tengu elder to take a rest whenever she needed. The elder had seen fit to give Momiji a rap on the head for her insolence; she rubbed it tearfully, dissatisfied with this treatment but unwilling to risk any more disobedience around her mother.</p>
<p>“No, no, there’s no need to go that far. We simply wanted to introduce ourselves…”</p>
<p>Benimaru had yet to accomplish what he set out to do, but this was no longer an atmosphere for casual talk. Plus, with Alvis as dejected as she was, he sensed that overstaying his welcome would be supremely unwise. But the elder had other ideas.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! Don’t worry about it, boy. That was quite some swordplay you showed off, by the way. That’s the Haze style, ain’t it?”</p>
<p>“How did…? Ah, no, I do have some idea. Momiji’s dancing did resemble my own sword style in parts. Could it be, perhaps…?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve studied Haze as well. From my master, Byakuya Araki.”</p>
<p>“Wha?!”</p>
<p>Benimaru was shocked. The tengu gave him a satisfied smile.</p>
<p>“My name, you see, is Kaede.”</p>
<p>With that, she began telling a story of her past. Over three hundred years ago, she’d been spending her time in the land of the ogres. She had been on a journey, hiding her true powers, but then she encountered Byakuya and became an apprentice on the ways of the sword. But Kaede wasn’t alone. She trained alongside someone else—a born talent, living by the sword, and Byakuya’s own grandchild.</p>
<p><a id="page-264"></a>“<em>It pains me so much that I am unable to give you a name</em>,” Byakuya had often said.</p>
<p>Naming monsters willy-nilly, it seemed, could come at the risk of one’s life. As a human, naming this grandchild of his would’ve surely killed him. Kaede didn’t have a name at the time, either, so she didn’t understand what his hang-up was about it, but now she had an inkling. If you love someone, after all, you want to leave something behind for them. It was natural for monsters not to have names, but for humans, it was the opposite.</p>
<p>Time passed, and Byakuya grew old and passed away, leaving behind his ogre grandchild who had become a virtuoso with the sword—enough to challenge even Kaede. In terms of technique, she lost out completely. She was smitten, and underneath a large maple tree, she confessed her love. Then, after a single night spent together in bliss, she left the ogre homeland.</p>
<p>The Forest of Jura had been known for its unstable weather, but this tree was a large, broad maple, one that shone with bright-orange leaves in the fall. It had become a symbol of the ogres’ homeland, and Benimaru knew it well—proving to him that her story was true…</p>
<p>“Wait a minute. Are you saying that Hakuro’s—?”</p>
<p>…and shocking him in the process.</p>
<p>“Hakuro, you said? Ah, so the Sword Ogre I trained with has gained a name? My… I’m surprised to hear he’s even alive.”</p>
<p>She smiled at the thought, shaking Benimaru down to his very core.</p>
<p><em>Whoa—whoa… Is Hakuro aware of this?!</em></p>
<p>His mind was swimming with all kinds of questions. But the greatest shock of all was yet to come:</p>
<p>“Well… That is a relief to hear.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“Because the fine young man Sir Hakuro raised is going to be the future groom of my daughter.”</p>
<p><em>Bppht!!</em></p>
<p>Benimaru spit out the tea he was drinking to calm his nerves. He was normally cool and composed, but here in the land of the tengu, <a id="page-265"></a>everything was shaking him to the core. And he wasn’t the only one—Alvis, next to him, was staring blankly into space as the teacup slipped from her hand.</p>
<p>Momiji blushed intensely at the news and looked at Benimaru, then Kaede. “M-Mother…?!”</p>
<p>Flustered, she attempted to shut her mother up, but it was no use. Kaede casually raised an arm to hold her daughter back as she addressed Benimaru.</p>
<p>“Now, Sir Benimaru, regarding your request earlier, I will be happy to accept it. In fact, I am prepared to acknowledge the rule of Sir Rimuru over our lands. However, that comes on the condition that you accept my daughter as your spouse. I doubt you will need much time to think it over, but what do you say?”</p>
<p>Benimaru froze. Such a dramatic question, posed so casually. He <em>did</em> need some time, as it happened. Fortunately, Momiji—the other related party in this question—stepped in to rescue him.</p>
<p>“Wait! Wait! I know you’ve accepted him, Mother, but I haven’t yet! Yes, perhaps he’s stronger than I am…but if so, then I don’t want you to force him into this. I want to win his love first. Don’t you always say, Mother, that a truly good woman is one who makes her sweetheart turn back toward her?”</p>
<p>She hid her reddened face behind her fan and all but ran out of the room, fleeing the scene. Kaede laughed heartily at her behavior.</p>
<p>As Alvis regained her senses, Benimaru could feel embarrassment creeping over him at Momiji’s reaction.</p>
<p><em>Y’know, Hakuro could stay calm through anything… As sudden as this proposal is, if that’s all it takes to throw me, I still have much to learn…</em></p>
<p>He took the moment to reflect.</p>
<p><em>…But still, this is way too sudden…</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">In the end, it was agreed that he would bring the question of Momiji back home to think over. This was all entirely Kaede’s idea, and she had no interest in forcing anyone into it. It was something she thought it’d be nice to see, and if it actually happened, why, all the better. As for the rest of Tempest’s demands, she largely agreed—the tunnel through the mountain was still an issue, but <a id="page-266"></a>she gave them permission to construct the highway to Thalion any way they pleased.</p>
<p>But their talks didn’t end there. Apart from potentially marrying Momiji off to Benimaru, Kaede also expressed an interest in building a constructive relationship between the demon lord Rimuru and the tengu race.</p>
<p>It may not have been obvious, but Kaede suffered from an illness. At least, that was the backstory; the truth was a bit different. She did indeed lose the majority of her remaining power bringing Momiji into the world. The birth and the subsequent “naming” of the child took place fifteen years ago, and it consumed nearly all the force of a woman once lauded as the goddess of the mountains. Death would be coming for her sooner rather than later, and that was why she wanted to find someone to back up and support her dear, inexperienced daughter. Benimaru’s visit was a coincidence, but to Kaede, he brought hope—a final hope, gifted to her by her former lover Hakuro.</p>
<p><em>If he turns me down, so be it</em>, thought Kaede. <em>You’re still there, aren’t you, with Sir Rimuru? I thought you would die before I did, but I see I was very happily mistaken. And won’t seeing Momiji remind you of our own past a little?</em></p>
<p>After some contemplation, Kaede agreed to postpone any concrete marriage plans. And with that, Momiji herself made her way to meet with the demon lord Rimuru in person.</p>

<p class="tx1">It was a pretty headache-inducing tale—and one representing the greatest danger Benimaru had experienced in his life. He described it as scarier than the first time he met me, which I wasn’t sure how to take. Maybe that was just his sense of humor.</p>
<p>Regardless, this was why Momiji had been sent here. If she landed such a clean hit on Alvis, you wouldn’t want to underestimate her in battle. Honestly, I was glad she wasn’t hostile to us anymore.</p>
<p>…But really, I couldn’t dodge the real question any longer.</p>
<p><em>Hakuro had a daughter all this time? No way.</em></p>
<p><a id="page-267"></a>I was in a panic over it, worried that it’d balloon into a huge issue, but there wasn’t much to be done about it until I met her. Besides, this wasn’t something Benimaru and I could solve alone. We needed to hear from Hakuro, who had just as large a stake in this—but I didn’t want to hurry him over here needlessly, either. So I decided to shelve the issue until he came back.</p>
<p class="space-break1">And come back he did, the previous night, after his journey to Farmus. The three of us held a little chat. I had no idea what the tengu would demand from us or what would happen with them at all, so we decided to save their audience for the final day. I was planning to call for Hakuro if he still wasn’t around by then, but fortunately I didn’t need to. Not that his timeliness solved a lot of problems, either.</p>
<p>Benimaru and Momiji marrying was strictly an issue between the two of them. I didn’t mind if they said yes; it didn’t really seem to affect me at all, but…</p>
<p>“Wait just a minute!” Benimaru began. “I—I have my own issues to think about, you realize!”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Hakuro countered. “Do you not like my daughter?”</p>
<p>“I am not saying that! Besides, why are you acting like a father <em>now</em>? You’ve never met her in your life. You didn’t even know she existed!”</p>
<p>“Well, now that I do, I have a certain responsibility for her, do I not?”</p>
<p>Hakuro seemed to be relishing Benimaru’s consternation. It only made the problem worse. We kept talking all night, but it never really came to a conclusion—so here, in the audience chamber, I was going to be forced to wing it.</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The beautiful girl sat down on a hastily prepared chair in front of me. The colorful white-to-red gradient of her hair was indeed beautiful. This was the Momiji I had heard so much about, representing <a id="page-268"></a>the tengu elder here. She gave me a haughty look and began to speak.</p>
<p>“Demon lord Rimuru, it is good to meet you. My name is Momiji, and I have come here on behalf of the elder of the tengu race. I look forward to working with you.”</p>
<p>“You’re very kind. My name’s Rimuru, and I’ve become a demon lord. I’m in human form now, as you can see, but I’m actually a slime. In general, I’m pretty much a pacifist, so if you have any problems, don’t be afraid to hit me up.”</p>
<p>“There is no need for such concern. The way you have conquered the Forest of Jura was breathtaking to witness. We recognize you as the ruler of the forest and look forward to being a good neighbor to you. However, we will not allow you to interfere in our affairs.”</p>
<p>She was saying that in front of all my officials. I could see Shion’s eyebrow twitch a little, but luckily no one reacted further. I hadn’t explained the full story to her yet, so she actually stopped herself that time. That was a new change in her, as of late; she no longer responded to small things in her usual exaggerated fashion. That was a good trend to see, if a little creepy. Hopefully she wasn’t just bottling it all in, only to have it explode later.</p>
<p>Momiji, meanwhile, was waiting with bated breath to see how I’d reply. She put up a bold, dignified act, so you wouldn’t notice unless it was pointed out to you, but I’m sure her nerves were killing her. She must not have been sure whether I was friend or foe yet.</p>
<p>Declaring her allegiance would’ve been fine, I thought, but the pride her race had in themselves must have forbidden that. A young, inexperienced ruler faces doom if people look down on them, after all. I can understand that—even though it seemed like Momiji had the support of the younger tengu warrior classes.</p>
<p>“All right. I understand. Certainly, we don’t have any interest in unduly interfering with you, either. As I think Benimaru here explained to you, we just want to build a highway around the base of the Khusha Mountains. Also, just to be sure, you recognize the rights of the high orcs who have already moved into the mountains, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is not a problem. I make no exclusive claims to the <a id="page-269"></a>right to enjoy the mountains’ blessings. You may mine the ore as much as you want—we have no need for it. We only wish to be left alone.”</p>
<p>Um…</p>
<p>The mountainous areas were considered part of the Forest of Jura’s territory. I had braced myself for some sort of complaining about that, but I guess it’s not a problem. So what were the tengu so on edge about? She acted pretty prickly toward Alvis; was there a fight between them and Carillon during his demon lord days? I decided it was safest to just ask directly.</p>
<p>“Um, so I don’t know what you’re so on guard about, but we really have no intention of starting a conflict with you, so…?”</p>
<p>“You want me to believe that?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I mean, have I said or done anything to make you suspect I’ve got my eyes on expanding my territory?”</p>
<p>Momiji eyed me carefully, judging my intentions once again.</p>
<p>“You associate with that crafty bird woman Frey. That’s all the evidence I need to recognize your ambitions!” she retorted.</p>
<p>I can safely say I did not see that one coming.</p>
<p>“Whoa, time-out!”</p>
<p>“What does time-out mean?!”</p>
<p>“It means stop! We need to discuss some things!”</p>
<p>I called my administration over. Momiji agreed to this—with some complaints, I think, but I wasn’t really paying attention.</p>
<p>“What do you think of that?” I asked once we were all in a circle.</p>
<p>“The former demon lord Frey’s territory is connected to the Khusha Mountains,” Soei quickly replied. “I could imagine some conflicts with the tengu erupting along those lines.”</p>
<p>I consulted the world map in my mind. True enough. The tengu settlement was outside the Forest itself, so fighting for it wouldn’t violate any noncompete contracts. They might’ve tried to invade at one point.</p>
<p>“But why, though?”</p>
<p>“I can’t think of any reason,” Benimaru said. He must not have noticed anything amiss during his visit.</p>
<p>“I have heard rumors. It is said that Frey likes high places. As <a id="page-270"></a>her second name of the Sky Queen suggests, perhaps she’s endeavored to move her capital to the tallest place within access to her?” Hakuro offered.</p>
<p>That didn’t sound quite right to me. Benimaru himself said the tengu stronghold was an idyllic enclave on the other side of a cave at the peak of a mountain—in other words, a small plane of space on another dimension. That’s not the kind of thing Frey would want.</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>We all murmured to one another. Then:</p>
<p>“Will you <em>stop ignoring me</em>?!”</p>
<p>“Whoa!”</p>
<p>I leaped up at the sound of someone shouting in my ear. Momiji was there, fuming and sick of waiting any longer. This time, I definitely couldn’t tune her out.</p>
<p>I gave up and sat back in my seat, facing her.</p>
<p>“Let me ask you a question. Does Frey have ambitions on tengu territory?”</p>
<p>“Huhhh? Of all the stupid things to ask…” She rolled her eyes, then realized I was being serious. “You’re kidding me,” she muttered.</p>
<p>It sounded like we weren’t on the same page at all here, so I decided to let her tell her side of the story.</p>
<p>As she put it, Frey’s aim was to capture Elmin Thalion, capital of the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion. She wanted it not for its territory, but for its height.</p>
<p>I sure wasn’t expecting that. It was very in character for her, but I couldn’t laugh about it.</p>
<p>In terms of size, Thalion was a huge country. Frey didn’t have the military resources to overwhelm it. However, while the nation enjoyed a geographical advantage against ground-based armies, against Frey and her aerial forces, they would face tougher going. Tactically, they were an even match, but Frey refused to let her ambitions stay just ambitions forever.</p>
<p>That was why she had turned her attention on the tengu. She wanted to bring them under her rule, shoring up her resources for a later assault on Thalion. But the tengu were too proud for that, <a id="page-271"></a>not ready to so easily accept Frey’s demands. Thalion, expecting this, hoped for the two sides to erupt into conflict with each other, which would take the heat off them and also let them profit from the ensuing war.</p>
<p>Frey was fully aware of that, however, and that stayed her hand. The result was this three-way détente that, frankly, looked pretty twisted to me.</p>
<p>While all that was going on, I fought against Clayman, and once the dust settled, Carillon and Frey gave up their posts and resolved to serve the demon lord Milim. It was the birth of a new superpower, one the tengu alone could never fend off, and now their government was in a heated debate over how to hold themselves going forward.</p>
<p>And then Benimaru came along, taking one of the Three Lycanthropeers with him. <em>Bad</em> idea. Momiji mistook that as my attempt to silently apply pressure on her.</p>
<p>“How’s Frey been lately?” I asked Geld. As the person responsible for building a new capital city, he had been taking orders from Frey, making him the most familiar with her out of our little group.</p>
<p>“Well, Sir Rimuru, Lady Frey seems tremendously satisfied with your plans. As taciturn as Mildo is, the two have gotten along well, and she’s been participating in some very detailed planning meetings.”</p>
<p>Frey found a way to make Mildo talk? That’s impressive.</p>
<p>“All right. So has she lost interest in Elmin Thalion?”</p>
<p>“Lost interest? I’d say her interests lie in…um…”</p>
<p>“In?”</p>
<p>“Well… Lately, I haven’t seen Lady Milim around. Lady Frey had been teaching her about governance and the like, but apparently she ran off on her unawares.”</p>
<p>Oh, right. I’m pretty sure I know where she is. For the sake of this conversation, though, let’s pretend that I don’t. Let sleeping dogs lie, and all that.</p>
<p>“As a result, I’d say that Lady Frey’s primary focus at the moment is figuring out where Lady Milim went,” concluded Geld.</p>
<p>The gigantic capital building project, skyscrapers and all, had <a id="page-272"></a>completely charmed Frey. It turned her interest away from any other potential capital she could conquer; they all paled in comparison. Milim, as Geld put it, was the bigger issue. And Momiji, listening to all this stuff going against what she imagined, was stunned into silence, unable to figure out how to react.</p>
<p>I couldn’t blame her. That’s reality for you—a force who you assume wants you and your people dead, and all of a sudden, their focus is on something else entirely. If it happened to you, <em>you’d</em> probably want to run away from reality, too.</p>
<p>“…All right. I understand. So there you have it. If you recognize all that as the misunderstanding it was, I’m cool with that.”</p>
<p>It could be said that tengu were not terribly wise in the ways of the world. The worry that they were surrounded by enemies had clouded Momiji’s judgment. Based on her situation, I could see why she made the decision she did.</p>
<p>“So I was imagining it all along…? Mother <em>did</em> say I was overthinking matters…”</p>
<p>She slumped back in her chair, the strength drained from her body. It was a lesson for all present: Jumping to conclusions can bite you hard.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">With that behind us, our talks quickly came to a close.</p>
<p>Since Momiji was still a little out of it, one of the tengu warriors looked over the pact we were to sign in her stead. I thought these were bodyguards, but I guess they served as government staff, too.</p>
<p>The tunnel question would be saved for later. We wouldn’t be allowed to start on it, I was told, until we could prove it was safe. That made sense to me, so I didn’t make a big deal out of it. We needed to talk to Thalion about building a tunnel anyway, and it wouldn’t really get underway until we finished developing trains, so there was no need to set anything in stone quite yet.</p>
<p>The tengu didn’t want us to interfere with them because they mistakenly thought we were prepping for an invasion, but now that we’d addressed that misunderstanding, nothing stopped us from <a id="page-273"></a>having normal relations. So we agreed to help each other out, in case something ever happened.</p>
<p>“…So is that all?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” the tengu aide said with a bow. “My thanks to you, Demon Lord, for allowing us to conduct such constructive negotiations.”</p>
<p>So things were square with Momiji. Our pact was signed. Now we needed to talk about Momiji and Hakuro’s relationship—and Benimaru and Momiji’s potential marriage. We failed to reach a conclusion on that last night.</p>
<p>Momiji started the day hostile toward us, but that had presumably changed now. Should we maybe work this out just with the people directly involved?</p>
<p>As I debated with myself over how to broach the topic, the tengu aide took out a sealed envelope.</p>
<p>“There is also the matter of this. Our elder, Lady Kaede, has this letter for you, Lord Rimuru.”</p>
<p>He respectfully handed it to me. Rigurd accepted it, and Shuna handled opening and reading it. It began with the sort of verbose, convoluted greetings you often saw in royal correspondence, probing me a bit to guess at where my disposition was, but grew less formal as it went on. Shuna’s face contorted in confusion as she read on.</p>
<p>“‘…I know things are complicated, and there have been a few misunderstandings, but I hope you will treat my daughter well. I remind you of what she told me about making Sir Benimaru turn toward her. I am sure she is not against the idea—’”</p>
<p><em>Wait, are you</em> sure <em>this letter’s for me?! It really doesn’t sound that way!</em> If I had known it contained stuff like this, I would have dismissed my staff…but it was too late for that now.</p>
<p>“M-Mother?!!”</p>
<p>Momiji leaped back to her feet, snatching the letter out of Shuna’s hands. Rude of her, but I’d just pretend I didn’t see it. Couldn’t blame her. If I were Momiji, I don’t know what <em>I</em> would’ve done, either. This goes beyond infamy and straight into humiliation.</p>
<p>“So… So there <em>were</em> two letters?! Mother, why can’t you be more careful…?”</p>
<p>She slumped back down again. Aha. Kaede must’ve put a message <a id="page-274"></a>for Hakuro in the letter to me. The tengu aides surrounded Momiji, trying their best to assuage her, but it only had the opposite effect. Times like these, it’s best to just leave people in peace.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh… That’s just like her.”</p>
<p>Hakuro, smirking, walked up to Momiji, taking the crumpled-up letter out of her hand and giving her a nod.</p>
<p>“I see… ‘She has a great deal of strength but is still lacking in technique. As a fellow student of the sword, and as her father as well, I hope that the Sword Ogre will deign it worthy to offer her training and instruction. From your ever-loving Kaede.’ So she still likes me, eh? Heh-heh! Ah, how lucky I am to live to see this day.”</p>
<p>His smile couldn’t have been more sincere.</p>
<p>“F-Father…?”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm. My name is Hakuro, and I am your father.”</p>
<p>“Father!!”</p>
<p>Momiji’s dark eyes, reminiscent of Hakuro’s, teared up as she hugged him tightly. Father and daughter were reunited. The girl, no longer wary of us, would never doubt Hakuro’s words again.</p>
<p>“I must warn you, Momiji, I am a hard taskmaster on the training grounds.”</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>
<p>“But I want to see you overcome your challenges and win the heart of Benimaru!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Father!”</p>
<p>Um, what…?</p>
<p>Here I was, nodding my approval at this lovely little family reunion, and now the conversation was going kind of haywire. Talk about bridging a major gap. Hakuro, usually gruff and reserved even in the best of times, suddenly had a daughter…and it turned him into a weepy, doting parent.</p>
<p>“Uh, Hakuro…”</p>
<p>Benimaru’s words failed to reach him. He and Momiji were in their own little world.</p>
<p>“Oh, now I see,” Shuna murmured.</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes turned toward her. She paid it no mind as she addressed Benimaru, who was looking straight at her.</p>
<p><a id="page-275"></a>“My brother, I have a message for you from Sir Alvis.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” a pained-looking Benimaru said.</p>
<p>I could get how he felt. He must’ve been thinking “<em>Please</em>, let’s do this later,” but Shuna was staring at him with a distinct lack of emotion in her eyes.</p>
<p>The message, given with Alvis’s accent, was this:</p>
<p>“‘Sir Benimaru, I have made up my mind. I intend to defeat Lady Momiji in battle and take the right to be your wife for myself—but even in the worst-case scenario, I could always be a concubine, couldn’t I? Either way, I refuse to give up, so prepare yourself!’”</p>
<p>My staff chattered with one another, their curiosity raging.</p>
<p class="space-break1">…</p>
<p class="space-break1">Benimaru just crossed his arms in silence. I’m sure he wanted to bury his head in his hands, but I have to give him props for not doing it. Or maybe it’s more like he was frozen in place, unable to move or speak. Unbeatable in battle, maybe, but powerless against “threats” like these—we’d just discovered an unexpected weak point of Benimaru’s.</p>
<p><em>Sorry, man.</em> As someone without much experience in love—not <em>zero</em> experience, but not much—I doubt there’s much I can do to help.</p>
<p>“Man, life’s sure hard when women are attracted to you, huh?” I tried.</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru,” Gobta said reproachfully, “are you serious? Because I think you face some of the same issues…”</p>
<p><em>Don’t be silly, Gobta. I’m genderless now, remember?</em></p>
<p>“Eh-heh-heh-heh-heh… I have no interest in silly romance. To me, Sir Rimuru is <em>everything</em>.”</p>
<p><em>I didn’t ask you, Diablo. If you have no interest, then leave me alone, okay?</em></p>
<p>But even as I thought this, I could hear my staff gossiping.</p>
<p>“Sir Benimaru <em>is</em> rather popular, is he not? I believe some of the people under my sister Soka’s command had taken a liking to him, too, but compared with Lady Alvis and Lady Momiji, I’m not sure I like their chances.”</p>
<p><a id="page-276"></a>“You mean Toka, Gabil? And maybe Saika?”</p>
<p>“Right, right. They’ve already given up on <em>you</em>, Sir Soei, what with Soka staking her claim already…”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t be silly!”</p>
<p>“No, it’s true!”</p>
<p>“Wow, it’s like a harem, huh? I’m so jealous!”</p>
<p>Come to think of it, Gobta had a point there, in the end. I began to wonder if this was the start of an envious romantic rivalry between Benimaru and him. But still, Alvis was a beautiful, reliable woman. Momiji was a little headstrong but still a nice little-sister type. Between them and all the other girls aiming for a chance, Gobta was right—Benimaru <em>did</em> have something of a harem going. Not that he wanted one…</p>
<p>“A harem, eh?” remarked Gabil. “Yes, that would make anyone jealous.”</p>
<p>“Well, not so fast,” Soei replied. “Benimaru <em>is</em> something of a late bloomer. I would not call him particularly adept with the opposite sex. He <em>acts</em> tough, but I’m sure he is just as confused as all of us.”</p>
<p>My thoughts were exactly the same. Having all this attention would be nothing but trouble for Benimaru. Shuna was watching him, too. I had a feeling Benimaru cared a lot for her sister, so I’m sure he was sensing danger from her and her overbearing ways right now.</p>
<p>“But I think it’s nice,” Geld said. “As manly a man as Sir Benimaru is, it’s only natural the women around town would love him. Lady Alvis is leader of the Three Lycanthropeers, and I suppose Momiji is the daughter of Hakuro—both worthy partners. I have a lot to learn from him.”</p>
<p>He certainly seemed enthusiastic about the idea of Benimaru finding a wife, harem or not. Geld himself cared more about his work than chasing women, so I wasn’t sure whether he really meant the part about having a “lot to learn.”</p>
<p>Besides, Geld was already pretty popular. As quiet, serious-minded, and responsible as he was, he had a fan base among not just high orcs, but other races as well. If he got off his ass and did something about it, he’d have a partner in no time.</p>
<p><a id="page-277"></a>“Oh, no, you are doing well enough for yourself, Sir Geld! Like I said before, Toka and the others never give me a second glance… For some reason, only the men show me any kindness in my unit,” Gabil insisted.</p>
<p>Geld nodded sagely. “You just need more chances to encounter women. I understand that a little.” He mostly worked on construction sites manned by burly male workers, so I bet he did.</p>
<p>Someone like me with no gender—or maybe an amphibian where gender was just a messy topic to begin with—was one thing, but building a work environment where women could participate equally was probably important, huh? It’d help encourage the men more, maybe. I’d have to think about that.</p>
<p>“Well, I should say, there are a few female dwarf apothecaries in my workplace. We do exchange some pleasantries, but…”</p>
<p>“Oh? No problem, then, right?”</p>
<p><em>No, that is a problem. Those are two totally different monster races. You aren’t okay with anything that breathes, are you, Gabil?</em></p>
<p>“No, a big problem. They told me that going out with a lizard was ‘physically impossible’! I’m just so unpopular with them…”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>Well. Don’t know what to say about that. Sounds like the species difference wasn’t the only wall to overcome there. Gabil may want to explore other avenues.</p>
<p>“And yet, they keep inviting Nanso and Hokuso out to eat—or for dates in the forests. It happens all the time! I find it <em>so</em> frustrating…”</p>
<p>Oh, so the species thing didn’t even function as an excuse, then?</p>
<p>“I, um, I’m not sure what to say…”</p>
<p>Geld was out of words, unsure what else he could do to comfort Gabil.</p>
<p>“Yes… That’s why I’ve been thinking lately that I should take more of a human form. My own dad transformed into a tall, dark, handsome person, so I wonder if I have a chance at that, too!”</p>
<p>Doubt it. Besides, it’s not about looks. <em>I</em> looked like a pretty nice guy myself, but I went almost forty years without a girlfriend!</p>
<p>The <em>real</em> key is—</p>
<p><a id="page-278"></a>“Don’t be ridiculous. You need to get up and <em>do</em> something.”</p>
<p>Right! That’s correct, Soei! Sitting around all day and whining like Gabil won’t win anyone over. Stop pretending someone’s going to pop out of nowhere and confess her love to you—and start going more on the offensive! Too bad I didn’t realize that until after I became a slime, but…</p>
<p>“W-well, yes, of course, but…”</p>
<p>“Soei’s right! I heard those dwarves talking once, and they were saying all these nice things about one of your men, Gabil. All like ‘Oooh, isn’t Gazatt so cool?’ and ‘Oh, you think so, too?’ and ‘He’s the classic strong, silent type, huh?’ and ‘He’s cute, kind of like my pet lizard.’ They were crazy for him! So I really don’t think it’s just about looks, Gabil!”</p>
<p><em>Wow, Gobta. Way to throw him under the bus.</em></p>
<p>Gazatt was one of Gabil’s underlings, part of Team Hiryu—quiet and handy with a spear, but not exactly the sharpest nail in the box, so he was mainly tasked with guard duty for our researchers and pharmacists down in the Sealed Cave. He was a former lizardman, of course, and even now as a dragonewt, his looks, much like Gabil’s, were more reptilian. As cruelly as Gobta put it, it definitely proved that looks aren’t everything.</p>
<p>“Besides, women can be easier to attract than one would expect,” Soei added.</p>
<p>“They can?!”</p>
<p>“Very much so,” he said, half-chidingly. “A lady knight from before, for example. I am unsure how she got the idea, but she seemed to have quite an interest in me.”</p>
<p>“R-really?! What did you do?”</p>
<p>“Oh-ho?”</p>
<p>“How very interesting!”</p>
<p>“Tell us more!”</p>
<p>This was enough to even arouse <em>my</em> interest. Which “lady knight” was this? Wait, wasn’t he up to something with Litus, one of the Crusader paladins? What was up with that? I meant to ask, but it kind of slipped my mind. I spotted her looking at Soei and blushing, so I feared the worst, but…</p>
<p><a id="page-279"></a>“You want to know, too, Sir Rimuru?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do. And that report you made that one time…”</p>
<p>“Ah yes, that. You see, I took some Sticky Steel Thread and—”</p>
<p>He was stopped mid-sentence by a feeling of impending doom from behind us, followed by an almost deafening clearing of the throat.</p>
<p>“Ah-<em>hemmm</em>!!”</p>
<p>Our little whispered chat was over. We immediately shot straight back up, faces serious. Sensing the danger, I slipped back into slime mode and attempted to escape the front line but instead found myself lifted up by a thin, pale arm.</p>
<p>“Enough joking, Sir Rimuru. Don’t we have my brother to talk about right now?”</p>
<p>Ah yes. That we do. We got a bit derailed, didn’t we? And we sure couldn’t afford to piss Shuna off anymore. Right. We needed to get serious about this.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Anyway…</p>
<p>Well, not that thinking about this issue would get us any closer to solving it.</p>
<p>“What do <em>you</em> think about this, Benimaru?”</p>
<p>“Hmm… Personally speaking, I do feel this is all going too fast. However, one thing I can say for sure is that one spouse is all I’d like to have.”</p>
<p>Yeah, fair enough. Being asked out of nowhere to marry would knock anyone for a loop. I know it’d throw <em>me</em> off. The past is one thing, but we live in an era where you’re free to love whoever you want. Besides:</p>
<p>“Besides, for higher-level magic-born like ourselves, siring a child is not a simple task. Some people have many wives and they impregnate each, who must compete with one another to give birth, but I have little interest in that approach. I do not intend to keep any concubines.”</p>
<p>Momiji watched Benimaru starry-eyed as she spoke.</p>
<p>“So no harem, then?”</p>
<p>No harem, it sounded like—or no polygamy, to be exact. No real <a id="page-280"></a>reason to adopt that in Tempest, unless we were forced to because of a glut of widows or something.</p>
<p>I was hoping that was the end of the topic, but it was really just the beginning.</p>
<p>“All right. In that case, I accept Alvis’s challenge. I promise you, I will earn the role of Benimaru’s wife with my own two hands!”</p>
<p>Momiji all but shouted this declaration out to the world. I wasn’t sure this is how love worked, exactly, but Benimaru seemed to have given up and didn’t comment on it.</p>
<p>“What do you think of that, Sir Rimuru?”</p>
<p>What do I think of it? All I can say at this point is—hey, whatever.</p>
<p>“Well, there’s no problem with it, is there? I don’t want any to-the-death duel or whatever, but if it’s more like vying to woo him, sure, that’s fine. If <em>he’s</em> not up for it, we’ll need to end it, but…”</p>
<p>As long as it didn’t venture into stalker territory, I was cool with it.</p>
<p>“Very well,” Shuna said with a smile. “In that case, do as you like.”</p>
<p>I had a bad feeling about that the moment she said it.</p>
<p>“I can beat you, Lady Shuna!”</p>
<p>“I look forward to seeing you try, Shion.”</p>
<p>They both smiled at each other. I wasn’t exactly sure what this meant, but I hopped out of Shuna’s arms anyway, sensing mortal danger.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I should note, by the way, that the previously reserved and hesitant Alvis got <em>seriously</em> aggressive from that day forward, attacking Benimaru from every possible angle regardless of how it made her look. Momiji, of course, followed her every step of the way, resisting her efforts. The other women coveting Benimaru, of course, didn’t take this lying down and immediately threw themselves into the fray. To say the least, things got intense.</p>
<p>It kicked off the start of a new tradition in Tempest—the idea that, if you love someone, prove it to them with your own might. Love on the battlefield, I suppose.</p>
