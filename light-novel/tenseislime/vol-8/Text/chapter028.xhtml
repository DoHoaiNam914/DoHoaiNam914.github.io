<p><a id="page-262"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">She stood back up, her wound already healed, and glared coldly at Momiji. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.2">Her presence was formidable indeed, as befitting one of the most powerful magic-born in Eurazania.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">“Went easy? </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">I</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1"> was going easy on </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">you</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">It’s taken quite an effort to avoid killing an envoy like yourself, I’ll have you know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">Or do you want to make me </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">truly</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1"> angry?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">It felt like their face-off was literally freezing the air around them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">The younger tengu warriors at the side of the courtyard tensed up as the concentrated auras filled the area. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">And in the midst of it, Benimaru sat drinking his tea, musing about how this had gone beyond the realm of a gaffe and into truly painful territory.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“Yes, you may be strong, but if you think a little girl as inexperienced as you in battle has a chance, think again.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">“Would you care to try? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">I was hoping to build some battle experience, as you so kindly pointed out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">I think you would make a fine test case!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">The stare down grew ever more heated—and then they both moved at once. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">The next moment, a flash of light streaked through the air, and the fan flew out of Momiji’s hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.3">Silence fell over the courtyard. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.4">Faster than anyone could have reacted, Benimaru stepped into the fight.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">“Enough,” he blankly stated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">“I apologize for her offense, but I really can’t have my companion killed.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">“S-Sir Benimaru?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">You thought I would </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">lose</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">If I didn’t stop you, you would’ve been cut in two.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">“Nonsense!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">Momiji said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">“I put none of my force into—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“No. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">You’re careless with holding your aura back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">You put too much power into it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“I—I didn’t…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“I… I lost…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">Both Momiji and Alvis fell to their knees. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">As they did, the doors on one end of the courtyard opened, revealing a large, beautiful, canine-eared woman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">The young tengu in the audience kneeled before her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">“M-Mother?!”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-263"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">The tengu elder smiled at the panicking Momiji, ambling over to her daughter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">When she reached her:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">“You fool of a daughter!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">The roar echoed like a thunderclap.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">In another few moments, the group had relocated themselves to an inner chamber, one in the classic Japanese style with tatami mats and flat floor cushions for kneeling on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">A door ahead led to an alcove, allowing the ill tengu elder to take a rest whenever she needed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">The elder had seen fit to give Momiji a rap on the head for her insolence; she rubbed it tearfully, dissatisfied with this treatment but unwilling to risk any more disobedience around her mother.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“No, no, there’s no need to go that far. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">We simply wanted to introduce ourselves…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">Benimaru had yet to accomplish what he set out to do, but this was no longer an atmosphere for casual talk. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">Plus, with Alvis as dejected as she was, he sensed that overstaying his welcome would be supremely unwise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">But the elder had other ideas.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">“Hee-hee-hee! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">Don’t worry about it, boy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">That was quite some swordplay you showed off, by the way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.4">That’s the Haze style, ain’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“How did…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">Ah, no, I do have some idea. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">Momiji’s dancing did resemble my own sword style in parts. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.4">Could it be, perhaps…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">“Yes, I’ve studied Haze as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">From my master, Byakuya Araki.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">“Wha?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Benimaru was shocked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">The tengu gave him a satisfied smile.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“My name, you see, is Kaede.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">With that, she began telling a story of her past. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">Over three hundred years ago, she’d been spending her time in the land of the ogres. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">She had been on a journey, hiding her true powers, but then she encountered Byakuya and became an apprentice on the ways of the sword. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.4">But Kaede wasn’t alone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.5">She trained alongside someone else—a born talent, living by the sword, and Byakuya’s own grandchild.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-264"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">It pains me so much that I am unable to give you a name</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">,” Byakuya had often said.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Naming monsters willy-nilly, it seemed, could come at the risk of one’s life. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">As a human, naming this grandchild of his would’ve surely killed him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">Kaede didn’t have a name at the time, either, so she didn’t understand what his hang-up was about it, but now she had an inkling. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.4">If you love someone, after all, you want to leave something behind for them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.5">It was natural for monsters not to have names, but for humans, it was the opposite.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Time passed, and Byakuya grew old and passed away, leaving behind his ogre grandchild who had become a virtuoso with the sword—enough to challenge even Kaede. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">In terms of technique, she lost out completely. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">She was smitten, and underneath a large maple tree, she confessed her love. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.4">Then, after a single night spent together in bliss, she left the ogre homeland.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">The Forest of Jura had been known for its unstable weather, but this tree was a large, broad maple, one that shone with bright-orange leaves in the fall. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">It had become a symbol of the ogres’ homeland, and Benimaru knew it well—proving to him that her story was true…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">“Wait a minute. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">Are you saying that Hakuro’s—?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">…and shocking him in the process.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“Hakuro, you said? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">Ah, so the Sword Ogre I trained with has gained a name? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.3">My… I’m surprised to hear he’s even alive.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">She smiled at the thought, shaking Benimaru down to his very core.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">Whoa—whoa… Is Hakuro aware of this?!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">His mind was swimming with all kinds of questions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">But the greatest shock of all was yet to come:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“Well… That is a relief to hear.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“Because the fine young man Sir Hakuro raised is going to be the future groom of my daughter.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Bppht!!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">Benimaru spit out the tea he was drinking to calm his nerves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">He was normally cool and composed, but here in the land of the tengu, </span><a id="page-265"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">everything was shaking him to the core. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">And he wasn’t the only one—Alvis, next to him, was staring blankly into space as the teacup slipped from her hand.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">Momiji blushed intensely at the news and looked at Benimaru, then Kaede. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">“M-Mother…?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Flustered, she attempted to shut her mother up, but it was no use. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">Kaede casually raised an arm to hold her daughter back as she addressed Benimaru.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">“Now, Sir Benimaru, regarding your request earlier, I will be happy to accept it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">In fact, I am prepared to acknowledge the rule of Sir Rimuru over our lands. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.3">However, that comes on the condition that you accept my daughter as your spouse. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.4">I doubt you will need much time to think it over, but what do you say?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Benimaru froze. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">Such a dramatic question, posed so casually. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">He </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1"> need some time, as it happened. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">Fortunately, Momiji—the other related party in this question—stepped in to rescue him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">“Wait! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">Wait! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">I know you’ve accepted him, Mother, but I haven’t yet! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.4">Yes, perhaps he’s stronger than I am…but if so, then I don’t want you to force him into this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.5">I want to win his love first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.6">Don’t you always say, Mother, that a truly good woman is one who makes her sweetheart turn back toward her?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">She hid her reddened face behind her fan and all but ran out of the room, fleeing the scene. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">Kaede laughed heartily at her behavior.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">As Alvis regained her senses, Benimaru could feel embarrassment creeping over him at Momiji’s reaction.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">Y’know, Hakuro could stay calm through anything… As sudden as this proposal is, if that’s all it takes to throw me, I still have much to learn…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">He took the moment to reflect.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">…But still, this is way too sudden…</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">In the end, it was agreed that he would bring the question of Momiji back home to think over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">This was all entirely Kaede’s idea, and she had no interest in forcing anyone into it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.3">It was something she thought it’d be nice to see, and if it actually happened, why, all the better. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.4">As for the rest of Tempest’s demands, she largely agreed—the tunnel through the mountain was still an issue, but </span><a id="page-266"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">she gave them permission to construct the highway to Thalion any way they pleased.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">But their talks didn’t end there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">Apart from potentially marrying Momiji off to Benimaru, Kaede also expressed an interest in building a constructive relationship between the demon lord Rimuru and the tengu race.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">It may not have been obvious, but Kaede suffered from an illness. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">At least, that was the backstory; the truth was a bit different. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.3">She did indeed lose the majority of her remaining power bringing Momiji into the world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.4">The birth and the subsequent “naming” of the child took place fifteen years ago, and it consumed nearly all the force of a woman once lauded as the goddess of the mountains. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.5">Death would be coming for her sooner rather than later, and that was why she wanted to find someone to back up and support her dear, inexperienced daughter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.6">Benimaru’s visit was a coincidence, but to Kaede, he brought hope—a final hope, gifted to her by her former lover Hakuro.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">If he turns me down, so be it</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">, thought Kaede. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">You’re still there, aren’t you, with Sir Rimuru? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">I thought you would die before I did, but I see I was very happily mistaken. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.3">And won’t seeing Momiji remind you of our own past a little?</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">After some contemplation, Kaede agreed to postpone any concrete marriage plans. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">And with that, Momiji herself made her way to meet with the demon lord Rimuru in person.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">It was a pretty headache-inducing tale—and one representing the greatest danger Benimaru had experienced in his life. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">He described it as scarier than the first time he met me, which I wasn’t sure how to take. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.3">Maybe that was just his sense of humor.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Regardless, this was why Momiji had been sent here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">If she landed such a clean hit on Alvis, you wouldn’t want to underestimate her in battle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">Honestly, I was glad she wasn’t hostile to us anymore.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">…But really, I couldn’t dodge the real question any longer.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Hakuro had a daughter all this time? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">No way.</span></em></p>
<p><a id="page-267"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">I was in a panic over it, worried that it’d balloon into a huge issue, but there wasn’t much to be done about it until I met her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">Besides, this wasn’t something Benimaru and I could solve alone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.3">We needed to hear from Hakuro, who had just as large a stake in this—but I didn’t want to hurry him over here needlessly, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.4">So I decided to shelve the issue until he came back.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">And come back he did, the previous night, after his journey to Farmus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">The three of us held a little chat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.3">I had no idea what the tengu would demand from us or what would happen with them at all, so we decided to save their audience for the final day. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.4">I was planning to call for Hakuro if he still wasn’t around by then, but fortunately I didn’t need to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.5">Not that his timeliness solved a lot of problems, either.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">Benimaru and Momiji marrying was strictly an issue between the two of them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">I didn’t mind if they said yes; it didn’t really seem to affect me at all, but…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">“Wait just a minute!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">Benimaru began. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.3">“I—I have my own issues to think about, you realize!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">“What do you mean?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">Hakuro countered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">“Do you not like my daughter?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">“I am not saying that! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">Besides, why are you acting like a father </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">now</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">You’ve never met her in your life. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.3">You didn’t even know she existed!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">“Well, now that I do, I have a certain responsibility for her, do I not?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">Hakuro seemed to be relishing Benimaru’s consternation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">It only made the problem worse. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">We kept talking all night, but it never really came to a conclusion—so here, in the audience chamber, I was going to be forced to wing it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">.........</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">......</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">The beautiful girl sat down on a hastily prepared chair in front of me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">The colorful white-to-red gradient of her hair was indeed beautiful. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">This was the Momiji I had heard so much about, representing </span><a id="page-268"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">the tengu elder here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">She gave me a haughty look and began to speak.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">“Demon lord Rimuru, it is good to meet you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">My name is Momiji, and I have come here on behalf of the elder of the tengu race. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.3">I look forward to working with you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">“You’re very kind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">My name’s Rimuru, and I’ve become a demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.3">I’m in human form now, as you can see, but I’m actually a slime. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.4">In general, I’m pretty much a pacifist, so if you have any problems, don’t be afraid to hit me up.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">“There is no need for such concern. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">The way you have conquered the Forest of Jura was breathtaking to witness. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.3">We recognize you as the ruler of the forest and look forward to being a good neighbor to you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.4">However, we will not allow you to interfere in our affairs.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">She was saying that in front of all my officials. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">I could see Shion’s eyebrow twitch a little, but luckily no one reacted further. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.3">I hadn’t explained the full story to her yet, so she actually stopped herself that time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.4">That was a new change in her, as of late; she no longer responded to small things in her usual exaggerated fashion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.5">That was a good trend to see, if a little creepy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.6">Hopefully she wasn’t just bottling it all in, only to have it explode later.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">Momiji, meanwhile, was waiting with bated breath to see how I’d reply. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">She put up a bold, dignified act, so you wouldn’t notice unless it was pointed out to you, but I’m sure her nerves were killing her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.3">She must not have been sure whether I was friend or foe yet.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">Declaring her allegiance would’ve been fine, I thought, but the pride her race had in themselves must have forbidden that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">A young, inexperienced ruler faces doom if people look down on them, after all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.3">I can understand that—even though it seemed like Momiji had the support of the younger tengu warrior classes.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.2">I understand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.3">Certainly, we don’t have any interest in unduly interfering with you, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.4">As I think Benimaru here explained to you, we just want to build a highway around the base of the Khusha Mountains. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.5">Also, just to be sure, you recognize the rights of the high orcs who have already moved into the mountains, right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">“Yes, that is not a problem. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">I make no exclusive claims to the </span><a id="page-269"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">right to enjoy the mountains’ blessings. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">You may mine the ore as much as you want—we have no need for it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.3">We only wish to be left alone.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">Um…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">The mountainous areas were considered part of the Forest of Jura’s territory. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">I had braced myself for some sort of complaining about that, but I guess it’s not a problem. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.3">So what were the tengu so on edge about? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.4">She acted pretty prickly toward Alvis; was there a fight between them and Carillon during his demon lord days? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.5">I decided it was safest to just ask directly.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">“Um, so I don’t know what you’re so on guard about, but we really have no intention of starting a conflict with you, so…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">“You want me to believe that?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">“Yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">I mean, have I said or done anything to make you suspect I’ve got my eyes on expanding my territory?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">Momiji eyed me carefully, judging my intentions once again.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">“You associate with that crafty bird woman Frey. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">That’s all the evidence I need to recognize your ambitions!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.3">she retorted.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">I can safely say I did not see that one coming.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">“Whoa, time-out!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">“What does time-out mean?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">“It means stop! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">We need to discuss some things!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">I called my administration over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">Momiji agreed to this—with some complaints, I think, but I wasn’t really paying attention.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">“What do you think of that?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">I asked once we were all in a circle.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">“The former demon lord Frey’s territory is connected to the Khusha Mountains,” Soei quickly replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">“I could imagine some conflicts with the tengu erupting along those lines.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">I consulted the world map in my mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">True enough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.3">The tengu settlement was outside the Forest itself, so fighting for it wouldn’t violate any noncompete contracts. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.4">They might’ve tried to invade at one point.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">“But why, though?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">“I can’t think of any reason,” Benimaru said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">He must not have noticed anything amiss during his visit.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">“I have heard rumors. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">It is said that Frey likes high places. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.3">As </span><a id="page-270"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">her second name of the Sky Queen suggests, perhaps she’s endeavored to move her capital to the tallest place within access to her?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">Hakuro offered.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">That didn’t sound quite right to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">Benimaru himself said the tengu stronghold was an idyllic enclave on the other side of a cave at the peak of a mountain—in other words, a small plane of space on another dimension. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.3">That’s not the kind of thing Frey would want.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">“Hmm…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">We all murmured to one another. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">Then:</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">“Whoa!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">I leaped up at the sound of someone shouting in my ear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">Momiji was there, fuming and sick of waiting any longer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.3">This time, I definitely couldn’t tune her out.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">I gave up and sat back in my seat, facing her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">“Let me ask you a question. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">Does Frey have ambitions on tengu territory?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">“Huhhh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">Of all the stupid things to ask…” She rolled her eyes, then realized I was being serious. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.3">“You’re kidding me,” she muttered.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">It sounded like we weren’t on the same page at all here, so I decided to let her tell her side of the story.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">As she put it, Frey’s aim was to capture Elmin Thalion, capital of the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">She wanted it not for its territory, but for its height.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">I sure wasn’t expecting that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">It was very in character for her, but I couldn’t laugh about it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">In terms of size, Thalion was a huge country. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.2">Frey didn’t have the military resources to overwhelm it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.3">However, while the nation enjoyed a geographical advantage against ground-based armies, against Frey and her aerial forces, they would face tougher going. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.4">Tactically, they were an even match, but Frey refused to let her ambitions stay just ambitions forever.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">That was why she had turned her attention on the tengu. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.2">She wanted to bring them under her rule, shoring up her resources for a later assault on Thalion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.3">But the tengu were too proud for that, </span><a id="page-271"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">not ready to so easily accept Frey’s demands. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.2">Thalion, expecting this, hoped for the two sides to erupt into conflict with each other, which would take the heat off them and also let them profit from the ensuing war.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">Frey was fully aware of that, however, and that stayed her hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">The result was this three-way détente that, frankly, looked pretty twisted to me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">While all that was going on, I fought against Clayman, and once the dust settled, Carillon and Frey gave up their posts and resolved to serve the demon lord Milim. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">It was the birth of a new superpower, one the tengu alone could never fend off, and now their government was in a heated debate over how to hold themselves going forward.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">And then Benimaru came along, taking one of the Three Lycanthropeers with him. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">Bad</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1"> idea. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.2">Momiji mistook that as my attempt to silently apply pressure on her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">“How’s Frey been lately?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.2">I asked Geld. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.3">As the person responsible for building a new capital city, he had been taking orders from Frey, making him the most familiar with her out of our little group.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">“Well, Sir Rimuru, Lady Frey seems tremendously satisfied with your plans. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">As taciturn as Mildo is, the two have gotten along well, and she’s been participating in some very detailed planning meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">Frey found a way to make Mildo talk? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.2">That’s impressive.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">So has she lost interest in Elmin Thalion?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">“Lost interest? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.2">I’d say her interests lie in…um…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">“In?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">“Well… Lately, I haven’t seen Lady Milim around. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">Lady Frey had been teaching her about governance and the like, but apparently she ran off on her unawares.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">Oh, right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.2">I’m pretty sure I know where she is. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.3">For the sake of this conversation, though, let’s pretend that I don’t. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.4">Let sleeping dogs lie, and all that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">“As a result, I’d say that Lady Frey’s primary focus at the moment is figuring out where Lady Milim went,” concluded Geld.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">The gigantic capital building project, skyscrapers and all, had </span><a id="page-272"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">completely charmed Frey. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">It turned her interest away from any other potential capital she could conquer; they all paled in comparison. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.3">Milim, as Geld put it, was the bigger issue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.4">And Momiji, listening to all this stuff going against what she imagined, was stunned into silence, unable to figure out how to react.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">I couldn’t blame her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">That’s reality for you—a force who you assume wants you and your people dead, and all of a sudden, their focus is on something else entirely. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.3">If it happened to you, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">you’d</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1"> probably want to run away from reality, too.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">“…All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.2">I understand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.3">So there you have it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.4">If you recognize all that as the misunderstanding it was, I’m cool with that.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">It could be said that tengu were not terribly wise in the ways of the world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">The worry that they were surrounded by enemies had clouded Momiji’s judgment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.3">Based on her situation, I could see why she made the decision she did.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">“So I was imagining it all along…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.2">Mother </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1"> say I was overthinking matters…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">She slumped back in her chair, the strength drained from her body. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">It was a lesson for all present: Jumping to conclusions can bite you hard.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">With that behind us, our talks quickly came to a close.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">Since Momiji was still a little out of it, one of the tengu warriors looked over the pact we were to sign in her stead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">I thought these were bodyguards, but I guess they served as government staff, too.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">The tunnel question would be saved for later. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">We wouldn’t be allowed to start on it, I was told, until we could prove it was safe. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.3">That made sense to me, so I didn’t make a big deal out of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.4">We needed to talk to Thalion about building a tunnel anyway, and it wouldn’t really get underway until we finished developing trains, so there was no need to set anything in stone quite yet.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">The tengu didn’t want us to interfere with them because they mistakenly thought we were prepping for an invasion, but now that we’d addressed that misunderstanding, nothing stopped us from </span><a id="page-273"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">having normal relations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.2">So we agreed to help each other out, in case something ever happened.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">“…So is that all?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">“Yes,” the tengu aide said with a bow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.2">“My thanks to you, Demon Lord, for allowing us to conduct such constructive negotiations.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">So things were square with Momiji. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.2">Our pact was signed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.3">Now we needed to talk about Momiji and Hakuro’s relationship—and Benimaru and Momiji’s potential marriage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.4">We failed to reach a conclusion on that last night.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">Momiji started the day hostile toward us, but that had presumably changed now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.2">Should we maybe work this out just with the people directly involved?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">As I debated with myself over how to broach the topic, the tengu aide took out a sealed envelope.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">“There is also the matter of this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.2">Our elder, Lady Kaede, has this letter for you, Lord Rimuru.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">He respectfully handed it to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.2">Rigurd accepted it, and Shuna handled opening and reading it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.3">It began with the sort of verbose, convoluted greetings you often saw in royal correspondence, probing me a bit to guess at where my disposition was, but grew less formal as it went on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.4">Shuna’s face contorted in confusion as she read on.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">“‘…I know things are complicated, and there have been a few misunderstandings, but I hope you will treat my daughter well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.2">I remind you of what she told me about making Sir Benimaru turn toward her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.3">I am sure she is not against the idea—’”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">Momiji leaped back to her feet, snatching the letter out of Shuna’s hands. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.2">Rude of her, but I’d just pretend I didn’t see it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.3">Couldn’t blame her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.4">If I were Momiji, I don’t know what </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">I</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1"> would’ve done, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.2">This goes beyond infamy and straight into humiliation.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">Hakuro, smirking, walked up to Momiji, taking the crumpled-up letter out of her hand and giving her a nod.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">Um, what…?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">Here I was, nodding my approval at this lovely little family reunion, and now the conversation was going kind of haywire. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.2">Talk about bridging a major gap. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.3">Hakuro, usually gruff and reserved even in the best of times, suddenly had a daughter…and it turned him into a weepy, doting parent.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">“Uh, Hakuro…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">Benimaru’s words failed to reach him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.2">He and Momiji were in their own little world.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">“Oh, now I see,” Shuna murmured.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">Everyone’s eyes turned toward her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.2">She paid it no mind as she addressed Benimaru, who was looking straight at her.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">The message, given with Alvis’s accent, was this:</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">Come to think of it, Gobta had a point there, in the end. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.2">I began to wonder if this was the start of an envious romantic rivalry between Benimaru and him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.3">But still, Alvis was a beautiful, reliable woman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.4">Momiji was a little headstrong but still a nice little-sister type. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.5">Between them and all the other girls aiming for a chance, Gobta was right—Benimaru </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1"> have something of a harem going. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.2">Not that he wanted one…</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">“Well, not so fast,” Soei replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.2">“Benimaru </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">is</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1"> something of a late bloomer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.2">I would not call him particularly adept with the opposite sex. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.3">He </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">acts</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1"> tough, but I’m sure he is just as confused as all of us.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">My thoughts were exactly the same. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.2">Having all this attention would be nothing but trouble for Benimaru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.3">Shuna was watching him, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.4">I had a feeling Benimaru cared a lot for her sister, so I’m sure he was sensing danger from her and her overbearing ways right now.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">“But I think it’s nice,” Geld said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.2">“As manly a man as Sir Benimaru is, it’s only natural the women around town would love him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.3">Lady Alvis is leader of the Three Lycanthropeers, and I suppose Momiji is the daughter of Hakuro—both worthy partners. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.4">I have a lot to learn from him.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">He certainly seemed enthusiastic about the idea of Benimaru finding a wife, harem or not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.2">Geld himself cared more about his work than chasing women, so I wasn’t sure whether he really meant the part about having a “lot to learn.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">Besides, Geld was already pretty popular. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.2">As quiet, serious-minded, and responsible as he was, he had a fan base among not just high orcs, but other races as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.3">If he got off his ass and did something about it, he’d have a partner in no time.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-277"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">“Oh, no, you are doing well enough for yourself, Sir Geld! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.2">Like I said before, Toka and the others never give me a second glance… For some reason, only the men show me any kindness in my unit,” Gabil insisted.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">Geld nodded sagely. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.2">“You just need more chances to encounter women. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.3">I understand that a little.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.4">He mostly worked on construction sites manned by burly male workers, so I bet he did.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">Someone like me with no gender—or maybe an amphibian where gender was just a messy topic to begin with—was one thing, but building a work environment where women could participate equally was probably important, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.2">It’d help encourage the men more, maybe. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.3">I’d have to think about that.</span></p>

<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">Wow, Gobta. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.2">Way to throw him under the bus.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">Gazatt was one of Gabil’s underlings, part of Team Hiryu—quiet and handy with a spear, but not exactly the sharpest nail in the box, so he was mainly tasked with guard duty for our researchers and pharmacists down in the Sealed Cave. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">He was a former lizardman, of course, and even now as a dragonewt, his looks, much like Gabil’s, were more reptilian. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.3">As cruelly as Gobta put it, it definitely proved that looks aren’t everything.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">“Very much so,” he said, half-chidingly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.2">“A lady knight from before, for example. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.3">I am unsure how she got the idea, but she seemed to have quite an interest in me.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1">Our little whispered chat was over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.2">We immediately shot straight back up, faces serious. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.3">Sensing the danger, I slipped back into slime mode and attempted to escape the front line but instead found myself lifted up by a thin, pale arm.</span></p>

<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">Anyway…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">Well, not that thinking about this issue would get us any closer to solving it.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">“Besides, for higher-level magic-born like ourselves, siring a child is not a simple task. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.2">Some people have many wives and they impregnate each, who must compete with one another to give birth, but I have little interest in that approach. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.3">I do not intend to keep any concubines.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">Momiji watched Benimaru starry-eyed as she spoke.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">No harem, it sounded like—or no polygamy, to be exact. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.2">No real </span><a id="page-280"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">reason to adopt that in Tempest, unless we were forced to because of a glut of widows or something.</span></p>
