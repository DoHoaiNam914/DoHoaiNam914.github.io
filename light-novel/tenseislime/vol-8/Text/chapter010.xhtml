<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">In short, she was the epitome of harmony in motion—a high elf, one of the most supreme beings in the land.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">The archduke found himself smitten for a moment at this beauty but quickly regained his senses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">His wife and daughter would be furious with him if he didn’t. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.3">Clearing his throat, he turned to the exquisite wood-carved seat Elmesia was sitting on.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“Your Excellency, the nation of monsters I have reported to you about has sent me an invitation.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Erald took a letter out from his pocket, presenting it to her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">He had already checked it for traps or hidden poisons, and he knew what it read, but he did not say it out loud; he was fully aware of how the emperor disliked people telling her things before she could see them for herself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">But he had his concerns. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">I truly never expected that slime would ever be recognized as a demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">But even if he has…why would he call someone like me to this coronation of sorts?</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">The letter Erald presented to the emperor was, in fact, addressed to him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">There was no need to show it to Elmesia. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">But as the letter put it: </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Please reply if able to attend, providing the number of participants you wish to bring.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1"> He interpreted this to mean he could bring as many plus-ones as he felt like. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">But who should join him? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">That was the rub. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.4">Some bodyguards would be a must, but the archduke could hardly show up alone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.5">Many of the nobles he had previously reported his travels to expressed keen interests in visiting for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">With Tempest becoming a new trade partner, courtly circles across the Sorcerous Dynasty were alive with talk of this new land. </span><a id="page-96"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">And the fascination was hardly exclusive to the nobility. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">When the emperor received the initial report of Erald’s audience with the demon lord Rimuru, her eyes had been cold and focused as she gave her response:</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">“…Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">So you went off to this fabulous land all by yourself? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.3">Well, weren’t you fortunate, Erald. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.4">I imagine it was quite the exciting experience. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.5">And why did you leave me behind, hmm? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.6">Even naming yourself my representative and establishing ties with them, no less? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.7">If our business with them was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1"> that </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">important, I would have liked to involve myself with it, wouldn’t you agree?”</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">She had a point. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">But Erald came to Tempest on the pretense of rescuing his daughter, and what he found was a literal nation of monsters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">He may have transferred his spirit into the body of a homunculus, but there was no telling what could have befallen him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.4">There was no way he could have guaranteed Elmesia’s safety if he took her there.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">But the emperor gave him no quarter. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“If</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1"> that </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">is the charming sort of slime you met, I wish I could have seen him for myself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">And meeting with a demon lord so soon after his birth? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">Why, I’ve lived for many, many years, and not even I have been graced with that opportunity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.4">And look at you, hogging it for yourself! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.5">Does the term</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1"> abandonment </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">mean anything to you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Imagine, being treated this way by my own people. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">What a pitiful leader I am…”</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">She had continued in this vein for a bit longer before wrapping it up like so:</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">“I’ve never been so envious—um, so</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1"> offended </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">in my life, I don’t think. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">You, taking in all this excite—ahhh, risking all this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1"> danger </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">and going off by yourself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">It is scandalous!”</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Elmesia’s rebuke was really more whining than scolding. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">Most of her vassals only knew her unreadable mask and assumed the heart beneath was just as icy; she only showed this side of her personality to Archduke Erald and one other, although Erald took the brunt of it. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">If only they knew what’s</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1"> actually </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">underneath</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">, he always thought.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">However, thanks to the emperor’s pouting, the budget for this effort had been frozen, their plans to share technology with Tempest delayed for the time being. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">Erald wanted to soothe her hurt </span><a id="page-97"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">feelings about it all so they could get the ball rolling on the tech swap again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">If he decided to join the festivities solo without informing Elmesia, he’d most certainly be inviting her rage upon him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">By that point, he feared, the frozen budget would be the least of his worries.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">This demon lord coronation was, in its own way, a show of force. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">It was devised to display Rimuru’s strength as demon lord to the nations around him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">They would be holding a festival in conjunction, along with assorted unspecified but large-scale entertainment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.4">There was no way the eternally bored Elmesia would pass up an opportunity to attend such an exciting-sounding event. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.5">Erald knew she’d sniff it out, then interrogate him about not reporting it to her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.6">The potential consequences for her wrath were beyond imagination.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">Thus, Erald opted to hide nothing and just show her the letter.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Now she lifted her head, fresh from reading it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">Erald sat up straight in his seat.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“So what do you intend to do with this?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Elmesia asked.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“Do what, Your Excellency?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">He was buying time, but Erald knew what Elmesia meant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">He knew, but he couldn’t say it himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">If the emperor was going to join the festivities, this was now an official state visit, and that took the entire administration to prepare for. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.4">It was too significant a thing for Erald to suggest from his own lips. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.5">He wanted to be sure anything that came from this meeting was, first and foremost, the emperor’s idea.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“Mmm, playing dumb, are we? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Do you know, Erald, of the sweet pastries we procured from that man Yoshida’s bakery? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">They’re far tastier than they used to be, aren’t they? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.4">Could you venture a guess as to why?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Erald fell silent. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">This change of subject was unexpected.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">“Or are you saying a strategic genius such as yourself is oblivious to the goings-on in the streets? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">What a disappointment.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“I apologize, Your Excellency. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">By Yoshida, you refer to the baker who runs the establishment in Englesia you enjoy so much? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">I believe the kingdom provides for his personal safety as an otherworlder, </span><a id="page-98"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">despite his lack of fighting skill. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">I was unaware that his work was distributed to Thalion, but how is that related to Sir Rimuru’s invitation?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">If you didn’t know something, better to be honest and ask. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">Maybe you can’t get away from that if you’re dealing with a stranger, but Erald was intimately familiar with the emperor—she even let him look at her unobscured face, a right granted to a tiny handful of people in Thalion.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“You truly claim not to know, then? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">Ellwyn brought some samples back several years ago as a souvenir. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">I suppose she didn’t see fit to give </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">you</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1"> any.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“She </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">what</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">The revelation that his own daughter declined to save any for him hurt harder than expected. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Elmesia was clearly gratified to see this.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">Seeing your expression is all I need. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">Let me tell you, then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.4">Yoshida, it seems, has found a new source for his ingredients. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.5">It’s allowed him to greatly expand the diversity of his wares, and the quality of his work has improved to match. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.6">In addition, in exchange for some monetary support, he’s been willing to send a supply of his goods to us.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">Erald was well aware of Kaoru Yoshida. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">Like his fellow otherworlders, he’d been the subject of much investigation and eventually pinpointed in the capital city of Englesia where he was running a café and sweet shop. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">He was said to lack any special skills, although that was unconfirmed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.4">His talents as a pastry chef, however, were undoubtedly top-of-the-line, enough so that he counted the grand master of the Free Guild as a grateful client. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.5">There were even rumors of Hinata, the Saint, sneaking in after closing hours to avoid attracting a crowd.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Thus, Erald already knew him as a successful tradesman, but Elmesia wasn’t done speaking yet.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">“So you know I invited Yoshida here once. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">Ellwyn, you see, brought along the most tremendous cake I’ve ever had. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.3">I was hoping I could have him become the empire’s official dessert specialist. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.4">But he turned me down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.5">No matter how much money I stacked on the table, Yoshida refused to come here…”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-99"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">The way she put it, Yoshida wasn’t the kind of man who was moved by money. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">Instead, she made do with having a small selection of “souvenirs” purchased for her. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">Your Excellency, what are you doing?!!</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1"> Erald resisted shouting the thought out loud. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">But she still wasn’t done.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">“Recently, Yoshida apparently sent word that he’d be closing soon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">I’m not sure if he’s moving or opening up another location… But losing my dessert supply during his hiatus would be a nigh unbearable blow, wouldn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">“Not especially, no.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">“Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">That’s what you have to say to me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.3">Ellwyn is quite fond of that bakery, you know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.4">If their wares remained easily obtainable, I’m sure she’d be glad to ferry my orders back here.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">“Wh-what?!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">This was monumental news. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">Erald thought his daughter hadn’t come near Thalion for years. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.3">Elmesia’s revelation was a heavy blow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.4">He already knew the two bodyguards assigned to her weren’t exactly the most reliable agents out there, but he hadn’t heard a word of this from the other observers he had hired to watch over her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.5">He resolved to rake them over the coals about this later, but for now, he had to press Elmesia for more.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">“This is grave news, is it not?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">“Oh, yes, it is! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">But I’ve used some of my authority—and funds—to obtain some rather interesting information.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">“Well, of all the places, it turns out that this baker is seriously considering a move to the nation you visited, Tempest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">So tell me, what were you doing over there?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">This actually jogged Erald’s memory a bit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">Every meal he had at Tempest was a delight; his daughter Elen practically wept tears of joy at first sight of their dessert selection. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">He even recalled her jumping up and down: “Ah, Shuna’s perfectly re-created that new recipe!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.4">and the like.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">“Ahhh… Was </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1"> what she meant?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">Erald cried as the pieces fell into place.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-100"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">Elmesia sighed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">“Are you sure you still have all your marbles, Archduke?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">Erald wasn’t so sure any longer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">“I—I am sorry,” he apologized, and he was entirely sincere.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Now he saw what the empress was displeased about. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">She suspected that Erald was hoarding all the sweets for himself—something he never would’ve done, even if it </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1"> for his daughter’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">“Nothing is ever too good for your daughter, after all…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Now, at least, Erald’s name had been cleared. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">Instead, Elmesia was now busy yelling at him about being totally oblivious to everything. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.3">Erald dutifully accepted it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">“But, Your Excellency, how will we respond to Sir Rimuru?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Elmesia gave her companion a satisfied grin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">“Yes…well…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">She was acting all stately about it but didn’t seem too interested in giving an answer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">It irked Erald, but he wasn’t foolish enough to offer his own words. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">As stated, the emperor visiting a foreign land was a national-level project. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.4">If Erald brought up the idea first, he could see himself being shouted down by criticism. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.5">People would get in his way; it’d turn into a big mess.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">The Sorcerous Dynasty was established by the emperor Elmesia, its sorcerous sovereign, and the thirteen royal families and other rulers under her gave her their total loyalty. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">In general, each family was responsible for governing their own fiefdoms, while the imperial court ran on the taxes they provided. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.3">None of the royal families had their own standing armies; all of that was concentrated on the empire side. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.4">The emperor was Thalion’s commander in chief, responsible for arbitrating across fiefdoms and nations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.5">Erald was born into one of these thirteen families; his mother, Ellis Grimwald, was the matriarch who ran it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.6">This Ellis was also the grandmother of Elmesia herself—the only other person in Erald’s life he was forced to submit to.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Erald’s elder brother, the father of Elmesia, had been killed in battle with monsters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">It was an event that happened both before Thalion’s founding and well before Erald was even born. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">It made Elmesia his </span><a id="page-101"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">niece, even though she had lived far longer than him—another reason he owed her at least some respect.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">What about the other royal families besides Ellis’s? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">They were, to say the least, often very peculiar. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.3">Some holed up in their domains, refusing to take any part in imperial administration, while others took advantage of their posts to actively participate in internal politics. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.4">Elmesia never made any policy statements herself, so a number of local nobles struggled to gain power for themselves instead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.5">As archduke, one of Erald’s tasks was to keep an eye on people.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">That was why he had to be careful here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">If this was just a pleasure trip, that was one thing, but many people would fault him for organizing a journey to a literal monster den. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">It could give them an excuse to strip him of his position. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.4">He personally doubted it, but some of the nobles might have even been scheming to eliminate the emperor from the picture entirely. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.5">To keep that from happening, he knew he had to be thoroughly prepared.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">“Aw, you worry too much, Erald.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">“Y-Your Excellency?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">“No matter what those little fish think, none could ever exact revenge against me.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Elmesia was changed now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">She looked, and felt, like a ruler—an emperor with absolute power, one who never allowed rebellion even once in her life. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">As long-lived as she was, all the great kings and leaders of the world—even Erald himself—looked like nothing but a street gang formed of children.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">Erald tensed up and nervously swallowed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">He could speak frankly with her thanks to sharing a bloodline, but technically speaking, she was far, far above him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.3">He was lauded as a champion of the people himself, but Elmesia was on a whole other level. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.4">It was impossible </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">not</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1"> to be nervous around her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">“That demon lord… His name was Rimuru, yes?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">she said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.3">“We cannot let our guard down.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">“…How do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">She was stating the obvious. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">He was strong, obviously, and you couldn’t discount the leadership he showed guiding his monsters. </span><a id="page-102"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">And there was never a demon lord who tried to build cooperative relationships with the nations around them before. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">But Elmesia wasn’t one to verbalize such an obvious point—hence why Erald asked for clarification.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">“Hee-hee… This Rimuru; he rather easily accepted our request to build a highway to Thalion, didn’t he?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">He asked for rights to things like tolls and customs fees, but he accepted the full construction job on his end.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">“And there’s the issue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">Those rights could grant him an absolute fortune. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.3">Can’t you see that looking at me, Erald?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">She was back to her usual casual self. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">Erald knew what she meant.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">“Ah, those revenue sources?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">Erald, too, realized early on that Rimuru was aiming for exactly that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">That was why he thought carefully before giving him those rights. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.3">But now Elmesia was giving him a supercilious chuckle.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">“You have a lot to learn, still. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">Long-lived species like ourselves can plan matters so we profit in the long term. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.3">You </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">do</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1"> realize that, do you not?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">“Of course. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">I made my decision after judging the passage fees the demon lord Rimuru could charge versus the money it would take for us to build the highway.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">By his calculations, any tolls they’d pay would be far cheaper. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">Attempting to build a paved path through the Forest of Jura, as monster-laden as it was, would require countless years and a massive budget. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.3">The Khusha Mountains at the forest’s border were ruled by the organized, warlike tengu. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.4">Working with them would be a slog—and once you were done with </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">them</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">, there were hundreds of other monsters and magical beasts to deal with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">Even discounting them, the complex geography posed a major problem. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.3">It’d require tunnels dug through mountains, bridges strung across canyons, and workers who’d need round-the-clock protection the entire way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.4">It’d be a century-long project, and while that wasn’t out of the question for an empire with Thalion’s resources, it was doubtful they’d ever see a return on their investment.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">With all that in mind, Rimuru’s offer was music to Erald’s ears.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">“How naive of you,” Elmesia said, shattering Erald’s confidence. </span><a id="page-103"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">“Certainly, crafting a highway in the forest is a daunting task. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">It has never been tried before because there was no benefit to it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">She began guiding Erald through the issues involved.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">Just as he thought, there would be no profit from the project. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">It was rife with challenges, and there was no point to having a road through the forest anyway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.3">But that was in the past. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.4">Before, the highway would’ve had to go all the way to the Dwarven Kingdom—now, all it had to do was reach Tempest, the new nation in the middle of the woods. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.5">Also, there was now a purpose to the highway—trade. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.6">Working with the dwarves could have improved Thalion’s technology, but there were too many obstacles in the way to achieve that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.7">Now, with Tempest on the scene, things had changed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">“The southern demon lord domains are ruled by Milim, alongside Carillon, the Beast Master, and Frey, the Sky Queen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">With all the military might they boast, they are set to become dazzlingly prosperous. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.3">Beyond that, we have the Western Nations to the northwest and the Armed Nation of Dwargon to the north. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.4">This new nation, Tempest, is nestled right between them, is it not?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">“…It is, yes.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">Erald felt he understood what Elmesia was driving at. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">He still didn’t see how that meant he had erred. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.3">Things change over time, after all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.4">That land had no value up to now, but as Elmesia pointed out, it now had boundless potential. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.5">Situated at a key location between multiple forces, it was bound to become a meeting point for all their cultures…and it was destined to grow rapidly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.6">That was what the demon lord Rimuru wanted, and this was why Erald—deftly realizing this ahead of the crowd—wanted to firm up relations with him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.7">But building a road to this new nation, as he knew full well, was a high-cost, high-risk endeavor.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">They knew Rimuru had engaged in armed conflict with the Crusaders not long ago. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">The battle, which ended overwhelmingly in Rimuru’s favor, reportedly featured far fewer casualties than what the world saw in Farmus’s invasion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.3">It showed how confident the monsters were in this fight, although some criticized the demon lord for going easy on his foes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.4">For someone who knew the inside truth, it was enough to make you swear off attacking Tempest forever, but there were plenty of clueless people out there looking to test their strength. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.5">This wouldn’t discourage them, and Erald was concerned Tempest would see more conflict going forward, not less.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">In the headquarters of a trading company in the Kingdom of Blumund, Gard Mjöllmile was starting to wonder if this constant stream of visitors would ever end.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">As a merchant who held sway over a litany of commercial ventures, Mjöllmile had a knack for accurately judging people with a single glance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">Some people came to him purely in search of money; others arrived seeking new business ventures. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.3">Occasionally, he’d see nobles who’d fallen on hard times, approaching him with all manner of fishy-sounding offers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.4">He was sick of dealing with them all, but sometimes he’d actually see people with real, concrete money-making ventures for him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.5">That was why he refused to leave this job to someone else.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">These facts were on his mind as he shooed away yet another charlatan and asked the next client to come in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">This was a well-dressed man, but Mjöllmile wasn’t fooled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.3">The fabric of his clothing was of decent quality, but the style was outdated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.4">He couldn’t afford a custom outfit in the latest fashion, so he was making do with last year’s model. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.5">No, this man wouldn’t be worth his time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.6">He was one of those hard-luck nobles, and he had already approached Mjöllmile once before, attempting to palm off random junk as pricey antiques he’d let him have for a song.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">Doubtlessly, he was here on another get-rich-quick scheme—but still, he </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1"> of noble blood. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.2">Mjöllmile had checked into him enough to know that for a fact, so he couldn’t just show him the door on sight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.3">That sort of behavior could lead to lèse-majesté, and then he’d have to worry less about his financial ledgers and more about his life. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.4">It made the job tricky for him, to say the least.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">Ah, here we go again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">The two of us, trying to outfox each other…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">So Mjöllmile heard him out—and just as he thought, the story </span><a id="page-107"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">made him wish he’d hidden under the table. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.2">This man (the Viscount Cazac was his name) was seeking a financial investment so he could use slaves to open a shop for him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.3">The merchant saw, to be brutally frank, no chance that it would ever succeed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.4">Employing attractive female slaves wouldn’t be nearly enough to make the business work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.5">Cazac needed to thoroughly analyze the market, his client base, and his potential location, not to mention employee costs.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">Telling him all this, of course, was like explaining calculus to a pig.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">“Huhhh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">Why can’t you decide on a location for me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.3">And you speak of employee costs? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.4">Now what sort of fool </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">pays</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1"> their slaves?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">The viscount wasn’t interested in hearing any of Mjöllmile’s objections. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">“Payment” wasn’t exactly what he meant, only that slaves need food like anyone else. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.3">And clothing, and a place to sleep. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.4">Not to mention the up-front costs for them would be far from trivial. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.5">If you wanted a slave attractive enough to catch the eye of most people, the money you’d need to expend on the search could buy you a decent house. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.6">It’d be a far more effective use of funding to just hire part-time staff, much like Mjöllmile did with the public-fronting stores he ran in Englesia.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">As he saw it, all beauties age over time, and thus it was too difficult to make back your investment on forced labor in situations like that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">If you were aiming for quick profits running a sexually themed establishment, you needed to be even more careful laying the foundations, or else your place would become a hive of disease—which, again, would make both Cazac and Mjöllmile criminals.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">The merchant sighed to himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.2">There was no way in this lifetime that he’d ever accept such a hazardous proposal.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">“Yes, indeed, my good viscount, you have a discerning eye. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.2">I must take my hat off to your wisdom. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.3">However, regarding the slaves you mention, I fear it may be difficult to procure them at this time, would it not? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.4">Human trafficking is banned in this kingdom, and even if you turn to the illegal trade, I fear you may not find the quality you are looking for, you see.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">He tried his best to make his rejection sound as inoffensive as possible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">It didn’t work.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-108"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">“Ah…well, about that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.2">I actually have an in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.3">I’ll tell you about it, too, if you’re willing to invest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.4">But you know, I have to keep this discreet… All I’ll say for now is that there’s a certain </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">elf</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1"> in the picture.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">The way Cazac never missed an opportunity to put on airs rankled Mjöllmile, but he had the willpower to retain his composure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.2">A master merchant like him could never physically reveal his disdain for his customers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.3">Anyone who did was below third-rate in this trade and incapable of ever pinning down a large-scale deal.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">But this elf-slave talk piqued Mjöllmile’s interest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.2">If he was telling the truth, that was </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">beyond</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1"> a luxury commodity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.2">But even before that, Mjöllmile was a man with some influence in the underground, running a not-so-legal outfit and not afraid to engage in some dirty work now and again, albeit no more than he knew he could get away with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.3">That was why he instructed his staff in this outfit to never stray past that one, final line in their work, even though he knew he’d get off scot-free as their boss either way.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">Mjöllmile knew full well just how dangerous elven slaves were.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">Mjöllmile had an idea what this could be. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.2">He had heard about monster hunts, where rich people seeking exotic pets hired hunters to capture monsters in the forest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.3">But if a demi-human had been snared by one of these hunters—and an elf, no less—quite a few nations would never let that go by without comment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.4">The Dwarven Kingdom would immediately look into it, and the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion was even ruled by an elf. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.5">If word of this got out, it’d be a huge controversy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.6">This wasn’t a small-time pickpocket or fraud; it was the kind of thing that could trigger an international standoff.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">His mind raced, thinking of a good excuse to turn down Cazac’s offer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.2">He came up with nothing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.3">But just as he was at his wit’s end:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">“Yooooo! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.2">Mollie! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.3">Doing well?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">Someone opened the door and stepped right into their meeting, a beautiful young girl (or boy?) with golden eyes and silver hair that had a tinge of blue.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">“Who are you, and how </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">dare</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1"> you interrupt my important business meeting?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">As Cazac bellowed at the boy, Mjöllmile realized who the intruder was, stunned. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">There was no way he could forget that face, the face of the champion who’d saved his life—the demon lord Rimuru himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.3">He knew this was the leader of that nation of monsters, and hearing he had become a demon lord shocked him to the core. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.4">But he really did it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.5">He was part of the Octagram, recognized by his fellow demon lords—and for some reason, he seemed to take a liking to Mjöllmile.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">They’d often meet up, occasionally working together on potential new business ventures. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.2">Recovery potion sales, for example. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.3">Mjöllmile was still the exclusive vendor around here, and he was now earning stable profits from his work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.4">Just as things settled down with that, Rimuru approached him about developing a new type of food, “ramen,” brought in from his own world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.5">This was already on sale in a handful of restaurants, and the feedback was encouraging so far.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">Now, more recently, Rimuru had had him taste test something called a “burger,” talking about building a “chain” of restaurants specializing in their production and sale. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.2">Mjöllmile had agreed to test the concept, and right now he was busy assembling and educating a staff, as well as finding a location and outfitting it with everything needed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.3">He had wanted to report back to Rimuru about his progress, but his demon lord duties kept him fiendishly busy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.4">It had been about a month since they last spoke.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">“Well, well! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.2">If it isn’t Rimuru! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.3">I thought you said you were too caught up in this or that crisis to come visit?”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-110"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">Mjöllmile, surprised at this sudden appearance, couldn’t help but ask. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">After all, Rimuru had a thundering horde of Crusaders to deal with at the moment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.3">He even advised the merchant to avoid Tempest for a while, as it’d be too dangerous for him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.4">Fuze, guild master for the Kingdom of Blumund, was still cursing himself over his failure to stop Hinata, the Saint. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.5">So why was the lord himself here? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.6">All these thoughts immediately pushed Viscount Cazac out of Mjöllmile’s mind.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">“Stop! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.2">Please, stop! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.3">The master is seeing another visitor!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">He could hear the voice of one of his servants, someone too new to know who Rimuru was. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">Upon catching sight of him, the servant stopped in his tracks and just stared at him, slack-jawed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.3">It was a rather pathetic sight to see—but Mjöllmile couldn’t blame him, since he himself might be doing the same if he didn’t stop himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.4">It was fine if they were talking or scheming over something, but when Rimuru was his normal self, he was just so touchingly attractive, a completely different person.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">“Rimuru, you said?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">Mjöllmile ignored Cazac. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.2">Rimuru, finally noticing him, gave him an awkward look.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">“Oh, sorry. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.2">I didn’t know you were busy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.3">I’ll be waiting over at your manor, all right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.4">See ya!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">The sound of Rimuru’s voice brought Mjöllmile abruptly back to consciousness. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.2">He began to feel honest pity for Cazac, the viscount who told a demon lord “How </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">dare</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1"> you” to his face.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">If Rimuru wasn’t so easygoing, I doubt the viscount would be breathing right now…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">What you don’t know can’t hurt you, as they say, although Mjöllmile wondered if he should make an exception at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">But Cazac spoke up again, his voice raised. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.2">“Look, you little boy…or girl? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.3">What are you, Mjöllmile’s mistress or the like? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.4">Do you realize you’ve both interrupted my meeting </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">and</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1"> listened in on confidential information? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.2">Do you understand the consequences of your indiscretion, hmm?”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">Oh, by the gods, what is he saying…?</span></em></p>
<p><a id="page-111"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">Mjöllmile, seeing Cazac eye Rimuru up and down with lecherous intent, could feel his heart stop.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">“Oh, I apologize about that, sir. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.2">Nobody stopped me from barging in, so… Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">Rimuru was cheerfully apologetic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.2">But Cazac was too high-handed to forgive him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">“Hmm… You know, I like your face. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.2">Look, you could use a little instruction on how the world works, I’d say. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.3">How would you like </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">me</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1"> to look after you?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">Great. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.2">And now this.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">Why do I have to deal with these utter fools, day in, day out…?</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">Mjöllmile was beyond exasperated and well into the realm of anger. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.2">Life seemed too ridiculous to be worth it at the moment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.3">He could handle the scorn of bush-league nobility. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.4">But treating Rimuru, a man he owed a life debt to, like some harlot was unforgivable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.5">Cazac’s behavior had crossed the line and then some.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">Yes, picking a fight with a noble would put Mjöllmile at a disadvantage, in the eyes of the law—but did that mean he should just sit there and take it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.2">No. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.3">He was willing to be modest with rabble like this because it’d be a pain for him otherwise, but open hostility deserved to be treated in kind.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">The merchant steeled himself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">“Cazac, you are being rude to the individual who saved my life. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.2">Why does some viscount think he can get away with riling me?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">He was a viscount? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.2">No wonder he kept insulting me like that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.3">That would put him above the Baron of Veryard, Fuze’s friend, and I can see why it’d be so much trouble for Mjöllmile.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">We were planning to hold a grand festival, attended by the monsters of the Forest of Jura and all the world leaders from the human realms. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.2">We called it the Tempest Founder’s Festival, and we had already picked the dates for it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">With things patched up between Hinata and me, all my anxieties were gone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">The date of Yohm’s coronation as king had also been decided, and we had sent word to all the neighboring countries to help that plan along. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.3">Rigurd and his team were busy writing up invitations to the leaders we wanted there, but they weren’t the only ones in full work mode. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.4">News of the nationwide festival had riled </span><a id="page-115"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">up enthusiasm across all my domain’s monsters, and each of my administration’s departments was formulating plans to wow them during the event.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">Look at Shuna, for example. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.2">She intended to launch an entire lineup of new dishes to impress our guests, as well as open Tempest’s first café, offering a variety of colorful cakes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.3">Yoshida, whose café in Englesia was now a favorite of mine, was assisting in the effort—he had once turned down every offer I sent him, but the moment he set eyes on Shuna, I could see him start to get fidgety.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">“Be… Before I opened this café, I enjoyed the support of a great number of people. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.2">I’d be happy to help you, too, but I can’t really leave here…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">“I hope you will reconsider,” Shuna said with a polite and elegant bow, one hand over the other. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.2">It was a little show-off-y but powerful enough to shake the heart of any man. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.3">I figured it’d work well enough, but:</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">Thanks to Yoshida, this was now a cooking battle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.2">Nothing worth worrying about for Shuna, though; anyone could recognize her cuisine was first-rate.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1">“Shuna, give him everything you’ve got! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.2">Make this cocky baker beg for mercy with something spectacular!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">I ignored Yoshida’s complaining; Shuna was ready to go. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.2">Yoshida’s own skills had lit a fire under her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">With the café kitchen left to her, Shuna began cooking up the dish nearest and dearest to her heart—</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">tamagoyaki</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">, a rolled-up scrambled egg. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.2">Simple, yes, but one’s ability to execute it perfectly was the ultimate way to test a chef’s acumen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.3">Yoshida eyed the results placed on a dish, then nervously swallowed before silently stabbing it with a fork and bringing it to his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">“It… It’s amazing!”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-116"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">A one-hit KO.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">It was funny, watching this burly middle-aged guy act all shy around Shuna. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.2">He was practically falling over himself for this fetching young woman with light-pink hair. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.3">I think he was smitten from the very start, actually, but better not to say that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.4">If he wanted to play it cool, it’d be mean to stop him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">So Shuna and Yoshida were now a pair in the kitchen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.2">I had no doubts they and their work would be a star attraction at the festival.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">Next, we had Gabil. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.2">The dragonewt was working with Vester to build a presentation devoted to the history of healing potions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.3">They intended to keep the core fundamentals of their research a trade secret, but they wanted to use this pavilion to recruit new people interested in joining their team. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.4">They had enough staff for now, they said, but just wanted to find potential hires with the kind of passion they wanted.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">Garm (eldest of the three dwarven brothers) and Kurobe planned to show off their own wares at the event. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.2">Their pavilion would be alongside Gabil and Vester’s, and already they were talking about competing to see who attracted the larger crowds. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.3">Glad to see they were using this festival to have a little fun.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1">Kaijin was also set to return the night before the bash. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.2">I told Geld to take a break during the event, so construction should be largely complete before then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.3">I informed my staff that our prisoners of war deserved a little celebration as well; they’d be enjoying a feast over in their own facility. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.4">A few people would have to work during the holiday, but we made sure to accommodate their schedules so they could trade off days and not be stuck on duty the whole time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.5">The festival would continue for about a week, so I wanted everyone to get in on the excitement.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">Come to think of it, Shion was planning something, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.2">She was very confident about it (“Hee-hee-hee, I hope you’re looking forward </span><a id="page-117"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1">to it, Sir Rimuru”), so I was half-excited, half–scared shitless. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.2">That…and Veldora was alarming me with his suggestions again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.3">Better do something about that before he starts freaking people out…</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1">Looking at all these people, I figured I should probably pitch in somehow—which brings us to the involvement of my old friend Gard Mjöllmile.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.1">.........</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1">......</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">A manor servant brought me some tea. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.2">I had come here many times before, so he was used to me and provided a couple of the cookies I liked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.3">Taking a sip of the drink, I grinned. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.4">It was just as tasty as always, helping put my mind in a better place. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.5">Time to move on to negotiations, then.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">“Anyway, Mollie, I’ve got another job for you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.2">Don’t worry; it’s an easy one this time, I promise.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">“Oh, another bright idea of yours? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.2">You always bring such fascinating projects to the table, but they certainly require a lot of…</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">start-up</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1"> work, to say the least.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">He grinned at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.2">Despite his complaint, it was clear he was interested in what I had to offer him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1">My project to bring fast food to this world—burgers, the whole bit—was still underway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.2">I had handed my outline of what needed to be done to Mjöllmile, and he was in the midst of executing it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.3">The plan had been on the back burner for a while, what with Hinata marching on me and everything, but I wanted to come over and see how it was going, as well as talk about putting up a satellite location in Tempest in time for our festival.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">“Hee-hee! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.2">Oh, don’t be a stick in the mud, Mollie. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.3">You know our recent project? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.4">Before we launch in Blumund and Englesia, I’d like you to maybe open up a test location in my nation first.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1">“Oh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.2">You know, I actually appreciate that offer a great deal, because I was just thinking about where we should train our staff. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.3">But if you’re proposing that, have you worked out your differences with the Crusaders?”</span></p>
