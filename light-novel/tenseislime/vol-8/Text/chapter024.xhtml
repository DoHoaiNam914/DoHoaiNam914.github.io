<p class="noindent"><a id="page-211"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">With everything running on schedule (to some extent), I returned to town. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">Veldora and Ramiris stayed in the labyrinth, and Milim was helping them out now that her dragon-wrangling work was done. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">The thought struck me that Milim might have to, like, go back and run her domain sometime, but I let her be. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">She</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1"> was the one who’d get chewed out over it, not me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Looking at the traps I laid, the three of them apparently had some complaints about the areas they were allowed to work out their final touches in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">Until Floor 30, I really didn’t want a lot of traps. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">It’d be pointless to sprinkle a bunch of dinky ones around, and if they got too sadistic too fast, adventurers would just give up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">If they gave up too early, of course, they’d stop coming.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">That’s why I personally laid out the traps for everywhere between Floors 1 and 50. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">Ramiris and Veldora were allowed to handle only the deeper levels. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">I suppose, though, that witnessing my cruelest traps mainly inspired them to come up with even more insidious ones.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">“Y’know, Rimuru, I think I had the wrong idea,” said Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">“Traps aren’t meant to be installed one at a time, are they?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“No fair! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">Let </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">me</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1"> invent some!!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">whined Milim.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">“Yes, perhaps I was so focused on my overall might that I overlooked how best to install these traps,” said Veldora. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">“Let’s approach this a little more seriously, then.”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-212"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">I mostly let them be. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">I didn’t have the time to deal with all this selfishness. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">Ramiris was allowed to do whatever she wanted with Floors 51 to 60; Veldora, Floors 61 to 70; and Milim, the trickiest part of the labyrinth—the dragon chambers on Floors 96 to 99. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.4">The floors might turn out ridiculous, I knew, but I doubted any adventurer would make it past Floor 50 for a while to come, so I didn’t see the problem.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Floor 95, by the way, was where we decided to place the beastman refugee camp. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">I’d been considering putting some (very expensive) lodging down there for rest purposes as well—another idea I filed away for the future, after I saw how things went. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.3">As for the remainder—Floors 71 to 94—I left those in their default, untouched state for future purposes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.4">They were fully infused with magicules, so you might see monsters show up down there, but otherwise, nothing of note. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.5">Everything else, the three had free rein over.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">A few days passed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">While I was scanning the buzzing city streets, I spotted Mjöllmile and his entourage heading this way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">That was quicker than I had expected. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.4">He must’ve packed up and come over in a hurry.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“Sir Rimuru! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">I do apologize we didn’t make it here sooner. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">I’m ready to begin at once!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“Ah, Mjöllmile, thanks so much for coming! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">Let me guide you over to your home here.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">I took him over to a residence we had only just recently built. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">I had asked Rigurd to get it done for him in advance, advising him to make sure it was move-in ready. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">I loved that guy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.4">So well put together. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.5">Ask him to do something, and he’ll never let you down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.6">I also wanted Rigurd and Mjöllmile to say hello to each other, although Mjöllmile already knew Rigurd from their healing potion business. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.7">Leaving the guide goblins and Mjöllmile’s servants to the house, I went with him over to Rigurd’s office.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“Excuse me, Rigurd.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“Oh, Sir Rimuru! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">And Sir Mjöllmile as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.3">What brings you here today?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">He must have been busy, but Rigurd warmly greeted us nonetheless.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-213"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“Ah, I’m sorry it’s been so long, Sir Rigurd! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">Your boss— Er, Sir Rimuru here has always been kind to me in our business ventures, but today—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Before I could explain matters, Mjöllmile skillfully took over the role. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">We moved over to the parlor, quickly getting down to business—the state of arena construction, the lodging on the southwest side, the stalls we’d build around the arena site, and more. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">We also talked about the freshly built Dungeon and using it to attract adventurers to town.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“…So the Dungeon is all ready to go. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">It’s not complete yet, but I think we can run it right now without any problem. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">The coliseum’s going to need some more time as well, but the main stage is complete. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.4">The VIP seating’s done, too, all fancy and stuff, so I figure we can have the regular audience sit on sheets in the grandstand for now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.5">Or make it standing room only if need be.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">We were short on time, so I had been procrastinating on that issue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">The arena structure was still bare-bones, but I figured that could wait until Mildo returned. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">Even incomplete, I think it had style, and I was also making sure it was safe to use.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Rigurd and Mjöllmile listened to my explanation with rapt attention, and we quickly lost ourselves in discussion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">Rigurd accepted the job of educating our citizens, ensuring they were fully able and ready to handle the people who’d be coming in soon; meanwhile, Mjöllmile had his own ideas for the arena and dungeon we had planned out, as evidenced by his commendably confident smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">We discussed it all, pointing out flaws and trying to correct them, figuring out what we needed and what had to be on-site.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">“It’s a tremendous relief to see Sir Mjöllmile with us on this,” a smiling Rigurd said.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“Yeah, isn’t it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">He’s a pretty useful guy, you know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">If this Founder’s Festival ends well, I’m thinking about making him into our nation’s chief financial manager.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">This was important to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">I wanted him in charge of our country’s finances, and I also wanted him running our new commerce and publicity departments, doing all he could for Tempest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">Rigurd nodded at this, promising to personally select the staff who’d work </span><a id="page-214"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">under him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">We had been asking the inns along the highway and such to keep track of their own accounts, but this was still an uphill process. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">Literacy rates had gone up thanks to Vester, but not everyone could read, write, and do sums yet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.4">If we wanted to keep this nation going, we’d really need people like Mjöllmile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.5">Rigurd, to his credit, seemed to understand that and was accepting to Mjöllmile joining my administration—and not just because I wanted him there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.6">Maybe he knew that numbers were a weakness of ours. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.7">He seemed to welcome him, even, outside of our current festival plans.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“…I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">That sounds like a splendid idea!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">“No, no, I still have much to learn. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">But I promise you that I will tackle our issues with every bit of strength I have!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">He was sounding modest, but I knew he had his heart set on this post from the outset. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">He had ambition, and as long as the Founder’s Festival worked out well, I’d have no qualms about appointing him to the roles I had laid out.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“However,” I said, “you’ll still need to perform well for us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">The others won’t accept you otherwise.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“Indeed,” replied Rigurd, “although I am sure one word from you would be enough to convince them all…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“I’d like to avoid that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">Honestly, if anything, I feel like I’m too involved in this stuff right now.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“Maybe so. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">And the very fact that noncitizens of Tempest can take top administrative roles will serve as fine advertising. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">To achieve that, however, Sir Mjöllmile will need to put up results that everyone can appreciate.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“You said it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Sorry to put all this pressure on you, but can I count on you for that, Mollie?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">That </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">would</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1"> be the tricky part. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">If this was just about strength, or something similarly easy to grasp, the monsters would easily be convinced. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">Diablo was a prime example; when I appointed him my second secretary, nobody complained about that at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.4">(Okay, Shion did, but that’s because she can’t take a hint.) Diablo’s strength was undoubtedly second only to mine; you’d have to be silly to pick a fight with someone like that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">In other words, when it came to military roles or the like, pretty </span><a id="page-215"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">much anyone could become an officer if I recognized their talents. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">If they’re strong enough for the post, we’re all good.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">That wouldn’t work with the more bureaucrat-type positions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">I imagine most governments have examinations and stuff for those posts, but sadly, we hadn’t reached that point yet.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">I’d gladly welcome experienced people like Vester, but again, they needed to put up achievements. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">Even Vester was still technically just a consultant—a visitor, if you will. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.3">I wanted to give him a promotion to an administrative job, but first I wanted Mjöllmile to prove himself at his. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.4">If possible, I’d like them both to play a simultaneous role in our new system of government, bringing them on as ministers.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">But Mjöllmile’s confident smile banished my concerns. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">“Heh-heh-heh… Sir Rimuru, I hope you won’t underestimate me </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1"> much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">Just watch as I satisfy your expectations and make this into a massive success!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">Glad I could rely on him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">He didn’t run the underground scene in his hometown with his mouth alone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">That brazen attitude put my mind at ease.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“Heh-heh-heh… Mollie, you have earned my trust. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Make me proud!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“And even if you </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">do</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1"> make a mistake or two, I’ll make sure it </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">becomes</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1"> a success in the public eye. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">Anyone who defies Sir Rimuru’s will shall face the might of my iron fists!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">“Um, Rigurd, you can’t do that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">That’s why I want Mjöllmile to do well for us, all right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">“Never fear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">I will leave no evidence—”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">Still, we exchanged dark smiles with each other. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">Rigurd and Mjöllmile weren’t unfamiliar with each other; I trusted they were comfortable with this relationship. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.3">Knowing that helped me relax. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.4">And really, I didn’t care </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">why</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1"> people decided to accept Mjöllmile’s presence, as long as they did.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Mjöllmile began shouting the moment he entered his new residence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">He must have liked the place. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.3">I was happy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">“There is running water, magic-driven burners, baths, and these toilets. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">Every advanced piece of equipment this town has to offer is available to us.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">The elated servant’s report almost made Mjöllmile faint on the spot.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">“You needed this, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">This was cheaper than building separate homes for each of them, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">If anyone wants their own house, they’re free to save up for one.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">I couldn’t build homes for them all, so I kind of reused a building we had set up for an administrator-level resident, but everyone seemed happy enough with it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">The house came at no charge, too—I mean, with all the money I had made off Mjöllmile, I really couldn’t charge him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">And that money was gonna keep flowing, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.4">This was a necessary expense, you could say—a steal, even.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">“Y-yes, true… But this is the standard you enjoy here? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">Then what about the more economical lodgings in the southwest?”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-217"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">“Yeah, they don’t get individual baths in the rooms, but they </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">do</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1"> get toilets. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">There’s a low-cost public bath nearby, and some of the inns have their own baths for free.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">“I see… Yes, you did talk about making this town into a kind of health resort, didn’t you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">Now it makes sense to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.3">So you offer this level of services to even the commoners, not just the nobility or well-funded areas? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.4">Yes, we certainly </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">can</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1"> expect some adventurers here!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">“Pretty easy living, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">“Not just ‘pretty easy.’ </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">This is the best you’d find all around the West. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.3">If adventurers can find a steady income in this town, we’re gonna have a lot of excitement pretty soon.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">What’s he talking about?</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">I mean, yeah, there aren’t as many wild monsters around Jura as there used to be, but…like, the Dungeon’s just a fun attraction, so…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">“This can work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">This can really work! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.3">We’re seeing more adventurers out of a job, what with monster counts dwindling and all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.4">Perhaps some can use the Dungeon as their workplace. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.5">Plus, we’ll be selling healing potions and adventuring gear nearby, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.6">Picture this: What if this town isn’t just a tourist site or health spa, but someplace where they can permanently reside? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.7">With all these inns providing fantastic service, a coliseum attracting tourists, and a dungeon providing thrills </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">and</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1"> a potentially decent wage…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">Um…was that what we built the Dungeon for?</span></p>
<p><a id="page-218"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">I did intend to offer money for whatever the adventurers earned in there, but that was kind of like offering buybacks on carnival prizes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">But was Mjöllmile’s line of thinking worth hearing out?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">“Wow, Mollie. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">You only just came here today, and you already worked it out?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">“Ah, of course, sir. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">If there’s money to be sniffed out, I’d never lose a single coin to you!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">“Heh-heh-heh… You’re incorrigible.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">“Ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">Ah, don’t be silly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.3">It wouldn’t be possible without you!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">“But thinking and doing are different things, of course. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">I was hoping I could leave you to work out the rest of the plan…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">“Oh, would you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">I’d be glad to help!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">I guess the plan was now to let adventurers “work” in the Dungeon, and Mjöllmile was kind enough to accept the job. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">He already had a ton on his plate, I knew. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.3">Talk about energetic.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">But… Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">I didn’t think that far, but I totally overlooked the idea of adventurers </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">living</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1"> here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">To me, the dungeon attraction was kind of a gamble—maybe some customers would make money off it, but the majority would leave with their wallets pretty thoroughly emptied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.3">But have a permanent group of adventurers hunt monsters in there? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.4">There’s no stopping Mjöllmile’s imagination, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.5">I love getting his insights.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">Unlike forest creatures, there was no chance of overhunting and wrecking the ecosystem. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">Much better, really, to have the hunters cull the monsters’ numbers before they multiplied too much, then buy the materials they harvested from them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.3">With Veldora around, there was no need to worry about where the magicules would come from—the monsters would be constantly replenished.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">This actually might be a brilliant idea! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">It’d give adventurers money to go spend around the city and help fill Tempest’s coffers, which would allow us to provide more support to them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.3">We could process the materials they hunted for us, and I suppose we could even export them to other countries. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.4">Magic crystals could be shipped off as is, although we wouldn’t export them all—we had our own uses for them.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-219"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">Maybe this would be the tipping point that made the Free Guild build a post in town, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">We could give them exclusive rights to the dungeon business, so we weren’t in competition. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">And if they paid the adventurers directly</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">, I thought, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">that would also open access to foreign capital for us—capital we could use to import goods from other nations.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1"> With imports cut off from Eurazania at the moment, I wasn’t sure the produce and grains we farmed would be enough to keep the adventurers full, so some imports might become necessary.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">Besides, I wanted Tempest to become a trade hub; that was part of the idea from the start, and I needed to think of ways to move larger amounts of goods and money around. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">There were plans in my mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.3">That was why I made sure the highways were designed to be pretty wide, after all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.4">We’d paved only half the width of the roads; the other half was bare earth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.5">I planned to put rails down on that land someday, and with the rails would come freight trains.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">“After that, I suppose it all comes down to advertising.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">Mjöllmile pulled me back down to earth before I floated off too much into fantasizing about my dreams. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">No, no need to go too crazy yet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.3">It’d take time to develop rails, much less the trains that’d run on them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.4">First, we needed to pull off this massive party without a hitch and make a good impression on the world.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">“You’re right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">This isn’t advertising, exactly, but I’ve sent out invitations to world leaders. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.3">Journalists from several nations are working with me as well, so I think we should see a pretty decent turnout.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">“Oh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">Good to hear, Sir Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.3">I was just thinking that we’d best start negotiating with royalty and nobility before the winter thaw if we want them to join in, but you’ve already planned ahead, eh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.4">In that case, I’ll contact the larger merchant operations I work with and let them know about the festival.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">“Could you do that?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">“Certainly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">I’m already prepared to, in fact. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.3">I intended to send out messengers once I scoped out how things were in Tempest.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">Mjöllmile grinned at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">He was </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">so</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1"> useful.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">“Ah, my hat goes off to you, Mollie. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">You never leave a single stone unturned, do you?”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-220"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">“I could say the same of you, Sir Rimuru! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">The foresight you’ve shown with all this is a far cry from anything </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">I</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1"> could ever manage.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">Another exchange of knowing smiles. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.2">I think Mjöllmile’s far more of a schemer than I ever was, but I’ll take the compliment.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">“Sir Rimuru,” he continued, turning more serious as he stood up, “there is no way this plan of yours could possibly fail. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">If you have what it takes to build a nation up </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1"> far, I’m sure you could guide just about anyone to success!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">I’m not sure about “anyone,” but he did help put my mind at ease. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">I suppose Mjöllmile was impressed enough by our town’s food, environment, and creature comforts. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.3">That’s why he was reacting that way, and perhaps it was a sign of our future promised success, even.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">I stood up and extended a hand to him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.2">“I’m counting on you, Mollie!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">“Certainly,” he replied, gripping it in a handshake. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.2">From that moment, I was sure we had it in the bag.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">That night, we held a big dinner at Mjöllmile’s mansion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.2">Afterward, he and I were relaxing together over some tea when he whispered something to a servant and had him go fetch someone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.3">This someone, or rather someones, turned out to be Bydd and Gob’emon.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">I had thought Gob’emon was staying undercover as he kept watch over Mjöllmile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">If he was here, had he introduced himself to the guy or something? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.3">And that wasn’t even my main concern.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">“Sir Rimuru, I understand that kind Gob’emon here was sent to protect me?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">I thought about playing dumb for a moment, but I guess Mjöllmile already knew he was here on my orders. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.2">No point trying to hide it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">“Well, yeah— But, Gob’emon, uh, what’s up with your arm?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">I kinda had to ask. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.2">Half of his right one was missing, ending at the elbow.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">“S-Sir Rimuru! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.2">My—my sincerest apologies!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.3">He kneeled down, head virtually to the floor. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.4">“I made a terrible mistake and exposed my identity to Mjöllmile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.5">This arm was my punishment, you see.”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-221"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">I turned to Mjöllmile for some kind of explanation.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">“Now, now, Gob’emon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">Go on, lift your head up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.3">Have some tea to calm you down.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">He sat Gob’emon on a seat and offered him tea from a servant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">Once we were all in place, he turned to me and went into the story.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">It turned out that Mjöllmile had, indeed, been attacked several times since our meeting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">Mjöllmile, being no fool, ordered Bydd and the rest of his security detail to redouble their efforts, but there were a few close scrapes that were foiled thanks to the assistance of an anonymous bystander—Gob’emon, in other words. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.3">There were considerably more assaults than I had planned for, and I guess that’s how he got spotted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.4">Mjöllmile apparently figured he must’ve been with me and kept pretending not to notice out of politeness.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">And then </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">it</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1"> happened. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">Viscount Cazac, whether he lost his temper or whatever, decided to get serious.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">“So I left my business to a trusted associate and left for this country. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.2">Once I reached the highway, I assumed I was safe and nobody would try to touch me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.3">But…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">The highway was full of adventurers, traveling merchants, and patrolmen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.2">I had teams clear the roads daily to keep them free of snow, so the winter hadn’t slowed the flow of people much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.3">An attack in such a well-traversed area was unthinkable, and even if it happened, our security team would be right on the scene. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.4">Someone like Mjöllmile, who traveled the highways frequently, was fully aware of that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">But as if to prove his confidence was misplaced, his party came under attack at a village near the far end of the highway.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">“A village? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">You mean the one where Bydd tried to rip— Um, where Bydd and I first met?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">“Yes! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.2">The very same, Sir Rimuru!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">Bydd might have been Mjöllmile’s bodyguard now, but when I first met him, he was a pretty low-end swindler. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.2">It wasn’t worth bringing up past drama, though, so I glossed over it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.3">He had shown up to help defend Gob’emon, and now they were both behind Mjöllmile as he explained matters.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">As Bydd then explained, they were accosted by a wagon painted </span><a id="page-222"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">black, out of which popped monsters—several of them, all ranked B. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">As an ex–C fighter, Bydd and his team couldn’t do much, and they were all about to say their prayers but still did their best to evacuate the villagers and buy some time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.3">Then Gob’emon showed up.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">“Yeah, that Gob’emon guy saved all our lives, man!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">“That he did,” Mjöllmile added. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.2">“Not just me, but everyone who was there owes him a word of thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">“But I still failed…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">Gob’emon didn’t seem interested in the compliment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.2">He wasn’t the sort to lose out to this monster band, and apparently he had dispatched them in short order. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.3">He then attempted to capture the criminal leading them, only to go eye-to-eye with a basilisk, a B-plus threat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.4">It spewed petrifying gas at Gob’emon’s right arm, and he hurriedly amputated it himself before it spread any further. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.5">That bought the black wagon enough time to speed off.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">“Failed? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.2">Meaning you didn’t catch the guy behind it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">“Yes, but I let Mjöllmile notice me…”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">That’s</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1"> what he’s talking about?!</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">“I don’t really care about that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.2">Your bodyguard duty was the more important thing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.3">Plus, like, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">fix</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1"> that thing, dude!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">I extracted a potion from my Stomach and attempted to hand it to Gob’emon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.2">He bit his lip, refusing to take it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">“No, this injury is the result of my inexperience. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">I was unable to defeat the basilisk by myself and compelled to seek the aid of Bydd and his team. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.3">It was terrible of me, and while missing an arm presents its difficulties, it will grow back over time…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">What a stubborn goblin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.2">Or proud, I guess you could say, but he was trying to do way too much by himself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">“Gob’emon, are you embarrassed that you needed Bydd’s help?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">“Well…my job was to guard Mjöllmile, but I exposed him to danger instead…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">“Hang on, Gob’emon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.2">You’re misunderstanding this.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">“Am I?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">“Yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.2">You’re trying to do everything alone. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">That’s</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1"> the difference between you and Gobta.”</span></p>
<p><a id="page-223"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">That summed it up, really—the ability to work with the people underneath them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.2">Gobta never tried to do all the work himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.3">Even when fighting powerful monsters, he was always issuing commands to his team. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.4">For the easier jobs, he barely even lifted a finger—or maybe he was just deliberately being lazy, much of the time—but in terms of encouraging growth among his team, Benimaru called Gobta a better commander.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">With Gob’emon, if a strong monster reared its ugly head, he’d leap right in front and try to fight it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.2">I could understand his line of thinking—he was talented, so this would make things faster—but doing that accomplished nothing for the rest of his team. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.3">And what if Gob’emon fell? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.4">It’d leave his troop defenseless. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.5">I’d be deeply concerned about their chances of surviving the encounter.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">That was the reasoning behind Benimaru’s evaluation, and that’s why I wanted Gob’emon to learn how to rely on others. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.2">Mjöllmile was great at handling his people, and I thought using him as an example would help Gob’emon grow a little.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">“…That’s exactly why you need to learn how to trust in your friends more. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">I’m not saying to throw them recklessly into danger. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.3">I’m saying that you need to conserve a little bit of your strength and give them a hand if things get hairy.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">“I—I…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">“Everybody knows how strong you are. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.2">But that’s not enough to lead a unit.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">“......”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">Gob’emon hung his head, and I took the opportunity to throw the healing potion at him.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">The fluid spilled all over his right arm, which visibly regenerated before us.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">There was fire in his eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.2">He always </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1"> a goblin of ambition—giving him a goal to strive for should make the growth process go faster. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.2">I was sure he’d live up to every bit of my expectations.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">As he managed this new company of his, Mjöllmile used his connections to send out invitations to VIPs worldwide. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.2">Powerful nobility from the inner countries, the wealthier merchants from each key city, the movers and shakers over in the Englesian capital, that kind of thing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.3">Once the snow melted, the Founder’s Festival was going to be even larger in scale than I had first envisioned.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">Of course, his organizational skills were also pointed in other directions: the performances for our new theater; the format and rules for our arena battles; the admission fee to the Dungeon, along with prices for the items we sold there; inventory and sales approaches for the stalls around the arena site. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.2">I was shocked this was a first for him; he seemed completely in his element as he arranged all this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.3">I introduced him to Veldora, too, and he agreed to work out the guy’s hibachi-grill concept with him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">I definitely made the right choice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.2">Out of all my crazy ideas, hiring him was probably the smartest one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.3">Without his talents, there </span><a id="page-226"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">was a pretty high chance the whole thing would’ve crashed and burned. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.2">No way I’d ever be </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1"> nimble with things. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.2">I was lucky to run into this guy, and as I watched him do his magic, I couldn’t help but feel exhilarated.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">Arena construction was proceeding well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.2">Gobkyuu was proving an excellent foreman, and everything was still on schedule. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.3">Mildo, youngest of the three dwarven brothers, was also back from his break and adding his own touches to my blueprints. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.4">Now there was an aesthetic, even artistic value, to the structure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.5">He was a real artist, indeed, and I sure wasn’t, so this was a huge help. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.6">I was sure it’d be more than enough to wow those jaded nobles. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.7">Plus, Mildo’s touches even looked like they’d be done in time for the first battle tournament.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">Mjöllmile’s staff also had their stalls open, selling to the workers in the area for practice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.2">This was going well, too, generating business at a pretty decent clip. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.3">Neither of us anticipated any problems, which was a relief. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.4">The Dungeon, meanwhile, was in Ramiris’s and Veldora’s hands—I wanted to be more involved, but I was rapidly running short of free time.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">Now the various leaders of the Forest of Jura’s monster races were assembling in town to celebrate (or maybe probe into) my new title. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.2">We had a series of audiences with each contingent scheduled across several days.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">They wanted to declare their fealty to the demon lord in hopes of obtaining protection in return—but if they saw that the demon lord didn’t have that kind of power, they’d no doubt bare their fangs at once and start rebelling. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.2">Under a powerless demon lord, there’d be no prosperity, only a straight, downhill road to oblivion, and they knew it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.3">Taking action to avoid such a fate was a matter of course.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">Until fairly recently, the whole of Jura had been protected under Veldora’s absolute, irresistible power. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.2">That made the Forest an impregnable fortress, but now it was under the rule of a new demon </span><a id="page-227"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">lord—a freshly ordained one, whose priorities and policies were still a question mark. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.2">That’d unnerve any of the monster leaders, I was sure.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">…So. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.2">Here I was, in the audience chamber we set up, being enshrined on my little platform, in full dress. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.3">As a slime. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.4">It made me feel like some kind of table decoration, a conversation piece laid out on a divine altar.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">I suggested just putting one of my Replications up there, but my team of advisers just smiled and said no. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.2">They had a knack for working together against me at times like this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.3">My only guess was that they were using Thought Communication to talk to each other behind my back.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">So I let them do what they wanted with me, and they dolled me up so much that I couldn’t even move. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.2">They even prepared special slime clothes for this day. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.3">It was exhausting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.4">Several outfits, changed daily for me—or maybe even morning, afternoon, and evening; I stopped paying attention. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.5">I wished they’d knock it off, but they kept talking about how I had to strike a dignified pose—which indicated to me that my slime form didn’t look dignified at all.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">Ah well.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">Everyone participating in this “presentation ceremony” was dressed like they were members of a military honor guard. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.2">Every button was polished, not a wrinkle in sight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.3">The pressure was intense, and in the midst of this oppressive atmosphere, Rigurd and Rigur—just as smartly dressed—were dealing with the envoys. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.4">I looked down at them, as instructed to do, without saying a word. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.5">Me speaking would ruin the effect anyway, so I was glad I didn’t have to.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">Benimaru and Shuna stood guard over me on both sides. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.2">Behind me was Shion, Soei, and Gabil, in a neat little line. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.3">Ranga, as always, was holed up inside my shadow.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">Over to the right was Gobwa and another hundred-odd members of Team Kurenai; the other two hundred were patrolling the city streets. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.2">They were all more powerful than our normal security team, so I took this measure so they could quickly handle any weirdos who showed up during the event. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.3">Shion’s Team Reborn </span><a id="page-229"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">in plainclothes, meanwhile, was also keeping an eye on the town, ready to address any flare-ups before they got out of control.</span></p>
