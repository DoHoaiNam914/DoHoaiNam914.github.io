<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Um… So to a spiritual life-form like Veldora, this attack “hurts,” then? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">In a way, this seems a lot more effective than just destroying him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.3">With the near-infinite stores of energy Veldora had, no amount of energy draining on Luminus’s part would kill him—but she </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">could</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1"> wear him out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">Adding pain and discomfort to the mix would make for a punishment he’d not soon forget, I imagine.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Luminus kept going with that attack for a decent amount of time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">Veldora started crying out, tear-filled eyes longingly staring at me, but I watched silently and offered no mercy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">This was for Veldora’s sake… Or really, if sacrificing him was all it took to make Luminus feel better, I’d say I got a bargain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">Call it a political transaction. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.5">Forgive me, Veldora.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">“Well,” an expressionless Louis observed, “at least Lady Luminus seems to be enjoying herself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">It’ll let her work through all her negative emotions as of late. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">I couldn’t be happier.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">“Yes,” Hinata said, nodding. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">“Given we don’t know who killed Roy, we don’t want any needless hostility right now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">By the way, just to be sure, that guy over there… Is he…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">She looked at Veldora, a tad unsure of herself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">Oh, right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">We hadn’t made introductions yet, huh?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“Yeah, that’s Veldora. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">Kinda hard to tell when he’s not in dragon form and all, but it’s definitely him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">I think he’s kind of busy right now, but I’ll introduce you to each other later.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“W-wait, Rimuru! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">N-n-now! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">Introduce us nowww—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">“Hmm? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">Still haven’t had enough, eh?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">“Worrrgghhhh!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">Poor guy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">It was his fault for trying to escape Luminus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">I could tell she increased the voltage or whatever just now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.4">Loose lips sink ships, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">“…So </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1"> was the Storm Dragon who Lady Luminus feared so much? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">Certainly, the amount of sheer power is astounding, but…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Hinata looked disappointed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">Who could blame her? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">Right now, Veldora was little more than comic relief. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.4">No sort of draconic majesty whatsoever. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.5">It was hard to believe this was a Catastrophe-level monster </span><a id="page-23"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">straight out of a nightmare. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">The other paladins must’ve thought the same thing, because they couldn’t have looked more confused.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“I—I can’t believe it…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“That? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">That’s the Storm Dragon we were told such terrifying tales about?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“Surely you jest? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">I honestly feel a little sorry for him.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">I think the form he had taken was tricking a few of the paladins, to be honest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">Plus, I’d based my own Replication on a younger Shizu. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">So similarly, if Veldora kept his mouth shut, he looked like a pretty handsome young man. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.4">If a guy like him was shouting for help with that desperate plea in his eyes, it’d move the hearts of untold numbers of women.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">But don’t be fooled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">Indulge him just a little, and he’ll walk all over you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">I needed to teach him some firm discipline right away, or else we—well, really, I—would pay dearly for it later.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">Report. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">The aura of Veldora the Storm Dragon, previously in danger of spontaneously combusting, has fallen back within the threshold of stability.</span></em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">…What?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">Wait a second. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">Did Raphael predict Luminus would do </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">, too? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">No way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">That was a bit much for even me to swallow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.4">It’d be impossible to read </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1"> far ahead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">No need to give him </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1"> much credit—the fight with Hinata had followed Raphael’s plan so closely, though, I couldn’t help but feel that way.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">I shook my head, banishing the thought.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">“Right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">I’d say it’s time to head out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">I know we’ve had a few misunderstandings, but once things calm down, I’d like to discuss our future plans.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">With that, I guided the paladins back to town.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">.........</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">......</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">Rigurd was waiting for us at the gate, panting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">I had sent Soei on ahead to send the news, and he had just now run out to greet us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">He </span><a id="page-24"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">didn’t need to do that—I was sure I gave him ample warning—but the guy just likes to run, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“On behalf of the city of Tempest,” he said with a friendly smile, “I welcome each and every one of you!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Nice smile there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">He must’ve learned it as part of his diplomatic efforts, and it put a professional service worker to shame. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">I appreciated it, especially given how we had our swords at the ready against these guys not long ago.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">“We will prepare meals for all of you, so please let us know if there is anything you’d prefer not to have.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">I had to hand it to Rigurd’s zeal for study—making sure to check if anyone had any allergies or religious reasons to avoid certain foods. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">He must’ve been roping in adventurers and merchants while I wasn’t paying attention, learning about human culture and thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">Would anyone believe that this guy used to be a helpless goblin?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“Oh, um, there is no need to go out of your way for us…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">Hinata looked a bit awkward about this, preparing to turn the offer down, but we needed to talk about our future relations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">It was already evening by now, so that talk would likely come the next day—and since they were here anyway, I couldn’t ignore a chance to advertise our city a little.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“Ah, don’t worry about it! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">We can talk in more detail tomorrow, so for today, let’s treat ourselves to a peacemaking party!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“Oooh, a party! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">A fine idea. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">And with that will come fine drink, yes?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Veldora, looking none the worse for wear after Luminus’s punishment, was naturally the first to react. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">He was in fine shape, after all, not that I had been concerned.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“Hmm… If this is a feast, I imagine I am invited as well?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Whoa! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Luminus, out of nowhere, was standing right next to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">And she </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1"> invited, of course, but were things really square with her and Veldora?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">“Well, sure, but um… What do I call you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Lord Luminus?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">“Don’t be weird. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">Luminus is fine.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">I suppose it was. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">We were fellow Octagram members.</span></p>
<p><a id="page-25"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">Luminus, then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">And you’re safe calling me Rimuru, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.4">But about Veldora—”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">Oooh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">She’s just calling me straight Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.3">I thought she’d act more high and mighty, but I guess she’s a lot more unaffected than that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">I was thinking about how I might just get along with her when Veldora started acting out again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">And Luminus took the bait, of course.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">“What?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">I’ve had more than enough punishment!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">Louis wasn’t too enthused about this, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">His expression didn’t change, but I could sense it anyway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.3">Maybe Luminus was in the habit of using and abusing them both on a regular basis…or at least, that’s what the conversation suggested to me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">Regardless, Gunther vanished the moment he heard Louis’s reply. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">Once she was sure he was gone, Luminus brightened up.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Thus, Hinata and everyone under her on hand was joining the feast—whether they wanted to or not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">Nobody dared voice any disagreement—nobody was foolish enough to rile Luminus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">That </span><a id="page-27"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">was how spectacular her fight with Veldora had been, really. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">It might’ve been a little light sparring from their perspective, but if any of the paladins got too close, it would’ve spelled disaster for them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">It’s a good thing I was around to stop them just now, or the fallout around town would’ve been catastrophic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">Some of them had turned pale, contemplating what they had just narrowly avoided, while others hadn’t even realized the gravity of it all yet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.3">Which—yeah—if you were a paladin, today’s myriad of events must’ve been mind-blowing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.4">My battle with Hinata was superhuman enough as it was, but then we extinguished the Seven Days Clergy, and </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">then</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1"> they found out the god they worshipped all along was a demon lord… </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">Then</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">, to cap it off, the Veldora fight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">It seemed to me that their faith in Hinata was the only thing that allowed them to keep it together, but this would take time for them to fully accept.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">I thought this was going to be harder, for some reason. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">But this was actually pretty chill.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">What all this meant was that, in this world, there’s no common, unified custom of drawing a bath and just soaking in it for a while. </span><a id="page-29"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">A private bath was a grand luxury, something that would only be possessed by the upper class—and even then only in nations with a large population of otherworlders. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">I kept forgetting that, given how my home nation installed baths even in one-bedroom apartments.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">“All right,” I said, giving the paladins a suitably sheepish look, “let me guide you to the women’s bath.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">I tried to walk away as casually as possible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">But it wasn’t going to be that easy.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">We’d be using the banquet hall for the festivities. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.2">With all the events we’d been hosting lately, I had this hall hastily built for us; it had only just been completed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.3">Basically, it looked like a circular domed stadium, about the size of a gymnasium inside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.4">Internally, it was wide open, the floor lined with tatami mats. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.5">It was meant to serve as an evacuation site in case of emergency, so it could hold a fair number of people. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.6">We had a lot of space to work with, so we used steel frame to construct a building of a decent size and sturdiness, but over time, this was going to change to magisteel. </span><a id="page-33"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">Our nation, and all the powerful magic-born living in it, had a lot of natural advantages like that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">As I thought about this, food began to be delivered on serving trays, on a set of intricate-looking bowls like you’d see in a fancy restaurant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.2">I had shown them how to knead clay into bowls like that, but then the children started imitating me, and nowadays you saw a lot of really impressive pieces. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.3">For colors, they made dyes out of herbal extracts or mixed weird ores into the clay, resulting in some dazzling work at times. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.4">The children’s output was being used in the homes of families across town.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">Looking at it this way, from hot springs to the containers the food came in, my personal tastes were starting to show their presence everywhere. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.2">Compared with those first few days of chewing on grass, life had become unbelievably better for me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.3">The food itself was really enjoyable now, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.4">I guess it’s easier to strive for something if you really feel like it’ll benefit you personally.</span></p>

<p class="space-break1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">This tempura had also come about after I showed my memories to Shuna and we developed each component, piece by piece. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.2">And that wasn’t all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.3">Fried chicken, hamburger, steak, croquettes, fried shrimp—I loved it all, and it went without saying that Milim did, too.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">For someone like me, not that well versed in cooking, trying to explain the difference between fried shrimp and tempura was quite a challenge. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.2">In simple terms, all you’re doing is taking shrimp, coating it with batter, and frying it in oil—but the batter makes all the </span><a id="page-34"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">difference in texture and taste, you know? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.2">Frying can be done in a bunch of different ways, too, and trying to re-create that based on my (hazy) memories of look, and feel, and taste, proved fiendishly difficult. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.3">It took </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">work</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">, and now, thanks to Shuna’s efforts, it had come all the way here.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">Englesia had a lot of good food to enjoy, but nothing I’d describe as Japanese. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.2">Guy Crimson had prepared a Western-style full-course meal for me, but I just didn’t see a lot of Asian influence in this world’s cuisine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.3">One reason for that: Few of the Western Nations bordered an ocean, so seafood wasn’t in plentiful supply. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.4">Attempting to preserve the freshness of ingredients with magic, it was explained to me, took a massive investment that few were willing to make. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.5">Thus, even if you had otherworlders who ran kitchens back in Japan, they couldn’t do much without the right raw materials.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">That made me recall the Japanese otherworlder, Yoshida, who ran that bakery and cake shop I liked in Englesia. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.2">He lamented how he used to enjoy making “drunken” cakes with gin, bourbon, and so on, but just couldn’t find anything like that in this world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.3">I remember how excited he got after I told him I’d throw some his way.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">Thinking about that made me realize just how blessed I was over here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.2">Just because you have a recipe doesn’t mean you’ll pull it off flawlessly on the first try, after all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.3">And with Japanese cuisine in particular, tracking down ingredients was a challenge. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.4">I’d do things like go to the sea and capture a bunch of different fish species to try to find an equivalent to make bonito flakes from. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.5">Having a skill like Spatial Motion made it possible to transport goods in as fresh a condition as possible, which greatly expanded what was available to us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.6">(I wanted to build a transport network that wasn’t so dependent on magic skills, but that was a topic for the future.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">Cuisine, after all, is culture itself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.2">If a nation doesn’t have a vibrant, expansive food culture, then if you ask me, what’s the point? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.3">Out of the three basic needs—food, clothing, and shelter—food was number one by far to me, although your mileage may vary.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">This was why I was expending (some would say wasting) a lot of energy developing new dishes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.2">Wheat-based grain was easier than I surmised at first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.3">I saw loaves of white bread in the Englesian </span><a id="page-35"></a><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">capital; if you were well-off enough to afford it, it seemed like a daily staple. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.2">Studying the production process for that got us bread in Tempest in relatively short order.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">Right now, the main issue to tackle was white rice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.2">We still hadn’t engineered something up to snuff taste-wise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.3">Compared with what one saw in Japan, painstakingly curated and improved since ancient times, the quality just wasn’t there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.4">That was expected; I wasn’t anticipating a sudden breakthrough for this one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.5">Raising plants with magic, at least, sped up the harvests quite a bit, although research was still at a halt right now due to the winter season. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.6">For the moment, we just had a few experimental rice plants growing indoors, managed by researchers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.7">Real results seemed like they’d be a while to come.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">I actually </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1"> have a solution for this, though. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.2">When I asked Raphael about a potential answer, it gave it to me right off—basically, use Shion’s Master Chef skill to alter the resulting rice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.3">Tinkering the final plant rather than the initial seeds, after all, made improving the quality quite a bit easier. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.4">But was that really the right thing to do? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.5">It wasn’t like anyone else could copy this method, and it seemed kind of ethically suspect to me…but given how much I relied on just that method to fine-tune our alcoholic drinks, I was in no position to moralize. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.6">Put my conscience and my appetite on the scales, and the latter’s gonna win every time.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">Since we couldn’t ask Shion to alter every harvest for us, our research continued. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.2">But I </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1"> have her engineer a small supply of lovely white rice, though. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.2">Just a bit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.3">Mainly for my personal consumption. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.4">Shion was more than glad to help, so I gave the bag to Shuna and had her steam it up for special occasions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.5">Occasions like this one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.6">I was entertaining a demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.7">Let’s </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">live</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1"> a little.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">As I reflected on this, the serving trays were all put in place. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.2">Now we just had to wait for the paladins to get out of the bath.</span></p>
