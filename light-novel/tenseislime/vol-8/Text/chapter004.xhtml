<p>Um… So to a spiritual life-form like Veldora, this attack “hurts,” then? In a way, this seems a lot more effective than just destroying him. With the near-infinite stores of energy Veldora had, no amount of energy draining on Luminus’s part would kill him—but she <em>could</em> wear him out. Adding pain and discomfort to the mix would make for a punishment he’d not soon forget, I imagine.</p>
<p>Luminus kept going with that attack for a decent amount of time. Veldora started crying out, tear-filled eyes longingly staring at me, but I watched silently and offered no mercy. This was for Veldora’s sake… Or really, if sacrificing him was all it took to make Luminus feel better, I’d say I got a bargain. Call it a political transaction. Forgive me, Veldora.</p>
<p>“Well,” an expressionless Louis observed, “at least Lady Luminus seems to be enjoying herself. It’ll let her work through all her negative emotions as of late. I couldn’t be happier.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Hinata said, nodding. “Given we don’t know who killed Roy, we don’t want any needless hostility right now. By the way, just to be sure, that guy over there… Is he…?”</p>
<p>She looked at Veldora, a tad unsure of herself. Oh, right. We hadn’t made introductions yet, huh?</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s Veldora. Kinda hard to tell when he’s not in dragon form and all, but it’s definitely him. I think he’s kind of busy right now, but I’ll introduce you to each other later.”</p>
<p>“W-wait, Rimuru! N-n-now! Introduce us nowww—”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Still haven’t had enough, eh?”</p>
<p>“Worrrgghhhh!!”</p>
<p>Poor guy. It was his fault for trying to escape Luminus. I could tell she increased the voltage or whatever just now. Loose lips sink ships, and so on.</p>
<p>“…So <em>this</em> was the Storm Dragon who Lady Luminus feared so much? Certainly, the amount of sheer power is astounding, but…”</p>
<p>Hinata looked disappointed. Who could blame her? Right now, Veldora was little more than comic relief. No sort of draconic majesty whatsoever. It was hard to believe this was a Catastrophe-level monster <a id="page-23"></a>straight out of a nightmare. The other paladins must’ve thought the same thing, because they couldn’t have looked more confused.</p>
<p>“I—I can’t believe it…”</p>
<p>“That? That’s the Storm Dragon we were told such terrifying tales about?”</p>
<p>“Surely you jest? I honestly feel a little sorry for him.”</p>
<p>I think the form he had taken was tricking a few of the paladins, to be honest. Plus, I’d based my own Replication on a younger Shizu. So similarly, if Veldora kept his mouth shut, he looked like a pretty handsome young man. If a guy like him was shouting for help with that desperate plea in his eyes, it’d move the hearts of untold numbers of women.</p>
<p>But don’t be fooled. Indulge him just a little, and he’ll walk all over you. I needed to teach him some firm discipline right away, or else we—well, really, I—would pay dearly for it later.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Report. The aura of Veldora the Storm Dragon, previously in danger of spontaneously combusting, has fallen back within the threshold of stability.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1">…What?! Wait a second. Did Raphael predict Luminus would do <em>that</em>, too? No way. That was a bit much for even me to swallow. It’d be impossible to read <em>that</em> far ahead. No need to give him <em>that</em> much credit—the fight with Hinata had followed Raphael’s plan so closely, though, I couldn’t help but feel that way.</p>
<p>I shook my head, banishing the thought.</p>
<p>“Right. I’d say it’s time to head out. I know we’ve had a few misunderstandings, but once things calm down, I’d like to discuss our future plans.”</p>
<p>With that, I guided the paladins back to town.</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Rigurd was waiting for us at the gate, panting. I had sent Soei on ahead to send the news, and he had just now run out to greet us. He <a id="page-24"></a>didn’t need to do that—I was sure I gave him ample warning—but the guy just likes to run, I guess.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the city of Tempest,” he said with a friendly smile, “I welcome each and every one of you!”</p>
<p>Nice smile there. He must’ve learned it as part of his diplomatic efforts, and it put a professional service worker to shame. I appreciated it, especially given how we had our swords at the ready against these guys not long ago.</p>
<p>“We will prepare meals for all of you, so please let us know if there is anything you’d prefer not to have.”</p>
<p>I had to hand it to Rigurd’s zeal for study—making sure to check if anyone had any allergies or religious reasons to avoid certain foods. He must’ve been roping in adventurers and merchants while I wasn’t paying attention, learning about human culture and thought. Would anyone believe that this guy used to be a helpless goblin?</p>
<p>“Oh, um, there is no need to go out of your way for us…”</p>
<p>Hinata looked a bit awkward about this, preparing to turn the offer down, but we needed to talk about our future relations. It was already evening by now, so that talk would likely come the next day—and since they were here anyway, I couldn’t ignore a chance to advertise our city a little.</p>
<p>“Ah, don’t worry about it! We can talk in more detail tomorrow, so for today, let’s treat ourselves to a peacemaking party!”</p>
<p>“Oooh, a party! A fine idea. And with that will come fine drink, yes?”</p>
<p>Veldora, looking none the worse for wear after Luminus’s punishment, was naturally the first to react. He was in fine shape, after all, not that I had been concerned.</p>
<p>“Hmm… If this is a feast, I imagine I am invited as well?”</p>
<p>Whoa! Luminus, out of nowhere, was standing right next to me. And she <em>was</em> invited, of course, but were things really square with her and Veldora?</p>
<p>“Well, sure, but um… What do I call you? Lord Luminus?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be weird. Luminus is fine.”</p>
<p>I suppose it was. We were fellow Octagram members.</p>
<p><a id="page-25"></a>“All right. Luminus, then. And you’re safe calling me Rimuru, too. But about Veldora—”</p>
<p>“I will <em>not</em> forgive him. That much is certain. I’ve come here today to atone for what my servants have done. In deference to you, Rimuru, I will give the lizard his <em>full</em> punishment another day.”</p>
<p>Oooh. She’s just calling me straight Rimuru. I thought she’d act more high and mighty, but I guess she’s a lot more unaffected than that.</p>
<p>I was thinking about how I might just get along with her when Veldora started acting out again. And Luminus took the bait, of course.</p>
<p>“What?! I’ve had more than enough punishment!”</p>
<p>“Silence, you! I’ve already given you my concessions. Or if you’d prefer, we could settle this right here!”</p>
<p>“Kwah-ha-ha-ha! Very well! Allow me to show you the sheer scale of my might—”</p>
<p>They fought like cats and dogs. I wasn’t so sure they were enemies at all, really. Maybe the term <em>frenemies</em> was invented to describe this.</p>
<p>“Stop it, you idiot. No violent rages within city limits.”</p>
<p>I had to put my foot down. Otherwise, they’d be apt to tear the whole place down.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Luminus, at least, seemed to be happy, no doubt appreciating all the magicule energy she had sucked out of Veldora’s body. It seemed like she was letting bygones be bygones for now, so maybe it was best not to needlessly prod her. <em>If she’s joining in the party, let’s give her the time of her life.</em></p>
<p>“So about this party— I wouldn’t expect the kind of first-class dining you’d get at Walpurgis, but are you okay with that?”</p>
<p>Luminus nodded, thankfully. “I did not attend the last one because I had a bad feeling about it…but that was not the only reason. My own team of cooks produce delicacies similar in quality to what you found over there. And eating is already optional for me; one simply gets bored of it over time. But you have rare and uncommon spirits here, no? Given how that lizard is already licking his lips, I must have a lot to look forward to.”</p>
<p><a id="page-26"></a>“Lady Luminus, do you not feel that is too careless of you?” an elderly servant of hers interjected.</p>
<p>I say <em>elderly</em> strictly in terms of outward appearance. He had extraordinarily good posture, and from the general aura he presented, I could tell this wasn’t some guy off the street. No, this servant was more comparable to Louis, standing adjacent.</p>
<p>Luminus gave this servant a dissatisfied look. “Why do you insist on opening your mouth constantly, Gunther? This is exactly why I didn’t want to take you.”</p>
<p>“Because it is my duty, my lady.”</p>
<p>“Well, enough of that. Rimuru seems like a sensible person to me. I’m not about to settle things with Veldora right here. There’s nothing you need to worry about.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“I said enough! You have no right to boss around a demon lord as old as I am! I bid you to go back ahead of me!”</p>
<p>Gunther gave a tired sigh to this show of force from his master. But he couldn’t defy her. After a few moments of thought, he carried out her orders.</p>
<p>“…I will return now, in that case.”</p>
<p>Luminus smiled. “Very good. Thank you, Gunther. You worry far too much. We have Louis and Hinata here.”</p>
<p>“I cannot help but worry about my princess,” he replied, looking at Louis. “I leave her in your hands, Louis.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Louis wasn’t too enthused about this, either. His expression didn’t change, but I could sense it anyway. Maybe Luminus was in the habit of using and abusing them both on a regular basis…or at least, that’s what the conversation suggested to me.</p>
<p>Regardless, Gunther vanished the moment he heard Louis’s reply. Once she was sure he was gone, Luminus brightened up.</p>
<p>“And now that I’ve swatted that bothersome gnat away, we have a party to enjoy!”</p>
<p>Thus, Hinata and everyone under her on hand was joining the feast—whether they wanted to or not. Nobody dared voice any disagreement—nobody was foolish enough to rile Luminus. That <a id="page-27"></a>was how spectacular her fight with Veldora had been, really. It might’ve been a little light sparring from their perspective, but if any of the paladins got too close, it would’ve spelled disaster for them.</p>
<p>It’s a good thing I was around to stop them just now, or the fallout around town would’ve been catastrophic. Some of them had turned pale, contemplating what they had just narrowly avoided, while others hadn’t even realized the gravity of it all yet. Which—yeah—if you were a paladin, today’s myriad of events must’ve been mind-blowing. My battle with Hinata was superhuman enough as it was, but then we extinguished the Seven Days Clergy, and <em>then</em> they found out the god they worshipped all along was a demon lord… <em>Then</em>, to cap it off, the Veldora fight. It seemed to me that their faith in Hinata was the only thing that allowed them to keep it together, but this would take time for them to fully accept.</p>
<p><em>But hey, let’s all relax for today, okay?</em></p>
<p>Rigurd, perhaps picking up on this, clapped his hands a few times and began barking out orders, sending the townspeople around him scurrying in all directions. Some collected everyone’s horses; some approached the paladins to accept their weapons and armor; some gave out potions to the wounded. And I guess the paladins really <em>did</em> believe in Hinata, because once she handed her gear over, the rest all followed. Some were even trying out our recovery potion, acting shocked at the results.</p>
<p>I thought this was going to be harder, for some reason. But this was actually pretty chill.</p>

<p class="tx1">“Now, it will be some time before the meal is ready, so why not take a bath first to take the grime off your bodies? We have rooms prepared for all of you, of course, so you may feel free to relax as well.”</p>
<p>The paladins didn’t seem to understand what any of that meant.</p>
<p>I knew the people of Englesia were in the habit of bathing regularly. I think the words used were all familiar to them. Hinata’s team members were using inns along the way, apparently, and they <a id="page-28"></a>all definitely had baths. Perhaps they never imagined monsters wanting a dip now and then, too.</p>
<p><em>Well, prepare to be amazed, guys! The baths we got here will beat anything you’ll see in your capital, trust me. Really more of a hot spring, in fact, and I’ve got everything from a large pool-like room to private open-air baths. Just like a hot-spring-resort town back in Japan, I’ve got all kinds of different types to try out. It makes for killer advertising, and besides, it just feels good when you’re all tired out.</em></p>
<p>They’d also need some new clothes to change into, wouldn’t they? The simple gear under their armor was battered and torn, a hopeless mess after all the fighting they’d been through. A change of clothes should be good PR, too, I thought. Maybe some of the hemp-based <em>jinbei</em> shirt-and-shorts outfits we’d just developed? We had the more kimono-like <em>yukata</em> for the women, too—in a pretty broad color selection, even.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t you worry,” Haruna told me with a grin. “Lady Shuna is already underway with preparations.”</p>
<p>I guess I had nothing to worry about. Let’s get going, then.</p>
<p>“All right, everyone. Please, enjoy our baths, the pride of our nation. The water is all pumped in from a natural spring, and I guarantee you’ll find it rejuvenating. Does absolute wonders for your skin, too.”</p>
<p>The salesman side of me was in full swing. Luminus swiftly took the bait.</p>
<p>“Ah, a bath? And good for the skin? Fascinating. I imagine you have saved your finest private bath chamber for me, yes?”</p>
<p>Um, private chamber?</p>
<p>And then I remembered. In the Dwarven Kingdom, as advanced as their tech was, personal steam baths were the common custom. They didn’t have bathhouses meant for use by great numbers of people at once. Englesia had public facilities like that, but Blumund didn’t. If the common people wanted to keep clean, after all, there were household magic spells for that, no water required. Every town had people who’d cast them on you for a nominal fee.</p>
<p>What all this meant was that, in this world, there’s no common, unified custom of drawing a bath and just soaking in it for a while. <a id="page-29"></a>A private bath was a grand luxury, something that would only be possessed by the upper class—and even then only in nations with a large population of otherworlders. I kept forgetting that, given how my home nation installed baths even in one-bedroom apartments.</p>
<p>Luminus must’ve been anticipating some nobleman’s grandiose gilded chamber of delights, but I was gonna have to disappoint her. There was no telling how angry she’d be if I just guided her to our regular baths without explanation. I decided to address her misconceptions before anything else.</p>
<p>“No, um, we have baths that everyone can go in. Separated by gender, of course, but there’s also a mixed bath if that’s more of what you’re into…?”</p>
<p>I thought that would’ve been enough. But others reacted before her.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>“What was that?!”</p>
<p>“Ah-haaa…”</p>
<p>Arnaud and the other male paladins had stars in their eyes. Heh-heh. Must’ve piqued their curiosity.</p>
<p>“Well, if you’re interested, right over there we have—”</p>
<p>I stopped midway. Hinata’s frigid stare was pointed right at me. <em>She</em> wasn’t falling for it.</p>
<p>“Lady Luminus, let’s go to a women’s bath. This will be my first hot spring visit in a while, so this is a very exciting opportunity.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Well, if you say so, Hinata, I will not stop you.”</p>
<p>I expected as much. But ah well. And here I was hoping I could join Hinata and Luminus for a… Wait, hang on. I shouldn’t give up yet, maybe. Arnaud and his cohorts looked profoundly disappointed, but it was a fool’s errand to expect the women to join the men in there. But what if it was just me?</p>
<p>“All right,” I said, giving the paladins a suitably sheepish look, “let me guide you to the women’s bath.”</p>
<p>I tried to walk away as casually as possible. But it wasn’t going to be that easy.</p>
<p>“Wait one moment. Why are <em>you</em> trying to take us there?”</p>
<p>“Why? You’re gonna need a guide, Hinata.”</p>
<p><a id="page-30"></a>No need to panic yet. Just keep calm. Make it seem natural.</p>
<p>“You don’t know the way there, do you? We have baths with different compositions of minerals and stuff. There’s even a sauna. I just thought it’d be prudent to explain how it all worked.”</p>
<p>I had once guided two of the Three Lycanthropeers through it all, I explained to them, after they’d expressed an interest. They loved it, so that was now the custom I took.</p>
<p>“So yeah, I thought I could give you a better picture of how great all this stuff is, you know?”</p>
<p>“Let me handle that, Sir Rimuru!”</p>
<p>I <em>really</em> didn’t need Shion’s support right now, thanks. Gotta take a firm stand.</p>
<p>“Oh, I dunno if I can rely on you alone, Shion.”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“But hey, come on! No need to be a stick in the mud. I’ll even join you in there.”</p>
<p>I tried to sound as chill as possible. Now my going around the women’s bath wouldn’t seem odd at all. Hee-hee-hee… Perfect. The perfect plan. Now I could join her in the—</p>
<p>“No, wait. You <em>used</em> to be a man, didn’t you? Why are you acting like it’s completely normal for you to join us in there?”</p>
<p>Erk.</p>
<p>She saw through it?!</p>
<p>I shouldn’t be able to sweat, but I swore I could still feel a cold sensation running down my back. Luminus joined Hinata’s skepticism, giving me a “Hmm?” and a focused look.</p>
<p>“Well, no, I mean…”</p>
<p>I was starting to panic, but before I could formulate a coherent thought:</p>
<p>“What is the matter with it? Sir Rimuru is Sir Rimuru!”</p>
<p>Shion, the one person I thought I couldn’t count on here, swooped in to back me up. <em>That’s right! Keep it going!</em> I tried to mentally encourage her, but—in the end—Shion was Shion, too.</p>
<p>“But <em>you</em> can guide us around, too, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>“In that case, I’d like to ask you a favor, would you mind?”</p>
<p><a id="page-31"></a>“But…”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t this be a good opportunity to prove to your leader that you <em>can</em> be relied upon?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see!”</p>
<p>In distressingly short order, Hinata had cajoled Shion to join her side. Even worse, the two Lycanthropeers joining us chose that moment to speak up.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Shion. We’ll be there, too, so if you forget anything, we can help!”</p>
<p>“Quite so. We’ve become regulars at this point, so we know how it all works.”</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru,” Shion replied, her mind made up, “please let me handle this!”</p>
<p>“Uh… Sure. Make me proud.”</p>
<p>Aw. And here I was hoping to get a look at Hinata’s lovely naked body…but at this point, giving up was the only option left. I had just lost the chance of a lifetime, and I had to face up to that, as much as it distressed me.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Pulling myself back together, I turned toward Benimaru.</p>
<p>“Pfft. Ah well. I’ll pay the men’s bath a visit for the first time in a while.”</p>
<p>That’s one thing I like to give myself credit for—my ability to mentally switch gears fast.</p>
<p>“Okay, who wants to scrub my back? Nothing like letting water from deep in the mountains take the sweat and fatigue away.”</p>
<p>“Allow me, sir…”</p>
<p>Benimaru and the gang loved the hot spring we’d all built together. Going in as a group now and then wasn’t such a bad thing.</p>
<p>“Kwah-ha-ha! Will you do <em>my</em> back then, Rimuru?”</p>
<p>“Why do I have to do something like <em>that</em>?!”</p>
<p>I had no interest in dealing with Veldora. Brushing him off, I took the lead as we all headed over.</p>
<p>The majority of paladins were male, nearly a hundred in all, but that was no problem for my main bathhouse facility. If there was just one room, that would fill it up, but we had several, allowing <a id="page-32"></a>them all to bathe at once. I could tell some of them were nervous—it must’ve been exciting for them. I’d love to give ’em a bit of a shock.</p>
<p>As I walked on, thinking this over, I ran into Shuna.</p>
<p>“I’ve prepared the clothing—but why are you together with the gentlemen, Sir Rimuru?”</p>
<p>The question was casual enough, but her eyes weren’t smiling. It gave me pause.</p>
<p>“Oh, I just thought I’d join them in the baths.”</p>
<p>Shuna gave me a cute little grin. <em>Uh-oh. Doesn’t that mean she’s incredibly angry?</em></p>
<p>“How do you mean?” she asked, sizing us up before squaring her gaze upon Benimaru and Soei. “I’m sorry, Sir Rimuru has an errand to handle, so I’m afraid he cannot join you. Also, Benimaru and Soei, I would like to speak with you later.”</p>
<p>“Er, um—”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The two fell silent under Shuna’s pressure. I wasn’t sure what this was about, but they must’ve felt it wise to avoid stoking her rage any further.</p>
<p>Me, meanwhile? I was being assigned to the bath in my detached house. How could it be? What set off Shuna like that? I had no idea, even as Shuna pointed me straight back home.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">After wrapping up a quick bath, I decided to check on how our prep work was going.</p>
<p>We’d be using the banquet hall for the festivities. With all the events we’d been hosting lately, I had this hall hastily built for us; it had only just been completed. Basically, it looked like a circular domed stadium, about the size of a gymnasium inside. Internally, it was wide open, the floor lined with tatami mats. It was meant to serve as an evacuation site in case of emergency, so it could hold a fair number of people. We had a lot of space to work with, so we used steel frame to construct a building of a decent size and sturdiness, but over time, this was going to change to magisteel. <a id="page-33"></a>Our nation, and all the powerful magic-born living in it, had a lot of natural advantages like that.</p>
<p>As I thought about this, food began to be delivered on serving trays, on a set of intricate-looking bowls like you’d see in a fancy restaurant. I had shown them how to knead clay into bowls like that, but then the children started imitating me, and nowadays you saw a lot of really impressive pieces. For colors, they made dyes out of herbal extracts or mixed weird ores into the clay, resulting in some dazzling work at times. The children’s output was being used in the homes of families across town.</p>
<p>It’s important to experiment with a lot of things, right? You never know what’s going to stick. The trays themselves were intricately detailed as well, made by Dold using processed wood from other projects. The kids started imitating that, too, and these days, handicraft sessions were part of regular recreation in Tempest.</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, from hot springs to the containers the food came in, my personal tastes were starting to show their presence everywhere. Compared with those first few days of chewing on grass, life had become unbelievably better for me. The food itself was really enjoyable now, too. I guess it’s easier to strive for something if you really feel like it’ll benefit you personally.</p>
<p>The main dish on tonight’s menu was tempura. Excellent. I mean, progressing <em>this</em> far was seriously moving to me. It looked perfect; it tasted amazing. All the work of Shuna in the galley. Definitely <em>not</em> Shion, it went without saying. Whether Shion had the Master Chef skill or not, one look at her attempts at cuisine and you knew she couldn’t be trusted with the responsibilities of a kitchen.</p>
<p class="space-break1">This tempura had also come about after I showed my memories to Shuna and we developed each component, piece by piece. And that wasn’t all. Fried chicken, hamburger, steak, croquettes, fried shrimp—I loved it all, and it went without saying that Milim did, too.</p>
<p>For someone like me, not that well versed in cooking, trying to explain the difference between fried shrimp and tempura was quite a challenge. In simple terms, all you’re doing is taking shrimp, coating it with batter, and frying it in oil—but the batter makes all the <a id="page-34"></a>difference in texture and taste, you know? Frying can be done in a bunch of different ways, too, and trying to re-create that based on my (hazy) memories of look, and feel, and taste, proved fiendishly difficult. It took <em>work</em>, and now, thanks to Shuna’s efforts, it had come all the way here.</p>
<p>Englesia had a lot of good food to enjoy, but nothing I’d describe as Japanese. Guy Crimson had prepared a Western-style full-course meal for me, but I just didn’t see a lot of Asian influence in this world’s cuisine. One reason for that: Few of the Western Nations bordered an ocean, so seafood wasn’t in plentiful supply. Attempting to preserve the freshness of ingredients with magic, it was explained to me, took a massive investment that few were willing to make. Thus, even if you had otherworlders who ran kitchens back in Japan, they couldn’t do much without the right raw materials.</p>
<p>That made me recall the Japanese otherworlder, Yoshida, who ran that bakery and cake shop I liked in Englesia. He lamented how he used to enjoy making “drunken” cakes with gin, bourbon, and so on, but just couldn’t find anything like that in this world. I remember how excited he got after I told him I’d throw some his way.</p>
<p>Thinking about that made me realize just how blessed I was over here. Just because you have a recipe doesn’t mean you’ll pull it off flawlessly on the first try, after all. And with Japanese cuisine in particular, tracking down ingredients was a challenge. I’d do things like go to the sea and capture a bunch of different fish species to try to find an equivalent to make bonito flakes from. Having a skill like Spatial Motion made it possible to transport goods in as fresh a condition as possible, which greatly expanded what was available to us. (I wanted to build a transport network that wasn’t so dependent on magic skills, but that was a topic for the future.)</p>
<p>Cuisine, after all, is culture itself. If a nation doesn’t have a vibrant, expansive food culture, then if you ask me, what’s the point? Out of the three basic needs—food, clothing, and shelter—food was number one by far to me, although your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>This was why I was expending (some would say wasting) a lot of energy developing new dishes. Wheat-based grain was easier than I surmised at first. I saw loaves of white bread in the Englesian <a id="page-35"></a>capital; if you were well-off enough to afford it, it seemed like a daily staple. Studying the production process for that got us bread in Tempest in relatively short order.</p>
<p>Right now, the main issue to tackle was white rice. We still hadn’t engineered something up to snuff taste-wise. Compared with what one saw in Japan, painstakingly curated and improved since ancient times, the quality just wasn’t there. That was expected; I wasn’t anticipating a sudden breakthrough for this one. Raising plants with magic, at least, sped up the harvests quite a bit, although research was still at a halt right now due to the winter season. For the moment, we just had a few experimental rice plants growing indoors, managed by researchers. Real results seemed like they’d be a while to come.</p>
<p>I actually <em>did</em> have a solution for this, though. When I asked Raphael about a potential answer, it gave it to me right off—basically, use Shion’s Master Chef skill to alter the resulting rice. Tinkering the final plant rather than the initial seeds, after all, made improving the quality quite a bit easier. But was that really the right thing to do? It wasn’t like anyone else could copy this method, and it seemed kind of ethically suspect to me…but given how much I relied on just that method to fine-tune our alcoholic drinks, I was in no position to moralize. Put my conscience and my appetite on the scales, and the latter’s gonna win every time.</p>
<p>Since we couldn’t ask Shion to alter every harvest for us, our research continued. But I <em>did</em> have her engineer a small supply of lovely white rice, though. Just a bit. Mainly for my personal consumption. Shion was more than glad to help, so I gave the bag to Shuna and had her steam it up for special occasions. Occasions like this one. I was entertaining a demon lord. Let’s <em>live</em> a little.</p>
<p>If I wanted to make our relationship a good one, I had to demonstrate how useful my nation could be. The carrot and the stick. When someone you don’t like treats you well for a change, your impression of them goes up much higher than it does with someone you’re already on good terms with. Imagine the ex–juvenile delinquent who volunteers to help out kids for charity—that kind of thing.</p>
<p><a id="page-36"></a>Maybe a little show like that could turn Luminus and crew to my side. I wasn’t sure the paladins would be that gullible, but appealing to people’s stomachs is a pretty classic—and effective—strategy to take. It was a tad underhanded, but it was also a great excuse to turn this evening’s feast into an extravaganza. And sure, the white rice might disagree with their palates—that particular element of our cuisine is more for me as a Japanese person—but I bet Hinata would appreciate it. It sure wowed <em>me</em> after going without it for a while.</p>
<p>Plus, who doesn’t like tempura? Nobody, that’s who. It was already a hit with the adventurers and merchants; Benimaru, in particular, was actually a huge fan. Clearly, there were no obstacles to its acceptance in this world.</p>
<p>As I reflected on this, the serving trays were all put in place. Now we just had to wait for the paladins to get out of the bath.</p>

<p class="tx1">The place settings were lined up in the shape of the letter C, with three seats at the center—me in the middle, Veldora and Luminus on either side. It gave me a view of everyone at the banquet, with the paladins and our city’s officials facing each other along the arc. This had the nuance of an informal gathering, so I wanted to be sure people could all see one another.</p>
<p>Soon, the paladins were ushered into the banquet hall. They had just come out from the bath, wearing the <em>yukata</em> and <em>jinbei</em> prepared for them. It must’ve been a novel experience, but they looked comfortable for the most part. You’d be hard-pressed to find something even more relaxing to wear around the house, after all—kind of like lounging around in sweats all day.</p>
<p>They all seemed a bit on edge as they were guided inside. The lack of tables and chairs must have thrown them, not to mention the custom of taking off their footwear before going up on the tatami floor. The goblinas guiding them along were in their element, however, demonstrating some pretty surprising elegance. Vester must’ve been teaching them well. I could tell some of the paladins weren’t sure what to make of them.</p>
<p><a id="page-37"></a>Luminus sat down first, the picture of high society as she settled next to me. Louis was next, a practical mirror image of the former demon lord Roy and every bit as dignified as his papal rank suggested. Third was Hinata, who (after sitting down) looked at me, determined.</p>
<p>“I have to apologize for all the trouble we’ve given you. What happened today, as well as the last time we met, was thanks to my own poor judgment. It wasn’t an order from Lady Luminus, and my paladins are not responsible for it. I don’t know if you can find it in yourself to forgive me, but—”</p>
<p>“Whoa, stop right there!”</p>
<p>I had to stop her before she started kowtowing to me on the tatami. Our first encounter? Yeah, that was all her fault. But our most recent rumble was all a misunderstanding, the Seven Days guys pulling the strings behind it, and Luminus had already taken care of them. And with Diablo wrapping things up over in Farmus as well, I saw no reason to keep dragging out the issue.</p>
<p>That’s why I stepped up to interrupt her. But then I made an astonishing new discovery. I… I thought I could see it—the smoothly undulating twin peaks, unfolding underneath her partially opened <em>yukata</em>!! Slightly flushed after the bath and so supremely captivating!</p>
<p>I hadn’t deliberately tried for that, but man, talk about good timing! Was this Raphael at work?</p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Understood. That is not the case.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1">That reply sounded a little cold to me, but it didn’t matter. Oh, man. I was starting to feel…<em>adventurous</em>. Now would normally be when I began sporting wood, but <em>that</em> thing was long gone. Ah well. A man never leaves his sense of adventure behind! Good thing I don’t get nosebleeds in this body, either.</p>
<p>A <em>yukata</em>, though, huh? Wow. Talk about packing a punch. A woman, fresh from the bath, in a <em>yukata</em>. There’s just no beating that. And if that woman was as beautiful as Hinata, the fearsome synergy that results…</p>
<p>…Well, she got me. I gave in. Defeated. I’d forgive her for anything she’d done. In fact, I already had.</p>
