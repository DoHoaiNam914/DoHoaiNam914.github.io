<p><a id="page-119"/>He looked a bit concerned. I must have left him too long without updates. Although I didn’t intend for it to turn into a fight, we had certain Luminism doctrine issues to deal with. If we were going to continue dealing with the Western Nations, we couldn’t afford to ignore the Holy Church issues. Now, however, that was all taken care of. We had nothing left to worry about.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee… Yeah, I ‘worked them out,’ all right. Hinata and I made amends peacefully, and I also worked things out with Lu…”</p>
<p>“Lu?”</p>
<p>“Lu… Loose ends! We managed to set a few ground rules and tie up any loose ends, that’s all. Everything’s peachy keen now!”</p>
<p>“Ahhh, I see! And here I thought the Western Holy Church was a much more intimidating group to work with. Glad to see they’re more reasonable than that. Maybe I was too worried for my own good!”</p>
<p>Mjöllmile gave me a relieved smile. I politely smiled back, sweating on the inside about the mistake I just barely avoided making. If I had followed through there and said Luminus’s name, there’d be hell to pay—which I could deal with, but what if she decided to rub out Mjöllmile as well? I was inviting both Luminus <em>and</em> Hinata and her Crusaders to the Founder’s Festival, so I’d better not shoot my mouth off before then—not that I knew whether the demon lord would deign to grace my little event with her presence. She’d probably be like “Why would I ever let myself be seen among the rabble?” or something. I’m sure she’d be an incredibly demanding visitor if she showed, so I honestly didn’t mind if she declined. <em>Though, maybe I ought to encourage her to attend…? I don’t know.</em></p>
<p>“In that case,” Mjöllmile happily exclaimed as I thought about this, “let me show you the results of our training so far!”</p>
<p>There was no point wondering about whether she’d come. I needed to consider my own program for now.</p>
<p>“Oh, has it been going well?”</p>
<p>“Nothing less than perfect! We’ve trained them to the point that everyone can perform their tasks on the same level.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I knew you wouldn’t let me down, Mjöllmile!”</p>
<p>We grinned at each other. It sounded like making our debut at the fest wouldn’t be an issue.</p>
<p><a id="page-120"/>“So can we put up a storefront offering burgers, hot dogs, fries, and the drink lineup we talked about?”</p>
<p>“That we can. And I think we can attract customers with those beef skewers dipped in the ‘secret sauce’ you talked about. Pairing them with a rice bowl will definitely improve our bottom line.”</p>
<p>“It’s been getting good reviews?”</p>
<p>Mjöllmile briskly nodded. “It’s become a low-key staff favorite, that’s for sure.”</p>
<p>Making yakitori skewers out of cowdeer and chiducken seemed to satisfy people.</p>
<p>“Great! Let’s add that to the menu, too. Do we have enough employees to work with?”</p>
<p>“Well, for the moment, I’m thinking we could launch with upward of twenty locations. But starting that big would take a fair amount of money. We’d need backup personnel, which I’m training right now—that’s a necessary expense, the way I see it. So along those lines, if we can deploy more gradually, say five locations at a time, that’ll put us well within budget.”</p>
<p>That’s Mjöllmile for you. He fully understood my proposal, and already he was working out any staff issues involved. In that case:</p>
<p>“All right. Well, sorry to trouble you for this, but can you bring over around five of your best employees?”</p>
<p>“Five? What did you want from them?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve got this friend of mine. His name’s Veldora.”</p>
<p>“V-Veldora?!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and he’s, like, <em>super</em>–worked up about opening a hibachi booth at the fest.”</p>
<p>“Er, <em>is</em> he…?”</p>
<p>Mjöllmile seemed to be growing visibly paler as I explained. It worried me, but I soldiered on.</p>
<p>“So you know, it’d be way too dangerous to leave him running that by himself, right?”</p>
<p>“I—I would say so, yes…”</p>
<p>I beamed at him. “So that’s why I want five of your best staffers to help him!”</p>
<p><a id="page-121"/>Mjöllmile, watching me gleefully dump all the responsibility on him, turned his eyes toward the ceiling. “Would you be able to guarantee the…er, safety of this staff?”</p>
<p>“Of course! Whenever they have any problems, they can come right to me. If Veldora starts getting all uppity, I’ll put ’im in his place.”</p>
<p>“I trust you will, yes, but… Um, we <em>are</em> talking about <em>the</em> Veldora, yes? The Storm Dragon?”</p>
<p>I suppose we were. Guess Mjöllmile knew the name, didn’t he?</p>
<p>“Is that bad?”</p>
<p>“Ahhh… <em>Bad</em> may not be the correct term. I just wonder if the crew will be, too, well, petrified to get any work done…”</p>
<p>Hmm. I should’ve known. Yeah, if you haven’t met Veldora, you must think he’s crazy scary, huh? Catastrophe-class, and all that.</p>
<p>“Well…maybe that’s not a good idea, huh?”</p>
<p>“No, perhaps not… If he could at least assume another name for himself, temporarily, our staff could work for him unawares…”</p>
<p>A<em>ha!</em></p>
<p>“Yes! Brilliant, Mollie! Let’s give him another name so nobody knows who he is!”</p>
<p>“Huh? You—you can <em>do</em> that?!”</p>
<p>“Sure. If he whines about it, I’ll just tell him he can’t do the hibachi thing at all. Right, let’s do that. And I’ll pay a special bonus to the five people you pick for me, so let them know I’m counting on ’em, okay?”</p>
<p>Whether Mjöllmile was keeping up with me or not, I considered this problem as good as solved. Veldora was being as selfish as always, but we were entertaining world celebrities here. Embarrassment would be the least of our worries if he gave all our guests food poisoning or whatever, so I couldn’t rest easy until I knew there were people who could watch over and direct him. I didn’t want to dismiss him out of hand, but I was too nervous to let him off the leash completely, so it’s a lucky thing Mjöllmile had the staff trained like I asked him.</p>
<p>He looked like he wanted to tell me something, but probably nothing important. The ball was in his court now.</p>

<p class="tx1">Rimuru looked supremely happy with himself at resolving this issue. Mjöllmile, meanwhile, felt like someone had just thrown a lit bomb into his lap.</p>
<p><em>L-Lord Veldora?! I knew the seal had been undone, but he wants me to deal with</em> him?!</p>
<p>This was a major headache in the making, for sure.</p>
<p>Rimuru was talking sense at first. Building a stand for the festival would be a good training opportunity. But if they were babysitting Veldora as well, that was another story. Mjöllmile wondered what the hell he had just gotten himself into, but as he observed the smiling, carefree Rimuru in front of him, he decided to take the “Ah well” approach. Ever since Rimuru saved him, he had tried to live life with no regrets. He might’ve been conniving and obsessed with money, but he was nothing if not brave.</p>
<p>“But a festival, though, eh? If we’re talking a large-scale event, I imagine you must have people jumping up and down to join in. A good opportunity for a merchant like myself, hmm?”</p>
<p>He had reason to think so. Many people, merchants and adventurers in particular, were now filing in and out of Tempest. It was starting to get heavily advertised; Mjöllmile was sure they were attracting curious travelers from the nearby towns and villages. That was exactly the kind of situation a merchant stood to profit from.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re interested?” Rimuru took a sip from his tea, apparently picking up on Mjöllmile’s muttering. “You know, to tell the truth, I’m still wavering on a few things with this festival. I know you’ve helped us decide on some of our attractions already, but I’m still trying to think of a big, flashy centerpiece for the event.”</p>
<p>“A centerpiece?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Basically, my plan is to turn our town into a kind of health resort. We’ve got our hot-spring infrastructure in place, along with lodging and guest houses suitable for royalty…but I feel like we’re still lacking in entertainment.”</p>
<p>“I see,” Mjöllmile replied, figuring it wouldn’t hurt to hear him out.</p>
<p><a id="page-123"/>As the excited Rimuru then explained, Tempest already boasted a healthy amount of high-end accommodation. Mjöllmile had stayed in it before, so he knew that much. The rooms on offer ran the gamut, providing a selection of things to enjoy—a nice meal with a fine view of the gardens, an open-air hot spring to relax in, and so on. In the smaller nations of the world, it’d be hard for even the nobility to maintain their own private baths. That went double if there wasn’t any water service, forcing you to physically dump water in a tub and heat it up manually.</p>
<p>To Mjöllmile, who took that for granted, a facility with a hot spring you could enjoy any time you liked was nothing short of mind-blowing…but apparently Rimuru wasn’t satisfied with just that.</p>
<p>“I understand all that,” he said, “but if you already have good food and relaxing spaces, how much more of a resort do you need?”</p>
<p>Rimuru shook his head. “You aren’t thinking big enough, Mjöllmile. Me, I think that won’t be enough on its own. I’d like some kind of project that everyone can have a little more fun with. Like, for example…”</p>
<p>What Rimuru then laid out for him was a complete recreational tourism strategy for the Forest of Jura. They’d provide travelers with day-long walking tours deep into the forest, accompanied by a guide/bodyguard. They’d hold fishing tournaments at the nearby canyons, hunting tours amid untouched natural reserves, and so on and so on. All the needed equipment would be available to rent for anyone interested.</p>
<p>“That <em>does</em> sound exciting. It’d certainly attract the kind of nobility with all the time in the world on their hands—and for those with more active work lives, it’d be a fine way to relax.”</p>
<p>“Right, you see? That’s what I’m hoping for, but I’m just wondering if there’s something we can get <em>everybody</em> in on, you know?”</p>
<p>One of Rimuru’s aims with the Founder’s Festival, it seemed, was to encourage repeat visitors to Tempest. He was coming up with all kinds of things to keep travelers engaged and interested in the area. Mjöllmile was both amazed and exasperated. How many years ahead was he even thinking?</p>
<p><a id="page-124"/>“Well, why not use Englesia as an example to imitate? The theater is quite popular over in their capital, I hear. They hold operas and stage plays nearly every day of the year there. You also see fighting tournaments held live at the arena…”</p>
<p>“Oooh! Oh, yes! Where the Hero Masayuki is, right? Isn’t he really popular?”</p>
<p>“He certainly is. Lightspeed Masayuki, as they call him. He’s dominated the tournaments for years. I’m actually rather a fan of his.”</p>
<p>“You are?!”</p>
<p>Even a hardened merchant like Mjöllmile had his sports allegiances. He began giving an in-depth explanation of the tournament system to Rimuru, failing to notice how he began to yawn almost instantly.</p>
<p>“…So really, nobody’s seen a man’s sword flash that way before. Hence the name Lightspeed, as you see. Occasionally, they hold to-the-death battles with captured monsters, but the Hero’s fighting companions are pretty strong themselves. I’ve been in the audience for some real white-knuckle matches myself. And if <em>you</em> had a spectacle like that… Ah, but I’m sorry. I’ve been talking for far too long. But come to think of it, isn’t <em>your</em> staff pretty strong, too, Rimuru? Who’s the strongest out of—?”</p>
<p>“Whoa! Stop right there! I can’t let you go on, Mjöllmile.”</p>
<p>It was obvious Mjöllmile’s interest would shift over to Benimaru and the rest of Rimuru’s officers, sooner or later. He had met Rigurd and the others several times, and to him, their muscles couldn’t have been just for show. Between them and all the other powerful magic-born he saw around town, he couldn’t help but wonder who was champion among them all. Now seemed like a good time to ask, but Rimuru’s reaction was chilly.</p>
<p>“Listen,” Rimuru said, voice lowered. “Between you and me, if you start talking like <em>that</em> around them, it’s gonna cause some serious disputes, you know? There’s this paladin named Arnaud, and he actually asked the same question back when we were all negotiating earlier. It led to the most insipid argument you ever saw—they were all trying to rank themselves on some impossible-to-understand scale, and it was starting to get pretty heated before I stepped in. I <a id="page-125"/>was lucky enough that only part of my staff was there, but seriously, better avoid topics like that. It’s a real powder keg with those guys.”</p>
<p>The one official who’d likely pitch the biggest fit of all about the question wasn’t there, Rimuru said, so he’d managed to talk everyone down from their fervor. He’d been trying to avoid such delicate questions ever since. If his main staff ever got into a real fight with one another, it could affect everything he’d striven to build for his town, and he couldn’t afford to risk that.</p>
<p>“I… I see. My pardons, then.”</p>
<p>“That’s okay. Just be careful around them. But I <em>do</em> like your point of view here…”</p>
<p>Rimuru didn’t seem overly concerned about the issue, unlike Mjöllmile. <em>I’d say</em> he’s <em>a little skewed, too</em>, he thought as he waited for Rimuru to continue.</p>
<p>“There <em>is</em> one vacant section of town. Perhaps we could turn it into an opera house, huh? Maybe that’d encourage people to become playwrights, and that’d lead to some new forms of entertainment. And an arena, huh…?”</p>
<p>He looked at Mjöllmile, and the merchant could almost see the gears turning behind his smile. <em>Great</em>, he thought. <em>He’s got some grandiose plan in mind again. Why does he always have to look like that? He’s good-looking enough as long as he keeps his mouth shut…</em></p>
<p>“Mollie!”</p>
<p>He shuddered. The moment had come. “Y-yes?”</p>
<p>“You know a lot about battle tournaments, right?” Rimuru stood up and then sat next to Mjöllmile, voice as ingratiating as possible as he practically whispered in his ear. “How ’bout we hold one, then? Can you arrange that for me?”</p>
<p>“N-now, wait just a minute! That’s a lot to put on my plate out of—”</p>
<p>“We can build the arena for you. For now, I just need you to handle the ‘show’ aspect!”</p>
<p>Mjöllmile’s objections fell on deaf ears. There was no point resisting him any longer.</p>
<p>“There’s just no beating you, is there, Rimuru? Every single time. All right. I promise I’ll do my best for you!”</p>
<p><a id="page-126"/>He showed a bit of a smile now. Honestly, Mjöllmile didn’t hate this. In fact, being assigned such a vital mission was like music to his ears. What did he need to put on a show like that? He’d have to both research it and put his thoughts into action. Never in his dreams did he ever think he’d be entrusted with such a large-scale event.</p>
<p><em>Well, I’m in deep now! I… I’ll never get this chance again!</em></p>
<p>He didn’t even care if he messed this up. Based on all the business partners he ever had, he knew this man, Rimuru, wasn’t the type to get angry over one failure or the other. He brought ideas into fruition fast, and he could be trusted—the most important thing to any merchant. If he said he’d build an arena, he’d build an arena—as unbelievable as it was to Mjöllmile, he could give his monsters any orders he wanted, and they’d be able to pull it off for him.</p>
<p><em>He may not look it too often, but Rimuru’s a demon lord. As long as his plans are sound, it’d be simple for him to assemble everything he needed. And now he’s relying on me…</em></p>
<p>“Good to hear,” Rimuru replied blithely as Mjöllmile’s emotions ran wild. “And I know we’re trying to get lots of world leaders, but make sure regular people can join in the fun, too, okay? You can’t make a profit if it’s not open to the general public, after all. I saw that in Englesia.”</p>
<p>“The general public?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’m going to build a coliseum capable of holding fifty thousand people or so. Like I said, there’s some vacant space to work with. If we build that fast-food stand we were talking about nearby, that ought to goose our profits, won’t it? We could have people go around selling food, and besides, the more foot traffic passing by, the more customers we’ll get, right? What do you think, Mollie?”</p>
<p>Rimuru was picturing entertainment for the masses—and taking the masses’ money. A fifty-thousand-seat coliseum would compare to Englesia’s pretty favorably—in fact, it’d be five times that arena’s size. It showed how serious Rimuru was about this.</p>
<p>“You see, we can have some standing-room sections that we’ll let people into at no charge. Meanwhile, we can direct rich people to <a id="page-127"/>the reserved seats and charge them appropriately. And then we’ll have royal boxes for the nobility with more money than sense. We’ll also need seats for special guests and invitees and things. I’d like you to figure out the ratios we need for all these seat types, if we want to make as much money as possible.”</p>
<p>Once again, he was leaving it all to Mjöllmile with a smile. Not even Englesia’s arena allowed the farmer and citizen classes to watch arena events for free. Mjöllmile could see the logic to it.</p>
<p>“I see… I thought fifty thousand was too high a number to aim for, but if <em>that’s</em> what you’re picturing…”</p>
<p>“Right. It’s important that we attract people’s interest with this stuff. And if we pack the standing-room sections, won’t that make a reserved seat look more attractive if you can afford it?”</p>
<p>“I bet it would. Better to reserve a spot instead of vying for space you don’t know will be available. That’ll naturally make the seats more valuable.”</p>
<p>This was a completely different approach from the arena in Englesia’s capital, which was chiefly a diversion for the upper classes. The aim here was to build buzz and pack as many people in as possible. It sounded deeply compelling to Mjöllmile. If admission was free, farmers and field laborers would come over to see the show when work didn’t occupy them—and when they spread the word about what they saw, that’d attract the middle classes from neighboring nations.</p>
<p>Besides, having tens of thousands of visitors would no doubt fill up the inns along the highways to Tempest—it’d be kind of neat to build the “fast food” establishments Rimuru described at stops along the way. When they arrived, of course, they’d need somewhere to stay. And if it could help advertise their food, their lodging, their baths, and so on, the arena wouldn’t even need to make a profit. The business all these fans would bring to town could more than make up for it.</p>
<p>“I gotta hand it to you, Rimuru. You had this all planned out from the start, didn’t you…?”</p>
<p>“Huh?! Um, yeah, kind of? Of course, yes!”</p>
<p>“You have enough hotel rooms for it, I think. The issue becomes <a id="page-128"/>how to attract guests on a regular basis. We’ll need to think about boosting our profit margins later, but spreading the word comes first, I think. And that’s what you’re counting on me to help with?”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah. Pretty much.”</p>
<p>“I see, I see. You want me to come up with the kind of entertainment that’ll bring people back again and again. Something that’ll make them contemplate another visit, even if this particular battle tournament turns a loss. If we do that, you’ll consider this a success?”</p>
<p>“…That’s exactly what I’m saying. I’m impressed you understand me so well, Mollie. You’re the only man I can trust with this job!”</p>
<p>This job—find ways to attract people to Tempest, using a battle tournament as bait—excited Mjöllmile to the core. And really, Rimuru had all but worked it out by himself before throwing it in his lap. He had to resist the urge to shout out loud with excitement.</p>
<p>“Heh…heh-heh… This is just too much…”</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s best to leave things like this to a professional, right? Don’t tell me you don’t feel up to it, Mollie?”</p>
<p>“Ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! How harsh of you. I never realized you had such a mean streak, Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha-ha! Right you are! But this is a piece of cake for you, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>They both laughed loudly at each other—then exchanged sly glances.</p>
<p>“You realize how much money is going to change hands here, hmm? I’m sure you do.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh-heh… Not to worry. You have Mjöllmile on your side, and accounting is my middle name. Just watch—I’m going to give you exactly the results you want!”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you will. Counting on you is the smartest thing I’ve ever done.”</p>
<p class="space-break1">Rimuru was right. This tournament <em>would</em> take a lot of money. He honestly scared Mjöllmile sometimes. He began to wonder just how far ahead he was thinking. The thought gave him vague fears, even as his mind filled with wild dreams.</p>
<p><a id="page-129"/>“Now, along those lines, I think I’ve stumbled upon a new way we can use your healing potions. That medicine can heal you as long as you are not killed instantly, yes? That means our competitors can fight with no small level of intensity, I assume. Plus, if a fighter is injured in one match and appears good as new in the next one, that would certainly make for some good advertising.”</p>
<p>“Wha?!”</p>
<p>“Oh, did you not think that far?”</p>
<p>“N-no, um, I did. It’s just that, you know, I wanted to see if your thoughts were any different from mine.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see! Yes, I’m sure you’ve already considered that much, Rimuru, heh-heh-heh… But I’m not done yet!”</p>
<p>Mjöllmile began to lay out idea after idea for him. This turned into a volley of brainstorming and compliments on the ideas. One concept was advertising the healing potion at the tournament, then selling it on-site to adventurers. Another involved weapon and armor rentals and sales.</p>
<p>“Even Kurobe’s failures at the forge are pretty off the charts when it comes to raw power. We can’t sell those to just anyone, but he has a workshop full of apprentices these days. Offering <em>their</em> stuff shouldn’t be an issue.”</p>
<p>They decided to give it a shot.</p>
<p>Another idea thrown around was state-run betting operations. This also existed in Englesia, where even simple pick ’em bets were netting huge amounts of revenue at the arena. They could do the same thing pitting warriors against captured monsters—which had its risks, of course, but Rimuru had a small army of powerful fighters at this point, so it wasn’t nearly the hazard Mjöllmile pictured. Maybe they could even offer training courses for beginner adventurers, reserving part of the arena’s space as a dojo of sorts. The lessons would be paid, of course, but they’d come with qualified instructors to guide newbies through the basics.</p>
<p>The ideas came rolling one after the other from Mjöllmile. As long as Rimuru was providing his full support, he felt like he’d never run out of them. He couldn’t stop thinking about how huge his role was, dreaming up possibilities and being responsible for <a id="page-130"/>making them happen. It was a bit daunting, but far more than that, exciting.</p>
<p>“I’ll do it,” he said with a shiver. “I’ll do it all for you! My merchant’s soul is telling me we’re going to make a massive pile of money on this!”</p>
<p>“Excellent! I love that confidence of yours, Mollie! And I <em>know</em> you got what it takes to give me the kind of revenue I want!”</p>
<p>Rimuru’s praise embarrassed Mjöllmile a bit. But he wasn’t done yet.</p>
<p>“Also, um, if you’re interested, of course, if this whole tournament turns out well, you wanna come live in my town? I could make a trade department for you—or maybe a PR firm or general financial office. It doesn’t matter what we call it, actually, but I could let you run it all. I got a pretty big population to govern these days, and once the tournament’s over, I think it’s high time we reorganize our administration. I’m sure everyone will agree to it, as long as you can pull this off. What d’you think?”</p>
<p>Rimuru sounded like he didn’t doubt Mjöllmile at all. It made his heart dance. The question “What d’you think?” plucked his heartstrings like a master harpist, and the melodies echoed over and over through his mind like a concert hall.</p>
<p>He gave him a strong nod. “…There’s just no beating you, Rimuru. Or should I start calling you <em>Sir</em> Rimuru? I promise you, Sir Rimuru, I’ll do whatever it takes to succeed and join your team!”</p>
<p>There wasn’t a moment’s hesitation. How could there ever be? <em>This man has counted on me so far</em>, he thought. <em>I can’t let myself mess this up!</em></p>
<p>As advanced as he was in age, Mjöllmile was now captive to the burning fires of excitement and hope and dreams in his heart. He could barely stay seated. He wished he could bottle this feeling up in a jar and keep it nearby forever.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to exaggerate.” Rimuru laughed, but the more they got into details, the more Mjöllmile felt like he was going to jump out of his skin. Pulling this event off, and becoming Rimuru’s trusted associate, was his new ambition in life, and he was ready to fight tooth and nail to make it happen.</p>
<p>Once Rimuru left, Mjöllmile called over his retainers and servants.</p>
<p><a id="page-131"/>“What did Sir Rimuru want from you, Sir Mjöllmile?” asked Bydd, the former C-level adventurer who was now the merchant’s personal bodyguard.</p>
<p>“Bydd,” Mjöllmile replied with an elated nod, “things are about to get <em>very</em> busy.”</p>
<p>“Oh, did he give you another impossible task? I like all the ideas he has, but I wish he understood how much he puts you through the wringer, huh?”</p>
<p>He laughed, but he didn’t really mean it. Just like Mjöllmile, Bydd owed Rimuru his life. He was one of the demon lord’s greatest fans, and while he described it as a wringer, Bydd probably enjoyed the wringing more than anyone else.</p>
<p>Mjöllmile chuckled back at him. “Bydd, this is gonna be nothing like you’ve ever seen before. Everything I’ve done up to now was like selling pencils on the street corner compared with what’s coming. I’ll be wagering my destiny on this one.”</p>
<p>He already looked like a mob boss, but Mjöllmile’s smile only added to his foreboding presence. His retainers were used to it, but none could hide their surprise upon hearing this declaration.</p>
<p>“What d’you mean by that, Boss?” his chief butler asked. His boss gave him a quick recap—running a battle tournament alongside the Founder’s Festival, together with a test run of their upcoming fast-food concept. The festival itself would be a show of force for the newly ascended Rimuru, an effort all of Tempest was pitching in for, and the scope of it was likely beyond even Mjöllmile’s imagination. His excitement at receiving such a vital assignment was plain as he explained to the staff.</p>
<p>“Thus, I’ve decided,” he concluded, “that I want to become part of Rimuru’s team. No matter what, I have to make sure this is a huge success!”</p>
<p>His servants began to chatter among themselves. Mjöllmile, it seemed, had no intention of returning to Blumund. It caused quite a stir.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh… You ain’t planning on going alone, are you, Sir Mjöllmile? Maybe I’m just some punk off the street, but I’m still <a id="page-132"/>your bodyguard. The gang I got under me practically worships Sir Rimuru. Take me along with ya!”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t be able to guard so much as a flea over there.”</p>
<p>“Aw, come on!”</p>
<p>“But if you would like to assist me in <em>other</em> ways, I suppose I could bring you alone.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing, Boss! I’ll do anything for you! I ain’t exactly intelligent, but I got street smarts, you know.”</p>
<p>Bydd likely did, given his swindler past, although it left Mjöllmile less than convinced.</p>
<p>“Bahhh, all right. The more the merrier, I suppose! And I bet that gang of yours could provide at least a <em>little</em> security, if they know they’ll get a meal out of it. Let’s take ’em along. Now,” he continued, turning toward his retainers, “what about you? You’re free to continue using this manor if you like.”</p>
<p>“Let us join you, sir!” they said in near unison. There was no hesitation among them; after all, Mjöllmile had trained them. Nothing was keeping them in this nation.</p>
<p class="space-break1">It was decided…and now, the real work began. As a full-fledged citizen of Blumund and member of the Free Guild, Mjöllmile had the freedom to travel to other nations. But as a man who believed in fast action once he made a decision, he felt a duty to the business he had remaining in town. There was no need for anxiety about the future.</p>
<p>“You,” he said, pointing out one of his most talented employees. “You’ve proven yourself qualified enough. D’you think you could run things here for me?”</p>
<p>“S-Sir?! This is so sudden…”</p>
<p>“Well, I mean… I appreciate that you’d like to join me, but think about it. We’ll be starting completely from scratch in Sir Rimuru’s domain. I’m planning to be a big success and win over his trust, but I don’t want you to run that gauntlet, too.”</p>
<p>This was a cover story. In truth, he didn’t want to sell this manor and lose his base of operations in Blumund. Ideally, a few of his people would remain here, keeping the lights on whenever his work brought him back.</p>
<p><a id="page-133"/>The leader he picked, a man named Bach, was brought here by his father, a relative of Mjöllmile’s who’d asked him to train his son in the business. He proved quick-witted enough to live up to his end of the bargain; however, Bach’s family had faced difficulty after his father’s business failed, leaving him with nowhere to return to, so Mjöllmile decided to formally hire him as head clerk. At the moment, that family was living off Bach’s income, and Mjöllmile felt too guilty about having him go off on this risky venture. He had no complaint about his work; no doubt the business would work fine under his watchful eye.</p>
<p>“B-Boss… I couldn’t be happier to receive this offer from you. But I hoped that we could perhaps join you…”</p>
<p>Bach, no doubt, was too young to readily accept this. He was reluctant to go fully independent yet; perhaps he thought he still had things to prove to Mjöllmile. It was cute of him, but Mjöllmile didn’t like it. If Bach wanted to stand out on his own, he had to be let out in the wild sooner or later. This was a golden opportunity.</p>
<p>“Bach, I am not your father. I’m offering you a position running this business, but I’m not <em>giving</em> it to you. Listen: Even after I leave here, you better not do anything that puts this business on the rocks, all right? In fact, once you’re able, I’d like to see you buy this outfit out from under me! So make it a big success and bring your parents back here someday, all right?”</p>
<p>He gave him an affectionate smile and patted him on the shoulder. It was a tender moment, even if he still intended to work out a contract with Bach and keep a piece of the proceeds. He was a merchant, occasionally a hard taskmaster, but never a philanthropist. <em>Besides</em>, he reasoned, <em>if he can’t even pay me for my share of the business, he’d never have what it takes to succeed in the first place.</em></p>
<p>“Thank you,” Bach said, choking up a bit, “thank you… I promise you that I’ll make a man out of myself and repay this favor!”</p>
<p>“I hope you do,” replied Mjöllmile, smiling ear to ear.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Now he went to work, choosing who to bring and who to keep behind.</p>
<p>“If you ever have any problems,” he advised Bach, “tell me about <a id="page-134"/>them, and I’ll help. But I believe in all of you. I know you’ll do just fine. Don’t disappoint me!”</p>
<p>The group remaining in Blumund all nodded at him. Mjöllmile had trained them thoroughly; none of them would fall out of line. Even if they were dealing with high nobility, he was sure they’d never do anything ill-advised.</p>
<p>“You’ve taught them all well. Rest assured they will not let you down!” Bach said in return.</p>
<p>“Well said. Also, while I’m sure you’re aware of this…”</p>
<p>“Do not worry, sir. I promise we will maintain the sales markets you’ve built up here. If you ever need access to them, we’ll give you first priority.”</p>
<p>“Good. I hope you will!”</p>
<p>Just in case, Mjöllmile wanted to be sure he got first dibs on any goods he might need. He always kept an eye on every facet of the situation, and Bach was in perfect sync with his thoughts.</p>
<p><em>He’s still a little green, but he’s starting to look the part, at least…</em></p>
<p>Now he was sure Bach wouldn’t let him down.</p>
<p class="space-break1">The last of his affairs were now squared away, and it was time for Mjöllmile to make the journey to Tempest with his retainers in tow.</p>

<p class="tx1">Leaving Mjöllmile’s house, I breathed a sigh of relief. <em>So</em> glad he said yes to that. He seemed ready to take the invite, too, so I should be expecting him shortly.</p>
<p>One thing I couldn’t say about my monsters is that any of them were good on financial matters. I was having Shuna handle the account books for us, but she couldn’t do that forever. A village is one thing, but a full-fledged nation is another; Shuna would be in over her head. Lilina in the management department and Vester from the Dwarven Kingdom were helping, but I’m not sure even that would be enough.</p>
<p>That’s why Mjöllmile came to mind. His brain revolved around money in ways few people ever experienced, he had connections <a id="page-135"/>with nobility, and he was running businesses in multiple countries. It seemed a waste for him to remain a merchant forever; I was sure he’d be a great help to me. Besides, we had a good working relationship. If he could handle finances for us, maybe he’d allow me a little more spending money to work with. I had been running a few side hustles with him before, but now I could picture that extra income ballooning.</p>
<p>I mean, our treasury’s pretty well-endowed, you know? But taking money out of it for myself, despite not paying any salary to my staff, seemed kind of low. Everyone always said “Oh, it’s all yours, Sir Rimuru,” but that just made me all the more reluctant. It felt wrong, and I wanted that money to help with expanding our nation.</p>
<p>Still, I needed some of it. I wanted to take people like Gobta out at night every now and then, even if I didn’t have much interest in it. Veldora was whining at me about that, too, and you know how you go through cash pretty quick at nightclubs…not that I had much interest, that is. (No, really.)</p>
<p>But while it was a drop in the bucket for our treasury, if it was my personal money, I’m sure Gobta and Veldora would burn through it like it was nothing. Plus, Shuna usually provides me with money, but if I tell her where I’m going, she snaps that wallet shut, and I can’t really tell her it’s “my” money then, so…</p>
<p>This was why I was running a few side jobs for extra spending cash. And with my future expansion, I had a feeling money wouldn’t be a worry for much longer.</p>
<p class="space-break1">That battle tournament was a pretty neat idea, too. Mjöllmile is such a talented guy. I wasn’t sure how he would take it, but he demonstrated some real enthusiasm as we brainstormed the plan. It barely took him a moment to suggest running a tournament to attract visitors, then take advantage of the crowds to sell potions and equipment. He’s got a forward-looking eye and a knack for great ideas, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>Once I get back, I’ll need to get ourselves an arena to work with. Geld was busy with urban-planning work over in the Beast Kingdom, and Mildo was supporting him. Without our two main <a id="page-136"/>building specialists, I’d have to oversee the operation. But that’s fine. After running all these construction projects, one after the other, we were starting to build a well-trained staff, enough so that I was mostly giving orders and not doing much else. I knew about this craftsman named Gobkyuu, who worked under the tutelage of Mildo, and he was involved with town architecture enough that I thought an impressive circular arena would be in his wheelhouse.</p>
<p>The job would normally take a decade or so, I’d imagine, but if you run the job with monster muscle, I thought we could cut that down a lot…like, down to maybe the two months or so we had until the festival. Even I had to admit that was far too little time to get everything done, so for now, I at least wanted the central fighting stage to be completed.</p>
<p>But how would we design it?</p>
<p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Understood. From my master’s memories, I have found the Colosseum of Rome. Building blueprints using it as a base… Completed.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1">Well, <em>that</em> was easy. I had some paper on hand, so I drew up the plans, adding my own style to it. This alone would normally take several months—surveying the site, calculating soil strength, that kind of thing. You could often spend a whole year on that kind of preliminary stuff. And here I was, drawing up blueprints that’d normally take several days at a computer on our equivalent of a cocktail napkin… Raphael’s support helped a lot even with detailed work like this. It honestly felt unfair to me, but I had no plans to give it up, so…</p>
<p>Now I had my plans. Next I’d have to discuss them with Gobkyuu— But before that, while I was here in Blumund, I may as well stop at the Free Guild. I could forward the plans over to Gobkyuu in the meantime; once I was free, I could assemble a team of craftsmen on-site to get down to business.</p>
<p>“Ranga, you there?”</p>
<p>“Here, my master!”</p>
<p>He popped his head out from my shadow. With things settled <a id="page-137"/>over in Farmus, everyone except Diablo was back home, with Ranga lurking in my shadow like it was his personal den. I gave him the arena blueprints I had just whipped up.</p>
<p>“Take these to a craftsman in town named Gobkyuu. And can you tell him we’ll meet up at the west gate once I’m free?”</p>
<p>“Very well. But are you not returning, Sir Rimuru?”</p>
<p>“No. I wanna see Fuze first, while I’m here.”</p>
<p>“Will you not need a bodyguard?”</p>
<p>He looked a bit nervous, tail down. But I wasn’t concerned. I <em>am</em> a demon lord, and I had Absolute Defense activated. If I ran into an attack that could penetrate <em>that</em> barrier, I wouldn’t be safe anywhere in this world.</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine! We’ll just chat a bit, and then I’ll head back. But I <em>should</em> be concerned about Mjöllmile, huh? He’s gotten kind of tangled up with this one bottom-feeder noble, and there’s no telling what the fallout from that is gonna be like.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that vulgar man from before? Would you like me to snuff him out?”</p>
<p><em>Please, no. Doing that in a foreign city is how you trigger a diplomatic crisis.</em></p>
<p>“You know, I think you’ve been hanging out with Shion too long. You’re getting too aggressive for your own good. I think you need to learn some more common sense.”</p>
<p>“I—I do?!”</p>
<p>Ranga looked shocked. He must not have realized it.</p>
<p>“Look, are you really sticking to what I told you back at the last fight? You weren’t going <em>too</em> far, were you?”</p>
<p>“I—I would never do that, my master!”</p>
<p>He looked uncertain, and I was starting to get suspicious. Gobta and Gabil, I recalled, would only say things like “Oh, uh, he was fine!” and “Y-yes, having Sir Ranga at our side was a tremendous boon!” when I asked for a report. It sounded fishy, but I never followed up on it. It just seemed like an invitation for further headaches, and I was leaving that to Diablo anyway. If he had no complaint, I just assumed all was well.</p>
<p>Maybe I was just kicking the issue down the road…but ah well. <a id="page-138"/>If there <em>really</em> was a problem, I would’ve heard about it. Better trust in Ranga for now and make sure Shion doesn’t poison his mind any further.</p>
<p>I patted Ranga on the neck. “Um, Ranga, buddy? Seriously, don’t do anything crazy, okay?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t dare,” he replied, solemnly nodding.</p>
<p>“Good. Now go relay that message, okay? And if anyone’s free on our security team, I’d like them to guard Mjöllmile for me. Check on that, could you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master!”</p>
<p>He disappeared back into my shadow.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="" class="ornament" src="images/Art_sborn.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">So now Mjöllmile was under guard, albeit behind the scenes so he didn’t pick up on it. I didn’t know who would come to guard him, but there weren’t that many people on the security staff I’d trust with solo duty. The new guys were out of the question, so it’d have to be at least a seasoned sergeant-class officer. Here, <em>sergeant</em> refers to a sort of team leader, the head of the groups of five that the force usually operated in. They were usually around a B rank in adventurer parlance, more than qualified enough for bodyguard duty.</p>
<p>I could personally keep tabs on Mjöllmile’s whereabouts once he was in my town, but in the meantime, if something happened to him over here, I’d find out immediately. Thus, I felt safe in saying hello to Fuze for a little bit.</p>
<p class="space-break1">So I headed into the Free Guild’s headquarters in Blumund. Last time I was here, I made more of a splash than I meant to, so I was worried about a repeat—but despite a few threatening glares, I made it to the reception counter without a peep. I <em>was</em> wearing that mask the previous time, wasn’t I? Maybe nobody recognized me. But hey, if they wouldn’t let me see Fuze, I could just leave an invitation letter for him and head back home.</p>
<p>“Hey-yo, I’m Rimuru, but can you take me to see Guild Master Fuze? Oh, here’s my ID.”</p>
<p><a id="page-139"/>I burped the card out of my Stomach and handed it to the woman at the counter. “<em>That</em> little girl’s an adventurer?!” I heard someone exclaim behind me, but no matter. I was used to it.</p>
<p>The lady remembered me, at least. “Ah yes, Rimuru! It’s good to see you here again. How have you been?”</p>
<p>“Mm? Oh, great, great! You’re looking quite well, yourself…”</p>
<p>“I sure am! And I see you’ve passed the examination over at HQ and made it to B-plus, huh? Well done! You have my respect!”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, I did, didn’t I? I really wanted to score an A, but I got kind of busy, so…”</p>
<p>…Or really, it was too much of a pain in the ass to bother. Being ranked B or higher gave you a lot of perks, but it also came with more responsibilities. B-plus was enough drudgery to deal with, so I figured I could earn my promotion only when I really needed to. Not like it was a salaried position or anything. Like a volunteer fireman, I’d be tapped for duty whenever certain kinds of danger came along. In exchange, I got easier admission into foreign countries, as well as free food and boarding at Guild branches. I appreciated the perks, sure, but I didn’t really like being forced to do anything.</p>
<p>But why rain on people’s parade?</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m <em>sure</em> you’d pass with flying colors, Rimuru! I’ll be cheering you on!”</p>
<p>“You think? Well, thank you! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha…”</p>
<p>I sure can’t resist a young lady looking at me with those sparkling eyes, no… At least, not until she drops a bomb on me.</p>
<p>“By the way, Rimuru, it must be annoying to share a name with a demon lord, isn’t it? If you like, you could take advantage of our Renaming System to change your name in the Guild archives, if you find it’s causing you trouble. That’ll let you conduct Guild activity in areas where your face isn’t well-known yet, albeit at one rank grade below your current one. What do you think?”</p>
<p>Oh, crap, I forgot! Here I am, a demon lord, and I went and put that same damn name on all my paperwork! And now that Rimuru Tempest, the Newbie in the Octagram, was a household name around the world, I guess being Rimuru the adventurer would present a few issues. Time to retire from the Guild, maybe? If I <a id="page-140"/>really needed to work as an adventurer, I guess I could consider that Renaming System. It’d be starting at the B rank, but that’s good enough for me. Pretty helpful system, there.</p>
<p>“Thanks for telling me about that! I’ll keep that in mind. Now, do you think I might be able to see the guild master?”</p>
<p>“Right away. And yes, feel free to ask anytime!”</p>
<p>It took a little conversation, but she let me right in. I could hear shouts of “Are you kidding me?!” and “Who the hell <em>is</em> that girl?!” among the rabble behind me, as well as commentary from a few people who must’ve seen me here last time.</p>
<p>“Oh, no way! I never knew she was so cute?!”</p>
<p>“Unbelievable… That’s the face of a person who swatted down a Lesser Demon like a mosquito…?”</p>
<p>“And she had the same name as that demon lord, huh?”</p>
<p>“You think it might actually <em>be</em> him?”</p>
<p>“Ha! What are you, stupid?”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha-ha! Yeah, yeah…”</p>
<p>Sounds like more rumors would be spreading soon. Although, maybe I had less to worry about than I thought. Sharing a name didn’t seem to arouse <em>too</em> much undue suspicion. Maybe the name Rimuru wasn’t that uncommon after all.</p>
<p>So I breezed into Fuze’s office. The first thing he did upon seeing me was bring a hand to his temple. I ignored it.</p>
<p>“Hellooooo! I’m back to pay a visit! Something up? Why the long face?”</p>
<p>“Well, things were pretty slow for a while, until this <em>demon lord</em> came out from nowhere…”</p>
<p>“Whoa, really? Sounds like bad news. You sure you should be chilling out in here?”</p>
<p>“I’m talking about the demon lord here in <em>front</em> of me. So what is it <em>this</em> time…?”</p>
<p>“Oh? Well, you better feed that demon lord some tea, shouldn’t you? I think he’d enjoy a little bit of cake, too.”</p>
<p>“<em>Cake?!</em> You think I can pull that kind of luxury out from under my hat?! I swear, why’s a demon lord like you just gallivanting around without a care in the world?”</p>
<p><a id="page-141"/>Fuze poured out some tea as he complained. He was diligent like that. I thanked him and took the cup, sipping from it before we got down to business.</p>
<p>“So I’m sorry about everything that happened, Sir Rimuru. I tried putting pressure on the Western Holy Church, but it didn’t work too well, and then the Crusaders got deployed…”</p>
<p>“Nah, I doubt you could’ve done anything to stop them. There was this band called the Seven Days Clergy masterminding the whole thing.”</p>
<p>“Wha?!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s probably why Hinata never listened to me when I tried pleading my case.”</p>
<p>“The Seven Days…? That legion of great heroes, tasked with protecting humankind…?”</p>
<p>“Apparently, yeah. They snared her, too, but…all’s well that ends well. We worked out all the misunderstandings, I think. But there <em>was</em> one casualty, unfortunately—a commander named Garde is missing in action.”</p>
<p>“Garde of Fire…,” Fuze muttered with a frown. “He’s one of the Ten Great Saints, the protectors of humankind. Quite gifted with a spear and flame-based spirit magic, albeit not as gifted as Shizu was…”</p>
<p>I didn’t know Garde personally, apart from how he was after the Clergy got to him. I couldn’t say anything about his personality, but apparently he was a well-known name, at least. Someone as well-connected as Fuze would certainly know him. I described him as “missing,” but “killed,” I suppose, was much more likely. Hopefully he’s in a better place now. I felt bad for him.</p>
<p>Moving on, I gave Fuze a recap of recent events—including the Walpurgis Council, since I knew he was concerned about that. There were now eight demon lords united under the name of the Octagram, and I covered all of that, along with my conflict with Hinata and the fall of Seven Days. I made sure, of course, to blur the true identity of Luminus—I had a reputation for blabbing when I shouldn’t, but I wasn’t dumb enough to let <em>that</em> vital a secret out.</p>
<p>“I see… You know, no matter how much we tried to make contact with them, they always just flatly denied us. The Church’s <a id="page-142"/>Blumund branch was a nonstarter, so I sent someone over to their headquarters, and they still said we couldn’t meet with anyone at the level of minister or above… I had no idea the Clergy was behind all this.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Hinata said the same thing. The only thing uniting them, as she put it, was Lu—um, the god Luminus. Their faith, you know; that was the real thing.”</p>
<p>“Humans are inherently weak, after all. They cling to the gods—and their strength.”</p>
<p>“Would you include yourself in that, Fuze?”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha! No, not me. When my strength fails me, I’m prepared to call it a life, so to speak. I’d hope for a miracle, of course, but I can’t pray to a ‘god’ I’ve never even met before.”</p>
<p>Sounded like Fuze leaned toward atheism. Of course, this was a world where a real-life monster with superhuman powers could get worshipped as a god by the locals. They, at least, you could meet up with and see for yourself. That must’ve made them seem more reliable. Even Luminus only offered protection to the people she knew, at first, and she didn’t figure in Fuze’s life at all. He just relied on himself instead—a little self-serving but certainly easier to come to grips with.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, I can certainly understand why people want to pray to a higher power. But in life, you get what you’re dealt, you know? Anyway, regardless of what Luminus may or may not bless us with, the Church and I are even now, and that’s all I need.”</p>
<p>Knowing Luminus personally taught me just how meaningless praying to her was—but not much point saying that. Sometimes prayer really <em>can</em> give a person strength. It wasn’t for me to comment on.</p>
<p>Fuze smiled. “Very true. It’s a load off my shoulders as well.”</p>
<p>I got the feeling he was depressed about failing to stop the Church after I asked him to put the screws to them a bit. I just appreciated him looking out for me.</p>
<p class="space-break1">We chatted for a while more over past events before I stood up, recalling something.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I better get going soon, but I want you to take this.”</p>
<p>I removed an envelope from my pocket and handed it to Fuze. It <a id="page-143"/>contained an invitation to the Founder’s Festival I was planning; we had gotten so caught up in conversation I had almost forgot about it. This was why I came here today, after all.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m gonna be holding my demon lord coronation soon, and I figured it’d be a good opportunity to advertise my town to the world. We’re calling it the Founder’s Festival, and the way I picture it, it’s gonna be a huge blast. We’re sending invites to all the royalty and nobility in the region, and I’d love for you to attend, too.”</p>
<p>“Huhhh?! Wait a minute, Sir Rimuru. What would inviting someone like me accomplish—?”</p>
<p>“No, no, it’s no big deal! I have an invite here for the king of Blumund, too. Can you make sure he gets it?”</p>
<p>“Well, couldn’t you give it to him directly—hmm? Maybe not, eh…?”</p>
<p>“Nah. I gave the dwarven king and Archduke Erald their invites personally, but I don’t have many contacts in the other nations.” I smiled. “I’ve met your king once, but I don’t think a demon lord would be invited to his throne room, would he?”</p>
<p>“It’s distressing enough for a demon lord to be in Blumund at all.” Fuze snickered back. “But thank you for this. I’ll be sure this reaches the king.”</p>
<p>My errand was now done, and I was about to depart but was stopped at the door. “Oh, right! I needed to mention that the grand master was concerned about you. Negotiating with the Western Holy Church was a huge headache for him, so I’ll be sure to say you’ve worked things out.”</p>
<p>Yuuki was worried? A lot had happened since we last met. I was starting to miss him.</p>
<p>“Ah yeah. I must have put a lot on his plate.”</p>
<p>“Oh, not really. The Guild has no interest in making an enemy out of the Church, after all. If you were able to settle your differences without a fight, we couldn’t ask for anything more.”</p>
<p>That was nice to hear. But I still felt like I owed the Guild something.</p>
<p>“I know! I think I’ll invite Yuuki, too. You think he’d mind?”</p>
<p><a id="page-144"/>“Hmm, hard to say. Not that I can speak for him, but he <em>is</em> a busy man. I’m not sure if he can make the time for it or not.”</p>
<p>“Well, I can give him an escort to and from the event, so I’m sure he can attend at least one day, you know? If not, I can stop by to see him sometime soon. So give him this for me…”</p>
<p>As Fuze watched, I wrote out a letter to him and included it in the envelope with the invites. Fuze winced at me a little as he accepted it.</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru, where did you get that paper from…? Actually, on second thought, don’t tell me. Can’t you magically send it to him yourself? I’ll do it, but…”</p>
<p>He looked tired. Maybe I was asking one too many casual favors.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! Sorry about that. Thanks.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing, Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>“Oh, and Milim’s coming, too.”</p>
<p>I felt it best to be just as casual with that bombshell as he took the envelope.</p>
<p>“Milim? Oh no…”</p>
<p>“Okay, see you there!”</p>
<p>With a smile, I half ran out from the office while he shouted after me: “Wait! You don’t mean <em>that</em> Milim, do you? <em>Heeeeey</em>!!”</p>
<p>Let’s just pretend I didn’t hear.</p>

<p class="tx1">As I escaped from the Guild building, a man leaped out from behind a corner at me, taking a respectful knee.</p>
<p>“I, Gob’emon, am here at your summons, Sir Rimuru!”</p>
<p>This man was one of the hobgoblins I named. Pretty ambitious guy. I think Rigur told me he and Gobta were fighting for the vice captain spot back when he was running our village forces. He had the strength to back that drive, of course…</p>
<p>“Hmm? Hey, weren’t you a lieutenant? You went to another unit after Gobta started captaining the goblin riders, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>A lieutenant, in Tempest’s armies, was an officer who could be assigned a unit to lead if needed. They didn’t necessarily have one <a id="page-145"/>to lead, which meant that captains were naturally above them, but it was still a much higher rank than the sergeants leading teams of five to ten people.</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord. I was never one to serve below others, you see, so I thought I would work as an individual for now. Someday soon, I’d like to assemble my own direct command and lead a unit myself.”</p>
<p><em>Hmm. Sounds like he’s got some real backbone.</em> He gave up his chance at vice captain of the goblin riders because he didn’t want to serve under Gobta, after all, so he must’ve had some pretty high aspirations.</p>
<p>“Do you? Well, keep up the good work. Now listen, Mjöllmile’s someone very important to me. I need you to keep him safe—without letting him notice, if possible. I think you could learn a lot from the way he sways people’s minds. His financial acumen’s enough to move the folks around him, but it’s not just that. Think of it as a case study while you’re guarding him.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir! I will keep that in mind as I execute my duty!”</p>
<p>Gob’emon was up for it. The way Benimaru described him, he tended to rely too much on his own abilities, downplaying the strengths of the people below or alongside him. That’s one reason he failed to reach captain, despite being much more physically gifted than Gobta. If he could learn to be more of a team player, that captain’s job could be his before long. I hoped he could grow into the rank.</p>
<p>“If you can carry this out and learn something from it, report back to me afterward. I’ll give you this katana of mine as a reward.”</p>
<p>Kurobe had contacted me earlier to report that my personal sword was complete. I wouldn’t need this one any longer. It was just a temporary weapon, but it was synced up with my aura well enough that I liked the results I got from it. I brought it in for maintenance after the Hinata battle, but Kurobe was pretty impressed by what he saw. I figured it was a nice enough carrot to dangle.</p>
<p>Gob’emon’s eyes opened wide with excitement. “Y-you will?!”</p>
<p>“Sure. I think you’re gifted enough to make use of this. But stay diligent, all right? Prove to me you deserve it.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir! I will live up to your expectations!”</p>
<p><a id="page-146"/>He immediately went into Mjöllmile guard-duty mode. That was almost too sly of me, offering that sword to him, but hopefully I got my point across. You had to earn the trust of your subordinates. Like how people used to think about obligation and duty, if you didn’t look out for and provide service to each other, it would wreck the whole master-servant relationship. I know I’m not exactly a stellar example of the ideal boss, but still, I hoped Gob’emon would answer my call in his own way.</p>
<p class="space-break1">I had now distributed all my invitations. Now we just had to prep for the big day. It needed to be a festival like none before. As I thought over everything we needed for it, I could already feel my heart racing.</p>
