<p>When I first encountered the lake, it was so densely packed with magicules that fish couldn’t even survive in it. That had thinned out quite a bit since. Maybe enough that a B-ranked monster could just barely withstand it? I was hoping we could use that magic to cultivate some more hipokute herbs, which would be the perfect job for the dragonewts. Shelter and a work assignment, just like that—two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>My final worry was whether they’d be strong enough to venture in and out of the cave. Gabil was in A-ranked territory—nothing could stop him in there—but the B-grade dragonewt warriors would still run into several monsters they’d have trouble with. The evil centipedes, at B-plus rank, were a powerhouse.</p>
<p>If I tossed them in there and they wound up being prey for the monsters, I’d sure have a guilty conscience about that.</p>
<p class="space-break1s">Understood. In terms of simple rankings, the evil centipede would outclass them, but if five or more dragonewt fighters worked together, victory would be easily attainable. That was calculated using their current weapon set, so once they have more decent gear on hand, that will boost their chances at victory. With healing potion on hand, the odds of anyone dying would be extremely low.</p>
<p>The Sage chimed in with the perfect advice. Dragonewts had wings and flight-based abilities. Evil centipedes were strong, yes, but apparently weak against aerial attack. The centipede’s breath would need to be watched out for, but with Multilayer Barrier, no one would be critically hurt.</p>
<p>So trusting in their skills, I formally gave the contract to Gabil’s force.</p>
<p>“Gabil, I want your people to cultivate hipokute herbs in the cave for me.”</p>
<p>“Leave it to us, sir!” His eyes clouded up as his heart soared with emotion. “I, Gabil, will work my fingers to the bone for you!”</p>
<p><em>Perfect. I’ll do that. He sounds motivated enough.</em></p>
<p>With them living in the cave, they could serve as guards, too. I wouldn’t have to be so wary of the cave all the time, like I did now. I also made sure to forbid them from working in the cave unless they were in groups of five or more. It’d be a boon for their training, too.</p>
<p>Finally, I gave each one a generous supply of healing potion, in part to provide motivation for their task. They all had permission to use it whenever the need arose. Even if they were caught unawares and faced critical injury, this should save them from danger.</p>

<p class="tx1">Gabil and his crew seemed to get the hang of things after a month or so, able to freely navigate the cave without any personal danger. With Garm’s and Kurobe’s new weapons and armor, their strength was more polished than ever.</p>
<p>I went down there just to check on them, but things seemed to be going great. Their eyes did nothing for them in the dark, but with Magic Sense and Sense Heat Source safely taught to them all, there were no issues. They had formed teams of five, with three teams working in tandem at all times and staying in touch with Thought Communication. Whenever trouble came along, they could respond quickly.</p>
<p>When it came to leadership skill, at least, Gabil was a born genius. They grew used to life in the caves far more quickly than I had thought—and living in an environment where battle was a near constant seemed to be growing their experience and strength. It sounded like with five of them at once, they could stop an evil centipede without having to rely on potions at all.</p>
<p>They couldn’t be more reliable.</p>
<p>It might be fun to have them engage in a mock battle with the goblin riders. A starwolf was ranked B alone, but with a seasoned hobgoblin on its back, you could add a plus sign to that. They were a seasoned unit at this point, so the goblin riders might even be above them…but with the advantage of flight, I thought the dragonewts could put up a surprisingly tense fight.</p>
<p>That was the sort of thing that occurred to me as I observed the dragonewts’ growth.</p>
<p class="space-break">Now Gabil’s team was devoting itself to cultivating hipokute. About ten, relieved from cave-patrol duty, were observing the herbs’ development and changing their horticultural approach in different regions to see which one produced the highest quality.</p>
<p>The plan was to go with whatever proved to work best; then I could make recovery potion with it, sell it off, and earn some much-needed foreign currency. It was one way I figured I could earn some coin before I set off to observe human society.</p>
<p>I called for Gabil.</p>
<p>“Right, how’s it going?”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… I am <em>so</em> glad you asked! It couldn’t be better! Behold, the fruits of our labor!”</p>
<p>He handed me a few weeds. Yes, weeds. I gave him a look, then a taste of Dark Thunder. Oh, don’t worry, he wouldn’t die. I can adjust its intensity perfectly fine now.</p>
<p>“Gahh! What was that for, sir? What did I do?!”</p>
<p>“You dumbass! These are just weeds! What are you growing down there anyway?!”</p>
<p>“Wh-whaa—?! A thousand pardons! I, Gabil, have perhaps been hurrying ourselves along too much.”</p>
<p>“You don’t get this just by ‘hurrying’ a little… Ugh. Could you be more careful? With that dense lake of magicules, managing to grow weeds around it is a feat in and of itself.”</p>
<p>Our exchanges grew tense at times, but really, it was largely going as planned. Hipokute was a rare plant, and the dragonewts were, indeed, making steady progress. The hardest part, in a way, was teaching Gabil the difference between the herbs and plain old weeds—but it couldn’t have been easy, relying entirely on touch instead of sight for the job. I had my analysis skills to work with, but Gabil and his team had nothing as convenient as that.</p>
<p>Only experience would make up the difference, and trying to hurry that along was pointless. <em>It’d be nice if there was some light down there…but we can tackle that issue later.</em></p>
<p>Gabil, for his part, acted like the de facto master of the caves these days, walking around like he owned the place. The mere sight of him made the monsters flee, and some of Gabil’s personal entourage could even whip an evil centipede singlehandedly. Part of the cave was <em>their</em> territory now.</p>
<p>I was impressed, but I definitely didn’t offer him any praise. It’d go right to his head, and then he’d screw something up. Kind of like me, in a way. Takes one to know one. That’s why I trusted him to step up and perform the work I assigned him.</p>
<p>We were still busy with cultivation for the moment, but once that got on track, we’d have to think about mixing next. I could produce oceans of potion with my skills, but I didn’t want to. I wanted a system that could manufacture this stuff without me.</p>
<p>I wanted to avoid creating a town that was incapable of anything if I wasn’t around.</p>
<p><em>You can make all the mistakes you want, so give me at least one solid success…</em></p>
<p>Thinking to myself, I left the cave.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">The dragonewts were well situated now, and Gabil and the rest were fully used to life with their fellow townspeople.</p>
<p>A long series of peaceful days followed. <em>Ah, nothing like peace</em>, I blithely thought as Shion carried me around, her breasts bouncing against me in a steady rhythm as she walked.</p>
<p><em>Boing, boing, boing, boing. Ooh, this feels great…</em></p>
<p>I was just letting myself descend to ever-lazier thoughts when—</p>
<p><em>Sir Rimuru, we have an emergency. Several hundred winged horses are headed for the direction of town.</em></p>
<p>Soei sent me a cold, to-the-point message via Thought Communication.</p>
<p>“Shion, it’s an emergency. I’ll call for Benimaru and Hakuro, so get Rigurd to alert the townspeople for me!”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>She lowered me down, then briskly ran off.</p>
<p>Thought Communication wasn’t enough to broadcast a message to an entire city. We needed to ring a special alarm bell to make everyone gather at the public square. I ran down the situation with the ogre mages, then turned my attention to the sky, turning my Magic Sense all the way up.</p>
<p>It let me detect something coming from the Dwarven Kingdom. A force of around a thousand. None ranked an A alone—or I should say, an A as a rider and mount alone— Wait, they had knights on flying horses?! It had to be a well-trained force, whoever they are.</p>
<p class="space-break1s">Understood. Using Analyze and Assess, I have determined the knights’ rank to be A-minus. Their flying mounts are also appraised at A-minus. However, their minds are synchronized to the point where one could treat each one as a single creature, ranked perhaps slightly higher than A.</p>
<p><em>Right. So we’re talking five hundred mounted, flying knights—A-ranked cavalry, as the Great Sage put it.</em> Even with all our forces pooled together, we couldn’t hack this one.</p>
<p>Gauging each mounted knight by itself, they seemed weaker than Gabil when he had just attained A rank. Let three of them surround that dragonewt, though, and I doubted he stood a chance. In a way, this was an even greater threat than two hundred thousand orcs at our doorstep.</p>
<p class="space-break">Shion came back with Shuna, with Benimaru and Hakuro arriving simultaneously. Soei had somehow appeared behind me, too.</p>
<p>Geld was busy calling for the high orcs, currently handling construction and resource-gathering work in the forest. He was running all over, trying to get his battle equipment organized, but I doubted any of it would be in time. A force of C-plus high orcs would just get razed to the ground.</p>
<p>“Your orders, Sir Rimuru?” Benimaru asked. I couldn’t give him a clear answer.</p>
<p>“My orders? Well… We don’t know who they are or what they want. It’d be a losing battle if we fought them, and I’d like to avoid that, but…”</p>
<p class="space-break1s">Understood. The advancing force’s destination is this area, beyond a doubt. They are traveling in a straight line toward here.</p>
<p>I didn’t need the Sage’s commentary to know that lying low and hoping it’d all blow over wouldn’t work too well.</p>
<p>“This is no problem! All we have to do is rout them all!” Shion optimistically shouted, blowing my pessimistic thoughts away.</p>
<p>I wanted to call her stupid, but I doubt she’d understand why. She and I had two different definitions of victory. If we could expend all the sacrifices we wanted to smash this team of five hundred, that would make things simple. If you asked me whether that was possible or not, then, sure it was. But if you want to avoid civilian casualties, I had to conclude that was impossible.</p>
<p>Based on the Sage’s calculations, the greatest chance of survival came if all of us immediately fled in another direction. That provided a survival rate, apparently, of around 90 percent. Staging a frontal counterattack would kill off half of us, and as the Sage put it, only luck would decide whether even I or the magic-born would make it through. And that assumed we fought with everything we had. <em>Routing</em> them, the way Shion wanted us to do, was not a word I wanted to bandy around.</p>
<p>Either way, we’d lose people. To me, the moment hostilities began, we would’ve already lost. Damage to the town, I didn’t mind, but I couldn’t abide the thought of personal injuries. That’s why I wanted to avoid battle, if nothing else.</p>
<p>“Well, what happens, happens. If this turns into a fight, our first priority is evacuating our residents. We’ll buy the time to make that happen.”</p>
<p>“You got it. And indeed, this could be an easy win once we’re in the thick of it!”</p>
<p>“I’ll handle the magical support!”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… My longsword is seeking blood.”</p>
<p>“—I am only here to serve you, Rimuru.”</p>
<p>Good to see the usual gang was in on it, then. I assigned Hakuro and Kurobe to stay on point if we had to evacuate. Now that Rigurd was here, I also explained matters to him, ordering him to regroup with Geld’s team outside of town if we failed to talk things out with our foes.</p>
<p>“Wait a second,” I heard someone mutter in the group. Turning toward the voice, I saw Kaijin lost in thought.</p>
<p>“What is it, Kaijin?”</p>
<p>“Well, if these are flying knights, I’ve heard rumors about a top-secret force under the direct control of the dwarven king. Just rumors, but…”</p>
<p>“Huh? I thought the Dwarven Kingdom’s military was all about heavy infantry and high-powered magic corps. And you’re an ex-military officer—what kind of top-secret force wouldn’t <em>you</em> know about?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well… The rumors came from a bunch of retired old generals. I mean, yeah, we were officers, but we were still young. I couldn’t really boss around people who had several centuries’ more experience than I did…,” Kaijin explained, grimacing.</p>
<p>So just like I expected, the long-lived, hard-drinking dwarves at the top of the military ladder still had a pretty heavy impact on the force. The rumors no doubt began their spread from them, at any number of taverns. A good wine can loosen anyone’s lips.</p>
<p>According to Kaijin, this top-secret personal army of the king’s, independent of the seven official armies, was known as the Pegasus Knights.</p>
<p>“The winged horses they fly are normally C-ranked magical beasts. Dwargon’s been breeding them for their flight skills. You won’t find too many A-minus ones in nature. I guess the rumors were true, huh…?”</p>
<p>What Kaijin said seemed to make sense. Whatever could upgrade those creatures so dramatically must have been kept under tight secrecy. Even an ex-officer would’ve only heard half-told rumors.</p>
<p>So was <em>this</em> was what we had to deal with…?</p>
<p>“Kaijin, if what you say is true, do you think there’s a chance the dwarf king himself is among them?”</p>
<p>“Per…haps? King Gazel almost never leaves the royal palace these days, but he was lauded as a hero in his glory years. If he thought it necessary, it wouldn’t be outside the realm of possibility for him to personally lead a force like this.”</p>
<p>“Can you think of any reason why he would?”</p>
<p>“Well… Maybe because of the orc lord? But that’s all settled now.”</p>
<p><em>Hmm? The orc lord…?</em></p>
<p>“Hey, Rigurd, can I ask you a question?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord?”</p>
<p>“I told Kabal and his party to spread some rumors around their fellow adventurers, but did we ever tell them that it’s over?”</p>
<p>“Ah…?”</p>
<p>“Oh, man, I forgot… Better send a message to ’em.”</p>
<p>“I apologize for this oversight, Sir Rimuru…”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Rigurd’s fault. I forgot, too, so we were even, pretty much. I could get the message across through Soei in a flash, so I didn’t see it as a fatal mistake. And while I wanted Soei to take care of that ASAP, I had to deal with our new visitors first.</p>
<p>“Do you think the dwarven king heard about this and came to help?”</p>
<p>Kaijin was awfully optimistic, but it didn’t seem that way to me. But there was no point speculating on what we didn’t know anyway, so I closed the subject. All we could do was wait for these uninvited guests, debating with one another about what to do should the worst happen.</p>

<p class="tx1">A herd of winged horses was flying above town. They took sidelong glances at us as we watched them, looping around the city airspace a few times before landing in an open field just beyond its borders. We had some open space in town, too—the areas where we planned to build most of our central facilities, for one—but I suppose they didn’t immediately touch down in the city out of politeness. That’d be pretty much a declaration of war, wouldn’t it, if a nation did that to another? International law probably didn’t apply to monsters, though, and I wasn’t even sure such a thing existed in this world in the first place…</p>
<p>No point thinking about it.</p>
<p>More pertinently, we now had confirmation that the dwarven king was leading the pack. That was a tad more important, as was the reassurance that he didn’t want to attack us on first sight. He would have without hesitation if he saw us as foes.</p>
<p><em>Maybe Kaijin was right? Are these just reinforcements or something? Not if this is supposed to be an undercover force, though—and not if the king himself is on the field.</em></p>
<p>Leaving the evacuation efforts to Hakuro, Kurobe, and Gobta, I headed out of town to greet them. Accompanying me was Rigurd, who insisted that negotiations with the outside world were in his jurisdiction. Assuming we had any room to negotiate…</p>
<p>Obviously, Kaijin and the three dwarves were with me, too.</p>
<p class="space-break">The knights were lined up in neat rows in the field beyond the city. In front was one whose force of presence dominated over all of them. He was flanked by four bodyguards, each obviously several times stronger than the rest of the force.</p>
<p>Counting King Gazel himself, that meant five incredibly powerful dwarves were before us. I couldn’t know exactly what kind of threat they were, but well into A territory, at least. Considering the aura of danger I felt when I was last placed in front of him—and considering that aura was still there now—his powers had to be on another dimension. If I had to guess, his four compatriots dated from his days on the road as Heroic King. No wonder their kingdom was so strong. If you ever bumped into these guys on the road, running was your best bet at survival, for sure.</p>
<p><em>We really have to avoid combat now. Otherwise, it’ll get ugly.</em></p>
<p>“Well, well, Your Majesty. It has been a long time—and quite an impressive showing, as well! May I ask what brings you here today?” Kaijin stepped forward and took a knee before Gazel.</p>
<p><em>Come to think of it, I’ve never directly conversed with Gazel before.</em> I wasn’t allowed to back in his kingdom, in keeping with dwarf tradition. Instead, unable to defend myself, we were made into criminals (Kaijin <em>did</em> punch out the nobleman Vester, but still) and almost made into forced laborers. Their king was a fair and upright enough ruler that we managed to avoid that, so I imagined he wouldn’t spring war upon us without a fair explanation—but if he did, I was prepared to give him a piece of my mind.</p>
<p>“A pleasure to see you again, Kaijin…and you as well, slime. Do you remember me?”</p>
<p>The king was surprisingly casual with us as I sized up his approach.</p>
<p><em>Are we doing away with the obnoxious formalities?</em> I blithely wondered as I felt something dark and ominous from behind.</p>
<p>In a flash, Benimaru’s smile vanished and he had a steady hand on his sword, apparently not a fan of the king calling me just “slime.”</p>
<p>Soei, on the other hand, kept it supremely cool—the faint smile on his face told us all how he felt. He was <em>pissed</em>. He normally had no expression at all, but get him mad, and he’d smile back at you. A dangerous man to trifle with, and it was pretty funny how the only way to make Soei smile was to basically bait him into killing you.</p>
<p>Benimaru might’ve had a short temper, but by ogre mage standards, he was showing remarkable restraint.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the aura I felt from Shuna and Shion was nothing to sniff at, either. They were showing the opposite of restraint, actively exuding danger with every fiber of their being.</p>
<p>This was <em>ugly</em>. They still respected my orders enough to stick to them, I supposed, but if anything else happened, they’d be liable to blow their top at any moment. I needed to get this squared away before they went beyond my control.</p>
<p>As I fretted over this, I realized that Kaijin, himself, was deeply disturbed by the king’s greeting. “M-my liege?!” he stammered, eyes ready to pop out of their sockets.</p>
<p>Apparently this wasn’t the Gazel that Kaijin knew—but to me, this was a good sign. It meant the lord of a kingdom had taken the time to come here himself, do away with all the procedural BS, and get down to brass tacks with me. The fact he didn’t immediately sic his knights on us was, in itself, a victory. Regardless of how much it rankled the ogres, I had to take advantage of this chance.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha-ha!” the king boomed. “I see your head is unbending as always, Kaijin. Can you not see? I have come here strictly as a private citizen. At least, on paper. Otherwise, I hardly would be allowed out of my own bedchamber.”</p>
<p>Kaijin, still flustered, exchanged looks with his king and me. Realizing that nobody on the scene had any further comment, he took that to mean Gazel was telling the truth. It was hard for him to swallow. He froze.</p>
<p>So. The dwarven king wasn’t paying us a state visit but just doing a little private tourism? So what were all those ominous-looking knights behind him for? Hmm. Thinking about it, they’d never allow a king to just walk around in the forest alone. They had to be guards sent with him to appease the elders and bureaucrats who formed the core of dwarven government.</p>
<p><em>Well, if we’re doing away with procedure, I don’t see any reason not to address him directly.</em> Trusting in my hunch that Gazel meant no conflict, I decided to take a bullish approach.</p>
<p>“Which means, sir, that I’m free to speak as I wish?”</p>
<p>“By all means. This is no place to allow ourselves to be bound by formal ceremony.”</p>
<p>“Right. Well, lemme introduce myself first. My name is Rimuru. You’re right that I’m a slime, but I’d prefer if you didn’t call me that. I mean, I’m kind of the leader of the Great Forest of Jura Alliance, so you could say things have changed a bit since last time.” I took this moment to turn into my human shape. “This isn’t exactly who I <em>really</em> am, but it’s probably easier for you to talk to.”</p>
<p>I grinned, waiting for his reaction.</p>
<p>“It… It transformed?!”</p>
<p>“A magic-born…and such a high-level one.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I sense magical force but no casting of magic itself. A skill-based status transformation, I would say. I sense no sudden burst of magicules, so it is likely as it said—simply a change of appearance, not of nature. But this could change its method of battle. At the least, being able to wield equipment like our own could boost its own offensive and defensive powers.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like trouble… I haven’t seen a rare variant like this in quite a while. And the monsters behind it are rather strange in themselves!”</p>
<p>“Hmm,” said an old woman among them. “Those, I can identify. They are ogre mages—a race just as rare as orc lords.”</p>
<p>“They are? That’s the evolved form of an ogre, is it not? Should we not dispatch them before they grow too strong to handle?”</p>
<p>“—You think it’d go that smoothly? Four of them bear horns. We would have to prepare for a bitter fight.”</p>
<p>“I hate to sound timid, but yes… Best not underestimate them.”</p>
<p>The king looked on silently, but his personal companions seemed fairly unnerved. They even guessed what Benimaru and his kin were. That old crone must’ve used some kind of magic to prod us for data. I didn’t like being evaluated like that, but it was largely out of my hands. I needed to show off a little strength, or else they’d stomp all over me. Even if we survived, I sure as hell didn’t want to be subservient to these guys.</p>
<p>“Silence!” the king suddenly bellowed, never taking his eyes off me. “Enough of this racket. This slime and I are speaking right now. Excuse me—Rimuru, I mean. I will evaluate him for myself, and I would appreciate it if all of you held your tongues in the meantime.”</p>
<p>It was a pure show of force, and it stunned them all into silence.</p>
<p>“Yeah, uh, sorry if I scared you all. I just transformed because I thought this’d be more natural for you. Just like that lady said, this is the work of my skill, Universal Shapeshift. A form of mimicry, is all. So you don’t have to freak out about it.”</p>
<p>“I will be the judge of that. I would hardly believe the words of someone unless I was reasonably sure they were a friend…or foe.”</p>
<p><em>True enough. Friend or foe, though, huh? That might be why King Gazel’s here, then—to figure out exactly who the heck we are.</em> If I had to guess, he knew about the orc lord’s defeat, and that compelled him to move. As long as I could gain his trust, there was no need to be hostile.</p>
<p>“Well,” I ventured, “you can doubt me all you want, but we can’t really sustain a conversation that way, can we?”</p>
<p>“No need to worry. Words are not what I need to judge your character. Instead, I will use my sword to divine your true nature. If you insist on such ribald boasting, calling yourself the ‘leader’ of this forest, it may be about time to show you your place. If that sword of yours isn’t mere decoration, I ask you to accept my request.”</p>
<p>With that, he handed the halberd he carried in his hands to an attending knight on his side. My katana-style sword must have set off his battle lust or something.</p>
<p>“Y-Your Majesty, surely…”</p>
<p>“Ha! What faster way to settle this than with a man-to-man duel?” The king laughed, ferocious.</p>
<p>Judging by the shocked looks on the knights and Gazel’s companions, their monarch was seriously looking for a fight. I had no reason to turn him down. We were still evacuating the town, so it’d be a helpful way to buy some time.</p>
<p>“I accept the request. And I’ll make you regret calling me a boaster,” I said, looking King Gazel in the eye.</p>
<p>We both took a step forward, the ogre mages keenly looking on. I’m sure they didn’t think I could lose. The king’s side seemed intent on letting him fight as well; nobody dared to dissuade him from the idea. The crowd had already formed a ring, with us facing each other down in the middle.</p>
<p>“Regarding the rules,” Gazel said, “if you can block a single string of my attacks, you may call yourself the victor. Not that it has to be said, but you are free to attack me at any time, too. But remember: I am Gazel Dwargo, Master of the Sword, and my blade shall not be taken lightly.”</p>
<p>He took his weapon in hand and aimed it in front of his eyes. It held a single edge, with a bit of a curve to it, and pretty patterns were etched up and down its length. It resembled a samurai sword but had its own unique design—certainly, a very well-made weapon for the Master of the Sword to carry.</p>
<p>Just when I was preparing to draw my own blade, a clear voice penetrated the ring.</p>
<p>“Allow me to watch over the match!”</p>
<p>As it did, I felt the presence of three more among us, hearts pure and bereft of evil. One had spoken—Treyni, a dryad I was familiar with. As always, she had a knack for appearing and disappearing whenever it suited her. The other two resembled Treyni, so I assumed they were among the “sisters” she spoke of.</p>
<p>“Dryads?!” exclaimed the elderly woman who scanned us earlier. I couldn’t blame her surprise. Anyone would be alarmed at a monster teleporting in from out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Treyni smiled as she gave both of us a quick glance. “Dwarven King, you are being terribly arrogant to our forest leader. Calling Sir Rimuru a boaster tells me you are willing to make every denizen of this wood your enemy. Is this right? However, if Sir Rimuru has accepted this challenge, it is my role as his subject to allow it. I will close my eyes to it this time. But relent on your promise, and do not expect mercy from us.”</p>
<p>She was willing to accept no back talk against this. My companions nodded at one another—it was like Treyni said what they all were thinking.</p>
<p>The dwarves, on the other hand, didn’t look well at all.</p>
<p>“The loftiest presence in the forest,” one whispered, “siding with a single force?”</p>
<p>“They are as powerful as high-level elementals. And three of them! I hope you are all ready for this, my friends…”</p>
<p>The mood was grim among them.</p>
<p><em>This was exactly why I wanted to avoid combat…</em></p>
<p>“Ha! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! So ‘leader of the forest’ was no boast, after all. I apologize for branding you a liar, Rimuru. And I think I have a vague understanding of the situation here. But I still seek to gauge your true nature. And if we have a referee for this contest, all that remains is to cross swords!” Gazel seemed completely unmoved.</p>
<p>He had been watching me the whole time, without wavering.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re right. We’ll have a quick match, and then we can talk about what has brought you here.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… And if you can beat me, I will do what I can to answer.”</p>
<p>There was no longer a peep from our audience.</p>
<p>Treyni, face tensed, stood between the two of us as we confronted each other. The match was on.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">“Begin!” came the dryad’s shrill voice over the still field.</p>
<p>And with that, Gazel and I instantly took action.</p>
<p>My Magic Sense skill allowed me to read all available information within the local range and replay it in my mind. Using it, I had a full grasp of the ring, as if I were looking down at ourselves from overhead. Speeding up my thought process by a thousandfold, I began to consider my tactics.</p>
<p>It had been a long while since I had given my all in battle. Since my fight with Geld, the Orc Disaster, I hadn’t skipped a day of practice with Hakuro—but the fact that none of it was “for keeps” had prevented me from really treating it seriously, in some corner of my mind. I honed every sense in my body as I sized up my foe.</p>
<p>At the moment, my height was around four and a quarter feet. Consuming the Orc Disaster had expanded my own magicule storage, so I had more all-purpose slime tissue to work with. King Gazel, meanwhile, was around five and a half feet, a bit larger than the dwarven average. Over a head taller than me—and in my mind, he loomed like a mountain. His role as king undoubtedly contributed to that.</p>
<p>Still, I kept my heartbeat calm as I observed him. He had his beautiful sword up to his eyes, taking a full-frontal approach and not moving an inch. He was ready to deflect anything I could dish up for him—and really, I couldn’t find any gap to exploit at all.</p>
<p>I was stricken by a sense that I was facing Hakuro. Master of the Sword was right. Or maybe I should be more amazed at Hakuro, given how he was the first person who sprang to mind when as a comparison to Gazel.</p>
<p>Regardless, this wasn’t training. I couldn’t afford to call time-out. <em>Let’s test him, then.</em> Gazel only talked about “a single string of attacks,” and I was free to try attacking all I wanted in the meantime. Or defeat him, even.</p>
<p>The more masterful the fighter, the better a gauge they had of the space around them. In that case…</p>
<p>Using Strengthen Body to boost my leg muscles, I zoomed forward and slashed at the king. He was free to take the blow; if he tried to respond to it, he was right in my trap.</p>
<p>I was sure I’d given him enough data to work with before I sprang into action, and I was sure he read it all accurately and factored it into his own approach. Which meant that, if I could just stretch my arms out four inches or so more as I slashed, that’d be enough for him to misjudge everything. Not too much—just enough.</p>
<p>Maybe this strategy sounds petty, but it definitely works. One of the most important rules of close-quarters combat is not to let your foe gain a solid sense of distance. I used the same trick to land a blow on Hakuro once. It never worked again, and Hakuro truly lived up to his ogre name as he showed me hell the rest of the day, but there it was. One point for me. And if it deceived a master like him, would it work on this one?</p>
<p>But betraying my total confidence, Gazel executed a precision move to deflect my hand away, as if expecting it the whole time.</p>
<p><em>Dude! You’ve gotta be kidding me!</em> I thought as I readied my sword again. Gazel showed no interest in countering, still just watching me quietly. I tried a few other attacks, switching out my tactics each time, but he breezily shrugged away each one. I should mention that I wasn’t going easy on him. I had potions on me, so I could heal him as long as he survived.</p>
<p>But my full force wasn’t enough to work on him. Lightly, gently, he was handling me with just the right amount of power, ensuring he didn’t nick his sword in the process. It seemed there was a clear, and overwhelming, difference in skill between us. I was so helpless against him that even I had to admit it.</p>
<p>“What? Are you done? Is that all the power you have, Rimuru?”</p>
<p>Come to think of it, he wasn’t restricting me from using my skills at all. It wouldn’t be breaking the rules, I reasoned. But relying on such skills seemed basically the same as admitting defeat. It peeved me. I had to get a clean blow in, no matter what. This whole match had lit a spark under the competitive streak I’ve had since before.</p>
<p>“Shut up!” I spat. “I haven’t come at you for real yet, so don’t hurry me!” But I still didn’t have any new ideas. I didn’t want to lose, but I had nothing to work with. And as if reading this state of mild panic, King Gazel started to move, confronting me with terrific fighting force. Exposed to this aura, my movements were fully held in check.</p>
<p><em>Oh, crap. I’m leaving myself wide open to him!</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s">Report. Analysis complete. This force is Heroic Aura, an extra skill that is a higher-level version of Coercion. Its aim is to make the target cower and become unable to move. Targets with low resistance will find themselves submitting to, and even adoring, the wielder.</p>
<p>Just as I feared the worst, my reliable partner gave me a report. <em>Now that’s what the Great Sage is for. So how to counteract?</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s">Understood. As with Coercion, the correct way to resist the skill is via fighting spirit.</p>
<p><em>Um? Fighting spirit? Come on…</em></p>
<p>Talk about unreliable. I had the feeling that the Sage was starting to phone it in sometimes.</p>
<p>But no time for that. I need to get out of this. How do I conjure fighting spirit? Shouting could help, maybe. I couldn’t move, but I could speak. If it didn’t work, I’d think of something else.</p>
<p>“Uh… <em>Oraaahhhhh!!</em>”</p>
<p>I screamed as loud as I could. It wound up firing a Voice Cannon, one of Ranga’s specialties, right at Gazel. I also released a bolt of Coercion of my own, hoping it would neutralize Heroic Aura.</p>
<p>The king dissolved the Voice Cannon without bothering to dodge it. But it still distracted his attention enough that his aura disappeared. Now we were back to square one. The two of us glared at each other, swords ready.</p>
<p>If this was how it’d be going, the only way to win was via the conditions he offered. See through his attacks and block them. But I wasn’t expecting such an expert fighter. The depth of his strength was unfathomable. It really was like fighting Hakuro. If he wanted to kill me, he probably would’ve struck a fatal blow long ago. He didn’t because, as he declared earlier, he wanted to see what I had.</p>
<p>But I wasn’t ready to accept defeat that easily. I had proclaimed myself leader of the forest, and I had to go all-out to win this. At the very least, I would never allow myself to fight like a wimp in front of all these people.</p>
<p>Shaking the cobwebs off, I quietly brought my sword up to eye level, facing Gazel—ready to take his instruction, like I did with Hakuro. <em>If I can deflect his moves, I win.</em> Banishing all doubt from my mind, I focused on becoming one with my blade. Turn an ear to its sound, and become one with it—that was Hakuro’s advice to me. I had no idea what he meant, but I meekly tried to follow it.</p>
<p>Watching me, Gazel grinned.</p>
<p>“Yes. That’s it. Now, it is time for me to move!”</p>
<p><em>You don’t have to telegraph it</em> that <em>much</em>, I thought. But just as I did—he disappeared. Not a single one of my search skills could find him.</p>
<p><em>What on…?!</em></p>
<p>It was only luck and coincidence that let me deal with it. Somehow—I had no reason for it—I had a feeling that danger was coming at me from below. I had never trusted my fate to such vague premonitions before, but this time, I decided to follow my gut feeling. Maybe it was the “voice of the sword” I felt—what you hear when you’ve fully mastered your craft.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t the end. Because this… This skill…</p>
<p><em>Oh, crap!</em></p>
<p>The moment I thought it, I held my sword aloft.</p>
<p>A loud, sharp <em>tiiiing!</em> echoed. The battle was over. I had successfully stopped King Gazel’s sword strike.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh-heh… Ahh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!! You’ve stopped me!!”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah… So, uh, if you admit it, does that mean I win?”</p>
<p>“It certainly does. You don’t appear to be at all evil to me.”</p>
<p>With another bellowing laugh, Gazel removed his sword.</p>
<p>“This fight is over! The winner is Rimuru Tempest!!”</p>
<p>With Treyni’s official notice, my victory was complete. I sat down on the ground, relieved. The battle had taken more out of me than I had thought.</p>
<p>So this was Gazel Dwargo, the dwarven king. Somehow, I felt like I had been granted a glimpse, just a glimpse of this hero’s full force.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Treyni’s voice was immediately followed by a chorus of cheers from the monsters assembled in the field. The dwarves, meanwhile, were already grumbling about the result.</p>
<p>“He stopped the king’s very sword?!”</p>
<p>“Ridiculous! It’s simply not possible!”</p>
<p>“Did His Majesty relent at the last minute?!”</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Though, really, King Gazel was trying to test me. Anything else, and I would’ve lost any sword battle against him. <em>Relent</em>, however? <em>I know me winning doesn’t exactly fill you with delight, but isn’t that going a little too far?</em></p>
<p>“Silence!” shouted one of the knights, clad entirely in white. “Have you no shame, my fellows?! How arrogant for anyone to accuse His Majesty of relenting on any foe! Are you saying <em>you</em> could follow his movements with your eyes, when none of us even could?”</p>
<p>“He’s right,” spoke another, a warrior-type dwarf dressed in jet-black. “Gazel did not relent. The Master of the Sword fully deserves his title. This was no duel to the death; it was focused squarely upon gauging each competitor’s true nature. Do not forget: We are not here to create enemies!”</p>
<p>How nice of them to plead my case for me. It also proved, for good, that the dwarves were here not for war but to judge my character.</p>
<p>The other dwarves scowled at this dressing down. “Forgive our impropriety,” they said to Gazel and me. I’m sure they weren’t trying to throw mud on the match—they simply didn’t want to admit that their beloved king was fallible.</p>
<p>The apologies sounded sincere enough, so I accepted them. Besides, I could understand their thoughts. Not to be blunt, but I blocked that last attack out of sheer luck. I should know, because I was there. I knew the stance that strike of his required, and it seemed like it’d be pointed at me in the same way, so I just followed my instincts and held my sword aloft—and I turned out to be right.</p>
<p>“Well done, though! You saw right through my Haze of Rumbling Heavens move. Impressive!”</p>
<p>“No, no, it was sheer coincidence. I saw my instructor use that skill before.”</p>
<p>Well, not “saw it” so much as “was beaten to the ground by it” in training. Just the other day, I managed to dodge his first slash, only to be smashed right on the crown by his <em>real</em> strike. Talk about a disappointment.</p>
<p>A piercing blow from the ground to the heavens like that is mainly meant to throw one’s foe off guard. It was the strike that followed after this blow that displayed the true worth of Haze of Rumbling Heavens. It was one of Hakuro’s beginner-level moves, but I was <em>juuust</em> about in a position to deal with it by now. I only stopped it because I was familiar with it. Nothing worth praising me for.</p>
<p>“What was that? Could this ‘instructor’ of yours be…?” Gazel asked, looking down at me in excitement.</p>
<p><em>Hmm. Could it be, indeed? The same skill and everything…</em></p>
<p>“Hoh-hoh-hoh! Well performed, Sir Rimuru. Glad to see you are hearing your sword’s voice!”</p>
<p>Hakuro, who was aiding the town’s evacuation, chose that moment to sidle up next to me.</p>
<p>“The women and children have been directed to safety. I left the rest to Gobta and came here, but what a sight awaited me!”</p>
<p>He gave me a smile, clearly enjoying this. I guess he must’ve thought I needed some help over here.</p>
<p>“If I may…,” Gazel said, suddenly humble. “Are you the Sword Ogre?”</p>
<p>Aha. So they <em>did</em> know each other.</p>
<p>“…Hohh. The child from way back when, is it? I hardly even recognized you. Well, forgive me for being so rude, Your Majesty. I was wondering what kind of stalwart warrior could use such a sword move. How splendid to see you have grown to be a better swordsman than I!” Hakuro gazed upon the king with a smile.</p>
<p>“It is an honor to hear such words, Sword Ogre.”</p>
<p>“Mmm. Three hundred years, is it? Since I found you as a child, lost in the forest, and began teaching you the way of the sword on a whim? A fond memory, nowadays. And now you are the dwarven king!”</p>
<p>So he instructed Gazel at some point? No wonder they had a similar style. Which meant the king was kind of my fellow student. Still, three hundred years? How long has Hakuro been around anyway? Talk about a man of mystery. And talk about never knowing who you’ll run into from your past.</p>
<p class="space-break">We decided to talk in more detail elsewhere.</p>
<p>Gone were the provisional tents from before. Now, in the center of town, we had a dorm full of rooms for everyone who held central posts related to keeping things running. There was a government building of sorts next to it filled with offices and meeting halls, and we all went inside to hold a little catch-up meeting. The freshly returned town residents could take care of the knight corps—this meeting was just for the top brass, and it began as a rather relaxed affair.</p>
<p>The mission of the dwarves was to investigate the mystery team of monsters that defeated the orc lord—in other words, us. As they put it, they needed to see if we were friend or foe, just like I thought.</p>
<p>Between the dryads and running into the king’s old sword master, any potential hostilities (that duel notwithstanding) were a thing of the past. The dryads were known to be a kind and fair race, and the dwarves believed they would never lend a hand to anyone with evil intentions. If they liked us, then they didn’t even need that duel to know we were okay. I guess that fight was just out of curiosity, then?</p>
<p>Once the dwarves gave their story, I gave ours—from the first rumblings of the orc lord to the Jura alliance we forged. I didn’t mention how the orc lord had evolved into a full-fledged demon lord—it’s all solved now, so I figured I didn’t need to.</p>
<p class="space-break">Somewhere along the line, the meeting transformed into a sort of banquet. The tension between us dissipated as we spoke, and by the time night fell, Shuna had offered us all dinner. We had a pretty bountiful food supply in town, so she was capable of some pretty decent eats. Nobody was better at it than Shuna, either, so I guess I should have expected this would devolve into a feast sometime.</p>
<p>It was dangerous for the Pegasus Knights to fly in the dark, so we would be hosting them tonight.</p>
<p>We had them all kick back in our public assembly grounds. Staying in regular contact with their home kingdom was no problem, they told me, so I thought I’d build a little amity and bust out some of the wine we were developing. Then the good times started rolling.</p>
<p>In the midst of this friendly affair, I thought I’d ask about something that bugged me.</p>
<p>“I have to admit, though, you guys work pretty fast. We informed the adventurers’ guild about this three months ago, so it couldn’t have reached you that long ago, could it?”</p>
<p>“Ah, our covert team—our intelligence gatherers—I had them keep tabs on you.”</p>
<p>For a king, Gazel seemed awfully forthcoming about what sounded like top-secret stuff. Maybe it was the wine talking.</p>
<p>“Uh, you sure you want to blow their cover or whatever?”</p>
<p>“Oh, what of it? You spotted them anyway.”</p>
<p>“Ah yes,” Soei coolly replied. “We did find someone sniffing around rather suspiciously. We had orders from you not to kill anyone, Sir Rimuru, so we simply chased him away. We thought it of little importance, but perhaps we should have taken him into custody?”</p>
<p>It barely even registered in Soei’s mind, so he didn’t think to brief me about it. I told him to just tell me next time instead of making judgment calls on his own.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s a rather hard pill to swallow. Yeah, my team isn’t too well suited for direct combat, but…”</p>
<p>This was Henrietta, a beautiful woman but apparently a bit of a mean drunk. One of Gazel’s close associates, she was a knight assassin who ran all the kingdom’s intelligence-gathering operations. I suppose Soei just hurt her feelings, but a serious-looking man in the white armor of a knight stepped in to assuage her. That was Dolph, captain of the Pegasus Knights, as he said—a man who adored Gazel, and one of the dwarves who apologized to us after the duel. Running a covert force as he was, he was more honest and upright than I originally thought.</p>
<p>After intervening between Soei and Henrietta, Dolph quickly fell into a deep conversation with Benimaru about aerial combat. I suppose not even someone as magnanimous as Dolph wanted to hang around those two for long. They had stopped sniping at each other, but the air was now silent and frigid between them. I’m sure anyone would rather talk about their favorite battle strategies instead.</p>
<p>Jaine, the old woman so curious about my own skills, was an arch-wizard and one of the most gifted dwarven clerics in the kingdom. She was now debating this or that finer point about magic with Shuna, and it seemed like Shuna was willing to learn from her, perhaps picking up on Jaine’s investigative magic. The crone also discussed the concept of “legion magic,” a kind of spell that could be cast on an entire military unit to annul the abilities of a rival force. It made me shiver a bit. If Benimaru decided to cast Hellflare on the knights, it probably wouldn’t have damaged them much at all.</p>
<p>This arch-wizard was decent enough in battle against individual foes, but apparently her true expertise was in strengthening entire units with magic. A much more dangerous lady than she looked.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kaijin was in friendly conversation with a dwarf clad in heavy black armor. This was Vaughn, arguably the strongest warrior of the entire Armed Nation. An admiral paladin, he said, and second only to Gazel in his field. He used to be Kaijin’s boss, and while his post meant he couldn’t play favorites, Vaughn still dearly regretted losing Kaijin. If we had come to blows today, he was prepared to make sure Kaijin and the other dwarves were escorted to safety. Nice guy. Bit scary-looking, though.</p>
<p>So that’s how we managed to break the ice with them all. And here’s King Gazel himself, reminiscing about the old days with Hakuro.</p>
<p>“Well, you may call me Hakuro the ogre mage now. I have taken on the post of instructor for Sir Rimuru.”</p>
<p>This comment of Hakuro’s made the good king promptly request his tutelage as well. His friends had to talk him out of it. The king of a nation—a superpower of sorts, even—leaving it all to go become an apprentice martial artist in a foreign country was gonna be tough to win approval for. So he glared at me instead, green with envy. Yeesh, could you knock it off? It’s not <em>my</em> fault.</p>
<p>It was funny, though. Gazel claimed to be visiting as a private citizen, and right now, that’s what he was. None of the grandiose atmosphere he presented in his royal chamber. Now he was more subdued, all the pomp and circumstance toned down. <em>Or maybe that’s the real Gazel I’m seeing now?</em> Watching him practically ooze delight as Kurobe praised his sword training, I couldn’t help but wonder.</p>
<p>There was Gazel the Heroic King, and then there was Gazel the fighter. He had seen what I was made of, and I felt like I had done the same with him.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Just as the feast got into full swing, Gazel suddenly turned to me, his expression grave.</p>
<p>“Rimuru…I want to ask you something.”</p>
<p>“Sure! Anything you need.”</p>
<p>“D’you want to forge a covenant with me?”</p>
<p>This body of mine didn’t allow me to feel buzzed, but I still felt like I had just snapped back into stone-cold sobriety.</p>
<p>“I ask you not as a fellow student of Hakuro, but as king. If you are the leader of this forest, that would put us in equal position—and if you’ve been able to hold this entire vast forest under a single government, I am sure you will be rewarded with riches and bounties that not even my kingdom can enjoy. We observed this city from the skies, and let me tell you, it is a beautiful one. That, and you have built great roads through the forest; I could only guess at the logistical and technical skills required to build them. They may yet be incomplete, but I can easily see this town becoming a vital trade center in due time—a vast new market, one that will take on great strategic importance. And when that happens, having another nation to back you would help in various ways, would it not?”</p>
<p>Some of that royal coercion was coming back again. He was pressing the offer at me, eyes dead serious. Ignoring that “fellow student” nonsense for a moment, he was basically recognizing that we were a coherent organization. A group he wanted to support, even. What a coup!</p>
<p>“Are you sure? Because this is the same as admitting that we—this group of monsters—are a full-fledged nation.”</p>
<p>A coup, but not something that King Gazel could decide upon by himself. If he was speaking as a king at the moment, this was his last chance to take it back.</p>
<p>“Of course! And since we may perhaps see this differently, let me say this: A covenant would be of great help to us, as well. This is no charity mission, Rimuru. We could both stand to benefit!” He told me all this with a grin, then offered his terms, dead serious.</p>
<p>These were as follows:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="nl-list">1. A nonaggression treaty with each other.</p>
<p class="nl-list">2. Assistance whenever one nation is endangered.</p>
<p class="nl-list">3. The building of a road to Dwargon, in exchange for their backing.</p>
<p class="nl-list">4. Guaranteed safety for dwarves in the Forest of Jura.</p>
<p class="nl-list">5. Promises of technology sharing between us.</p>
</div>
<p>There were a few other details, but those were the five main points.</p>
<p>The nonaggression thing went without saying, and safe passage for dwarves seemed suitable enough. In terms of military assistance, it seemed unlikely that we’d suddenly be tapped for that, just because we were getting along a bit civilization-wise. Dwargon shared a border with the Eastern Empire, but given that the dwarves were strictly neutral, the Empire wouldn’t be dumb enough to pick a fight with the Armed Nation. If they did, it wouldn’t really be our business to intervene.</p>
<p>If we were going to build formal trade links, a road would obviously follow along shortly. Having accessible trade routes is an indispensable part of encouraging trade, after all. But making us foot the bill for the whole thing? That would normally be a bit hard to accept. I suppose that was Gazel being as sharp as ever, but still, this was an extraordinary deal.</p>
<p>Recognition of monsters by humans like this was, in terms of common sense, just something you’d never see too often. I was picturing it happening over a long period of time, gradually. If I could get some real interaction with other nations going within, say, a few decades, that would’ve been fine by me. And here we were being offered the backing of the Armed Nation of Dwargon. Priceless. We couldn’t snag that even if we tried negotiating with one of the smaller kingdoms around us. It was such a stroke of good luck, I couldn’t help but shiver a bit.</p>
<p>“I would be glad to take this offer,” I told him.</p>
<p>Rigurd, Benimaru, Treyni and the others had no objections, willing to let me have the final say on it. As Treyni put it, none of the dryads disagreed with naming me leader of our alliance, and none of the monsters had any innate aversion to interacting with humans or dwarves.</p>
<p>So now we had an alliance.</p>
<p>“Let’s relay this to the kingdom,” the king told Henrietta. The head of Gazel’s undercover team would transmit the message back home by magic. To her, it was as casual an operation as making a phone call.</p>
<p>“What do you call this nation anyway?” he asked. It was a natural question, but one that made me freeze. We all gave one another surprised looks.</p>
<p><em>Our name…?</em></p>
<p>I mean, yeah, if Gazel was calling us a nation, we’d need a name like any decent one. But wow, a nation, huh…? I was happy enough with a town, so I hadn’t really thought about that. I thought it’d be neat to have a nation of monsters sometime, but I figured that was a while in the future.</p>
<p>“Well… I don’t think we’re really at the ‘nation’ point, yet. I mean, there’s the Alliance, but that’s just a bunch of different races that accepted me as their leader, is all. I don’t know if everyone in the forest is ready to accept that.”</p>
<p>I knew from the start that it sounded weak. Everyone in the room shot me down.</p>
<p>“If anyone refuses to recognize you as their lord,” Shion declared, “I promise I shall slay them where they stand!”</p>
<p>“Well,” Benimaru added, “it’s a monster’s natural instinct to follow the power chain. But I think it’s a little different with you, Sir Rimuru, at the core of it. You know? Nobody’s being forced to follow you, and I don’t think you’ll find anyone against it, either.”</p>
<p>It seemed to be beyond questioning for either of them, at least.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! Right now, Sir Rimuru, you hold control over approximately three-tenths of the forest. The other advanced races have decided to watch you carefully for the time being. However, the middle levels among them have already expressed interest in aligning with you, and I am sure the lower-level races will come flocking to this town for protection. We are united under a so-called alliance for now, but it is an alliance based on a common will, one that I believe will birth a full nation. One with you, Sir Rimuru, at the center.”</p>
<p>Way to stab me in the heart, Treyni.</p>
<p>Even in these circumstances, the old survival-of-the-fittest rule held true. Now that Veldora, the guardian of the forest, was gone—whatever that dragon thought about it—it meant the local monsters needed to band together before greedy humans or ambitious demon lords came in first. If not, the whole wood would either be exploited or demolished.</p>
<p>I had said it myself: <em>We will form a great alliance among the peoples of the Forest of Jura and build cooperative relationships with one another. It’d be pretty neat if we built a nation composed of multiple races, I think, but…</em></p>
<p>Treyni and the others had run with it, apparently, and that little quote had been causing a huge stir from one end of the forest to the other. Things had been moving really fast, and growing, while I wasn’t paying attention.</p>
<p>Guess I’d just have to live with it.</p>
<p>“All right. Let’s think up a name, then…”</p>
<p>Gazel gave a distressed laugh in response.</p>
<p>Leaving him behind, we took up a separate room for the debate. The dwarves hadn’t had enough wine yet; they wanted to keep it going all night, so we promised that we’d officially enact the covenant (really, an international treaty at this point) tomorrow and left them to their devices.</p>
<p class="space-break">Over the previous night, we had hammered out a name, assembling our top officers and staying up late discussing it.</p>
<p>The result we came up with: the Jura-Tempest Federation. Tempest for short. They were almost ready to name it Rimuru at first, but I was too embarrassed to allow that. I can just barely put up with Tempest—it didn’t really sound like a name unique to me, and it had a nice ring to it.</p>
<p>Of course, while I had my guard down, they went and named this town Rimuru on me. Ugh. The Central City of Rimuru, officially, but you <em>know</em> they’re gonna call it Rimuru or the town of Rimuru. Just thinking about it makes me want to crawl into a hole, but their conventions were simply too firm to let me turn it down. I just hope I get used to it quick.</p>
<p>We also talked a bit about what direction our fledgling nation should take. It was nothing we could settle upon in a single night, of course, so we planned a series of conferences to discuss it. I would be the sovereign ruler, more or less, but over time, I’d like to shift toward more of a republican form of government. You know—employ intelligent monsters, whether they had physical strength or not, and get them involved with politics. The right person in the right job, that’s my motto.</p>
<p>It was a long way from what you could even call a framework, but for now, we were good. Besides, this covenant came out because King Gazel and I trusted so much in each other.</p>
<p class="space-break">This current covenant between the Armed Nation of Dwargon and the Jura-Tempest Federation took the form of a pact between the two nations. It would take effect after representatives from each side applied their signatures. It would then be kept in safe, magical storage and announced to the world.</p>
<p class="space-break">And so the term Jura-Tempest Federation appeared in the public record for the first time.</p>
