<p>“Shion, that opinion speaks to my own heart as well. Let us go and see what this foe’s strength truly is.”</p>
<p>“That’s the spirit, Ranga. Let’s do it!”</p>
<p>Their excuses made, the two of them sprinted toward Charybdis.</p>

<p class="tx1">There were, at first, thirteen megalodons, each an A-ranked monster. Of the two remaining survivors, one was already dead, slashed to ribbons by Hakuro’s barrage of strikes. We had lost nobody on our side to death or injury. Things were going well, and I breathed an internal sigh of relief over it.</p>
<p>“Ah, how disappointing. Your mobility and ability to avoid danger have improved, but your offense is still woefully lacking. You couldn’t even defeat a single one of them… Once this battle is over, I will need to toughen up your training.”</p>
<p>“Whoa! Come on, gramps! If you toughen it up any further, I’m gonna die! Like, really, really die!”</p>
<p>“Did you just call me gramps?”</p>
<p>“Aghh?!”</p>
<p>I heard a pained scream from Gobta, and then all was quiet. I wasn’t sure what had happened. Maybe some passing megalodon bit him or something, huh? <em>So I guess we now have one casualty. I’m sure he’s not dead, though, so I’ll just believe that he’s still all right.</em></p>
<p>—And as I was thinking all this nonsense, new developments began to unfold. Soei was controlling the final megalodon like a well-trained mount, making it sink its teeth mercilessly into Charybdis. It was latched on to the great dragon now, looking like a work of surrealist art.</p>
<p>The megalodon was still alive, but it was no longer any sort of threat. That just left Charybdis to tackle.</p>
<p class="space-break">Paying no further mind to the megalodon, Soei flew over to Charybdis.</p>
<p>“Whoa, you think Soei’s gonna be all right?”</p>
<p>“Sir Rimuru, there is nothing to worry about. Soei is second only to me in terms of real strength. This is the perfect chance to test out Charybdis’s powers.”</p>
<p>Benimaru heard me muttering to myself and cheerfully replied. He didn’t sound worried at all, implying just how much he believed in Soei.</p>
<p>“Besides, we have that pair in the battle, too.” He pointed to Shion and Ranga.</p>
<p>They were both on the dragon’s back. Presumably they had climbed up to a pretty high altitude to avoid Magic Interference, then dive-bombed down on it. Looking at Charybdis, though… The sheer size of it was mind-blowing. Being over 150 feet long was a threat in and of itself. Simply dropping a mass that size on a city from above would result in unimaginable damage.</p>
<p class="space-break1s">Understood. Based on an estimate of its size, from a height of—</p>
<p><em>That’s fine, Great Sage. Thanks, but I don’t need to crunch the numbers. It’d just depress me to hear it anyway. If you’re gonna be that way, how about giving me some easy way to beat this guy?</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><img alt="image" src="images/Art_mdash2.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle;"/></p>
<p>Radio silence, huh? The Sage had this incredibly bad habit of going mum exactly when I needed it the most. Or maybe it was just pouting at me.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p class="space-break">Before my eyes, Soei, Shion, and Ranga had commenced their attack on Charybdis.</p>
<p><em>Things have been going well so far. Maybe…</em></p>
<p>But despite my wishes, it wasn’t that easy. The sheer size was a true menace, and now that was clearer than ever. All three launched attacks, but none worked at all. They were up against a 150-foot-long frame; anything they could throw at it was little more than peeling a layer off an onion. And more importantly, none of it could reach its magic-controlling neural network.</p>
<p>Charybdis, technically speaking, was not a living thing. It was a monster with a pretty twisted ecology, and thus it had no internal organs or anything. Picture it as using the flesh of lesser dragons to construct an armor of meat surrounding it.</p>
<p>This was to be expected, and it was also a given that no half-baked attack would be enough to stab through it.</p>
<p>“So it’s come to this. My magic had virtually no effect from outside of a thousand feet…but if a close-range approach like that fails as well, there is nothing we can do. Magic doesn’t work, and now we know that physical attacks are just as meaningless,” an anxious Treyni said.</p>
<p>“See, this is why I told you to leave it to me…”</p>
<p>Even at a time like this, Milim was still wheedling incessantly. I had no time for her at the moment.</p>
<p>According to Treyni, even Aerial Blade—the strongest elemental magic spell she had at her disposal—was reduced to only about a tenth of its natural power. Far from the deciding blow it was meant to be. It did deal some damage, but as she put it, the wounds immediately healed themselves.</p>
<p>Plus, after the attack had continued for a while, it suddenly flew into a violent rage—the pain receptors must’ve taken their time transmitting their message to its brain.</p>
<p>“It suddenly sped up and attempted to ram me. Each of the scales on its body slashed at us, like small individual swords. The light rays from its eye scattered the nearby magicules. To beings like ourselves, which create their corporeal forms through magicules, it was a very difficult attack to deal with.”</p>
<p>She recounted the situation for us.</p>
<p>I had this explained to me at the meeting hall, but seeing it in person made the sheer ferocity easy to understand. Run-of-the-mill attacks were meaningless against this monster.</p>
<p>“…Oh no!” Treyni suddenly shouted.</p>
<p>“Its single eye flashed red for a moment. That might be a sign that Charybdis is preparing to attack,” Benimaru explained.</p>
<p><em>Uh, I saw it, too, guys, okay? I was just, you know, taking a more laid-back approach to assessing it.</em> Besides, Shion had just summoned her full aura to bust out an Ogresword Cannon, so I was kind of distracted by that. Maybe that’s what pissed Charybdis off, but regardless of the reason, it looked dangerous. I decided to send a Thought Communication their way.</p>
<p><em>Did you hear that? It might be hatching something, so keep your guard up!</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, Sir Rimuru!</em></p>
<p><em>Understood.</em></p>
<p><em>I hear you, my master!</em></p>
<p>I nodded at the replies. I’m sure they didn’t need that “keep your guard up” reminder, but hey, just in case.</p>
<p>But my message turned out to be an incredibly good idea. Just a moment later, Soei and the others were exposed to a truly massive attack. A deafening sound akin to fingernails on glass filled the air, itself enough to make it feel like your very soul was being contaminated. It was the sound of the scales that covered Charybdis’s body grating against one another. And then…</p>
<p>“My heavens! I had no idea it possessed an attack like that…”</p>
<p>“This…is bad. It can’t be evaded.”</p>
<p>The tension was clear in Treyni’s and Benimaru’s voices. From every inch of its own body, Charybdis was unleashing a calamity, one that would spread death and destruction wherever it went.</p>
<p>And in the midst of it…</p>
<p>“Hohh! So this is Tempest Scale, the attack that made Charybdis feared as a tyrant! Never seen <em>that</em> before!”</p>
<p>That was Milim. Having nothing else to do, she was offering color commentary to me now. <em>The name of it doesn’t matter. And if you knew about that, I really wish you could’ve told us…</em></p>
<p>I almost asked her what she knew, but I stopped myself. Now was no time for a long-winded explanation, and the attack was pretty self-evident anyway.</p>
<p>Right now, I was more worried for Shion and our other allies. It had happened right after I warned them to stay on guard, so Soei, Shion, and Ranga were just barely able to take evasive action. But they were being threatened by Charybdis’s overwhelming supply of scales—hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands—being shot out in all directions like high-caliber bullets. They varied in size, but even the tiniest were several inches in diameter. Take one unguarded, and it’d no doubt be even more disastrous for you than a sword slash.</p>
<p>There were tens of thousands of them raining down at incredible speed. There was no place to run. The so-called Tempest Scale worked at a far broader range than even Hellflare, which was capable of mowing down entire landscapes.</p>
<p>“Ngh, I can’t dodge them all. Ranga and I have Shadow Motion, but…”</p>
<p>“Dodge them? What a childish thing to suggest. This won’t be enough to kill me!” Shion snickered at Soei’s assessment.</p>
<p>Her eyes were bloodshot, and I was pretty sure she had lost all sense of reason. She was brandishing her sword at Charybdis, not even bothering to protect herself against the storm of scales. She was obviously in danger.</p>
<p>Soei and Ranga met in the air once more.</p>
<p>“…Soei, you should flee. I will serve as a shield for Shion.”</p>
<p>Fully stretching out his legs, Ranga leaped away from their foe’s Magic Interference radius, then used the extra skill Control Wind to turn back toward Charybdis. The first wave of scales had already reached him, cutting through skin. Just as he promised, he intended to shield Shion with his own body.</p>
<p>“Are you crazy, Ranga? You need to go!” Shion shouted, regaining her senses.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… I imagine that Sir Rimuru, too, would select the option that gave him the greatest chance of survival. But with a body this size, I cannot find shadows suitable enough for me to use Shadow Motion with. You go alone, Soei.”</p>
<p>Shadow Motion often seemed like an all-powerful skill, but even it had its limitations. In the air, with only stable and temporary footholds available, it simply wasn’t available to Ranga. Hearing this made even Soei hesitate for a bit.</p>
<p>“…The greatest chance of survival, eh? Then I’m staying here. But don’t worry. I’ll make the <em>real</em> me retreat before I die.”</p>
<p>“Ha! How Soei-like of you. In that case, may we all live to see another day!” Shion laughed, voice loud and clear.</p>
<p>Faced with the terrifying Tempest Scale, not one dared to give up on themselves. It could be called reckless, but to me, I couldn’t have asked for anything else.</p>
<p class="space-break">They were all ready for this.</p>
<p>“You people really are a bunch of idiots, you know that? You could at least count on me now, of all times.”</p>
<p>I decided now was the time to speak.</p>
<p>“““?!”””</p>
<p>All three froze in surprise. I flew in front of them, raising my left arm against the advancing scales.</p>
<p>“““Sir Rimuru!!”””</p>
<p>I could hear them shouting my name, a mixture of shock and joy in their voices. I didn’t respond, head faced forward to handle what must be done.</p>
<p>Which was…</p>
<p>“Consume them all, Glutton!!”</p>
<p>With my call, the insatiable Glutton within me stirred. The results unfolded in a single moment. I imagine not too many knew what had happened. The wall of innumerable scales that loomed over them just a moment ago had now neatly disappeared.</p>
<p>“A…astounding. Well done, Sir Rimuru…”</p>
<p>It was Soei who found his voice first. And really, I was just as surprised as he was.</p>
<p>I flew up there since, hey, if it’s a long-range attack, I could just eat it all up.</p>
<p>…Okay, that’s a lie. The Great Sage actually tipped me off. All I did was take it at its word and step up to protect my friends. Using Shadow Motion to appear in front of them, I just barely made it in time to follow the Sage’s advice and unleash Glutton.</p>
