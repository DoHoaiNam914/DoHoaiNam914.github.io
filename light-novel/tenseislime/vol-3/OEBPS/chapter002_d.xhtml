<p>“Mmmm, this is good!”</p>
<p>“Ah!!”</p>
<p>“Whew. <em>Really</em> good. Oops! I’m almost out.”</p>
<p>“Whaaa?!”</p>
<p><em>This is fun. She’s just like a child, ripe for getting picked on.</em></p>
<p>“So you gonna admit that I won?”</p>
<p>“…Wait. I have a suggestion.”</p>
<p>“Let’s hear it.”</p>
<p>“Call it a draw. How about we call it a draw this time?”</p>
<p>“And what do I get out of agreeing to that?”</p>
<p>“I’ll forget about everything that happened.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“That, that’s not all, either! I swear I won’t meddle with you guys at all! And you know, if you have any problems, you can talk to me about them, okay?!”</p>
<p>I won!</p>
<p>Her strength was overwhelming, but inside, she was every bit the kid that she looked like. Against a grown-up’s negotiation skills, she had no chance. Yep. Grown-ups play <em>dirty</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, trying to extract anything else out of her would be dangerous. She was a catastrophe-class demon lord, and if I got on her bad side any further, I ran the risk of my town being turned into ash. I decided to play my hand before she changed her mind.</p>
<p>“Sounds good to me. I accept. We’ll call it a draw, then.”</p>
<p>I had a fair bit of inventory left, so I put a generous supply of honey into a jar and handed it to her. It wasn’t a fancy jar, misshapen and handmade from clay, but Milim still accepted it with a smile, scooping a bit up and sucking at it with gusto.</p>
<p>The danger was gone. She was in a good mood, and the most unprecedented catastrophe to ever hit our town ended before it began.</p>

<p class="tx1">I had just healed the ogres and started to head back into town when I realized that Milim was following me. Oh, brother. I thought I had talked my way out of this, so I assumed she would be going back home, but already my plans were failing.</p>
<p>Holding the jar of honey drops carefully, the demon lord stuck right to my side in lockstep. <em>Does she want more honey?</em> I had a supply, but no intention of letting her have more of it. I didn’t want <em>my</em> portion to run away on me.</p>
<p>“Hey,” she asked, sidling up to me as we walked. “Hey, have you ever thought about calling yourself a demon lord, or trying to become one?”</p>
<p><em>What on earth is she going on about…?</em></p>
<p>“Why would I want to put myself through that?” I asked.</p>
<p>She gave me a genuinely perplexed look in response. “Huh? I mean… We’re talking about a demon lord, here! They’re really cool, you know? You kinda want to…look up to them, right?”</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>It appeared that Milim the demon lord and I saw things in very different ways. We looked at each other.</p>
<p>“Well, lemme ask you this: Do you get anything good out of being a demon lord?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Umm, well, all these strong guys seek you out to try to start fights. It’s fun!”</p>
<p>“I’m already getting in enough fights now, thanks. Not interested.”</p>
<p>“Whaaaa?! Well, how do you get <em>your</em> fun in life?”</p>
<p>“Oh, all kinds of things. There’s practically too much for me to do, if anything. I only just got my hands on that honey a little bit ago. There’s lots of other stuff I want, too, so I really don’t have the time to be a demon lord. Or is there something to it besides fighting?”</p>
<p>“No, but…you can act all big around humans and magic-born…?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that kind of boring?”</p>
<p>The question caused Milim to make a face like she was just struck by lightning. I guess it <em>was</em> kind of boring. I was so on the mark that she had nothing to say.</p>
<p>We were almost back at town again, and if she was that shocked about it, I kind of wished she would go away and leave me alone.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess you know my story now. Be careful on your way back home, all right?”</p>
<p>I thought that was a pretty smooth way to drop the hint. I was wrong.</p>
<p>“Wait! Y-you…?! You’re doing stuff that’s more fun than being a demon lord? That’s not fair! It’s <em>totally</em> not fair! Now I’m angry. Tell me what it is! And let me join you, too!!”</p>
<p>I did my best not to call her a spoiled brat to her face. She was a demon lord; riling her could have unexpected consequences. Really, just thinking of her as a child made dealing with her a cinch. Judging by our confrontation just a moment ago, it was super-easy as an adult to talk around her. You can’t try to read someone like this too deeply. Just work around her selfishness and nudge the conversation in your direction—that’s the real key to it, and along those lines, I was already treating Milim like the children of my relatives.</p>
<p>“All right, all right. I’ll tell you. But on one condition. Can you start calling me Sir Rimuru from now on?”</p>
<p>“What? No! You’re crazy! It should be the opposite. You need to call me Lady Milim! Don’t go bandying about my first name like that…”</p>
<p><em>Oops. Maybe I got a little too cocky?</em> She looks and acts like a child, but angering a walking potential catastrophe could be lethal.</p>
<p>“Well, hang on a sec. We just drew our last fight. That’s fine, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Nnngh…”</p>
<p>“All right. Let’s do this. I’ll call you Milim, and you can just call me Rimuru. Sound good?”</p>
<p>“Mmmmhh… Well, okay. I got it! I’ll allow you to call me just Milim. You better appreciate that, though! Only my demon lord friends are allowed that.”</p>
<p>“Well, thanks. I guess we’re friends now, too, huh?”</p>
<p>“Huh?!”</p>
<p>Despite all the sparks, we had overcome our naming dispute. We’d just call each other by our own names—no honorifics or anything.</p>
<p>“Okay, well, I’ll give you a tour of the city, but no wandering around by yourself, okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay, Rimuru! Ee-hee-hee!”</p>
<p>The demon lord Milim—just Milim to me—was being oddly cheerful.</p>
<p>“Great. There’s a good girl. And no starting fights in town without my permission, either. Promise me?”</p>
<p>“Of course! I promise, Rimuru!”</p>
<p>So far, so good. Easier than I thought, even. I ought to be fine now.</p>
<p>“…Well done, Sir Rimuru. Taming the wild demon lord so briskly…”</p>
<p>“We should expect no less of Sir Rimuru!”</p>
<p>“I will let Sir Rigurd know about this…and to take care not to anger the demon lord.”</p>
<p>The feedback from the ogre mages seemed positive enough, too. No complaints, at least—<em>and if they did have complaints</em>, I thought as I guided Milim toward town, <em>lodging them to a demon lord wouldn’t do much</em>.</p>
<p class="space-break">It seemed, by the way, that calling yourself a demon lord was a good way to make the other demon lords punish you. If you couldn’t prove your strength, they’d boot you right out of the club.</p>
<p>Whew. That was a <em>real</em> close one. If I declared myself a demon lord, like Milim was semi-pushing me to do, I’d start to get watched by <em>real</em> demon lords. Not that Milim wasn’t one, but either way, I dodged a bullet without realizing it. Hearing that story afterward, I gave myself a mental pat on the back for refusing the bait.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">I was showing Milim around town.</p>
<p>It turned out to be much more laborious than I was expecting. If you’ve ever taken a young child to an amusement park, I think you can imagine how it was. Take your eyes off her for a moment, and she’s gone. It was exactly like that.</p>
<p>“Hey! I told you to stop running off!”</p>
<p>“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I’m over here! What’s this thing?!”</p>
<p>“Listen to me! Just calm down and pay attention.”</p>
<p>“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! What’s the big deal? I’m listening!”</p>
<p>She plainly wasn’t. She was running up and down the streets, her tension level so high that it honestly made me wonder about her.</p>
<p>“Ah, Sir Rimuru!”</p>
<p>Just inside town, we ran into Gabil, who was carrying a box.</p>
<p>“What good timing. I am here because our test run is complete.”</p>
<p><em>He may live to regret calling it “good” timing.</em></p>
<p>“Oooh, a dragonewt! Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! That’s pretty rare. Doing okay?”</p>
<p>“Well, well, here’s a new girl. Indeed, I am Gabil the dragonewt! As Sir Rimuru’s right-hand man, I have been tasked with the development of a secret potion. Are you new to town, too, li’l lady?”</p>
<p class="space-break"><em>—Snap!</em></p>
<p class="space-break">“Huh? What did you just say? ‘Little lady’—you don’t mean <em>me</em>, do you? You want me to kill you?”</p>
<p>She was all smiles a moment ago. Now, Milim was transformed. Guess she didn’t like what Gabil called her.</p>
<p>Grabbing Gabil’s head with a single hand, the demon lord pulled it toward her, then planted a fist in his stomach. I had no time at all to stop her. With a pained exhalation, Gabil had been brought to the brink of death.</p>
<p><em>Uh… Wait. What happened to her promise not to start a fight without my permission…?</em></p>
<p>“Listen to me. I’m in a <em>very</em> good mood at the moment. That’s why I’m willing to forgive you now that I’ve done that…but not next time, so watch yourself, got it?”</p>
<p>I don’t think she could’ve done much more than “that” without causing literal death. Some “forgiveness.” It was like she expertly judged the exact amount of force to bring Gabil up to—but not over—the cliff. This girl was <em>fearsome</em>! She probably used Dragon’s Eye to gauge the strike, but still, fearsome.</p>
<p>Good thing Gabil was carrying a test run of our healing potion. We quickly used it on him. It worked.</p>
<p>“Phahh?! I saw my father waving at me from across the river!” he shouted upon waking up.</p>
<p>“Guess you’re fine, then,” I muttered, rolling my eyes. “Your father’s still alive, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>“Er…oh, right. Many pardons. I really <em>was</em> rather close to death, however. Who is this girl—er, this esteemed lady before us…?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Soei’s informing Rigurd right now, but I guess nobody told you guys in the cave yet. This is Milim. I guess she’s a demon lord?”</p>
<p>“H…uh? Whaaatt?! A demon lord?!”</p>
<p>Gabil was so shocked, he looked ready to piss himself. I could understand why. I waited for him to compose himself, then explained that Milim would be staying in town for a little while.</p>
<p>“I see… No wonder that was such a powerful punch. I suppose I should be glad to be alive…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, she promised that she wouldn’t start any fights, so I doubt she’s aiming to kill anyone.”</p>
<p>“Wah-ha-ha! Of course not! That was just my way of saying hi!”</p>
<p>Hell of a way to do that. I guess I shouldn’t trust her on that promise too much. A little love tap from her would have life-altering consequences for any of us. I’d have to make sure everyone here is sufficiently warned.</p>
<p>“I’ll head to the cave later, so let Vester know, too, all right?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir.”</p>
<p>Gabil bowed as he bounded off. Considering the punishment he just endured, he looked in pretty good shape. Maybe the potion was pretty potent, or maybe Gabil was really that tough, or maybe both. Milim gave him a broad, approving nod, waved, then turned to me like nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“Wow, he’s pretty solidly built, huh? Maybe I oughta turn it up a notch next time?”</p>
<p><em>Um, don’t ask me</em>, I pleaded from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>“Hey, um, you know you can’t start punching people just because you’re mad, okay?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? It’s his fault for angering me. Plus, like I said, that’s just a form of greeting!”</p>
<p><em>No, Milim. No, it’s not.</em></p>
<p>“Well, I’m not gonna let you greet people with a boxing match, all right? No more of that!”</p>
<p>“No? But I gotta show people a little force to start out, or else they’ll think I’m a pushover…”</p>
<p>“I <em>said</em>, you can’t! I’ll tell everyone in town to treat you with respect, all right?”</p>
<p>“You will? Well, great. I’ll leave that to you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, thanks. Just chill for now, okay?”</p>
<p>That was about all I could warn her about at the moment. I had a feeling I’d need to gradually teach Milim some common sense over the next little while. It felt like the demon lord had a couple different triggers that enraged her—I’d just have to pray that Gabil was her first, and last, victim.</p>
<p class="space-break">We continued our journey across town. It was almost dinnertime, when most people would wrap up their work and gather around outdoors, and I figured it was high time to introduce her.</p>
<p>Soei had been nice enough to spread the word around town about our little tyrant, but it was probably safest to show her around and make sure everybody knew exactly what she looked like. I really doubted anyone was stupid enough to try to make a pass at her, but it paid to be doubly sure.</p>
<p>I sent out the announcement for everyone to gather at the main square. They slowly filed in after finishing work, and once the square was filled up, I hopped up on the podium.</p>
<p>“Umm, so starting today, we’ll have a new friend living with all of us. We’ll be treating her as an honored guest, so I’d like you all to treat her politely for me. She’s also promised to follow all the town rules, so if you see her violating any, please let me know.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t willing to let a ton of things slide just because she was a demon lord…but given her violent force, figuring out how to lay down the law was a thorny question. I did make her promise to play nice to the general public, and she seemed confident that she’d stick to that.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you worrying too much?” she said. “I always keep my promises!”</p>
<p>I had my concerns about that, but I couldn’t just sit here and doubt her every move. I decided to trust in her.</p>
<p>Next, Milim took the podium.</p>
<p>“I’m Milim Nava,” she told the crowd, “and starting today, I’ll be living in this city. It’s good to meetcha!”</p>
<p><em>Um, wait. What did she just say?!</em></p>
<p>“Whoa, hang on. What do you mean, you’ll be living here?”</p>
<p>“Um, that’s exactly what I mean. I’ve decided to live here, too.”</p>
<p>“Wait, wait, wait. Don’t you already have someplace to live? Aren’t there people you have to worry about over there?”</p>
<p>“Oh, they’ll be fine. I’ll just go home every now and then, and it’ll be no prob!”</p>
<p><em>It’s a huge prob to me, you idiot!</em> I had to mentally keep myself from screaming my thoughts at her. Well, whatever. She was a pretty flighty girl. Once she got bored of us, I was sure she’d be outta here.</p>
<p>“Well, you heard her, so treat her well,” I said, defeatedly addressing the crowd.</p>
<p>Milim was free to do as she pleased, and the residents generally seemed positive about the news—“What?! Lady Milim, the demon lord?!” “My stars, I’ve never seen her royal countenance in person before!” “Well done, Sir Rimuru! Striking such cordial relations with that tyrant!” “Ahh, it’ll be peaceful days for Tempest now!” And so on.</p>
<p>The name of a demon lord had a lot of cachet around here, Milim’s in particular. Nobody accused her of being a fake, either—with my good word to back her, there was no room for doubt.</p>
<p>“So just to make sure we’re clear, starting today… Well, Milim’s one of us. If she runs into any problems, I want you all to help her out.”</p>
<p>“Yes! Rimuru and I are friends now, so if something comes up, I’m your girl!”</p>
<p>I didn’t expect Milim to require help from any of us. If anything, we’d take the brunt of whatever drama she conjured up. That was what I meant from the statement, but that didn’t register with the demon lord. She took it straight, and I couldn’t deny her.</p>
<p>Still…</p>
<p>“Friends, huh…?”</p>
<p>Was that really all right? Befriending a demon lord and all? I mean, in the short time we’d known each other, Milim seemed nice enough and all, but…</p>
<p>The girl herself, perhaps picking up on my whisper, began to blush. “Yeah,” she said, “‘friends’ does sound kind of odd. Uhmm… Maybe not friends, so much as BFFs!”</p>
<p><em>Um… BFFs? Milim, when did I give any indication that we were BFFs?</em></p>
<p>“Er, BFFs?” I hesitantly asked.</p>
<p>“Huh? Aren’t we?!”</p>
<p>I could see the tears welling in Milim’s eyes already…but if anything, the hostile force in her already-balled fists came even more quickly. <em>Crap!</em></p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee! Kidding, kidding! BFFs forever, man!”</p>
<p>I quickly corrected myself. Now <em>there’s</em> a mine I almost planted my foot on. I was not gonna go down the same road as Gabil.</p>
<p>“Right? Totally! You sure are good at scaring people!” Milim beamed at me, indicating I had made the right call.</p>
<p><em>Too easy.</em> Too easy, but still a tough one to handle. No letting my guard down any longer. This had been a real lesson for me. The land of Tempest had a new resident, and she was more dangerous than a warehouse full of powder kegs.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">With her introduction over, we filed into the dining hall. Food was on the way, and today’s main dish was curry.</p>
<p>To be honest, it was a dish that did its best to simulate curry. We had discovered a grass that resembled wild rice well enough, and we were in the midst of improving upon it right now. It wasn’t very nutritious at the moment, and it certainly didn’t taste great, but curry’s great at covering up stuff like that, so the results turned out pretty well. I had Shuna’s culinary gifts to thank for that. If we could figure out how to grow some honest-to-goodness white rice, I think it’d be a classic, but either way, this worked, too. We also had some ersatz Indian-style naan bread, so you could choose that instead.</p>
<p>Cooking in this town was the result of a long trial-and-error process. We had a stockpile of recipes at this point, but without any sugar, recreating the dishes I knew on Earth was a challenge. I had monsters scouring the forest for anything that resembled sugarcane. There might be plants with sugar stored in the roots, like sugar beets or whatnot, so I’d been asking our patrols to come back with as many different types of plants as they could. A sample was all I needed to run Analyze and Assess, figure out what was inside, and—over time—extract real sugar from it.</p>
<p>Milim certainly enjoyed the meal. I figured she had pretty childish tastes in food, too, so I asked Shuna to put some extra fruit juice in her curry to make it sweeter. Judging by the way she tore through her helping, I guess I made the right choice.</p>
<p>“Wowwww!! I haven’t eaten anything this good in <em>suuuch</em> a long time!”</p>
<p>Shuna smiled as she doled out a second serving. It was a darling little scene. One that was ruined by the bombshell Shion had for me.</p>
<p>“By the way, Sir Rimuru, I had been wondering—what was that present you gave to Lady Milim outside of town?”</p>
<p>Erk.</p>
<p><em>Aw, geez, Shion, why’d you have to bring that up all of a sudden?</em></p>
<p>“No! You can’t have any! That jar’s mine!”</p>
<p>Milim immediately tucked her jar of honey drops out of view. Sheesh. She could’ve just tossed it into Spatial Storage, but <em>noooo</em>.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t worry, Lady Milim. Nobody’s thinking about taking your things at all,” Shuna said, smiling.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, I’d hope not.</em> Nobody was suicidal enough in town to try it. And the moment she realized her honey wasn’t in danger, she grinned and resumed her meal—so completely defenseless, one would begin to wonder how demon lord-ly she really was, if at all.</p>
<p>Though Milim wasn’t really the problem. The problem was that people now knew about my secret honey stash.</p>
<p>“You know,” Shuna continued, “I have been noticing a rather fragrant scent around here lately. I had thought it belonged to you, Lady Milim, but was that what Sir Rimuru gave you, perhaps—”</p>
<p>Crap. I did <em>not</em> like her leading the witness like that. This was bad. Soei had his head turned aside, pretending not to be involved, but Benimaru was already giving all of us a curious look. There were six of us seated at the table: Benimaru, Soei, Milim, Shuna, Shion, and me. Shuna was the only one not there for my confrontation with Milim, so I couldn’t explain my way out of it.</p>
<p>Ah, such was my fate, I guess. I was hoping to keep it under wraps until we could figure out how to mass-produce it, but oh well. I took out some honey from my pocket and filled a nearby cup with it.</p>
<p>“Okay, well, this stuff is called honey. I got this as a substitute for sugar, but I can’t make very much of it yet, so I can’t give you all a supply.”</p>
<p>I directed them all to scoop some up with their fingers and give it a try.</p>
<p>“““Ah…?!”””</p>
<p>The looks on the two females’ faces were of abject shock. Soei just raised a single eyebrow, but Benimaru was already looking at me expectantly, hoping for more. Milim, of course, scooped up a bit herself, not that I invited her to. <em>You already have your own, you greedy brat!</em></p>
<p>“So as you see, the honey tastes extremely sweet, but it also has a medicinal effect. In fact, it can cure almost any disease, but sometimes there can also be poison mixed in, so you need to be very careful extracting it. That’s not a problem if I’m doing it, but still.”</p>
<p>“And you think we can make a larger amount?”</p>
<p>“Not right now, no. I can produce maybe a single cup of this a week.” If I pushed Apito hard enough, we <em>might</em> be able to up that to three cups, but there was no pressing need to, so I let it slide. “I want to conduct more research into its makeup to evaluate it as a medicine, so there’s not a lot to spare for eating quite yet.”</p>
<p>This wasn’t a lie. My Analyze and Assess skill told me that this was a special-grade panacea. The rarity of the plants we extracted it from no doubt meant it had all kinds of astonishing benefits.</p>
<p>“Yes. The nectar we harvested from giant honeybee hives simply doesn’t compare to this. As a sweetener, it was fairly disappointing.”</p>
<p>Shion nodded. She was always a font of information about stuff like that, even if it didn’t directly connect to cooking. And she was right—giant honeybee nectar was more poisonous than sugary, making it ill-suited for food. I figured I could analyze it and extract something decent from it, but taming giant honeybees sounded like pretty tricky business to me anyway.</p>
<p>“If we could prepare a suitable garden for them and let that be their territory, I think we could get some pretty decent honey from them, though.”</p>
<p>“You think?” Shion said, finally seeing things my way.</p>
<p>“You said this could be a substitute for sugar,” Shuna asked, clearly curious. “Is sugar itself really this sweet?”</p>
<p>I could see Milim’s and Shion’s ears perk up at the question.</p>
<p>“It sure is. There’s no medicinal value, but it’s so sweet that people get literally addicted to it. You can use it in food, in drinks; all kinds of areas. We’ll be able to craft a great deal more food than before, once we have it,” I explained.</p>
<p>“Ah… I see. In that case, I will have us devote all our efforts to discovering this sugar, starting tomorrow. Shion…”</p>
<p>“Yes, Shuna. I promise you, I will stake my life on discovering this sweet plant for us all!”</p>
<p>“Yes! Very good!”</p>
<p>The three women gave one another firm nods. I wanted to ask why they’d stake their lives on this (and since when were they all best friends, too?), but it was fine for now. I took a final lick or two of the remaining honey, already assured that real sugar would be ours sooner than ever now.</p>
<p class="space-break">With dinner wrapped up, I directed them all to the bath, my crowning achievement. The tub, made with the finest dwarven marble out there, was filled day and night to the brim with hot-spring water, ready to be used at any time.</p>
<p>Milim had joined us, meekly following along behind Shuna and Shion. Normally, I’d nonchalantly hop in the bath with them all in slime form, but that definitely didn’t feel right today. She’d be happier alone with the other females, and besides, I would need to discuss things with the ogres whenever Milim wasn’t around.</p>
<p>So I moved on to our meeting hall and gave a rundown of the day’s events to the people assembled there. “My goodness… I hardly know what to say. I never expected a demon lord to visit here on her own volition,” Rigurd said, shaking his head.</p>
<p>I could understand his position. I had never pictured this happening, myself.</p>
<p>“Well, I think it’ll be all right, though,” I said. “She’s promised not to start any fights in here, at least. Not without my permission.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t exactly confident about that, but I had little choice but to trust her on that count.</p>
<p>“Perhaps…but shouldn’t we be more worried about how the other demon lords will react?” Kaijin spoke up.</p>
<p>Hakuro and Benimaru nodded at this.</p>
<p>“How do you mean?” I honestly asked.</p>
<p>“Well, there are multiple demon lords out there, and they all work under a convoluted system of checks and balances. You and Lady Milim just declared each other allies out in the public square, and that basically means this town’s under the protection of Milim the demon lord. And normally, I suppose, that would be incredibly desirable, but…”</p>
<p>“…Sir Rimuru, you are leader of the Great Forest of Jura Alliance and ruler of the Jura-Tempest Federation,” Hakuro interjected. “I suppose the actions of today would seem, in the eyes of the other demon lords, to mean that the Forest of Jura has forged an alliance with Milim herself.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Benimaru added. “It means that Milim, who hardly has any subjects of her own, suddenly has a much larger force backing her up. It shakes the foundation of the current power balance among the demon lords. One wrong move, I fear, and the entire forest could become subject to a major war.”</p>
<p><em>Hmm. Yes, I will admit to not thinking too deeply about it, but I suppose my decisions could wind up affecting the whole forest, huh? But… I mean…</em></p>
<p>“Practically speaking, though, none of us could stop Lady Milim if we wanted to, could we?”</p>
<p>Rigurd offered his opinion, and he was right. Even all of us at once would never have a chance. It left us with nothing but the most passive of approaches—waiting for her to grow bored and leave.</p>
<p>“To be frank,” Benimaru said, “her strength is on a totally different dimension from any of us. There is no point even debating whether we could beat her or not. None of us would be alive now were it not for Sir Rimuru’s quick thinking.”</p>
<p>“…Exactly. If other demon lords oppose her, I honestly like our chances against them more than her. Milim the demon lord is a walking catastrophe.”</p>
<p>Soei nodded at his compatriot’s honest feelings.</p>
<p>That largely settled it. There was nothing else to be done, and that was that. So how to handle Milim in the meantime…?</p>
<p>“In that case, I vote that we should leave the day-to-day handling of Lady Milim to her…ah, BFF, Sir Rimuru. All in agreement?”</p>
<p>“““Aye!!”””</p>
<p>Wha?! <em>Dammit, Benimaru!</em> But by the time I had the thought, I was too late. I was used to tossing the ball to someone else most of the time—this time, they did the same to me.</p>
<p>“Besides,” Hakuro said, “Lady Milim is one of the oldest and strongest of demon lords. A lord that we absolutely must not be hostile toward, one could say. For this issue, at least, I see little we can do besides let Sir Rimuru handle it.”</p>
<p><em>Way to drive the stake in like that.</em> I didn’t think she was <em>that</em> dangerous, but so be it. I sighed. Nobody else seemed to know how to curry Milim’s favor, and since I was apparently a genius at handling children, I suppose it was up to me to help out. We now had a silent, but steadfast, agreement that the demon lord Milim was <em>my</em> problem.</p>
<p class="space-break">Milim was already looking drowsy by the time she left the bath. Apparently, she was beside herself with excitement—few baths large enough to swim in existed in this world, so I couldn’t blame her. Most people had to make do with quick dips in cold water, and even nobility had to be content with hot water in cramped little tubs, I was told. Assuming you lived in a rich enough nation to have dedicated baths at all, which wasn’t always the case.</p>
<p>I was admittedly kind of picky about having this bath. Selfish of me, I know, but it had turned into a lovely facility. If people liked using it, I couldn’t be happier.</p>
<p>I asked Shuna to lead Milim to a guest bedroom and put her to sleep. There weren’t any Western-style beds here, just pseudo-tatami mats and futon mattresses on the floor. I worried that she’d have some complaints about that, but it wound up not being an issue. She immediately fell asleep, looking snug as a bug.</p>
<p>It was the demon lord’s first day and night in Tempest, and by and large, it could have turned out a lot worse. Of course, the whirlwind she was kicking up had only just begun.</p>

<p class="tx1">We were busy as bees the next morning.</p>
<p>First, waking up Milim at sunrise wasn’t easy… “Why does a demon lord have to wake up early?!” she grumbled.</p>
<p>We managed to get her up and dressed. Her current outfit was just too exposed, so we prepared some other clothes for her the previous evening—just a quick outfit built from whatever we had around, but she was pretty enough that she looked just fine wearing anything.</p>
<p>“This is hard to move in.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Well, it looks nice. Isn’t that better for you?”</p>
<p>I made a decent attempt to mollify her, and her mood instantly improved. No complaints there. Children can be so simple like that sometimes.</p>
<p>Next up was breakfast. Something resembling bread, fruit jam, and milk—chilled cowdeer milk. I had been telling people about how good cow’s milk was, and this was close enough. That, plus some hot vegetable soup.</p>
<p>The jam used fruit that had been boiled, cooled, and then sealed in chilled jars. It used no additional sugar, and I wasn’t wholly sure what kind of fruit it was, but it was Shuna’s homemade recipe and quite a bit sweeter than I expected. It was more sour than sweet to my palate, but in a world so lacking in sugary food, this was still a rare luxury. Most people in town just had bread and the remaining vegetable soup for breakfast, so the jam was more reserved for honored guests, so to speak.</p>
