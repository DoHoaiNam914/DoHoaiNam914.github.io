<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter022">CAPITAL IN TURMOIL</a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page-201"></a>The darkness in the imperial capital ran deep and black. Advances in science had given the city natural gas-powered streetlights to illuminate its streets, but even so, there were still many back alleys hidden from the public eye. The city was still developing, but it would be quite a while before all the darkness inside was eradicated.</p>
<p>Now Misha was quietly walking in the dark where she was born and raised, and here, it gave her mind comfort instead of fear. That’s just how she was.</p>
<p>In the days since she finished her report to Yuuki, Misha had kept hidden in the shadows, busily preparing for the upcoming coup. The imperial army was currently out on an invasion; it’d be dangerous for an officer like Misha to be seen in public. Desertion was punishable by death—and also described what she was doing pretty well at the moment. But she strode on with confidence, not a hint of fear on her face. It made evident just how confident she was in her knowledge of the city’s darkness.</p>
<p>Besides, despite her preference for staying behind the scenes, Misha was an excellent fighter—not as good as Vega or Damrada but certainly a talented boss all the same. She was an expert at intel gathering, priding herself at outclassing Dwargon’s and Blumund’s agents. That was why she felt sure she could hide from the Imperial <a id="page-202"></a>Intelligence Bureau, and she had stayed alive in the capital well enough up to now.</p>
<p>Now she was heading for her usual destination… But tonight, that seemed to be a mistake. She hadn’t been careless at all, but nonetheless, a man appeared to block her way.</p>
<p>His name was Tatsuya Kondo, the “figure stalking the halls of information” in the IIB. Damrada hadn’t confirmed it with her, but he was also likely the commander of the Imperial Guardians. At the very least, there was no doubt that Misha could ever hope to beat him one-on-one.</p>
<p>“Where are you going this time of night?” Kondo asked, his cold voice particularly resonant.</p>
<p>Misha smiled, even as she internally chided herself. “Oh, it’s you, Lieutenant Kondo! Are you working late tonight?”</p>
<p>Despite any misgivings, she acted perfectly serene with him. But for her, the situation couldn’t get much worse right now.</p>
<p><em>I can’t believe he sniffed me out in this remote nook of such a vast city… What a monster. No way could I beat him, either. And my escorts won’t even buy any time for me.</em></p>
<p>Kondo had appeared without warning, but he seemed to be alone. That didn’t give Misha much optimism. She searched for a way, any way, to get out.</p>
<p>“You’re Misha, aren’t you? Staff officer for Commander Caligulio? Why are you back in the capital during a wartime operation?”</p>
<p>His tone was dead serious.</p>
<p>“It was so scary, Lieutenant Kondo! I was actually asked by Lord Caligulio to go on a secret mission back to the capital.”</p>
<p>She had to deceive him somehow. At the same time, she searched her surroundings for other people, keeping her guard up. There was no one else in this cramped alleyway, which was fine, but her bodyguards had apparently disappeared on her.</p>
<p><em>Did they already take care of them? How outclassed are we anyway? I didn’t even notice a fight…</em></p>
<p>In an instant, Misha gauged the situation. They did not know each other personally, but there was no way Kondo wasn’t aware of Misha. She didn’t know how he saw her, but it didn’t seem like <a id="page-203"></a>words alone would get her through this. Her guards were dispatched without a moment’s hesitation. Deception, she assumed, was out of the question.</p>
<p>So she decided to ask for help from Damrada, whom she was planning to meet up ahead. But then an unpleasant thought entered her mind.</p>
<p><em>How did they find out where I was? Sir Yuuki decided to trust Damrada… But can I do the same?</em></p>
<p>It was Damrada who arranged this meeting place for them; they were supposed to work out the details of the top secret conference they’d have with the demon lord Rimuru tomorrow.</p>
<p><em>Not good… Not good at all. There’s a chance Damrada double-crossed us…as much as I hate to think it. Sir Yuuki trusts him, and besides, I owe Damrada as well.</em></p>
<p>Misha and Damrada had known each other for over twenty years. They were both leaders of Cerberus, and she felt she knew more about him than even Yuuki. That’s why this was all so confusing for her. He knew Damrada to be coldhearted—rational. Based on what he told her, he had no apparent reason to stab Misha in the back. She not only wanted to believe that—after listening to Yuuki explain matters, she was convinced of it. So now wasn’t the time for hesitation. She had to believe in her friends until the end.</p>
<p>So her mind made up, Misha looked at Kondo.</p>
<p>“My gratitude goes out to the great Emperor Ludora for the good fortune of meeting you here.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“It was you, Lieutenant, wasn’t it? The guy who took out my pursuers? I knew I wouldn’t be able to take on that many opponents by myself.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Proceeding with that script, then?”</p>
<p>“Oh, are you suspicious of me? Even after I’ve been desperately trying to get back from that hellhole to bring you my information at all costs?”</p>
<p>Misha boldly continued the performance, approaching Kondo and sidling up to his chest. This was Misha the Lover’s specialty—using her feminine charms to ensnare unwitting men. It was <a id="page-204"></a>powered by a combination of Curse Perfume and the illusory magic Charm, and it worked on the mind of the target, stimulating their base instincts while inhibiting their thought processes in order to make them fall in love with her. Their dependence on Misha would grow further if she was closer to them—physically and emotionally. Once she had it all in place, she’d have as much control over the target as she wanted.</p>
<p>She was using this on Caligulio as well; by her estimation, a few more embraces, and he’d be hers for the taking. And not just Caligulio, either—a litany of men had fallen for her wiles. As far as she knew, it had never failed before. It was the most powerful card she had to play, because even if she never had a chance in battle, she was sure any opponent would succumb to lust for her.</p>
<p>So Misha placed her supple hands around Kondo’s back, pushing her ample breasts against him. Then she gauged his reaction. She could sense him slackening a little. She giggled.</p>
<p><em>Hee-hee! Good. He pretends to be this stuck-up bastard, but even Kondo’s still a man, huh?</em></p>
<p>This was going better than she anticipated. Maybe this would work out, after all.</p>
<p>“Hey, why don’t we go someplace else, huh? A room where we can relax, maybe.”</p>
<p>She whispered the words, her lips close to his ear. Kondo’s right hand moved a bit. “Very well,” she could hear him whisper back.</p>
<p><em>This is going well. My best bet is to meet up with Damrada at our rendezvous point. Even if that doesn’t work out, I can have Kondo sleep with me, and then he’ll become my captive—</em></p>
<p>It was the last thought Misha would ever have. With a dry <em>bang</em>, Misha collapsed to the ground, the left side of her head bleeding profusely all over the street.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, Kondo had produced a Nambu semiautomatic handgun. The smoke rising from the muzzle made it clear this was the murder weapon that had shot Misha in the temple. He put it away, expression frozen, as if nothing untoward had happened.</p>
<p>His unique skill Decipherer, which read the thoughts of anyone <a id="page-205"></a>he came in contact with, had already collected all relevant information. Misha’s objective, Yuuki’s plans, the fate of the imperial troops staging the invasion—it took him less than a second to read all that. But despite the devastating truths just revealed to him, Kondo’s face remained frozen. Instead, looking almost bored, he spoke into the darkness.</p>
<p>“…A coup? What a deranged idea. And yet you claim you’re not betraying His Majesty?”</p>
<p>From the darkness, where nobody should have been, emerged a lone man. Instead of answering Kondo’s question, he walked up to the crumpled figure of Misha. It was Damrada.</p>
<p>“Kondo, you didn’t have to kill her, did you? With the right education, she could have been of great help to His Majesty.”</p>
<p>“No, there was no chance of that. Apply a ranking to her skills, and she would be lucky to reach thirty-seven or so. She might have had a chance if she could reach the teens, at least, but no woman of her caliber could ever serve His Majesty. Besides,” Kondo coldly spat, “I was completely exposed, and she couldn’t penetrate my defenses.”</p>
<p>Damrada shrugged. If Kondo said so, he must have been right. There was no point arguing. All he had were mixed feelings over the fate of Misha, one of his friends.</p>
<p>He kneeled next to her, holding out his left hand to the left side of her head. A soft light closed the wound. He pushed Misha’s protruding eyeball back into its socket, pulling both eyelids down. Finally, he wiped her face clean, trying his best to restore at least some of her beauty. He couldn’t bring the dead back to life, but at least he wanted her to rest in peace.</p>
<p>“Why waste your time? Leave her, and the body will be disposed of before sunrise,” said Kondo. “Just answer my questions, please.”</p>
<p>“I can’t put my emotions aside the way you can.”</p>
<p>“You’re too soft.”</p>
<p>“<em>You’re</em> just crazy. How can you act so thoroughly emotionless at such a young age?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have any emotions. End of story.”</p>
<p>“That’s ridiculous—”</p>
<p><a id="page-206"></a>“I have seen hell in my time. It was Emperor Ludora who saved me from that hell. If you’re switching sides on me, you won’t receive any mercy.”</p>
<p>“I am ever His Majesty’s faithful servant. I could never betray him.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see about that. Remember, you’re under my spell at the moment. If you want me to trust you, better prove it by your actions.”</p>
<p>Then Kondo walked away, never looking back. Damrada took one final glance at Misha, then left the scene himself. Nights lasted a long time in the imperial capital. There was still work left to be done.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Not long after, agents from the Intelligence Bureau disposed of Misha’s body, leaving not a trace behind. The darkness of the capital’s nights was so deep it could bury even these events, as if they had never happened at all.</p>

<p class="tx1">Upon receiving Yuuki’s instructions, Kagali immediately went on the move. If they were going to carry out this coup, careful preparation was absolutely essential. Messengers were instantly dispatched, and within a few days, all the major players from around the world were gathered in one place.</p>
<p>Nearly thirty of them were now at Yuuki’s mansion in the imperial capital, faithful agents who all swore absolute loyalty to the man. Some, like Vega, were embedded in other imperial corps and couldn’t participate; the people here composed around half of Yuuki’s executive staff. The coup itself had been in the works for some time, and the attendees were all eagerly awaiting Yuuki’s speech, feeling that the time was near.</p>
<p>They were all quite capable, climbing the ranks on their own strengths and making names for themselves in the military. Their loyalty to Emperor Ludora was nonexistent from the start. Some were even excited at the concept of engineering an Empire-wide revolution. There were visitors from other worlds, halflings with strange and unusual skills, superhumans subjected to cruel <a id="page-207"></a>body-enhancement experiments, and first-rate adventurers raised by Yuuki himself. There were even enslaved warriors collected by Damrada, as well as magic-born under Misha’s protection.</p>
<p>What they were faithful to the most was violence—and that’s exactly where the Composite Division shone the most.</p>
<p class="space-break1">A large meeting room was opened to them all, located upstairs above the grand atrium floor. Yuuki came in with Kagali just as everyone took their seats.</p>
<p>“Hey there, guys. Great to see you all here.”</p>
<p>He was all smiles, speaking in his usual cheerful tone as he greeted them.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow, I have a meeting planned with the demon lord Rimuru. I’m having Misha bring over Damrada as well, so we’ll discuss more details once he arrives.”</p>
<p>This instantly caused an uproar.</p>
<p>“Weren’t we staging this coup by ourselves?”</p>
<p>“The demon lord is too cunning and unpredictable. Are you sure we can trust him?”</p>
<p>“No, wait. Aren’t we at war right now? Rimuru can’t just slip out of that and slink over here.”</p>
<p>Voices shouted out from across the hall. Yuuki’s smile just broadened.</p>
<p>“The imperial army has been annihilated, you know. Rimuru killed all nine hundred and forty thousand troops who invaded the forest.”</p>
<p>“That’s insane!”</p>
<p>“It’s too fast. Calculate the travel times, and it’s only been a few days since we engaged them…”</p>
<p>It was far too much for the audience to believe. Yuuki quieted them down with a laugh.</p>
<p>“If we’re going to overthrow the empire, we need fighting power. That’s why I’ve decided to join forces with Rimuru.”</p>
<p>The audience began to understand Yuuki’s words, even if they didn’t agree with them. The more intelligent among them had shifted their attention to whether this intel was reliable or not.</p>
<p><a id="page-208"></a>“Is this information Lady Misha brought back?”</p>
<p>Many Cerberus members were among the group, aware of Misha’s presence in the military.</p>
<p>“You got it. If we hadn’t allied with them beforehand, I think they would’ve killed Misha long ago.”</p>
<p>“Lady Misha did that?!”</p>
<p>“Astounding…”</p>
<p>She may have done mostly undercover work, but she was also a well-known figure, a truly appropriate leader for Cerberus. Everybody in here attained their positions in life through their own efforts alone, so they knew how to assess their peers fairly. They had a lot of trust in Yuuki that way, oddly—they knew he’d never value someone inferior in ability.</p>
<p>“Well…in that case, I welcome this alliance. I’m not too happy about how you kept this to yourself until now, but I’m sure you had your reasons for it, eh, Boss?”</p>
<p>“Not really any major reason, but yeah. It’s just that I lost to Guy, and he made me promise him something.”</p>
<p>“Guy? You don’t mean Guy Crimson, do you?!”</p>
<p>“You fought the Lord of Darkness? That’s way out of line, Boss!”</p>
<p>“Impossible. I’m amazed you survived.”</p>
<p>Now the audience was in an uproar for another reason. Yuuki quieted them down again.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you all have your opinions, but I don’t have time to explain everything. For now, you’ll all gonna have to accept it, and I hope you’ll be patient with me on this. Instead, I’d like to discuss the arrangements we’ll make at tomorrow’s meeting and how we’ll conduct our operations afterward.”</p>
<p>The only official forces remaining in the capital were the IIB and a force of new recruits. The top-ranking IIB personnel were a threat, perhaps, but their rank and filers didn’t really count as a military force. The new recruits formed a vast army, numbering a good hundred thousand, but they had no real skill. They were just fill-ins, not even worth considering in this coup attempt. There were also around twenty thousand guards serving as police, but in terms of their equipment, they were no match for a military. The difference in <a id="page-209"></a>gear was so vast, it’d be like a grown-up taking on a five-year-old. At best, they could stop their coup for a short period of time.</p>
<p>But the most powerful forces of all, the Imperial Guardians, were still at the disposal of the emperor.</p>
<p>“The IIB has Guardians mingled in among them, too. So technically speaking, it’s really only the Guardians who we need to worry about.”</p>
<p>“Right, yes. I’ve run into them in ranking duels before, but the guys up top really do pack a punch.”</p>
<p>“Oh, quit patting yourself on the back. For all we know, there are traitors like us among the Guardians, no?”</p>
<p>“Could be. Me, the only thing I have faith in is power. I’m not going to swear allegiance to some emperor who swaggers around like a fancy lad all the time!”</p>
<p>Scattered laughter broke out. They had allies among the Guardians. Reaffirming that fact just now, everyone realized just how much of an advantage they had.</p>
<p>The joke was told by a somewhat small man, known for his arrogant attitude. His name was Arius, and he was an otherworlder—not summoned, but a “visitor,” one who made the journey by chance.</p>
<p>“So will the demon lord Rimuru’s forces be ready for this by tomorrow?”</p>
<p>The black-haired girl asking this question was Mai Furuki, a high school teen over in Japan who was then summoned and picked up by Yuuki back when he still led the Free Guild. Thanks to the support Yuuki offered, she held deep, admiring trust for him.</p>
<p>“Good question. If they’re bringing an army, it’ll take a while no matter how fast they are. Not unless they’re flying over— Hey, they ain’t gonna fly into the capital, are they?”</p>
<p>Now a large, muscular man was chiming in—Tornewot, a former slave fighter. If he hadn’t caught Damrada’s attention, he might’ve spent his whole life toiling in the mines until he collapsed. Thrown into the army, Tornewot received an education, something he took intense pride in. Despite his bulky build, he was quite an intelligent man, enough so that he had been appointed a staff officer in the Composite Division.</p>
<p><a id="page-210"></a>“Perhaps, but flight magic consumes spiritual force. That won’t be a problem for a demon lord, maybe, but I don’t know if his rank-and-file monsters can all fly.”</p>
<p>Tornewot’s question was answered by Alia, a petite magic-caster who also wore the heavy armor of a fighter. She was nowhere near as young as she looked—in fact, she was an apprentice of Gadora’s, and she had also undergone body-enhancement surgery, making her a unique figure in this crew.</p>
<p>“I don’t mean <em>that</em>,” Tornewot countered. “Whether the Empire’s main force is away or not, they’ve got a surveillance network covering the skies above the capital. If a large army comes in from the air, they’re gonna get noticed no matter how far away they land.”</p>
<p>Alia’s face reddened a bit. It was a surprisingly accurate observation, and being shown up like this was a tad embarrassing. By magic-caster standards, she was unusually short-tempered and too quick to speak without thinking matters over.</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s important to keep an exchange of ideas going here. Analyzing things from different angles could help us see things differently, after all.”</p>
<p>Yuuki quickly interceded, guiding the chatter back to the main topic.</p>
<p>“Rimuru has contacted me through old man Gadora to say that only a small number of them will be coming tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The contact came through a Gadora-engineered anonymous magical call. Even if the IIB was listening in, it was all encrypted and impossible to decipher. Gadora outlined the main points of it to Yuuki, and according to him, the roster they’d send tomorrow was still undecided. Rimuru was definitely coming… But who would escort him?</p>
<p><em>Sounds like Rimuru’s decided a show of force won’t work on Ludora, too. Quality over quantity, huh? I bet he’ll bring nothing but his top brass over, then.</em></p>
<p>Maybe about ten or so at most, Yuuki reasoned.</p>
<p>“They’re underestimating the Empire that much? Or are they making fools out of their allies?”</p>
<p>The question was lodged by a slender beauty, stretching herself <a id="page-211"></a>out—not a question so much as just stating what was on her mind. This was Orca, a warrior, and she might’ve appeared a bit airheaded at first. Despite that, she was an extraordinary talent with a number of hidden skills.</p>
<p>“Wrong on both counts, Orca. Like I said, it takes a lot of time to ready a large army—delays pop up in so many different ways. I’m sure he decided it was better to work with a small team of elites.”</p>
<p>Tornewot stepped up to explain matters again. Yuuki smiled, glad to be spared the trouble.</p>
<p>“Exactly. That’s why we need to work out our own direction now.”</p>
<p>If Rimuru was only bringing his best fighters, that brought up the question of who would pit themselves against whom.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna ask Rimuru what he thinks at the meeting tomorrow, so we need to put our thoughts together. For example, what are we gonna do with Emperor Ludora?”</p>
<p>It might’ve been pretty arrogant of Yuuki to say that. Defeat wasn’t even on his mind; only victory was in his future. Discussing their treatment of the emperor before the coup had even succeeded was a tad abnormal, after all. But no one pointed this out. Even Tornewot, always ready with a verbal jab, grinned and waited for Yuuki to continue.</p>
<p>“The Dwarven Kingdom is aware of our activities as well, so the currently deployed Composite Division forces are free to head off to the capital without worrying about their rear. If all they have to deal with are the imperial forces left in the capital, it’ll be easy, right?”</p>
<p>“It sounds that way. The Guardians are the only threat?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” responded Yuuki, still smiling. He knew the true threat was elsewhere—an unknown entity known simply as the Marshal. And if you thought about why Guy let Yuuki live in the first place…</p>
<p><em>Why did Rimuru take action this time? He’s a pacifist at heart. I figured he’d hate to attack other countries out of nowhere…</em></p>
<p>Perhaps he just didn’t want to have any regrets. But Yuuki felt that couldn’t be the only reason. So he mentally put the pieces together—and then he saw a hint of Guy’s shadow behind Rimuru <a id="page-212"></a>as well. If that was the case, he concluded, perhaps there was a monster in the Empire that could be a worthy opponent for even Guy.</p>
<p>“Depending on how things work out, we might have to kill the emperor, won’t we?”</p>
<p>“Not so fast, Arius.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, don’t reserve the right for yourself!”</p>
<p>The crowd here was so excited now that they were openly talking about the emperor’s upcoming murder. Yuuki agreed it was too early to discuss his treatment, but he was glad to see everyone so revved up in advance.</p>
<p>In fact, they’d be discussing Ludora’s fate at the meeting tomorrow. Gadora was opposed to killing him, and Damrada’s loyalty was still squarely aimed at the emperor. They were both important collaborators on this, and Yuuki hated to clash with them. Plus, there was a healthy chance this “monster” Guy was so wary of was Ludora himself—and if so, it’d be suicidal for Yuuki to make any careless moves.</p>
<p><em>Let’s wait and see how this turns out</em>, he concluded. <em>No need to put myself in the hot seat for no good reason. I could always have Rimuru take the emperor, too.</em></p>
<p>They’d be saving strategic details for after Damrada’s arrival, but Yuuki already had a draft outline ready for their approval. First, the main part of the Composite Division would overrun and capture the capital. Any Imperial Guardians who got in the way would be taken care of by those present in this room. Yuuki expected big things from them all; they were no less capable than the Guardians themselves. Maybe they couldn’t take the top-ranked ones, but they still had a numerical advantage. If multiple allies swarmed on one, that should make up the difference.</p>
<p>The big guys like Ludora and the Marshal could be left for Rimuru, considering he was kind enough to join their fight and all. That’s what Rimuru was probably aiming to do anyway, so he was sure the demon lord would accept that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, no imperial reinforcements would come from anywhere to defend the capital. Out of their three major armies, the Armored <a id="page-213"></a>Division was destroyed by Rimuru; the rest of the Composite Division would join them once the trend was clear; and the Magical Beast Division was way up in the clouds over distant lands. Even if they found out and rushed over at full speed, it’d all be over by then.</p>
<p>Now that the plan had progressed this far, it was all but a sure bet. Yuuki wasn’t about to hurry matters, but he was sure victory was imminent. Still, he still couldn’t shake the uneasy feeling that he was missing something. What could it be—?</p>
<p>“Pardon my lateness,” boomed a calm voice that echoed across the heated meeting hall. The moment it did, everyone shrank back, as if showered with ice-cold water.</p>
<p>“<em>There</em> you are, Damrada.”</p>
<p>He was finally here.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Today Damrada was dressed in his military uniform, a rarity considering his usual merchant’s disguise. That was when Yuuki began to worry.</p>
<p>“Where’s Misha?”</p>
<p>“She’s dead.”</p>
<p>The hall fell silent. Everyone went on guard, sensing something disturbing. They had all been in many life-threatening situations in their time, so they were sensitive to the signs.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, Damrada?”</p>
<p>“I mean exactly what I said. She was killed by Kondo a moment ago.”</p>
<p>The instant he heard the news, Yuuki felt the lingering uneasiness in his chest explode. That uneasy feeling that he had overlooked something… Now he knew what it was.</p>
<p>He and Damrada hadn’t known each other for long, but their relationship ran deep. They’d shared in countless evil machinations that could never be revealed to the public. It was his assistance that helped Yuuki take down the Echidna Club, once the overlords of organized crime. They then established Cerberus together, with Damrada working tirelessly to build it up.</p>
<p><a id="page-214"></a>That’s what Yuuki thought, but maybe he had it all wrong. In fact, everything was going exactly how the Empire wanted it. Cerberus was built from a core group that Damrada recruited for the purpose. Its mission was to weed out the talented from the incompetent, and its network was spread around the world to find and bring in new potential talent. Protecting lost otherworlders was part of that. And they hadn’t started this just recently—it had been going on for a while, even back when the Echidna Club was dominant.</p>
<p>In a way, didn’t it mean that Yuuki himself was discovered by Damrada in the same manner? He was in the business of scouting strong prospects and bringing them under his wing, and as he worked on that, Damrada discovered Yuuki. If Damrada himself emerged from his undercover position, he’d be too conspicuous, after all. Yuuki was just selected as a charismatic public figure.</p>
<p>He thought he was using Damrada, but it was the other way around. But that didn’t mean Damrada double-crossed him. His loyalty was genuine. Perhaps someone had manipulated Damrada in order to make the ever-suspicious Yuuki trust in him—thinking about it that way, it seemed to answer all the questions he had up to now.</p>
<p>Picking up on all this, Yuuki let out an exhausted sigh.</p>
<p>“Well, you sure put one over on me. So when did this all begin?”</p>
<p>“…? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Damrada sounded indifferent. He used the same tone as always… But now Yuuki was positive something was off. Damrada didn’t seem to be playing dumb; he honestly didn’t understand this question. The man himself, in other words, didn’t even realize he was being manipulated.</p>
<p><em>No wonder, huh? If he didn’t realize it was happening, he wouldn’t know to keep an eye out for it.</em></p>
<p>Yuuki recalled their last meeting. Damrada had insisted he didn’t betray anyone, and Yuuki felt that was the truth. Maybe something had been done to him after that, even. If he could trust his own instincts, it seemed that Damrada’s manipulation happened only recently.</p>
<p><em>Right. I’m the one who decided to trust him, and I’m not going to say <a id="page-215"></a>anything about that now. The important thing is: What does whoever sent Damrada here want from us?</em></p>
<p>Someone was controlling him. That much Yuuki was certain of now, and based on that, he surmised that they were in a very delicate situation. For all he knew, they’d fully surround his mansion in the time it took to deal with Damrada.</p>
<p>Yuuki was lost in thought, Kagali quietly analyzing the situation herself. But the revved-up audience was enraged by Damrada’s behavior.</p>
<p>“How dare you disrespect Sir Yuuki!” Alia shouted, denouncing him.</p>
<p>“Damrada,” Tornewot said, “what are you thinking? Are you here to betray us all?”</p>
<p>“Betray?” Damrada aloofly replied. “What a strange thing to accuse me of. From beginning to end, my allegiance for His Majesty, the Emperor Ludora, has been unwavering.”</p>
<p>“<em>Tch!</em> That’s <em>called</em> betraying us!” Arius spat.</p>
<p>Damrada was notorious for being corrupted by money, a fact that some of his companions looked down upon him for. Some even openly talked behind his back about how he’d surely betray them all for the right price. That’s why the group here was more angered than surprised by this revelation.</p>
<p>Tornewot was the first among them to act, lifting Damrada up by his shirt and shouting at him.</p>
<p>“Quit screwing with us! You found me! You said that I should live for the greater good instead of die in the mines. I was so grateful to you. So why did you do this to me— <em>Nngh?!</em>”</p>
<p>This was actually Tornewot’s attempt to protect Damrada. Before anyone else could act, he wanted to confront his benefactor himself and figure out what was going on. But to Damrada, this was probably unwelcome attention. With a gentle squeeze of Tornewot’s wrist, he flicked his hand back, manipulating his muscle tension to reverse the hold on him.</p>
<p>“Tornewot, do you remember what I said to you?”</p>
<p>His eyes were so cold that they chilled the normally levelheaded Tornewot to the core. “Wh-what?” he replied, grabbing his wrist.</p>
<p><a id="page-216"></a>“I told you to be strong for the greater good, didn’t I? And <em>this</em> power is all you have to show for it?”</p>
<p>All his force converged on a single point. It made Tornewot’s wrist creak…and then shatter, all in an instant.</p>
<p>“You… What did you do to my wrist…?”</p>
<p>With that groan, Tornewot backed away from Damrada, rubbing his wrist as he used one of the healing potions he always kept on hand. Damrada stood there at ease, refraining from a second attack, but there was nothing off guard about him. In a world where some monsters can repair broken bones in an instant, you could never let up until you were sure your opponent was neutralized. A failure to realize this would be lethal.</p>
<p>Yuuki narrowed his eyes toward Damrada. He knew this man was powerful. You didn’t get to rank that high among the Single Digits without being able to outclass a room full of champions like these. The question was: Did he possess an ultimate skill or not? And if so, how good was he at using it?</p>
<p><em>Will my Anti-Skill work on it? That’s the thing.</em></p>
<p>Depending on the answer, he may have to kill Damrada. He needed to know, so he didn’t dare stop anyone from confronting him.</p>
<p>“You’re the emperor’s dog, aren’t you?!” shouted Arius. “I thought you were just a money-grubbing bastard, but you tricked us all! Why would a coward like you just walk in here alone and expose yourself?!”</p>
<p>Then things began to unfold.</p>
<p>“He’s right, Damrada. I owe you a great debt… So I’m going to make your death painless.”</p>
<p>Now Tornewot was ready to challenge him with everything he had.</p>
<p>“Too late.”</p>
<p>But despite Tornewot grabbing the battle mace hanging from his belt and heaving it up with both hands, Damrada had no problem ducking the strike. In a clean, natural movement, he dived toward Tornewot’s chest and gently pushed out the palm of his right hand. Despite the light, airy move, it hit its target with a deep, heavy impact.</p>
