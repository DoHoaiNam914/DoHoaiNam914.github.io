      <h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="toc.xhtml#toc-chapter007">FARAWAY MEMORIES</a></h1>

      <p class="noindent"><a id="page-52"></a><a id="page-53"></a>The first place Velgrynd set foot in was a rift in faraway space. Exactly where, she didn’t know, but she was unbound by the limitations of time, giving her a chance to face up to herself. That enabled her to fully make her ultimate skill, Cthugha, Lord of the Fire God, her own.</p>

      <p>Cthugha included the ability to trace the soul of Ludora. To be exact, it could track down the location of any object its master specified. Using that ability, Velgrynd was able to discover the pieces of her beloved Ludora’s soul, no matter how far away they were—even beyond time and space.</p>

      <p>After that, all she needed was a way to “jump” toward them. This was provided by Dimensional Leap—the complete, full combination of Control Dimensions and Trans-Dimensional Leap, made possible only by the powers of an ultimate skill that far transcended most others of its kind.</p>

      <p>However, not even this skill could calculate the exact coordinates of the destination, making it impossible to leap to the time and place of one’s choice. That took extra targeting—but if one was leaping within the same timeline, that ceased to be an issue. In fact, Dimensional Leap even let the user travel any distance in an instant, making de facto teleportation a reality.</p>

      <p class="space-break"><a id="page-54"></a>So Velgrynd relied on this ability to chase after Ludora.</p>

      <p>The first place she came to was a large landmass on one planet or another, a location where civilization was only beginning to form. Here was the leader of a tribe of dark-skinned people—a man with blond hair, still young. This man housed a piece of Ludora’s soul within him.</p>

      <p>This band of hunter-gatherers had, over time, built a permanent home for themselves in the basin of a large river. Velgrynd didn’t hesitate for one moment to help them, conjuring rain and taming the river in order to create a bountiful land. The people began to practice agriculture, doing away with hunting exclusively. Their food situation vastly improved, letting them feed more mouths than before. Their small settlement grew into a town, one that struck fear into the other villages around them.</p>

      <p>It was inevitable that the blessed would face foreign threats in time. So Velgrynd prepared her next move. She gave them a furnace, one hardy enough to melt metal—a very out-of-place piece of technology in this world. The young man and his tribe jumped straight from stone tools to bronze ware, finding themselves gifted with tools and weapons of iron.</p>

      <p>Swallowing up the nearby villages, the tribe grew until it became a kingdom. The throne was passed down to the king’s son, and then his grandson. Velgrynd stopped directly aiding the kingdom at this point, preferring instead to sit back and nestle up to the person she loved so much. No matter how much she was asked, she never exercised her skills for the kingdom’s sake. Because that was what her beloved wanted.</p>

      <p>“If I were you, I’d make ’em owe me far more than they could ever pay back. But no, I don’t need any more than this. If I retire from the throne, it’ll be far too much power for those fools to handle.”</p>

      <p>“Yes. I understand fully, Ludora.”</p>

      <p>The king’s sons and grandsons had no soul fragments within them, so Velgrynd had no reason to give them aid. She could have done it on a whim anyway, but the king wanted his descendants <a id="page-55"></a>not to be dependent on anyone else, and Velgrynd intended to respect that.</p>

      <p>“Pfft! My name’s ‘Ludora’ again, huh? …Great. As long as you love someone else, well, no wonder you give me the cold shoulder.”</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee-hee. Jealous? That’s so cute.”</p>

      <p>“Ah, shut up. I have this first-rate woman in front of me, too. It’s like being stuck in eternal limbo.”</p>

      <p>Just as he’d said, the man—who’d gone from a tribal chief to the first king of Arcia, a riverside pioneer in civilization—never enjoyed a romantic relationship with Velgrynd, despite treating her as a goddess. Velgrynd was fine with that. Her job, she thought, was to oversee things. All she needed to do was wait for lovers to have children, pass down their bloodlines—and for one of them to have a piece of Ludora’s soul.</p>

      <p>That was how she lived her life.</p>

      <p class="space-break">An age of development evolved into an age of prosperity. Happy times passed all too quickly. The young man grew old, was robbed of his faculties, and soon the day came when he was simply waiting for death to arrive.</p>

      <p><em>“I’ve led a happy life, my goddess. You called me your husband, but have I lived up to the role well enough?”</em></p>

      <p>“Yes, you did. I was happy.”</p>

      <p><em>“Ah. I’m relieved to hear that. May you be eternally blessed.”</em></p>

      <p>Those were the great king’s final words, and then his silent voice handed over his soul to Velgrynd. She had the soul fragment she wanted—but this was a tiny, tiny piece. The journey had only begun, and so Velgrynd took her next leap.</p>

      <p class="space-break">The kingdom continued to swallow up the nations around it, growing into an empire. Those left behind wrote historical records for later generations—and thus, mythology was born. And in the lands of the Holy Arcian Empire, ruled by members of the young man’s bloodline, Velgrynd the fire-wielding creator goddess was worshipped for years and years to come.</p>

      <p class="tx1"><a id="page-56"></a>Velgrynd went through a cycle of encounters and partings. Through them, she came to understand that Veldanava had created more than one world. Many of them, in fact.</p>

      <p>A single world was self-enclosed; there was no such thing as parallel worlds, but there <em>were</em> so-called “other worlds,” residing in alternate dimensions. That much Velgrynd already knew thanks to the otherworlders she had met, but she hadn’t imagined the sheer number of other worlds out there, and their sheer diversity. They could run on completely different laws, or be unbound by the rules of karma.</p>

      <p>Indeed, a wealth of civilizations could intermix in the physical worlds contained within vast spiritual realms. They could look familiar, all magic and swordfighting, or they could be bereft of magicules and locked away from all types of spells. Civilizations could be driven by a thing called science, and some of the less common realms featured human beings transformed into machines. Some worlds were small enough that a fully unleashed True Dragon could wipe them from existence; others were wastelands, fought over constantly by angels and demons with the powers of awakened demon lords.</p>

      <p>Velgrynd traversed all of them—but not by her own free will; rather, she simply took the path she was guided to. They were all at differing levels of civilization (if they had any at all), and she couldn’t conjecture what dimension they were in, or what timeline.</p>

      <p>No parallel worlds overlapped each other in the universe, so there were never duplicates of the same existence within the same timeline. In other words, just because she’d gone somewhere once didn’t mean that she could revisit it at any time. She <em>could</em> produce accurate space-time coordinates for herself within a single given timeline in the dimension she existed in—but that was simply the point where she existed at that moment in time, and not even Cthugha’s Dimensional Leap ability let her make precise jumps.</p>

      <p>As a result, the knowledge Velgrynd possessed consisted of <em>all</em> <a id="page-57"></a>memories of <em>all</em> Ludoras in <em>all</em> worlds. There was a fleet commander serving a galactic empire. In a more magic-oriented world, there was the vizier of a small kingdom. In a magic-less realm, there was a globe-trotting swindler. In a civilized world, there was a scientist living in poverty.</p>

      <p>Velgrynd would often be “called” toward people bearing pieces of Ludora’s soul at a moment when they encountered considerable danger. Only when they were staring death in the face would their soul emit the necessary shine. She wasn’t always on time; sometimes they died as children. These were very sad scenes, but Velgrynd accepted them, chalking them up to fate. (Such tragedies, besides, let her gather the victim’s soul fragment more quickly, so she saw no need to weep for them.)</p>

      <p>Despite this, she never tried to accelerate the march of time with her abilities. Watching over all these disparate Ludoras was how Velgrynd found happiness in life.</p>

      <p>She discovered early on that the bloodlines of these Ludoras didn’t matter much. There was no pattern to their appearance, either; one would have black hair, the next red. But in Velgrynd’s eyes, all of them were Ludora. So she spent untold numbers of years living this way. The number of soul fragments grew and grew, slowly regaining their beautiful whole. Velgrynd could instinctively sense that only a very few remained—either the next one, or the one after that, would be the last. So she kept on leaping, going wherever she was called.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Here was an empire, and after her latest space-time voyage, Velgrynd appeared in an ornate chamber. Silk robes appeared to be the standard clothing in this era—in deep blue hues, which suited her well.</p>

      <p>Now Velgrynd regarded the other man in the room, the empire’s wizened emperor.</p>

      <p>“…Who are you?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-58"></a>The emperor had lost his stamina to old age. He was lying down on a large, magnificent bed, and having this strange woman appear suddenly in their bedchamber would have surprised anyone. The fact he hadn’t screamed in terror indicated that much of his courage, at least, remained intact.</p>

      <p>But Velgrynd paid him little mind.</p>

      <p>“Oh? It’s an old man again, is it? Ah, that brings me back. That look reminds me of that tribal chief.”</p>

      <p>To her, old age didn’t matter. It was just one of the many forms human beings took, an indication of their physical status. So she affectionately reached out to the old man’s cheek, bringing her lips close to his ear.</p>

      <p>“Velgrynd. That is my name. What’s yours?”</p>

      <p>“Hmph. You do not fear me? And your power… Is it divinity?”</p>

      <p>A sword had been thrust against Velgrynd’s throat. She blocked it with a single wispy finger, not bothering to even move her eyes. Not a single drop of blood was shed; the demon-destroying strike was fruitless.</p>

      <p>The attack hadn’t come from the emperor, of course, but one of the guardians attending to him. His name was Gensei Araki, and as the imperial guardian who protected the land from man-eating fiends and evil spirits, he bore a blade with the power to dispel evil. He was the best swordsman of the present age, the current master of the sword style known as Oboro Shinmei-ryu. Still in his early thirties, he had been named guardian of the emperor despite his youth.</p>

      <p>But not even Gensei’s blade could hurt Velgrynd. The reason why might have been obvious, but to Gensei, it was beyond the realm of comprehension.</p>

      <p>“…I never thought my blade would be stopped. Minamoto, guard His Majesty for me.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

      <p>Gensei was speaking to Saburo Minamoto, a man in his early twenties. Much like Gensei, he was guarding the emperor from the shadows. He was a talented student who was third-ranked among Gensei’s pupils.</p>
