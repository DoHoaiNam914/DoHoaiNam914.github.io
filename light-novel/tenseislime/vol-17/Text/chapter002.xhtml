      <h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="toc.xhtml#toc-chapter001">MJÖLLMILE’S AMBITIONS</a></h1>

      <p class="noindent"><a id="page-2"></a><a id="page-3"></a>My name is Mjöllmile, and yes, I’ll freely admit I’ve had more than my fair share of luck in my life. But you know what? The stuff I’ve experienced lately—well, “luck” doesn’t even <em>begin</em> to describe it.</p>

      <p class="space-break">Looking back, I suppose my luck turned unshakable once I accepted Sir Rimuru’s invitation. Sir Rimuru, in so many words, is my boss, but let me tell you, he’s a lot more than just some faceless master I serve. After all, he’s the head of the Jura-Tempest Federation—its king, in other words. A <em>demon lord</em>, to boot. Not joking. I mean it.</p>

      <p>Since the day I met this Sir Rimuru, I’ve instinctively known that he wasn’t one to be trifled with. Even now, I see him as this god (or goddess?)-like figure, and frankly, they say he’s far stronger than I could ever imagine. I mean, think about it. He saved my hide once by defeating a Sky Dragon, a monster powerful enough to destroy entire cities—maybe even overthrow a small nation or two. That alone makes him a hero and someone I owe well near everything, but not long after that, I heard he joined the Octagram. Just about fell out of my chair, I did.</p>

      <p>And that’s hardly all. He’s close friends with Lady Milim, the kind of demon lord you’d hear about in legend—or fairy tales, really—and he even recruited Sir Veldora, one of just four True <a id="page-4"></a>Dragons in the world, to his side. You know, I’m so exhausted from all these surprises that whenever I hear something new about him, it just makes me think <em>oh, neat</em> and that’s all.</p>

      <p>But enough about Sir Rimuru. Let’s get down to business.</p>

      <p>My principal ambition in life was to become a great merchant, one big enough that nobody would dare make light of me. I ran an enterprise in a small nation called Blumund, with another branch in the much larger kingdom of Englesia. I became fairly well known in my field, and just when business was really starting to boom, I received a rather large-scale proposal. Fuze, the guild master serving Blumund, reached out to me, and that was how I wound up meeting Sir Rimuru for the first time. Next thing I knew, the newly crowned demon lord was visiting me—and even inviting me to assume a rather lofty position in his monster kingdom.</p>

      <p class="space-break">In essence, I’m now serving as Tempest’s finance minister. My exact title tends to change pretty often, but the nature of the job doesn’t. Basically, I take all the vast fortunes the kingdom accumulates and transfer ’em over to whatever department needs it, at my discretion.</p>

      <p>Back when I was still a merchant, part of the sales from my multiple businesses would come back to me as remuneration. From that I deducted investment purchases, labor costs, and what have you, and funneled what remained into my operating expenses. That was hard, but what I do now is hard in a different sort of way. The <em>amounts</em> of money I work with, I mean.</p>

      <p>My gross salary once upon a time was a proverbial drop in the bucket—or a drop in the ocean, really. As for what it is now…well, why hide it? It’s fifty gold coins a month, and that’s <em>after</em> taxes. <em>And</em>, lest we forget, that doesn’t even include bonuses, assorted stipends, and the extra credit I get to cover my housing costs. As if <em>that</em> weren’t enough, I also have people from Tempest’s job training center working as maids at my home, so the kingdom’s largely covering maintenance and so forth for that as well. It’s simply an unheard-of deal. In fact, I could hardly contain myself when they offered it to me.</p>

      <p><a id="page-5"></a>Of course, I <em>do</em> still have to take care of the people who joined me from my old home office in Blumund, but most of them are still working under me anyway, so <em>their</em> salaries are covered by the Tempest government as well. The only folks I directly employ around here are Bydd and the guys I hired to watch my house—and twenty gold coins are enough to cover that.</p>

      <p>But that’s not even the <em>real</em> surprise. You see, I’m not a single-income type of person. I have certain <em>other</em> passive income streams, too.</p>

      <p>One is the profit earned from my old trading firm. I’ve been helping Sir Rimuru implement all his wild ideas, starting with the fast-food stalls he suggested for the Founder’s Festival. We’ve been deploying these in Blumund and at the rest stops along the highways, but I’m the general manager of all these new locations. Day-to-day operations are handled by Tempest, but for reasons I don’t understand (though I’m certainly not complaining about it!), they pay me a salary for that as well.</p>

      <p>As Sir Rimuru is fond of saying, <em>“he and I are bound by fate.” “Mollie,”</em> he told me, <em>“when you make money, that fills my coffers as well. Doesn’t it? It’s money you earn, after all, by making my ideas happen, so you deserve to share in the benefits, don’t you think?”</em></p>

      <p>I have his full support, in other words. Plus—I wasn’t aware of this—apparently the contract between us stipulates that Sir Rimuru and I each get an equal share of the profits. By “contract” I don’t mean anything written down on paper, but it sounds like Sir Rimuru is absolutely willing to comply with this agreement.</p>

      <p>So, you see, I have quite a bit of motivation to live up to Sir Rimuru’s expectations, and I do a very good job at it. As a result, I receive a good hundred gold coins per month from all the storefronts I’m involved with. There was a great deal of up-front investment, mind you, so my overall profits aren’t staggeringly high yet, but we’re both certain that they’ll increase going forward.</p>

      <p>Our current locations are expanding their reach, and we’ve also received requests for more branches from all manner of different countries. I’m thinking that we’ll have more variety to the restaurants we offer as well. There are so many dishes, so many types of <a id="page-6"></a>cuisine, that Sir Rimuru has enlisted Gobichi to create for him. I receive the side benefit of getting to sample all these delicacies first, too, and overall it’s an investment opportunity I’m not going to turn down.</p>

      <p>The burger places and ramen shops are all going gangbusters, let me tell you. The hibachi locations are starting to make a name for themselves as well, and we’re working on a concept for something called “ice cream” that I’m rather excited about. We’re also providing all our latest culinary inventions to the inns along the highways, and if these concepts prove to resonate with our audience, I’m sure we’ll be adding even more restaurants.</p>

      <p>Thus, realistically speaking, I think I’m all but guaranteed to see profits commensurate with my investments. At this rate, I’m no longer excited to learn how much I make per year—I’m more <em>terrified</em> to learn the number. You have to keep in mind, after all, that in the space of under a year, I’ve stashed away enough coin to live like a king for the rest of my natural life.</p>

      <p>It’s an absolutely unbeatable business arrangement, and that’s not even all of it. I have another income source, you see, and that lies in that little REG organization I’m a member of.</p>

      <p class="tx1">REG refers to a group consisting of Sir Rimuru, Her Excellency Elmesia of the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion, and me, Gard Mjöllmile. It’s our initials, you see.</p>

      <p>Elmesia, the Heavenly Emperor, is truly a divine being. Nothing at all like me, to be certain. It’s said that if you want to meet with the nobility of the world’s more powerful nations, the waiting list can be several years long. When it comes to royalty, you may never receive an audience, no matter how hard you try. It’s a simple matter of power. Folks say Thalion is as powerful as all the Western Nations combined, and <em>they’ve</em> been supporting Tempest since its founding, so we’ve been able to bask in the glorious light of Emperor Elmesia for a long time now. I’m led to believe that Elmesia is treated as a god in her home country, and considering that Sir <a id="page-7"></a>Rimuru’s made her his drinking partner, one can only guess how mighty a leader <em>he</em> is.</p>

      <p>Why am I part of this little social club of adult beverage enthusiasts? At this point, I honestly can’t remember. But thanks to that, here I am, sitting around with the Heavenly Emperor and even referring to her as “Big Mama” for reasons that, again, I don’t recall.</p>

      <p>So people have come to refer to us as the Three Pranksters and the like, but nobody knows exactly what REG is involved with. It’s the very top among top secrets, so only a select few are allowed to be clued in. Within Tempest, that’s Benimaru, Soei, and no one else—just those two. Soei’s been lending us personnel and support for our projects, so we can’t leave him in the dark about them. Benimaru, on the other hand, came in on Sir Rimuru’s introduction. I can recall the conversation vividly:</p>

      <p><em>“Hey, you’re gonna get married someday, aren’t you?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“I, er, I didn’t have any plans…”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Well, if you wanna prepare for that, you need to save up a little stash, y’know? Like, some spending money you can hide from the wife so you can go out and have fun.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“N-no, my lord, I’m already well compensated—”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Oh, quit acting so dumb! You gotta hide at least your official yearly salary, or else you’ll have a lotta trouble keeping up with all your male friends’ drinking outings!”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Er… I will, sir?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Oh yes. A man needs to be resourceful like that!”</em></p>

      <p>I’m not sure if Sir Rimuru was giving him wholly sound advice, but it wasn’t any of <em>my</em> business, so I didn’t speak up. I just let it slide, wisely concluding that it’d be best to stay out of it. Besides, I knew that Benimaru—who, as our highest-ranking general, is Tempest’s de facto minister of war—earns the same salary I do, and you’d have to be quite the tippler to spend six hundred gold coins a year on your bar tab. But anyway.</p>

      <p>Oddly enough, Sir Rimuru seems rather petrified that Lady Shuna will find out about our REG plans. I’m sure he recruited her brother Benimaru in no small part to stand guard and ensure <a id="page-8"></a>nobody got wise. Either way, though, we have Benimaru helping us out and Soei lending us staff. These employees serve as our people on the ground—executing the plans of REG, our little secret cabal.</p>

      <p>The exact plans came from Sir Rimuru, who honestly had quite an insight. The core of them is to establish a sort of three-way deadlock. We retain full control over REG, this underground group that’s not afraid to get its hands dirty (or bloody)—and at the same time, we also build a couple of “clean” firms that compete in public. If we built a single giant firm, it’d start to rot on the inside over time—and either way, we knew Tempest had already earned itself a lot of enemies. So we decided to divide our activities between two organizations, then have them compete against each other. That energizes the market, and as these two firms compete, they’re also set up to work in tandem as needed. That—hopefully, anyway—will prevent any internal corruption.</p>

      <p>This structure, of course, will take years to fully develop. Sir Rimuru is working on a vast timeline, and I gotta admit, I would have never come up with a thing like that.</p>

      <p>Either way, my job was to put together one of these two public firms. Big Mama, meanwhile, was building her own, mainly comprised of former employees of the Rozzo family over in the kingdom of Doran. This resulted in something called the Western General Trade Company, a group filled with people openly hostile toward Tempest. In order to compete with them, I was forming the Four Nations Trade Alliance, and I needed to get it up and running pretty damn fast.</p>

      <p>As we planned it originally, the FNTA was a parent organization overseeing major movers and shakers in Tempest, Blumund, Farminus, and the Dwarven Kingdom. The merchants I recruited after the Founder’s Festival served as my ground team—we’d starve them of customers, ostracize them from their home nations, rob them of their support staff, and <em>then</em> we’d offer them a helping hand. <em>“Work for me,”</em> I’d tell them, <em>“and I guarantee you’ll keep a roof over your head…”</em> Not many were foolish enough to refuse the offer. How could they? We made sure newspapers around the world reported heavily on us, so we were well known to people—notorious, even. <a id="page-9"></a>Not many decent folk would trust an organization like that, so we positioned ourselves as their last resort, in a way. The journalists did <em>such</em> a good job for us, and it goes without saying that Sir Rimuru and Diablo’s manipulation of them was downright scary.</p>

      <p>Thanks to that, my work went almost laughably well. Some people picked up on what we were attempting, of course—and, really, I bet the majority did, actually—but we’d never recruit anyone useful unless we took this approach. We <em>did</em> pay the salaries we promised everyone, too, so nobody had any right to complain. People’s pride got in the way sometimes, but we could deal with that. Merchants are very opportunistic people, you see, willing to allow just about anything if it means profit. We gave them better positions and salaries if they proved worthy of them, and in time, their complaints dwindled. Before long, they were swearing allegiance to me.</p>

      <p>This group of employees, by the way, also included Bach, my former head clerk. He was faithfully paying off his debt to me as he grew into an excellent manager, so I recruited him for this work in exchange for canceling his balance. He always felt like he owed me, if you will, and already he was working out better than I’d imagined.</p>

      <p>We were finding talented recruits in all sorts of other places. When Fuze explained matters to the king of Blumund, the king promptly gathered his most trusted ministers and set off to train people for the future to come. The Dwarven Kingdom sent us a number of talented bureaucrats as well. As long-lived as they are, one has no chance at a promotion over there unless the person above them leaves. Those sharp enough to spot this opportunity from us were all but lining up to join. That sort of ambition is real important to see, you know.</p>

      <p>I heard the Western General Trade Company that Big Mama was forming had a number of long-lived elves join them as well. We had dwarven staff pitching in for us, but elves would certainly be stiff competition for them.</p>

      <p>Farminus, meanwhile, was an issue. We actually needed to intervene in order to get a branch built there. The Free Guild helped us as well, but I suppose keeping the kingdom stable was their first <a id="page-10"></a>priority. This was all stuff we expected, however, so we were taking a long-term view on that region. That’s why we pitched in for now, hoping that they’d train up their personnel for the future.</p>

      <p>Beyond that, though, we faced a lot of other problems. If we were going to expand into the Western Nations, well, we had nowhere near enough staff for that. REG had been expanding this whole time, crushing other organized crime groups and absorbing them into itself, and I was honestly quite jealous of them. <em>Those</em> sorts of companies could get away with that, but what a company in the public eye needed was talented people you could rely on to get the job done. We’re sending our recruits over to Tempest for education, but I’m afraid it’ll be several years before we see them exercising their full potential.</p>

      <p>Besides, in my business, trust is everything. That’s my philosophy, you see. Leaving important work to someone you don’t know well goes against everything I believe. That, of course, meant we needed to pick and choose our employees carefully—and, as I feared, we faced employee shortages as we expanded into other nations.</p>

      <p>I decided to bring this up with Sir Rimuru.</p>

      <p>“Hmm… That <em>is</em> an issue,” he said. “The ‘staff’ in my country are all monsters, after all. Not all humans will like to see them walkin’ around.”</p>

      <p>“No, they won’t. As talented as many of those monsters are, I’m sure they’ll become more accepted once people work together with them…but I fear now may not be the time to force the issue.”</p>

      <p>“I agree with you there, Mollie. If the monsters they look down on work <em>too</em> well, they’ll become the target of envy next. I can’t have the humans persecuting them. Working too fast here wouldn’t be smart.”</p>

      <p>So we were on the same page there. But what should we do, then? As we pondered this, Sir Rimuru offered a potential solution.</p>

      <p>“Well, so be it. I know someone who can help with this. She <em>seems</em> pretty talented to me anyway.”</p>

      <p>He called in Testarossa, who answered directly to him. Testarossa served as a diplomatic attaché, and an excellent one, too, by the <a id="page-11"></a>sounds of things. I had already been introduced to her, but she was so beautiful, I could barely have a coherent conversation with her.</p>

      <p>I didn’t fare any better <em>this</em> time, either.</p>

      <p>“You called for me, Sir Rimuru?”</p>

      <p>That kind, affectionate smile, on that incredibly pretty face. The aroma wafting around her was so astounding, I was instantly cowed into silence. I just sat there, mouth wide open, as Sir Rimuru and Testarossa began to discuss matters.</p>

      <p>“So, you know, we’re running pretty short on staff.”</p>

      <p>“I see. Perhaps I can help you with that. I could have my own underlings assist you.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, you can? I’d appreciate that, yeah. Keep in mind, this is a secret operation, so don’t tell <em>anyone</em> else about it.”</p>

      <p>“My. A secret between me and you, Sir Rimuru? Then I promise I won’t tell a soul—and neither will my minions. If any one of them leaks it…”</p>

      <p>She let out a low snicker. One look at that grin, and I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that our secret was safe.</p>

      <p>That settled things for the time being. But then Testarossa smiled at me.</p>

      <p>“Sir Gard, I will instruct them to obediently follow any order you give them.”</p>

      <p>Her voice sounded like the trumpets of heaven to me as it made its way through my brain. Testarossa—<em>the</em> Testarossa—was addressing me by name.</p>

      <p>“Thank you very much, then!” I couldn’t help but blurt out. I now had Testarossa’s support, and after that, things proceeded at a scarily fast clip.</p>

      <p class="tx1">In the space of a few months, we had Four Nations Trade Alliance branches in every member nation of the Council. Many of these were quite small, with perhaps ten employees at most, but it would suffice for now.</p>

      <p><a id="page-12"></a>This alone was a great surprise to me, but soon I was greeted by an even more shocking event. It turned out that, somewhere along the line, <em>I</em> of all people had been picked as the FNTA’s director.</p>

      <p>“We are leaving everything to you,” King Gazel told me. “If Rimuru places his trust in you, Mjöllmile, I certainly can as well.”</p>

      <p>Hearing this high praise made even someone like me freeze up in anxiety. But if that was what the king was saying, none of our dwarven bureaucrats would be against it. If they were, they never betrayed it in their work.</p>

      <p>Yohm was just as appreciative. “We’re the ones being helped here,” he said, “and I got no complaints about that so far. So hang in there, okay?” Then he brought his lips to my ear and whispered “Can’t be easy, huh, bein’ wrapped around Rimuru’s finger?” to me.</p>

      <p>“Not for either of us,” I retorted with a grin. “But thanks to that, I couldn’t possibly be having more fun.”</p>

      <p>Yohm smiled back at me, so I can only assume he understood.</p>

      <p>Blumund, meanwhile, was a slog. The people over there might have <em>seemed</em> sensible and open to debate, but my instincts told me that Doram, king of Blumund, was not someone to trifle with. And of course I was right, you know. The negotiations were an exercise in futility.</p>

      <p>“Hoh-hoh-hoh! The director of this trade alliance will likely wield untold power in the future…enough that not even a king could turn their head. If you were to take this position, Mjöllmile, that would put my mind at ease.”</p>

      <p>I’d been expecting the worst, but the way he put it, he was open to a wait-and-see approach.</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! Well, I’m quite honored. In that case, I look forward to—”</p>

      <p>“By the way…”</p>

      <p><em>Here we go!</em> I steeled myself.</p>

      <p>“Our nation is currently training people who will serve in Rimuru’s plans. It seems natural to me that this staff would be guaranteed employment once their training is complete…”</p>

      <p>“Ah yes, of course. I’m sure the plans would never work at all without their cooperation.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-13"></a>“You believe so? That’s quite a relief to hear. I imagine you are aware, then, of the current situation in my kingdom?”</p>

      <p>“The situation, Your Majesty?” I replied, unsure what he was talking about or how I should answer.</p>

      <p>The king maintained a friendly smile as he told me something that sounded utterly preposterous.</p>

      <p>“Let me be blunt, then. Our nation has completely abandoned all agricultural activity. We’ve released all the crops and provisions in our treasury, so our people will have something to subsist on. I would like to ask for some support along those lines, if I may.”</p>

      <p>“What?!”</p>

      <p>I was stunned into silence. But protesting wouldn’t achieve anything.</p>

      <p>“Of—of course, we will do whatever we can, but I’m afraid my current post does not allow me to make such policy decisions…”</p>

      <p>“Ohhh, I’m sure Rimuru would give his permission with a smile. We’re letting him build the World Central Station, the main nexus point for magitrains, in our lands. Given that contribution, I hardly imagine he would simply abandon us.”</p>

      <p><em>That’s crazy!</em></p>

      <p>I wanted to shout at him about how unsound his logic was, but a part of me thought it made sense, too. This king had staked the entire future of his kingdom on Sir Rimuru’s plans. Would it prove to be a foolish mistake, or the work of a wise ruler? Or…isn’t it <em>my</em> job to ensure he’s making the right move? I think it is. If people decide the king erred on this call, it’ll mean Sir Rimuru’s plans have failed.</p>

      <p>We’d been facing severe staff shortages even before this. If the whole population of Blumund was willing to work for us, it’d help us out in all kinds of ways. Really, I had just one answer for him.</p>

      <p>“Ah yes, I’m sure he wouldn’t. You certainly have me there, Your Majesty! In that case, I promise you that I will endeavor to bring Blumund to a state of full employment!”</p>

      <p>“Hoh-hoh-hoh! How reassuring to hear, Mjöllmile! And I hope you’ll continue to let us rely on your good graces going forward. With that in mind, I would like you to call me simply Doram from now on.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-14"></a>Whoa now. <em>This</em> was a surprise. A king wanted a common merchant like me to drop all formalities?</p>

      <p>“Oh, that would be far too untoward of me…”</p>

      <p>I motioned to turn him down, fearing a trap, but:</p>

      <p>“Mjöllmile… Or actually, why don’t I call you Gard instead?”</p>

      <p>“N-no, I’m simply here on behalf of Sir Rimuru. I’m a commoner, you see—”</p>

      <p>“Hoh-hoh-hoh! No need for modesty now. Besides, Gard, given your connections with both Rimuru and Emperor Elmesia, can one <em>truly</em> think you are a mere commoner? Because not even <em>I</em> am fully awarded that luxury with them.”</p>

      <p>The king looked deadly serious. He and Sir Rimuru were acquainted with each other and I knew they got along well enough—but if he was stacked up against the Heavenly Emperor of almighty Thalion, he’d look like the king of an anthill by comparison. It was written all over his face, and I couldn’t deny he was right. I had been turning my eyes away from the truth, perhaps, but Big Mama was truly an invincible juggernaut.</p>

      <p>No, the king of Blumund was undoubtedly trying to form a closer relationship with me here. Referring to me by my first name was an honor, something I certainly appreciated as part of building our ties. But how should I react…? Well, was there any need to hesitate? I mean, the king of Blumund’s last name is, well, Blumund. Besides, we had his son Prince Figaro running the Western General Trade Company. I figured I was safe.</p>

      <p>“All right… King Doram, then.”</p>

      <p>“Hold on, hold on. Let’s refer to each other as equals, why don’t we? You can even call me Dory if you—”</p>

      <p>“N-no, no, I’m afraid that’s simply too off-the-wall! Or dangerous, even!”</p>

      <p>“You think so?”</p>

      <p>“I <em>know</em> so! Phew… But all right. May I at least refer to you as the good Sir Doram?”</p>

      <p>Carefully, I adjusted his title a bit, trying to satisfy his request. If someone saw this as too rude, I’d be deservedly thrown in the dungeon, but I trusted that wasn’t going to happen.</p>

      <p><a id="page-15"></a>But Sir Doram just smiled back at me. “Hee-hee! You’ve made me very happy. Building such a close friendship with someone like you, Gard, who has the demon lord’s ear at all times, makes <em>me</em> feel more powerful than ever before. I look forward to continuing our relationship along these lines!”</p>

      <p>Apparently I was Sir Doram’s friend now. I looked around the throne room, wondering if anyone was going to voice an objection to this. However…although the king had all his dour-faced ministers standing behind him, not one of them made a peep. In fact, they were smiling at me in relief.</p>

      <p>I could only take this to mean that Sir Doram was serious about all of it. He was investing everything he had into the Four Nations Trade Alliance, this multinational organization I was directing—really betting his entire nation on it, and on me. What an unbelievable gamble! Even I would have had trouble making such a momentous decision. Looking at it that way, the king of Blumund was truly one of the world’s boldest figures.</p>

      <p>“Yes indeed, I look forward to building a long, fruitful relationship. And I’ll try to prove to you that I’m not merely coasting on my lord’s good name.”</p>

      <p>With all the respect I could muster, I bowed to Sir Doram.</p>

      <p class="tx1">After our meeting, I had some other practical business to handle in Blumund.</p>

      <p>Veryard, who had lately been promoted from baron to viscount, gave me a briefing on current affairs. The kingdom apparently had a year’s worth of food remaining, and its educational program was progressing well. The more talented students were already being sent across the land so they could contribute early in their careers.</p>

      <p>“Of course, I don’t think I’m delivering shocking news when I say that our nation is gifted in espionage. Our agents are currently deployed in many countries, handling work like price research for us. We’re also training people for the bureaucracy, under the <a id="page-16"></a>philosophy of ‘wise people, bountiful country.’ People young and old are coming together to learn about world affairs and economics.”</p>

      <p>The smile never faded from the viscount’s face as he spoke, but this rather extreme political move he described left me speechless. I hadn’t doubted Sir Doram’s words at all, but I also hadn’t thought they were going <em>this</em> far with it. The king’s subjects sounded just as resolved to this as he was.</p>

      <p>…Ahhh, but I can’t sit here acting shocked forever.</p>

      <p>“Very well, then. In that case, I will go over the current progress of our own plans.”</p>

      <p>No point hiding anything. I went over all the stuff we were up to.</p>

      <p>First, the magitrains. Development was proceeding well with them. We had laid tracks from the terminus in Dwargon through the planned station at Farminus; construction had progressed to a point just a bit before Blumund in the middle. Crops and produce from Farminus were being sent to Dwargon, and there the magitrains’ loads were replaced with industrial goods. These would get sent off to Farminus, which would take what it needed before the remainder moved on to Blumund, which needed to become a great hub for goods in time.</p>

      <p>“Of course. I suppose sanitation and storage for food commodities will become important work in the future, then?”</p>

      <p>“Indeed it will. I’d also want to ask Blumund to work out where necessary goods should go, and who they should be sold to.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, naturally. I am stating as much to the employees we are deploying on the field.”</p>

      <p>Hmm. I had heard Veryard is friends with Fuze, but he’s just as wily at the bargaining table, isn’t he? And come to think of it, Sir Rimuru <em>did</em> tell me to watch for how sharp Veryard is. He certainly was right—Veryard’s not someone I can let my guard down around.</p>

      <p>“Excellent. So what are you doing with the land you’re no longer raising crops on?”</p>

      <p>“We have plans underway for that as well. We’ve already procured the necessary land for World Central Station, which we plan to build near the capital. Most of the land around it will be left empty in all directions so the station can be more easily connected to the highway system.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-17"></a>“Oh?”</p>

      <p>“We also have land on the outskirts of the capital ready to serve as a logistical hub connected to World Central.”</p>

      <p>“You do…?”</p>

      <p>They were so well prepared, I didn’t even know what to say.</p>

      <p>Soon, we were deep into frank negotiations, no longer trying to cow each other into submission. We in Tempest would provide a labor force to build the gigantic World Central Station and open a rail line to Dwargon. The plan was to then build new lines going to Thalion and Englesia. As this was happening, we decided that Blumund would build an array of warehouses on the empty land they had prepared for us. Through this, we could already picture a future where Blumund was a vast, powerful industrial region. This would lead to a rise in land prices, no doubt, so it was vital that we secured the most favorable acreage urgently. Blumund was clearly going to become a trade hub in the future, and I planned to buy the best land possible before then.</p>

      <p>“Now,” I continued, “as for our Four Nations Trade Alliance branch, I’d like to build a new one for us, which would make the current location just a temporary site.”</p>

      <p>“No worries there. We have some prime spots for it.”</p>

      <p>I began to have a bad feeling about this. I tried reading into Veryard’s intentions, but they were all too hidden by his villainous smile to make out.</p>

      <p>“And you’re willing to give us this land?”</p>

      <p>The cost of the land needed for the rails and stations would be shared equally between us going forward. In exchange for the expertise and labor we provided, we wouldn’t be charged anything—something we’d already come to an agreement on. The procurement of land for our branches, I had saved for later, and already I saw dark clouds on the horizon. And I was right.</p>

      <p>“No, no, I’m afraid I can’t offer that. In the kingdom of Blumund, we’ve adopted a new system where all land is the property of the nation, with the king lending it to his people as needed.”</p>

      <p>He got me! That was such a drastic, evil move, not even I would’ve come up with it. I mean, good heavens, how did they even get that <a id="page-18"></a>law passed? Hats off to them for pulling it off. I can’t even <em>imagine</em> how they convinced the nobles to give up their vested interests…</p>

      <p>“And…how much are you charging for the use of this land?”</p>

      <p>“Our current plans call for one silver coin per square meter.”</p>

      <p>It…wasn’t outrageous. It wasn’t <em>cheap</em>, either, but if you wanted to rent land in Englesia, you were looking at three silver per square meter, at least. We’d have to pay a de facto income tax every year on this land, but better to procure it now than later.</p>

      <p>But we had a bigger problem. Profit didn’t matter as much at this point. I was facing the looming threat of Blumund calling all the shots on this rail project. A disaster! Sir Rimuru could be strangely careless about this sort of thing, but Big Mama never gave an inch. I could already picture her frowning at me and saying, “Why’d you let them change their conditions midway, hmm?”</p>

      <p>All would have been fine and dandy as long as we formed a good relationship, but the thing about people is that they come and go. That made it so important to gain permanent rights to the land we wanted. What if they decided to raise the rent on us, not that I thought they would? If the price hike was within reason, we could accept their terms following a discussion, but if they charged something extortionary, it might just turn into a national-level crisis.</p>

      <p>And…well, I’m fully aware all of this is what-if territory. But Big Mama told me to always think about any possibilities that might come up. If we have control of the land, we can reject any unjust demands on their part—but if they have it and don’t bend on their terms, we’d be in trouble. If conflict occurs, well, it’s the landowners who have the upper hand, isn’t it? We’d have to pick up our ball and go home. <em>That’s</em> why I wanted those land rights. If having them wasn’t possible, it’d make it damned hard to spend too extravagantly on that land.</p>

      <p>But as I pondered my next move, Veryard grinned at me.</p>

      <p>“Now, we planned to adjust the rent depending on the economic situation, but Mjöllmile, I happen to have some good news for you!”</p>

      <p><em>Uh-huh…</em></p>

      <p>He was starting to get under my skin.</p>

      <p>“What news is that?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-19"></a>“Oh, it’s very simple. As a symbol of our good relations with your country, the kingdom of Blumund is prepared to offer you some concessions.”</p>

      <p>“Concessions, you say?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. To be precise, regarding the ‘prime spots’ I mentioned, we are willing to negotiate a permanently binding lease agreement that will recognize the land as extraterritorial areas.”</p>

      <p>“You are?!”</p>

      <p>I made my surprise known to him. It was almost too good to be true. And before I could even think about what ulterior motive he might have, Veryard seemed ready to explain it to me.</p>

      <p>“Now, let me just say that there is no catch. His Majesty Doram Blumund made that proposal himself. I was against it, but it was accepted after the other ministers sided with him. The idea has certain pros and cons for us, you see. The obvious minus, of course, is that other nations might look down on us if we sell our land piecemeal like this.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I suppose they might.”</p>

      <p>I was surprised he wasn’t hiding more about this—but I had a pretty good idea about the potential pluses for them, too.</p>

      <p>“As for the benefits—well, we fully expect that Tempest will aggressively invest in us if we commit to this. That, and we decided that Blumund can retain certain advantages through the exact conditions of our lease agreement.”</p>

      <p>“Meaning…?”</p>

      <p>Those “conditions” were what I was worried about.</p>

      <p>“Oh, nothing too intricate. First, we’d like you to hire our citizens as your employees. Second, we’d like you to build the headquarters of the Four Nations Trade Alliance in our nation.”</p>

      <p>Aha. Now it made sense. If we built the FNTA’s main office in Blumund, they’d be more than just a logistical center—they could become the nerve center of the entire world economy. I could even conceive of them taking over Englesia’s current position at the head of the table. Blumund’s stock would skyrocket, really.</p>

      <p>So would the cost of its land, no doubt—if nations around the world built embassies there, the real estate proceeds alone could be <a id="page-20"></a>a potential profit center. That business, unlike the tourism industry, wasn’t as vulnerable to dips and rises in the economy—and even better, it’d create more jobs for the Blumundians. As long as they were serious about casting their lot with the FNTA, it was a bet that could pay off in spades for them. It was honestly impressive to see from Sir Doram. He’s a natural-born gambler, ain’t he? And besides, the idea of Blumund taking center stage in world economics had been part of Sir Rimuru’s concept as well.</p>

      <p>So, having no objections to any of this, I eagerly gave Veryard my agreement.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">Soon enough, after hammering out all the little details, we had a formal treaty in place. It was designed so that both nations retained their own vested interests—the agreement would be void in times of war, and so forth.</p>

      <p>I was fairly happy with this treaty—or I thought I was anyway—but for future reference, I still wanted to hear Veryard’s true feelings on the matter.</p>

      <p>“Now, if I could ask you a question…”</p>

      <p>“Yes?”</p>

      <p>“You see, Viscount Veryard…erm, apparently, you were personally against signing this agreement. May I ask for your own thoughts on this, now that it’s been ratified?”</p>

      <p>The FNTA had received some pretty favorable terms, after all. They’d create some red tape for Blumund as it dealt with other nations. Maybe Veryard wasn’t dead set against this, but I wondered if he wasn’t the greatest fan, either.</p>

      <p>“Oh, you’re asking about that?”</p>

      <p>Veryard paused to think for a moment. Then he stood up, not looking at me, and walked over to a nearby window.</p>

      <p>“…?”</p>

      <p>He coughed as I pondered what he was doing.</p>

      <p>“I am going to talk to myself for a moment, so please ignore me,” he stated gravely. “A noble is a creature that never reveals where <a id="page-21"></a>their feelings truly lie. In fact, showing those feelings could be fatal for them. If a negotiation results in something less than desirable to them, they’ll still bellow and brag about how it went just as planned. Anything else would be a sign of weakness, and weakness can too easily be used against you. So what I want to make clear is that I <em>was</em> against this, past tense. You may interpret that to mean I am now in full agreement as of the moment I signed the treaty.”</p>

      <p>I was a little shocked. <em>This</em> was how he felt? If so, I had a feeling Veryard had been aiming for this result all along. I didn’t think I’d necessarily <em>lost</em> this battle, but it reminded me just how arduous it was to bargain with the nobility.</p>

      <p>“Boy,” I couldn’t help but mumble, “I see I have a long way to go, eh? And here I prided myself on my ability to deal with lofty nobles like you. Now I’m worried that I may lack the nerve to keep serving as head of the FNTA.”</p>

      <p>“No, no, Mjöllmile, you strike me as quite a sly dealer, if I may be blunt enough to say so.”</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! I will gladly accept the compliment.”</p>

      <p>I chuckled a bit—and, much to my surprise, Veryard joined me. In a sincere, <em>human</em> sort of way; that cold exterior from before seemed like a distant memory now. So I couldn’t help but risk taking just one more step.</p>

      <p>“I apologize if this is too forward of me, but I hope you will hear me out,” I began. “Do you have any interest in working for me?”</p>

      <p>The answer would probably be no. I knew that before I asked—but part of me really meant it, too. If someone as talented as Veryard was part of my staff, I couldn’t have asked for a better ally as we expanded into Englesia, which was doubtless going to be an uphill battle.</p>

      <p>“Hmm.”</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! Ahhh, but look at me blurting out nonsense. You can just treat that as a joke—”</p>

      <p>“Well, hold on. That’s actually quite an interesting offer.”</p>

      <p>“Oh?”</p>

      <p>Veryard studied my face. He didn’t seem to be toying with me.</p>

      <p>“You mean that?” I asked.</p>

      <p><a id="page-22"></a>“Yes. You see, I was actually considering a change of employer myself.”</p>

      <p>Veryard went on to give me a rundown of how things were going for Blumund, and what he saw in its future. As he reckoned, “wise people, bountiful country” was a double-edged sword. It’d provide peace and prosperity for the people of Blumund…but it could also weaken the position of the kingdom’s nobility.</p>

      <p>“In Blumund, you see, the nobility do not hold vast parcels of land. In fact, numerically speaking, there are actually very few of us—perhaps one percent out of our population of one million. Of these, a little under two thousand are knights, and their families add eight thousand to the total. Based on that, you can see how only a small handful of nobles are actually involved in politics—fewer than a hundred, in fact. Which is fine for now, but I’m quite sure that our titles will be little more than ceremonial in the not-too-distant future. That is the direction His Majesty has indicated in his plans.”</p>

      <p>Hmm. I see. Even a small nobility can still throw their weight around in a country of Blumund’s scope. But how could the nation so drastically reform itself while retaining the nobility’s interests? I’m sure there was at least <em>some</em> backlash—but here they were, reinventing themselves.</p>

      <p>“And are you…personally against any of that, Viscount?”</p>

      <p>“No, I’m not. To me, earning a profit matters more.” He grinned at me. “I <em>do</em> think, however, that I need to find other work before I wind up unemployed.”</p>

      <p>That smile told me the whole story. This had all been orchestrated from the start.</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh-heh… <em>Now</em> I see what you’re up to. This is your way of auditioning instead of answering my question, isn’t it?”</p>

      <p>“Ha! I was expecting you’d see through that.”</p>

      <p>Oh, I’m sure. If I hadn’t, he never would have deigned to work for someone like me.</p>

      <p>“So you <em>are</em> indeed interested?”</p>

      <p>“I am. I would be delighted to work for you, Mjöllmile…but it <a id="page-23"></a>would need to be strictly in an adviser role for now, if that works for you.”</p>

      <p>Makes sense. He still has his noble title, so he can’t make any major moves for a while yet. What I wanted most was Veryard’s knowledge and experience anyway, so his serving as an adviser was just fine with me.</p>

      <p>“Of course it does! Thank you very much for your open-mindedness.”</p>

      <p>“And thank <em>you</em> for the offer.”</p>

      <p>We defiantly smiled at each other as we shook hands.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">With Veryard providing me his full support, the Four Nations Trade Alliance began to grow more steadily. Before long, our company would need to face off directly with the land’s most powerful merchants, our biggest competitors in business.</p>

      <p>“And that’s what brings us to Englesia for the first time in a while, Gard?”</p>

      <p>My bodyguard Bydd and I knew each other well enough by now to be on a first-name basis. He had been training in Tempest, and that had boosted his strength from a D-plus to an even B in rank. He had a new set of gear as well, and I now trusted him enough that he accompanied me on all my extended business trips.</p>

      <p>Gob’emon was with me as well, of course, and by this point, he looked like a battle-hardened hero, one whose presence left people awestruck. He was easily an over-A in strength, and I think he had even evolved into an ogre mage on me. An ogre mage! They were the stuff of legend, I’d been told, but Tempest was positively overrun with them. It was so absurd, I just accepted it as fact lest I lose my marbles.</p>

      <p>“Right you are. I have a very important meeting today, and it will bring me into, er, <em>slightly</em> dangerous territory.”</p>

      <p>“Oh? Sounds like you’ll need me, then.”</p>

      <p>“Aw, c’mon, Gob’emon! Not when he’s got me right here, y’know!”</p>

      <p>“Heh. We’ll see.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-24"></a>Now Gob’emon was openly laughing at the hyperconfident Bydd. He was an ogre mage, but his skin color was the same as before—I supposed that varied from ogre to ogre. He had horns as well, but they were small enough that he could hide them with a hat or bandanna. Today, he had a hat that matched the sharp business suit I’d had tailored for him. At first sight, he looked like any other hobgoblin, which made it easier for him to take his enemy by surprise. I hate to downplay Bydd too much—he’s been very good to me—but he still had a ways to go; it was really Gob’emon who helped me out the most as a bodyguard.</p>

      <p>So I had two guards with me, but today, not even that felt like quite enough. After all, I was going to meet with the merchants that more or less controlled all the Western Nations. Not that I should have had cause for concern. Sir Rimuru, after all, knew about my plans for today. Whether our negotiations paid off or not, I knew I was as good as secure with him watching.</p>

      <p>Instead, I could sit back and be in my element—a meeting hall full of top businessmen and women from across the world, all here at my invitation. How much more exciting can it get for a man like me? And that, you see, is why I had myself and my guards dress in snappy business attire. A form of bracing ourselves for what’s to come, kind of.</p>

      <p>“So are we ready?”</p>

      <p>Bydd and Gob’emon briskly nodded—and so, steeling our resolve, we headed for the hotel hosting this conference.</p>

      <p class="space-break">The automatic doors opened. “May I have your name, sir?” the man at the front desk asked with a refined, practiced gesture.</p>

      <p>“Mjöllmile.”</p>

      <p>“…!! My pardons, then. Just in case, would I be able to have a look at your personal identification?”</p>

      <p>Hmm. Not that anyone would attempt to impersonate me—but no reason not to cooperate. The hotel was being just as careful with all the other guests, I’m sure, so this was actually a relief.</p>

      <p>“Will this work?”</p>

      <p>Bydd took a letter of introduction out from his pocket and gave <a id="page-25"></a>it to the hotel staff. Once everything checked out, we were patted down to ensure none of us were carrying weapons. In the midst of this, some of my employees jogged up to me.</p>

      <p>“Sir Mjöllmile, we’ve been expecting you!”</p>

      <p>“Everything has been set up. The meeting hall is this way.”</p>

      <p>Chasing away the front-desk man, my underlings guided me over to the site—a large chamber this time, suitable for noble balls and such. Quite a number of people were already there, their eyes fixed on me as I came in.</p>

      <p>“That’s the head of the FNTA? The man who proposed this?”</p>

      <p>“Hmm… He looks familiar to me. I seem to recall the particular streak of cruelty he brought to his work…”</p>

      <p>“I heard the man achieved his current position by currying favor with the demon lord Rimuru.”</p>

      <p>“Indeed. But best not to look down on him. I heard he’s at the core of all the business conducted in that monster nation. He’s taking in the smaller merchants who’ve suffered as a result, and now he’s got a decent amount of power in the region.”</p>

      <p>“Hmph! Who cares about some upstart like him? With the Rozzo family out of the picture, I know King Doran has been positioning his kingdom for a potential comeback…but none of the other Five Elders have shown an interest in a takeover. It’s over for all of them, I’m sure.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, and Prince Johann of Rostia was arrested by Englesia’s magical inquisitors. Nobody else is strong enough to restore their former glories.”</p>

      <p>“One story I heard was that Margrave Cidre is in custody as well. Apparently he was ordered to defend Englesia, only to wholly abandon the request. He’ll be lucky to see the outside of a cell ever again, let me tell you.”</p>

      <p>“So whoever can seize the initiative at today’s meeting can expect to wield enormous influence in the next generation, then?”</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh-heh… Not that I’ll hand <em>that</em> throne to any of the other attendees. And <em>especially</em> not a mob of country folk like the Four Nations Trade Alliance!”</p>

      <p>“But Tempest is nothing to trifle with…”</p>

      <p><a id="page-26"></a>“No, it is not. Their fighting power is formidable, and one of their diplomats—a talent by the name of Testarossa—has all but seized the Council for her own.”</p>

      <p>“Well, let’s just see what they bring to the table.”</p>

      <p>“Absolutely. If that man proves to be talentless, we can step right in and take over his position. Simple.”</p>

      <p>“And what demon lord <em>wouldn’t</em> pick the most powerful candidate for the job? I’m sure <em>this</em> one will as well.”</p>

      <p>They weren’t even trying to be secretive about this. I could hear the excited rumormongering from all across the chamber. Everyone was intensely curious about whether I had the acumen to back up my reputation, talking loudly to ensure all their frank opinions reached my ears.</p>

      <p>And who could blame them? I had far more than Rozzo’s former allies here today. I even had some crime lords from around the world, each with an iron grip on their local underground mobster activities. These were the kind of people who held a monopoly on the world’s fortune, the kind of lofty leaders who’d normally never confer with each other. Indeed, the kind I’d never gained an audience with back in the day. The fact they were in on rumors about the Five Elders showed just how vast their networks spread.</p>

      <p>These were the sort of people who’d spent their lives constantly outwitting and outfoxing their competition. Their greed was endless. Rozzo’s decline didn’t scare them; they all saw it as an exciting new opportunity. I braced myself once more—I couldn’t let my guard down for a moment around these guys.</p>

      <p class="tx1">In the midst of this furor, someone decided to directly address me.</p>

      <p>“Well, look who’s here. Mjöllmile, huh? You’ve sure gotten too big for your britches, haven’t you? Not even gonna say hello to me?”</p>

      <p>Gehhh. This was Alecchio, bodyguard of Don Gabbana; a huge man in the prime of his life with equally huge muscles. He was clad in full-body leather armor that made him stick out like a sore thumb at this event, not that anyone dared to bring it up. They’d <a id="page-27"></a>have been foolish to. Alecchio, after all, was a retired A-ranked adventurer with such a reputation for sheer violence that nobody in organized crime wasn’t aware of him.</p>

      <p>We were acquainted, of course, although given the choice, I’d have preferred never seeing him again in my life. He’s like a ferocious beast, is the only way to put it, one who’s constantly starving and stalking his prey. Ever since I met him as a young man, he’s been constantly pestering me for food and money and such. I’d like to yell at him about it, but he’s a living personification of brutality, you know?</p>

      <p>And even worse, he’s got Don Gabbana behind him. A towering figure; of noble blood despite not owning a title, and someone not even the Englesia royal family can hope to defy. When Alecchio went too far one day and killed this wannabe street enforcer, the military police wrote the whole affair off as a suicide—and ever since then, nobody’s even thought about crossing that maniac. I was certainly not going to rattle my saber against Alecchio, not when I was supposed to be discussing economics. As the man convening this meeting, I had to weave my way through this situation, even if I came out of it looking bad. So, with a smile, I faced up to Alecchio.</p>

      <p>“Well, well, if it isn’t Alecchio! What a surprise to see you in a place like this.”</p>

      <p>“Huhhh? Who said you could talk to me like <em>that</em>? You really <em>have</em> gotten cocky while I wasn’t payin’ attention, huh?”</p>

      <p>Oof… Scary. Alecchio wasn’t raising his voice, but the sheer intimidation resonated down to the pit of my stomach. I almost wanted to pee myself, I tell you. People call me the “emperor of the underground” over in Blumund, but faced with the real thing like this, I was reminded all over again just how low on the ladder I really am…</p>

      <p>“A-Alecchio, this is s’posed to be a happy event for us all, okay? Maybe you could talk this over later—”</p>

      <p>Bydd was just as awed by him. I guess he knew about Alecchio, and that knowledge made him quake in his boots, not that I’m one to talk. If anything, I was impressed Bydd dared to speak to him—I don’t think he ever tried opposing him in the past.</p>

      <p><a id="page-28"></a>Still, I can’t say it was his best idea.</p>

      <p>“And who the hell do you think <em>you</em> are? Thinkin’ you can just step up and address me… Who gave you permission for <em>that</em>, huh?”</p>

      <p>Now his ire was pointed squarely at my bodyguard. Just as I’d thought, Alecchio had no memory of Bydd—I doubt he saw him as anyone worth remembering anyway. Someone as small-time as Bydd trying to speak to him was probably an unforgivable affront in his mind, and even if it wasn’t, it certainly did little to improve his mood.</p>

      <p>Back in the day, I would have paid Alecchio some coin and shooed him away. That wouldn’t work today. I was the director of the Four Nations Trade Alliance, and I couldn’t afford to look like a pansy around my business rivals. The people around us were just standing and smiling, nobody lifting a finger to help me. They likely saw this as an amusing diversion, but if I let it slide without comment, it would ruin my reputation with them. They’d see me as incapable of handling even <em>this</em> level of trouble, and <em>ohhh</em>, how they’d sneer at me afterward!</p>

      <p>“I fear, Alecchio, you might be laboring under some incorrect assumptions. Right now, I happen to be director of the Four Nations Trade Alliance. As we’ve known each other quite a while, I will be happy to let this slide, so would you mind promptly leaving my sight, please?”</p>

      <p>I tried to act as composed as possible. Keeping my voice from shaking took a lot of effort, but fortunately, I managed to keep it together.</p>

      <p>“What?”</p>

      <p>Is—is this what they mean when they say you can <em>feel</em> murderous rage in the air? The very atmosphere seemed to change around Alecchio as his gaze hardened. It was beyond terrifying.</p>

      <p>“M-Mjöllmile…”</p>

      <p>Bydd was calling for me now, knees shaking as he sounded almost ready to cry. But how could I find the time to acknowledge him? I couldn’t. I had to keep my eyes on Alecchio no matter what.</p>

      <p>“Whoa, whoa, Mjöllmile, you sure <em>you</em> aren’t makin’ a big mistake? Or, what, you think I wouldn’t lay hands upon you with all these folks around?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-29"></a>“Ooh…”</p>

      <p>Well, yes, I <em>do</em> think that! Anyone with even a modicum of intelligence would never think of resorting to violence at a place like this. A magical beast who lived purely on instinct was one thing, but no normal, sensible person would dream of it. Besides, Alecchio was Don Gabbana’s personal bodyguard. If he started a fight in here, it’d cause untold strife for his boss.</p>

      <p>So I believed I was safe…but just as I did, I felt like I saw Alecchio make a motion with his left hand. <em>Huh?</em> I thought—and then Bydd was pulled down to the ground, as Gob’emon promptly stepped in front of me. One moment, it seems, was all it took for Alecchio to try throwing a punch at me, and Gob’emon had taken it in my place. Gob’emon was the one who’d thrown Bydd aside as well; I supposed Bydd would have been in too much danger if he’d stayed there—and in fact, the concussive force of Alecchio’s fist had torn poor Bydd’s ear right off.</p>

      <p>“You all right, Bydd?”</p>

      <p>“Y-yes, sir… Sorry I, ah, couldn’t help…”</p>

      <p>“Don’t worry about it. If you die because of something like <em>this</em>, Sir Rimuru’s going to be enraged.”</p>

      <p>“H-he would care about me, you think?”</p>

      <p>“Of course he would. And <em>I’d</em> be just as mad!”</p>

      <p>I reached out to Bydd, helping him up…and even as we spoke, sparks were flying next to us, as Gob’emon and Alecchio engaged in a tenacious war of words.</p>

      <p>“Were you attempting to kill him?”</p>

      <p>“It was an accident—an accident! I was just trying to give him a little love tap. It wound up toppling <em>him</em> over just because <em>you</em> decided to butt in.”</p>

      <p>“Don’t give me that. He may be inexperienced, but Bydd is my brother-in-arms. I stood by so as not to shame him, but you went <em>much</em> too far.”</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha! It’s <em>his</em> fault for being such a pushover, ain’t it? No weapons are allowed in here anyway, y’know. What kind of bum dies after gettin’ jostled a little bit, huh?”</p>

      <p>“…Oh?”</p>
