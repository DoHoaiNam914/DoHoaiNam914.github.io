      <p><a id="page-262"></a>So it was pretty much just as written in Minitz’s report.</p>

      <p>Back then, I didn’t have the strength I have now. I think I was a talented knight, but my powers would maybe have ranked a B at best. It would have been impossible for me to have protected this house alone.</p>

      <p>“Ah, it’s all in the past. It’s the future that matters.”</p>

      <p>“…Yes, you’re right. I will accept all responsibility for this, so please, try to be lenient to the rest of the staff.”</p>

      <p>The head butler bowed low as the other servants voiced their apologies. That alone showed how ethical and upright a person my father-in-law had been.</p>

      <p>“Please, don’t get the wrong idea. It was my fault, too, and I’m not going to push the responsibility on anyone else. Just keep supporting us, all right?”</p>

      <p>We were all at fault here, really. They felt a collective responsibility for the family, and I wanted to join them in that.</p>

      <p>“Sir Caligulio!”</p>

      <p>There were tears in the head butler’s eyes, too. But, right after that, he raised an eyebrow, thinking about something.</p>

      <p>“Hmm? I’d have understood if you wanted to support the lady of the house…but did you say ‘us’?”</p>

      <p><em>He noticed, huh?</em></p>

      <p>“Um, Sir…Caligulio? What do you mean by that?”</p>

      <p>Now Mamia was asking, too. Here was the moment of truth. The idea of being rejected here mortified me, but I drummed up my courage and began to speak.</p>

      <p>“Well, I mean exactly what I said. We’re all at fault here—meaning that the divorce itself was a mistake. We need to take it back. Don’t you agree with me?”</p>

      <p>I spoke as calmly as I could, despite my emotions. Honestly, pushing this line of logic was a stretch. My and Mamia’s divorce had been filed with the relevant imperial judicial office, as was her and Nezt’s marriage certificate. That was all a done deal, and normally it’d have been impossible to overturn…but I was sure Minitz would figure out a way for me.</p>

      <p>“…You mean we’d go back to being a married couple?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-263"></a>“Exactly. Not a fan?”</p>

      <p>I felt like my heartbeat was drowning out my voice.</p>

      <p>“Are you sure it’s all right? Because what I did—”</p>

      <p>“That’s what I want. And I’d like you to accept the offer.”</p>

      <p>“But I… The drugging…”</p>

      <p>She wanted to say she’d drugged me, I’m sure. But that had all been taken care of. His Majesty Rimuru had fully restored my body, and he had informed me that all my reproductive functions were intact. Any lingering effects of the poison, I think, were long gone.</p>

      <p>“No need to worry about that. I’m pretty sure that’s no longer a problem for me healthwise. So would you like to try life as a married couple again?”</p>

      <p>It was a request I made with all my heart. I thought proposing marriage to someone once was good enough. I’d never expected to do it twice with the same woman. But if I couldn’t make this work, I was sure life would continue to feel empty.</p>

      <p>I waited for Mamia’s response, more nervous than I had been before any battle. Her eyes began to shine, as a smile unraveled over her face. She was beautiful. The beauty she had lost over the past twenty years immediately came back.</p>

      <p>“I’d be glad to.”</p>

      <p>My empty heart was filled with joy. And at the same time, the servants cheered for our reunion.</p>

      <p class="space-break">I had completed my goal. There was still the matter of dealing with that little man Nezt, but his position as the baron of Heath would be erased as well, so he’d meet his doom soon enough. He would go back to being a merchant, which meant he’d no longer be immune to arrest. His crimes still belonged to him, of course, so I doubt he’d be seeing the light of day again—and since those crimes had been committed on a noble family, his own relatives would likely be implicated, too. I was sure his father was going down with him.</p>

      <p><em>“Everything is going well here. You can go ahead and put him in custody.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Yes, sir. We’ll capture and take care of Viscount Zook ourselves, then?”</em></p>

      <p><a id="page-264"></a><em>“Yes please.”</em></p>

      <p>I let my staff handle the little details. That wrapped that up. I had patched things up with Mamia, and I now returned to being the baron of Heath.</p>

      <p class="tx1">“I guess I should congratulate you on your marriage?”</p>

      <p>“Sure. It’s not exactly remarrying, though.”</p>

      <p>Minitz and I were drinking again at our preferred restaurant in the capital.</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee! Well, either way, I hope things work out between her and you.”</p>

      <p>“Thanks. And thanks for handling all that paperwork for me.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, you better be thankful. It was tough. If people brought up statutes of limitations and stuff, I wouldn’t have been able to turn anything around. I needed to be a bit forceful at times, which I’m sorry about.”</p>

      <p>“I did hear you had some difficulty.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, kind of. But you don’t have to worry about it. Think of it as my wedding present.” Minitz smiled.</p>

      <p>“I appreciate it,” I replied, stifling a laugh.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>He then peppered me with questions about our married life.</p>

      <p>“Oh, stop praising your wife to high heaven!”</p>

      <p>“What’s wrong with that? I’m just telling you, marriage is wonderful! You should stop living the rich bachelor lifestyle someday, y’know. You need to find a woman who’ll be your life partner!”</p>

      <p>“Ah, shut up. Quit trying to mess around with my private life.”</p>

      <p>“Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Well, you should have been there when I drummed up the courage to finally say it!”</p>

      <p>“That’s the fifth time you’ve said that.”</p>

      <p>“So what? If you want to hear about it that badly, I’ll tell you as many times as you want.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-265"></a>“Damn, you’re pretty drunk, man. I didn’t expect you to get <em>this</em> hostile.”</p>

      <p>…I had a feeling that I was rambling on about her, not caring about his reaction. <em>But it didn’t really matter</em>, I thought. No point dwelling on it.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>After some more chitchat, we got down to business.</p>

      <p>“So those documents you gave me…”</p>

      <p>“Did they help you out?”</p>

      <p>“You said you wanted to have something on me, just in case. But that was a lie, wasn’t it?”</p>

      <p>“…Oh, you noticed?”</p>

      <p>“Of course. We’re talking about something that happened twenty years ago here—over ten at the time you did that investigation, even. So how did you get all that private information in such exacting detail? Not even the IIB could do <em>that</em> extensive a job!”</p>

      <p>“Heh! I thought you were drunk, too. You’re pretty sharp, pointing that out.”</p>

      <p>With Minitz having admitted to it, I was now sure about my convictions.</p>

      <p>“Was it Lady Testarossa?”</p>

      <p>“You got it. She gave them to me. Said they might be useful.”</p>

      <p>“She’s one fearsome woman.”</p>

      <p>“You said it.”</p>

      <p>She struck me with nothing but terror. What kind of information network would you need to have gathered <em>that</em> much info on me?</p>

      <p>I mean, we’re talking Blanc, the demon that menaced the Empire for years upon years. The emperor’s guard supposedly sealed her away after the Bloody Shore incident, but at this point, I’m sure that was faked, too. She let herself get sealed off—or maybe sealing her away was bound to fail anyway. That was what made Lady Testarossa so strong—that brain of hers. She was even a thorn in Lady Velgrynd’s side, I heard, despite the huge difference in power. That told the whole story, really.</p>

      <p><a id="page-266"></a>“The outlook of our military is, if you attempt to take on Lady Testarossa, you’ll likely lose on the strategic front. It wouldn’t even be a fight, in other words. You better keep that in mind as you work out how to deal with Tempest going forward.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, don’t be stupid! I know that full well without <em>you</em> telling me. Even if we’re not at war, I’m sure every negotiation with her going forward is going to be an ordeal. I have to praise the insight of Sir Rimuru for naming someone like her his chief diplomat.”</p>

      <p>I suppose I didn’t need to give Minitz the warning. We were in agreement with each other, which was a relief.</p>

      <p class="space-break">But either way, I imagine we’re going to keep our cooperative relationship with the monster nation active. For as long as Minitz and I are alive, at least. What happens after <em>that</em> is the key question. The administrators of the Jura-Tempest Federation have life spans that’re basically infinite compared to ours. With our empire, meanwhile, people will be constantly leaving and joining our government. Lady Velgrynd is indifferent to politics; she might reluctantly offer assistance if asked, but I still worry about future generations.</p>

      <p>With Mamia as my wife, I’ve restored my desire to cherish my family life. With that comes the concern that some unforeseen disaster may strike the Empire later on. We really need to work out a way to ensure we don’t wind up at war with Tempest again. That, plus the right education to maintain peace, is something we owe all our future generations.</p>

      <p>“We’ve got a tough journey ahead of us, huh?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. There’s a mountain of things to do.”</p>

      <p>Minitz must have reached the same conclusion I had. I smiled at him as I tipped my glass.</p>
