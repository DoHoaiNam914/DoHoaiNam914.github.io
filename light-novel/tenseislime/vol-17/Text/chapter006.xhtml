      <p><a id="page-43"></a>Enthusiasm grew in the chamber as the leaders tried outdoing themselves with new and innovative torture methods. What should I do now, then? I pondered the question as I looked at the downtrodden duo in front of me.</p>

      <p>Honestly, both of them had made serious errors, but I wouldn’t have called them guilty of a crime. Acting macho and browbeating some new organization horning in on your turf is part and parcel of being a mobster. Being so openly defiant against the man who runs your group is a problem, but how could he have known when he had no idea who I am? And that attack on Bydd <em>was</em> infuriating, but even that all got worked out with no permanent consequences.</p>

      <p>Sir Rimuru was aware of the conference I organized, besides, and I’m sure he had someone there watching us to ensure nothing serious happened. In fact, several of Soei’s troops were stationed in the room right now. If things <em>really</em> went awry, I was confident it would be stopped at once before anyone was truly in danger.</p>

      <p>Along those lines, I was starting to think capital punishment for Don Gabbana and Alecchio was going too far.</p>

      <p>“Order!”</p>

      <p>I quieted down the room, now that I’d collected my thoughts.</p>

      <p>“They will not be punished. Gabbana is no traitor to our organization; he simply didn’t know I was the boss. If he betrays our trust in him again, that is a different matter, but I am going to overlook this particular event.”</p>

      <p>I was still annoyed about a lot of things, but I needed to restrain myself. That was my decision, but not everyone was for it.</p>

      <p>“You’re being too lenient! It’d be a terrible precedent to set!”</p>

      <p>This was greeted with applause from many people.</p>

      <p>“Boss,” one of the extremists in the room said, “don’t tell me you’re an amateur in this field? Because to lifers like us, saving face is more important than almost anything else. If you let people screw around with you like this, nobody’s gonna want to serve you any longer.”</p>

      <p>Indeed, some of the group were starting to openly question my authority. I didn’t mind dissatisfaction about the decisions I made, but I really couldn’t have this.</p>

      <p><a id="page-44"></a>“Whoever said that just now, come forward.”</p>

      <p>A young man took a step toward me, a fearless look on his face.</p>

      <p>“This is Yang from the Black Nails. We fought together in the same mercenary army before, and I can affirm that he’s a stern, severe man who never shows mercy to his enemies. He is talented as well, equivalent to an A in rank.”</p>

      <p>This was Girard filling me in. He was the leader of the Sons of the Veldt, and somewhere along the line, he’d taken position next to me here. Smart fellow.</p>

      <p>I nodded at him and turned to the man before me.</p>

      <p>“Your name is Yang, then?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah.”</p>

      <p>“And you call me an amateur?”</p>

      <p>“Am I wrong? Because if you show mercy <em>that</em> readily, in <em>this</em> business…”</p>

      <p>“You think I’m letting people screw with me?”</p>

      <p>“…Again, am I wrong?”</p>

      <p>Good grief. Does Yang realize how much contempt he’s showing with every remark?</p>

      <p>…Well, maybe he does. Maybe he’s using this chance to plant seeds of doubt in everybody’s minds so he can stage a coup someday. They say that “those without power can never thrive in the darkness”—that you have to constantly show your strength, lest someone dethrone you—but I didn’t want REG to become <em>that</em> kind of company. I needed to explain reality to him, and fast.</p>

      <p>“Who’s screwing with me?”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>“I’m asking you who could beat me, Yang. Do you think <em>you</em> could?”</p>

      <p>“N-no…”</p>

      <p>Yang shot a glance at Glenda. I guess it was she, and not the Sons of the Veldt, who had taken down the Black Nails.</p>

      <p>“You said saving face is important. Shouldn’t <em>you</em> be taking responsibility for addressing me with such contempt?”</p>

      <p>“I, er…”</p>

      <p><a id="page-45"></a>“Glenda, I take back what I said about your merit points earlier.”</p>

      <p>“Aw, come on…”</p>

      <p>“Silence! Because it’s become <em>clear</em> to me that Yang’s far from the only one of you failing to treat your boss with respect! You have no right to criticize Gabbana at all!”</p>

      <p>Don Gabbana and Alecchio gave me surprised looks. That made something else click in my mind. Were they being used?</p>

      <p>“Glenda, you’ve been putting ideas into their heads, haven’t you? Setting things up so someone would challenge me to try giving themselves a boost?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, you noticed?”</p>

      <p>“Of course I did. And you should be glad it was me here. If it was one of the <em>other</em> bosses, we’d have some serious problems…”</p>

      <p>“No problems at all. I already discussed this matter with Lady Elmesia. She advised me to proceed and hide it from you.”</p>

      <p>“Oh…”</p>

      <p>Big Mama’s mean streak can cause me <em>so</em> much trouble sometimes. Things were working out well with this in the end, but still.</p>

      <p>“Yang, I’d love to meet the person who tries screwing with me just because I’m letting Gabbana off the hook. That applies to all of you here. I’m not going to demand that you stop thinking about overthrowing me, but you better be ready for the consequences. I might be too weak to survive any attempts on my life, but let me make this clear: If I go, all of REG goes.”</p>

      <p>I meant this as a clear warning. It made Yang visibly shiver. I wasn’t bragging or bluffing, he knew. It was the honest truth.</p>

      <p>“S-so…does this mean the other two bosses are…?”</p>

      <p>“You don’t need to know.”</p>

      <p>“You said it. Why are you so keen on learning things? People get killed for knowing too much.”</p>

      <p>Girard and Glenda answered before I could. It silenced the other leaders, who had sweat dripping down their brows. I decided to give it one final push.</p>

      <p>“Now! I will not try Gabbana and his bodyguard, and I assume none of you have complaints about this? Let me hear you!”</p>

      <p><a id="page-46"></a><em>“““No, sir!”””</em></p>

      <p>They all bowed before me, showing their allegiance.</p>

      <p>“Well, Yang, you should rejoice. I’ll let your insolence go this time, but you won’t receive another chance.”</p>

      <p>“Of course! Thank you very much. I promise I will work harder than ever to repay the favor!”</p>

      <p>“You will? Good. That’s the kind of spirit I like to see.”</p>

      <p>I smiled, satisfied. I was now confident in my full control of REG, and based on this experience, I decided to enact a core set of regulations for our firm:</p>

      <div class="top">
        <p class="nl-list">1. Do not betray your friends.</p>

        <p class="nl-list">2. Be gracious enough to forgive the mistakes of others.</p>

        <p class="nl-list">3. Do not punch down or bring misfortune upon anyone.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Those three should suffice.</p>

      <p>Not betraying your friends went without saying; we would sentence anyone who broke that one to death. Forgiving others’ mistakes was trickier, but we were positioning REG as a last resort for people who were down on their luck. We weren’t gonna receive the cream of the crop, in other words, so I was asking our people on the ground to try and make up for any errors. Nothing was going to change unless the higher-ups carried out systematic reform, and I wanted to get this nailed down now, while all the top managerial staff were in one place.</p>

      <p>Finally, rule number three was the most important one. REG was going to be an amalgamation of all the big forces in organized crime, but if we constantly tried pulling each other down, we’d never be able to take on our public merchant competition. I’m sure some people had made a lot of money with that approach, but going forward, it was completely prohibited.</p>

      <p>I wanted everyone here to realize that we wielded far more influence than before, and that meant we had to contribute to society in a fair way. We weren’t a lawless mob; we were a chivalrous group, one that helped the weak and crushed the powerful. That was my wish, and it was Sir Rimuru’s, too. Given our underground position, <a id="page-47"></a>we certainly couldn’t whitewash everything we got involved in like that, but I didn’t want us to abandon our pride. If the top management is corrupt, the guys at the bottom have no way to defy them. That applied to me as well, and I wanted to be sure I didn’t forget it.</p>

      <p>“I know it’s hard to change your ways immediately,” I said to wrap things up, “but you should see these as the rules REG expects you to follow. Give our younger kids time to learn. They need to know there’s more than one way to survive out there.”</p>

      <p>The leaders meekly pondered this. They were used to doing all kinds of dirty things—it was impossible for them to change their thought processes that quickly. But with the right use of my (or, really, Sir Rimuru’s) authority, I didn’t think it was impossible.</p>

      <p>I suppose this is silencing the opposition with my power, but I’m dealing with people who believe that power is everything, so I think it’s the right move to make. Hopefully it’ll help foster change in everyone else, too.</p>

      <p class="tx1">So the Gabbana family was set to be dismantled, its members reassigned to other organizations. Gabbana would be treated as my personal adviser; he’d work at our Blumund headquarters under a different identity. He was good with financial matters and certainly talented in other ways as well, so I’d hate to leave him idle.</p>

      <p>I decided to let him oversee our magitrain project, which was a constant, aggravating thorn in my side. It’s really Sir Rimuru’s fault, you know—he’s at the core of it all. He comes up with these wild ideas, and then he pushes me to implement them. And that’s fine! It’s my job, and I won’t deny that it’s an attractive project to work on. But he really needs to remember that I’ve only got two hands. I’m an average human being, not at all like him; I need to sleep at night. It’s hard to turn him down whenever he says, “It’s all yours, Mollie!” to me, but when I call off a project due to budget concerns, it’s often for the sake of my own health. Of course, with <em>this</em> much money on the line, that excuse is gonna stop working pretty fast—and that’s why recruiting Gabbana was a stroke of luck for me.</p>

      <p><a id="page-48"></a>Gabbana, by the way, complained to me on a daily basis. “Damn it,” he’d grumble, “I’m thankful for this, but look at all the work you’ve allowed to pile up in here! I had no idea it would be <em>this</em> much of a trial!” Said “work” was all stuff Sir Rimuru had irrationally demanded from me, so I really wished he’d complain to Sir Rimuru, not me. (I <em>did</em> feel just a tad guilty, though, so I took measures to ensure he was generously compensated for the job.)</p>

      <p>As for Alecchio, I left him in the hands of Gob’emon. The ogre mage himself requested this—he wanted to settle matters with Alecchio, apparently, after the whole thing with Bydd. So we arranged a fight…one that Alecchio had no right to refuse, but I dangled a chance at upper management in his face to sweeten the deal. It ended, as you’d expect, with Gob’emon dominating.</p>

      <p>“Do you understand now? You’re always going to find someone stronger than you. And even <em>I</em> would be considered merely above average in my homeland. Strength is not something to show off; it is hidden within your heart. It must be used for just causes, to protect the things you must never give up. That is what I was taught, and it is not too late for you, either. You ought to take this moment to reevaluate yourself.”</p>

      <p>I’d like to think that speech—plus the trouncing he received—opened Alecchio’s eyes a little. And I was right. Soon he was volunteering to serve next to Gob’emon.</p>

      <p>So things ended rather quietly for the two men who’d tried picking a fight with me. But we announced something quite different to the general public. We needed to leverage REG to give the Four Nations Trade Alliance the flashiest debut possible, but we also needed to find some happy compromise to keep REG from losing face in the process.</p>

      <p>Thus, for starters, we took the mansion we had purchased to serve as the FNTA’s Englesia branch and blew it to cinders. All the staff was evacuated in advance, but the fallout led to a lot of gossip among the general public. That, and the journalists Diablo introduced me to wrote some truly wonderful coverage for us. They portrayed REG as this fearsome, ominous entity, while singing my praises as someone who can’t be intimidated. And why would I bow <a id="page-49"></a>to mob activity like this? I’m the finance minister of Tempest, for goodness’ sake.</p>

      <p>The breakup of the Gabbana family made for big headlines as well, and between all the coverage, I think we got across to people that the FNTA’s a lot bigger than they thought. On top of that, we spread rumors that REG and the FNTA had declared a truce to rest and regroup their forces. This theory came to be generally accepted by the public, and with that, the whole thing was over.</p>

      <p>So that was how we safely got the FNTA off the ground…but looking at the earnings reports from our branches, even I was left speechless. Between you and me, these branches were earning the equivalent of several dozen gold coins an hour—more than my yearly salary as a Tempest minister in the space of one day, I suppose. In the eyes of the public, I was earning more in an hour than most of them could expect to make all year.</p>

      <p>By the way, we also gave Benimaru and Soei payment for their services helping REG—I think around fifty gold coins per month. Soei’s agents working directly for REG were earning vast amounts more, though, and all their necessary expenses were covered, too. The same went for Glenda and Girard, the people we had posing as bosses—a boss needs a lavish lifestyle, after all, or else their associates will get suspicious.</p>

      <p>Finally, we also received compensation from our respective governments. Essentially, Big Mama, Sir Rimuru, and myself were each entitled to 2 percent of the profits. This was paid yearly, but even now, my account was growing at a shocking pace. I consider myself a lucky man, yes, but <em>this</em> lucky? It’s all so scarily unreal to me.</p>

      <p>But my ambitions don’t end here. I’ve got big dreams, you know. I’m not about to stay satisfied with these little successes.</p>

      <p class="space-break">My name is Gard Mjöllmile, the man whose destiny was changed after I met Sir Rimuru. I want to run hard, climbing as high as I can my whole life, so that I have no regrets later on. And until death finally visits me in the end, I’m never going to stop trying.</p>
