      <p>This was the history Xienhua was born into, but as the Holy Fist, she was more than worthy of being called their strongest yet. Her inherited <em>hun-po</em> had fully integrated itself within her spiritual will, making all skills and strength her own. She had reached levels of power that were unusual, almost eerie, to see in this world. In terms of existence points, she was over a hundred thousand, and in the demi-material “key world” Velgrynd was born in, she’d be overwhelming enough to be classified as Enlightened.</p>

      <p>Nobody in this world could even hope to compare with her—but, well, she’d chosen the wrong opponent today. Velgrynd toyed with her for a little while, and that was all it took to mark her defeat.</p>

      <p>“…I give.”</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee-hee! Such wonderful strength. Certainly stronger than Gensei. In <em>this</em> world, I think you could’ve beaten Kondo, too.”</p>

      <p>Despite being so badly beaten, Xienhua seemed refreshed by the experience. All doubts about Velgrynd had vanished, and she admitted to herself that this was the real thing. Velgrynd, for her part, was overjoyed that the Long she loved had seen his martial art passed down to this present day. She couldn’t have praised Xienhua and her students more, and she was even ready to give them one or two God-class weapons. That never wound up happening, but the sheer joy she exuded at having had this experience was undeniable.</p>

      <p class="tx1">So, after many twists and turns, the leaders of all the relevant states were here.</p>

      <p>It turned out that the Chinese political leaders who had been brought here, apart from the general secretary Wang Rongren, were actually more martial artists in disguise. They had presumed this whole thing was a <em>yohma</em> trap, Japan realized, so no blame was <a id="page-148"></a>assigned, and now they were replaced with the real government officials.</p>

      <p>Listening to their story, it was actually an all-too-common tale of hostages being taken. Here, though, their sheer number was on a national level.</p>

      <p>The mystics’ activities in the Chinese Fiefdoms had begun with the targeting of the children of the nation’s leaders. Over time they’d expanded on this, built up their numbers, gained new connections, hooked up with their targets, and brainwashed them before sending them off to their bases. Teachers, coworkers, bosses, families—they’d gradually possessed all of them, and they were around 70 percent of the way to their ultimate goals. That was why the invasion of the United States of Azeria had been approved by unanimous vote in the National People’s Council.</p>

      <p>“I’m not expecting an apology to be enough, but I hope you will understand that none of us were willing participants in this.”</p>

      <p>Wang lowered his head.</p>

      <p>“Oh, it’s fine,” George replied. “I understand that every nation has their own issues to tackle. My own son was taken from me, besides, but if I put my family against my nation on the scales, my choice is gonna be the same every time. That’s my responsibility as president…but even so, I’m not going to give up until the very end.”</p>

      <p>“Yes… I understand how you feel.”</p>

      <p>George and Wang nodded at each other.</p>

      <p>“Along those lines, let me apologize as well.”</p>

      <p>Emperor Magellan of the Greater Rossiam Dynasty spoke up. His military was beyond his control now, staging a mad invasion of the Chinese Fiefdoms, and he admitted to everyone there that he had no way to stop them.</p>

      <p>“I suppose I’m just as guilty, then. Our invasion of Greater Rossiam was a terrible misstep engineered by the <em>yohma</em>. I think it’s time for me to admit that as well.”</p>

      <p>Emperor Zangu was acting unusually humble by his standards. After Yamamoto and Oharu’s quick thinking had saved his life, he’d spent some time in the waiting room calming down. With his <a id="page-149"></a>head cool, he’d realized just how dangerous his antics back there had truly been. He was far from a talentless ruler, and he could discern which way the wind was blowing. So he’d talked things over with his Seven Sacred Treasures.</p>

      <p class="space-break">Zangu’s right-hand man was fourth-ranked out of the Seven. One of the Seven had joined the invasion of Rossiam and had yet to return, so he’d been brought in to replace that person for this event. The missing member was a woman, one burning to fight so badly that she’d requested to join the operation, then put her military unit on the move without waiting for HQ’s answer. It had been a clear violation of the chain of command, and a Sacred Treasure staging an invasion without waiting for imperial orders was a serious issue that couldn’t be allowed to stand.</p>

      <p>She had once been steadfastly against any opening of hostilities, but had recently demonstrated a clear change of heart. It greatly confused those around her, and she was soon placed under suspicion. Following her most recent crime, however, the government decided to stage a search, as much as they hated to make a hero and Sacred Treasure their enemy. They had failed to find conclusive evidence that a <em>yohma</em> had taken her over…but as they concluded, it had to be accepted as fact. It was a gut-wrenching, pride-destroying decision.</p>

      <p>Velgrynd and Xienhua’s battle had taken place in the courtyard that was visible from the waiting room. The Seven Sacred Treasures working together couldn’t defeat the Holy Fist, but for Velgrynd, it was like taking candy from a baby. The Treasures understood there was no reason to keep on bluffing about their own strength, and Zangu agreed. Thus, without any further ado, the Holy Arcian Empire renounced its ambitions to conquer the world.</p>

      <p><em>Heh-heh… I just remembered. As the myths say, anyone who earns the goddess’s blessings will rule the world. If that is the inevitable truth, that would make Oharu our generation’s mightiest ruler.</em></p>

      <p>It was Zangu’s clear understanding of this that made him pledge his full allegiance to Oharu.</p>

      <p class="space-break"><a id="page-150"></a>So the summit began with a flurry of apologies.</p>

      <p>“If I may also speak—”</p>

      <p>“No, no, I understand the Conquering Empire of Japan’s position well enough.”</p>

      <p>“Right. We of the United States regret forcing you into a decision as well.”</p>

      <p>Oharu attempted to join the fray, but Wang and George wasted no time cutting him off.</p>

      <p>The others in the room—including Yamamoto, standing motionless against the wall—could read their leaders’ minds like a book.</p>

      <p><em>Yes, I can see their motivations. If they try to pin blame on His Majesty Oharu for this, it’s sure to raise his hackles, after all.</em></p>

      <p>Yamamoto took a glance at Velgrynd, thinking about how he’d have made the same choice in their shoes.</p>

      <p>After this spate of mea culpas, the summit moved on, its leaders working out a strategy against the <em>yohma</em>—but everyone’s eyes quickly turned toward Velgrynd.</p>

      <p>“So, Ryu-oh…umm, what sort of strategy do you think would be effective against the <em>yohma</em>?”</p>

      <p>Japan’s army minister hated to ask the question. It was terribly embarrassing for him. Here was the commander of one of the Conquering Empire’s greatest forces, someone who certainly wasn’t paid to shunt responsibility off on others. This time, though, nobody was going to criticize him.</p>

      <p>All the world leaders awaited Velgrynd’s reply. They had no other choice, for they lacked any sort of firepower that could resist these enemies which were beyond human knowledge.</p>

      <p>As they turned toward Velgrynd, their only hope, the woman herself couldn’t have been more casual. She turned toward the army minister, as if she thought the answer was obvious.</p>

      <p>“You understand that any military deployment is meaningless, right?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, regrettably. It might keep them from approaching our homeland, but we’d never fight a naval battle with them anyway. <a id="page-151"></a>We could place everybody here into our ships, and we’d still never be able to resist the <em>yohma</em>.”</p>

      <p>The minister was right. If the fleet came close enough to Japan itself, the fleet’s cannons could target Japanese cities. That made it worth building a naval defensive line, but either way, it’d be pointless if they had no chance of winning. They weren’t sure the <em>yohma</em> would even try destroying urban areas. If they had the power to possess people’s minds, they’d likely prefer to co-opt the cities for their own use instead. If so, they had no reason at all to stage some grand naval fight.</p>

      <p>“Precisely,” Velgrynd said with a nod. “Guns don’t work on <em>yohma</em>, and no foot soldier will provide any resistance. That narrows it down to two choices.”</p>

      <p>“What are those?”</p>

      <p>“Either leave all of this to me, or try a little harder by yourselves. One of those.”</p>

      <p>To the proud military men and women in the room, the choice Velgrynd presented was simply humiliating. But the reality was that nobody had anything to counter her with. They were all gathered here, the supposedly most powerful wagers of war this world had ever known, and now they were flashing glances at each other, gauging each other’s reactions. Their eyes told the whole story—they were in agreement.</p>

      <p>Gensei Araki and Saburo Minamoto, proud swordsmen of the Conquering Empire, were the first to speak.</p>

      <p>“This is our issue to solve, after all. I have no intention of trying to act proud here, but it would be pathetic of us to rely on Ryu-oh for everything. If there is anything I can accomplish here, I want to risk my life on it.”</p>

      <p>“I agree with my companion.”</p>

      <p>They were followed by the Seven Sacred Treasures of Arcia.</p>

      <p>“Well, I don’t want Japan seizing all the glory. I want us to play a role in this, too.”</p>

      <p>“We can’t have His Majesty Zangu come out and fight himself. I hope he can leave this to us.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-152"></a>“Exactly. The emperor has duties he can carry out only if he is alive. This is a job for <em>us</em> to handle!”</p>

      <p>The six members besides Zangu were ready to contribute. Xienhua the Holy Fist was just as resolute.</p>

      <p>“Longhuang, my lord—if you are willing to offer the human race your protection, we have nothing to fear. Even if we are defeated, with you on our side, we are all but guaranteed victory in the long run. So please, allow us comparatively smaller presences a chance to grow and prosper in battle.”</p>

      <p>She meekly bowed her head. That made her the ninth warrior to have volunteered for this effort, but there was one more remaining.</p>

      <p>“Umm, is it all right if I join you?”</p>

      <p>This was codename “Billy,” head of the Secret Service of the United States. He was here to personally guard President Hayes, and by any account, he was a professional at warfare. Despite being just twenty-six years old, he cut an intense, masculine figure, complete with a scar on one cheek. He was proficient in casting magic as well, and he handcrafted the bullets he loaded his gun with, ensuring anyone he shot met their maker—even ghosts.</p>

      <p>But while it was a courageous act from a courageous-looking agent, compared to the other nine, Billy was clearly a notch below them. His physical abilities were nothing to write home about, and even his weaponry wasn’t particularly noteworthy. He certainly beat everyone else in the room who stayed silent, too timid to think they could help at all, but could he really help in a combat situation? That was questionable.</p>

      <p>Billy was fully aware of that as he nervously awaited Velgrynd’s answer. George saw fit to back him up.</p>

      <p>“Yes, Billy has proven to be extremely talented in his guard duty. He’s saved my life multiple times, and Emile is just as fond of him. I’ll withdraw him from contention if he’d just get in the way, but if possible, I’d like you to take him along.”</p>

      <p>Giving up such a trusted member of his personal staff likely meant exposing himself to more danger than before. George was fully aware of that, but with humanity facing extinction, he couldn’t <a id="page-153"></a>find it in himself to simply do nothing. Billy, he figured, could hold his own against the lower-level <em>yohma</em>. He honestly believed this, and so he made the offer in hopes of expanding their warpower.</p>

      <p>This group would form a team that’d raid the <em>yohma</em>’s headquarters. They’d destroy the portal Velgrynd called the “Underworld Gate,” eliminating the invaders’ threat right at its core. Everyone was resolved to do this…but Velgrynd just gave their suggestions a measured smile.</p>

      <p>“If you had opted to leave everything to me, I would have protected only those I <em>wanted</em> to protect. But I’m glad to see you have the enthusiasm to fight…and in appreciation of your resolve, I’ll help you a little bit, all right?”</p>

      <p>In fact, if they had agreed on the former option, Velgrynd was fully ready to leave the human race to its own fate. She could even see herself taking her favorites, like Oharu and George Hayes, and transporting them into some other world to live in. Goddesses can be finicky like that. But these representatives of the human race had made the right decision, so Velgrynd responded in kind.</p>

      <p>“Codename ‘Billy,’ you said? All right. I’ll let you on the team—I have no reason to turn you down. Your strength is on the same level as Minamoto over there, and if we can do something about your weapons, I think we can make you both a much deadlier presence.”</p>

      <p>Her mind made up, she asked Minamoto and Billy to surrender their weapons to her. Minamoto dutifully gave her his beloved blade, Billy his favorite Smith &amp; Wesson Model 27 revolver. Velgrynd accepted them and immediately engineered their rebirth as God-class weapons.</p>

      <p>“…?!”</p>

      <p>“Th-this is just…”</p>

      <p>Both men were awed by how plainly more lethal their weapons had become. Gensei wasn’t so surprised, having experienced this before—he just nodded, his expression serene. The others in the room weren’t so calm, the Seven Sacred Treasures shocked at how she was letting these God-class pieces flow freely over to other <a id="page-154"></a>nations. In a fight, though, they’d undoubtedly help a lot, and since now was no time for Velgrynd to hold back, Oharu voiced no objections.</p>

      <p>“That should make you two a bit more capable. But I want one thing to remain clear here: The only <em>real</em> power out of you all is Xienhua, and Xienhua alone. What was your name again? Bright?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, my lady!”</p>

      <p>“Right. You’re the most decent among the rest, but you’re still not even tapping into three percent of your God-class weapon. And the others don’t come even close—maybe one or two percent. I’d like to see some more effort from you all, please.”</p>

      <p>If they <em>could</em> unleash all of a God-class weapon’s force, it’d cause them to reawaken as spiritual life-forms capable of beating most of the <em>yohma</em> single-handed. At this point, this transformation wasn’t even remotely possible for any of them. Velgrynd, after all, had designed the Sacred Treasures’ weapons so the blood descendants of Shin had access to their powers. They could all use this equipment well enough, but they weren’t able to unleash its true firepower.</p>

      <p>Still, there was no need to be ashamed of that. As sparse as magicules were in this world, everything was that much frailer and more vulnerable. If these people had crossed worlds and had their physical bodies remade in the process, they’d likely awaken to Enlightened status, and Xienhua had every chance of reaching the Saint level.</p>

      <p>So the warriors were ready. It was time for the grand counterattack.</p>

      <p class="tx1">The <em>yohma</em> Delia was taking a walk around Greater Rossiam’s grand palace.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>During her human years, Delia had been the fourth member of the Seven Sacred Treasures. On that fateful day, she’d received a vital assignment—stop a <em>yohma</em> calling himself Emile from carrying out <a id="page-155"></a>his mission. But it had all been a trap laid by Emile himself. Even their intelligence department had been caught in Emile’s web, and he’d used this to lure Delia out. She had been defeated—trounced, in fact, by the roughly dressed Emile, despite the full set of battle gear she’d brought with her.</p>

      <p>It was humiliating. But more than that, it was the first time Delia—an overwhelming force among mankind—had ever felt fear in her life. She’d abandoned all sense of shame as she begged for mercy. “Of course,” Emile had said with a light smile. But by the time she knew what that spelled for her, it was too late. Delia’s knowledge, position, and even her name was taken from her, and she was fully reborn as a <em>yohma</em>.</p>

      <p class="space-break">On the mystic scale, Delia was “general”-class, just like Li Jinlong and David Reagan. She had come onto the scene in time for Arcia’s invasion of Greater Rossiam, participating in the operation to destroy Greater Rossiam.</p>

      <p>As far as the <em>yohma</em> were concerned, their first mission was to procure territory to rule over. The second job was to make mankind servile to them, so they’d have a steady supply of bodies for their race to take over. Not just anyone would do, however; they preferred tough, strong, muscled bodies, capable of withstanding the magicule-driven transformation. This made sorting the bodies important.</p>

      <p>As a half-spiritual life-form, when a <em>yohma</em> possessed someone, they basically did not need to eat after that point. Not that they couldn’t—and, in that, they could absorb nutrients from food just fine—but a lack of food was no problem, either. Regardless of that, powerful, durable bodies were still preferred as targets for possession, and so the <em>yohma</em> sought ways to thoroughly manage and control the human race for their own purposes.</p>

      <p>The idea that they’d wound up adopting was to simply do away with the one nation out of the five with the worst climate conditions. That was Greater Rossiam. Its fields produced relatively little, and over half of its territory was unsuitable for development. Its soldiers were well-honed and spiritually strong thanks to this <a id="page-156"></a>harsh environment, but the <em>yohma</em> ultimately decided that no nation needed to be located here at all.</p>

      <p>Installing a king to rule over conquered lands was a must in order to control and manage the land and its people, but with Rossiam no longer seen as necessary, there was no urgent need to keep the royal dynasty going. The <em>yohma</em> had no intention of simply killing everyone in the region; they figured that if the Rossiam royalty were eradicated, the nation’s current political system would collapse by itself.</p>

      <p>Along those lines, Pulcinella the Mad Priest was agitating the populace with an eye toward staging a coup, and Delia was following his lead.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>Delia performed a patrol of the palace grounds, then let out an annoyed sigh. No matter where she looked, there was no trace of Rossiam’s royalty—the emperor and his entire family. The same was true for all his high-ranked political officials and their families—and, in fact, all the knights working in the palace, as well as the chamberlains and female attendants, had vanished as well. They had combed the palace, searching for hidden corridors and the like, but they had yet to discover any trace of those who had gone missing. They’d even possessed a couple of palace staffers, picking through their detailed memories of the palace, but still found no clues. The only conclusion they could reach at this point is that these people had all disappeared into thin air.</p>

      <p>“How’s it going with you?”</p>

      <p>She was being addressed by Emile, a coworker of hers. They were both of the same rank, so they had a friendly relationship with each other.</p>

      <p>“I give up. I have absolutely no idea where the Greater Rossiam emperor could have gone.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah? That’s a problem. It’s not like they have access to Control Dimensions like we do…”</p>

      <p>“Oh, no way. People on <em>this</em> world would see that as an act of <a id="page-157"></a>God. The Seven Sacred Treasures can’t even teleport themselves around.”</p>

      <p>Delia was sure of it—the memories of the powerful human body she had taken over left her fully convinced. There were too few magicules around for people to cast spells with, and elemental magic like Warp Portals didn’t exist at all. There were extra skills like Spatial Motion that Delia did have access to right now, but the transport gates that skill summoned could be used by maybe a handful of people at best before losing integrity. Thus, no matter how you sliced it, it was absolutely impossible for anyone to have escaped this palace while they had it under siege—or it should have been.</p>

      <p>Emile was the most physically gifted among the more recent recruits, so he’d been set up with a <em>yohma</em> from the “general” class, the lower end of the upper echelons. He wasn’t the world’s strongest man or anything, so Delia assumed he wouldn’t be aware of things like transport magic. The body Delia now inhabited was stronger and contained much more knowledge of this world. It gave her a feeling of superiority over Emile.</p>

      <p>“Well,” Emile said, “that would mean there’s a hole in our siege, but my instincts tell me that’s not the case. I feel like we’re overlooking something very important.”</p>

      <p>He was looking at Delia’s spear as he spoke—this divine instrument from the Seven Sacred Treasures, fabled as the work of a goddess. Somehow, it seemed familiar to him. He wasn’t sure why, but thought the answer was locked in his memories somewhere. <em>Yohma</em> can read the memories of the humans they take over, but while important knowledge was one thing, the repeating cycles of human life—the day-to-day conversations and experiences—took up so much of the mind that examining them in detail took too long. They couldn’t waste time and effort on things that didn’t really matter anyway, so these more humdrum memories were generally ignored.</p>

      <p>Emile was no exception to this. He had a grasp of his body’s identity, skills, the nature of his work, the people he associated with—the basic stuff. But he wholly ignored memories like this <a id="page-158"></a>body’s childhood experiences. That was why, when he recalled the beautiful woman who had associated with his grandfather, all he could remember was the name “Gryn.” If it had dawned on him that this was Velgrynd, he no doubt would’ve been concerned enough to redraw all his plans.</p>

      <p><em>I wonder about that spear, though. Maybe it’s related to Emile, the previous owner of this body, somehow. Let’s look through my memories a little…</em></p>

      <p>Emile’s apprehension refused to leave him alone. It bothered him. He didn’t think it had anything to do with the Rossiam royal family’s escape, but nonetheless, he began poring over his memories to assuage his fears.</p>

      <p>Delia, on the other hand, was supremely confident.</p>

      <p>“Ah, whatever. No point dwelling on a couple of fugitives. There’s no way they can beat us anyway. Let’s just ignore them and stick to the plan.”</p>

      <p>“…Good point.”</p>

      <p>“We wanted to take the royal family hostage and bait the nation’s elites to join our side…but let’s abandon that plan for now. Instead we’ll set this place on fire and make it known to the world that Greater Rossiam is finished.”</p>

      <p>The original blueprint had called for them to announce that the royal family would be publicly executed, sending the people into a frenzy. The powerful, civic-minded heroes of the world would be lured into trying to stop this, and then their bodies would belong to the <em>yohma</em>.</p>

      <p>Ideally, this tactic would have helped to snare Xienhua, the strongest in the Chinese Fiefdoms and likely this whole world. She wasn’t from Rossiam, of course, so whether she’d take action or not was a gamble—but the stakes were low either way, so the <em>yohma</em> didn’t care if things didn’t pan out. Once Rossiam was plunged into chaos, their attention would turn toward the Chinese Fiefdoms next, and Xienhua was bound to come out then, so it didn’t make much difference. Either way, once they had Xienhua in their grasp, this world was good as seized. Delia gloated to herself about it. It’d all be so simple.</p>

      <p><a id="page-159"></a>But then Pulcinella the Mad Priest sent an emergency telepathic message.</p>

      <p><em>“You can hear me, right?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“F-Father Pulcinella? Did something happen? Why are you personally reaching out to me?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Well, a priest of mine I dispatched to Chinese lands ahead of me has sent back a strange report. I was having him work out where the Chinese commanders were located, but he said he couldn’t find a single one of them.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“What? So the humans are tricking us?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“…No, I don’t think so. I considered the possibility that it’s some kind of camouflage spell unique to this world, but nothing like that would ever work against any of us officer ranks.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“I agree. No one on this low-level world could ever threaten us, no matter how much they struggle.”</em></p>

      <p>Delia couldn’t imagine they were being deceived at all, and she assumed the same for the underlings who worked for her. Judging by her memories from back in her human days, even the Seven Sacred Treasures would be on the lower end of average in the <em>yohma</em> hierarchy. Xienhua was another matter, but there was no way anyone else would get the best of them.</p>

      <p>But Pulcinella wasn’t so sure.</p>

      <p><em>“Don’t get so full of yourself, Delia! This world exists in physical space, full of possibility. With the right number of magicules, things can change in every which way. We</em> yohma <em>only become complete once we obtain physical bodies. I want you to make sure you don’t forget that!”</em></p>

      <p>Delia, after that tirade, realized he was right. This world was inferior in terms of pure strength, but that was only because its physical laws differed from the ones they were familiar with. She admonished herself not to forget where she stood until this invasion was over.</p>

      <p><em>“My pardons, Father. I will take your advice to heart.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Good. See that you do.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Yes, sir! Now, I actually have some problems to report from our side…”</em></p>

      <p>Delia thought it a good opportunity to update Pulcinella. They were here to catch the royal family, only to find nobody home. It <a id="page-160"></a>was just like what Pulcinella had heard of over in China, making her sense of dread even more palpable.</p>

      <p><em>“What? The situation is similar in Rossiam? I can see the palace from here, but I didn’t detect anything unusual. Did we let our guards down? I don’t know, but I feel like something terrible is happening…”</em></p>

      <p><em>“What should we do?”</em></p>

      <p>Delia was in full agreement with him. Next to her, Emile, listening in on the telepathic conversation, looked just as nervous.</p>

      <p><em>“Wait for a little bit. I will discuss things with Masahiko Amari.”</em></p>

      <p>Pulcinella wanted to avoid reaching a conclusion by himself. The commander class, the sharpest leaders of Cornu’s squad, had miraculously installed themselves within the brightest human minds of this world as well. Masahiko Amari was one of them, and asking for his advice made perfect sense to a fellow “commander” like Pulcinella.</p>

      <p>The decision they made was:</p>

      <p><em>“We’re going to retreat. We’ve got an unknown situation taking place, so we need to free ourselves from all other operations. We’re going to regroup over in Atlantis to carefully rework our plans. Any questions?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“No, sir,”</em> Delia instantly replied. Emile had no objections, either—and with that, the <em>yohma</em> paused all their plans and decided to regroup back on their home turf.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">Masahiko Amari, after hearing the news from Pulcinella, could tell things weren’t going the way they wanted.</p>

      <p>All of them were invincible. Looking at the situation, both as <em>yohma</em> and from the perspective of the humans they possessed, they were one step away from conquering the world. Once they built their rule over the human race, they’d top it all off by summoning Cornu—and from there, they’d start reworking the planet itself, making it into a stellar base for their future conquests. Space was a big place, but not as large as the universe they’d come from. Now that they had physical bodies, they could feasibly conquer this entire dimension in the span of thousands to tens of thousands of <a id="page-161"></a>years. As they did, they’d develop a new Underworld Gate to the next dimension, with an eye toward yet more pillaging.</p>

      <p>Now, however, they were running into snags. Something they weren’t aware of was playing a role in this—Amari was sure of it.</p>

      <p>“Well, what now, then…?”</p>

      <p>Li Jinlong and David Reagan both reacted to the blurted-out phrase.</p>

      <p>“Something wrong?”</p>

      <p>“You look pensive. I thought everything was going as planned. Is there a problem?”</p>

      <p>Amari looked back at them and explained the situation. The royal family of Rossiam and the leaders of the Chinese Fiefdoms had both disappeared for unknown reasons, and he believed some external force was behind it.</p>

      <p>“Wah-ha-ha! Aren’t you overthinking it a little?”</p>

      <p>“It’s a cause for concern, to be sure, but is it really enough that we should pause our entire operation?”</p>

      <p>Li openly laughed off the threat. David audibly wondered whether Amari was being too weak-willed. But Amari wasn’t moved.</p>

      <p>“We’re strong, that much is true, but we’re not omnipotent. Let your guard down for even a moment, you realize, and this entire invasion could fall apart. We need to take this opportunity to gather as much information as we can. Contact our people in the remaining three nations and have them brief you on matters. We have to look into what’s going on with the other world leaders.”</p>

      <p>With that order, the trio went their separate ways.</p>

      <p class="space-break">After his two compatriots left, Amari leaned back in his office chair, thinking to himself.</p>

      <p><em>“It’s the same thing in Arcia. The imperial family, along with the rest of the Seven Sacred Treasures, are all gone.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“This is Azeria. The President and his close associates have fallen out of contact. There’s no record of them leaving the White House, but they’re nowhere to be seen in there.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Security’s been stepped up inside the Conquering Empire of Japan. I attempted to enter the administrative zone, which includes the palace, but it wasn’t possible for me.”</em></p>

      <p><a id="page-162"></a>Before he gave his orders to Li and David, Amari had already been moving his own teams on the ground. Whenever something bothered him, he liked to take immediate action to address it—and his suspicions were quickly confirmed.</p>

      <p><em>Azeria and Arcia are fine, but I’m wondering about Japan. I think I had one of our company-officer-class</em> yohma <em>performing spy work over there, but perhaps Gensei would be a challenge for him…? No, no, that’s impossible. Fighting is one thing, but Gensei’s no counterespionage agent.</em></p>

      <p>As Masahiko Amari’s teacher, Gensei was a world-class swordfighting talent. He wasn’t a spellcaster, however, and without Amari around, the Imperial Palace Spellcaster Guard would have trouble dealing with the <em>yohma</em>’s undercover maneuvers. It’d have been one thing if the <em>yohma</em> stormed the palace, were discovered, and it resulted in a battle. But if they couldn’t even get anywhere near the palace, that was highly unusual.</p>

      <p>“Well, well, what now?”</p>

      <p>Pulcinella and the others had been ordered to return at once; they would be teleporting in once they’d finished wrapping things up. David and Li would have caught up with the news by then, so they’d likely all be discussing their future plans shortly. But that wasn’t what Amari was concerned about.</p>

      <p><em>What am I anyway?</em></p>

      <p>The human Masahiko Amari had been possessed by a commander-class <em>yohma</em>. The assimilation process wasn’t complete yet, but he had gained enough access to all of this body’s capabilities.</p>

      <p>…Or not.</p>

      <p>Masahiko Amari, after all, was closely matched with Kondo. They had been dear friends and rivals, and thus it wouldn’t have been strange if his spiritual force was honed to near-ultimate levels. That was exactly why Amari was now wondering about himself.</p>

      <p><em>Am I really a</em> yohma<em>? Or maybe…</em></p>

      <p>The humans of this world received no support from magicules, that miracle state of matter. That made them weaker, but they were still free to think and act as they wanted, as their spirits could be as <a id="page-163"></a>steadfast as anyone’s. On the other hand, many of the <em>yohma</em> were former angels that served the seraphim—and angels in the Dominion class or lower were little more than robots carrying out orders. Their senses of self were stretched thin at best, and even now, there was a chance that the humans would possess them, not the other way around. If a human’s will could break through a <em>yohma</em>’s sense of ego, all order among the mystics would be blown away.</p>

      <p>Amari could conceive of all of that, and it unnerved him. It applied just as much to him, too. As a <em>yohma</em>, he believed the resurrection of Cornu was the best thing for them all. He needed to expend every effort to make it happen; no obstacle to it should be left unaddressed.</p>

      <p>Now, however, Amari’s thoughts were different. The Underworld Gate expansion work could wait. In fact…</p>

      <p><em>What if we destroy that Gate? Then I’d be king, wouldn’t I? Ah, but a king can be such an irritating thing to be; I could let Pulcinella take the job, instead of having invaders like the</em> yohma <em>do as they please. Wouldn’t it be more desirable for us humans to rule over this land?</em></p>

      <p>These were outrageous thoughts, these ideas he kept hidden in his mind. But was this phenomenon happening to him alone?</p>

      <p>Amari’s commander-class <em>yohma</em> memories told him that he had once been a member of the cherubim, given life by a god called Veldanava the Star-King Dragon, and assigned to serve Cornu. Despite that, and despite having gained powers that’d put him on the level of an awakened demon lord on certain other worlds, here he was struggling with questions about his very existence.</p>

      <p>He knew that he himself was a very convincing example. He didn’t want to stop there. It was clear, he now concluded, that the others like him must be much the same way—and if so, who was really his friend, and who was his foe? Was installing Pulcinella as king really the right move? Now the question seemed impossible to answer. There wasn’t enough information for him to make a decision.</p>

      <p>So Amari put off the topic until later—and that was when an aide reported that everyone had arrived.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">

        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1"><a id="page-164"></a>“The conclusion seems clear, then. All the world’s leaders and top officials have disappeared?”</p>

      <p>“Some still remain, just to be accurate.”</p>

      <p>“No need to consider them. We must assume that everyone with the power to enact policy in their home nations is gathered in the Conquering Empire. The human race is clearly showing signs of a counteroffensive.”</p>

      <p>“I will not deny that, no.”</p>

      <p>If the two leaders in the room were in agreement, there was no debate left.</p>

      <p>“Should we send our fleet to Japan, then?”</p>

      <p>The fact that the <em>yohma</em> had a base here on Atlantis was an open secret. The humans knew about it, and the <em>yohma</em> hoped they’d be lured over someday. People in military service, after all, were typically more suitable vessels than the general public. Best to have them beat a path to their doorstep rather than try kidnapping them all—such was the <em>yohma</em>’s strategy.</p>

      <p>But if something disturbing was going on in Japan, that changed matters quickly.</p>

      <p>They could, perhaps, have sent out a large offensive force and wait to see what would happen…but Masahiko Amari was fighting off the anxiety that he was missing something important. The world was all but theirs now, because there was nobody strong on this planet. But was that really the case? If that assumption proved incorrect, that presented the need to reconsider this whole operation at its core.</p>

      <p>“If I could just confirm this one more time,” Amari said, “I want all of you to exercise all your knowledge for me—are there <em>truly</em> no strong people left in this world?”</p>

      <p>“That much is a given,” Li Jinlong replied, a grin on his face. “The only threat to any of us is Xienhua!”</p>

      <p>The confidence he effused only added to Amari’s concern.</p>

      <p>“Hold on. Let me ask you, then; who trained Xienhua?”</p>

      <p>“That…”</p>

      <p><a id="page-165"></a>“Because in my research, I saw that she is trained in the ‘Dragon Fist’ style, which is strictly passed down from the master to one of their students. It’s said this style includes skills that remain unknown to the public.”</p>

      <p>“R-right, yeah! That’s why she’s so much stronger than average.”</p>

      <p>“But how were these skills created in the first place? The style was originally founded by a man named Long; do we have any information on him?”</p>

      <p>The question made Li reflect on his body’s memories. He was an advanced student of the Dragon Fist, even though he hadn’t been selected to become its next master, so he had learned quite a bit about its progenitor.</p>

      <p>“I think it was written in one of our sacred tomes that he was guided to found this style by a great woman named Longhuang, but what I read was just a collection of oral histories. I don’t know how useful it’d be for us.”</p>

      <p>“…Hmm.”</p>

      <p>The dread was growing in Amari’s mind. An ancient, unsourced biography like this normally wouldn’t have fazed him at all, but something about it kept nagging at him.</p>

      <p>“Actually,” Delia said, remembering something, “I recall a myth about a goddess who guided the original founder of Arcia as well…”</p>

      <p>This was doing nothing to assuage Amari’s mind. Delia grew pale as well, a cold sweat running down her back. Since becoming a <em>yohma</em> she had never let herself be swayed by emotion like humans were, but the importance of this memory spooked her.</p>

      <p>“And this goddess’s name was?”</p>

      <p>“Cardina…”</p>

      <p>“…”</p>

      <p>“…It’s said she called herself Cardinal, in reference to the deep-red color used to represent her, but came to be better known by the nickname Cardina.”</p>

      <p>The word “cardinal” rang some bells. Amari, plunging into his <em>yohma</em> memories, knew that Velgrynd the Flame Dragon had called herself that for a time, after the color of her aura.</p>

      <p><a id="page-166"></a><em>Quite a coincidence. Velgrynd the Flame Dragon should be in the same demi-material “key world” as Lord Feldway. I heard she was too infatuated with Emperor Ludora to have even known what our true objectives are. There’s no way she can be in this world…</em></p>

      <p>Even as one of the commanders serving Cornu, he had never been given the chance to speak with Feldway the Mystic King, a godlike existence to him. Therefore, he had to rely on secondhand sources, but they’d told him that their plans in the key world were going well. Velgrynd was completely submissive to Ludora; she’d never leave his side, and that wasn’t up for debate. It was impossible to picture her on this planet…but now Amari couldn’t shake the idea that she was, somehow. The pained expression on Delia’s face indicated that this topic was far from over.</p>

      <p>“Hmm… Is that all?” he dared to ask. Delia replied by presenting her spear.</p>

      <p>“This weapon is a ‘Sacred Treasure,’ supposedly crafted by that goddess. It contains a fearsome amount of power, but not even I can take full advantage of it…”</p>

      <p>“““…!!”””</p>

      <p>The statement unnerved both Amari and everyone else in the room. It was a given that a general-class <em>yohma</em> could wield a Legend-class weapon like it was one of their own arms or legs. If she couldn’t handle this spear in that way, it proved that it was a God-class item.</p>

      <p>“Could—could a magicule-starved world like this really create a God-class weapon? And not just one, either—the stories say there were twelve at first. I know the Sacred Treasures my former comrades wielded well, and I feel they are in the same class as this one.”</p>

      <p>“So there are twelve God-class weapons in this world?”</p>

      <p>“Yes…but I don’t think any of the others were extracting more than a few percent of their weapon’s capabilities!”</p>

      <p>“That’s not the issue,” Amari wanted to shout. But since that wouldn’t solve anything, he opted for a change of subject.</p>

      <p>“The issue here is the fact that, at one time, there was <em>someone</em> on this planet who could produce God-class gear.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-167"></a>“Oh, come on! These are all just legends!”</p>

      <p>“Can you think before speaking, please? You’re smarter than that. You have the physical evidence right in your hand and you still won’t consider it?”</p>

      <p>“I’m sorry, sir!”</p>

      <p>Amari cast a sidelong glance at Delia, who was hurriedly apologizing. Now he was sure of it. The goddess Cardina had to be Velgrynd the Flame Dragon. It was all a bunch of coincidences, but stacked up high enough, they formed an irrefutable truth—a truth that made Amari mutter out loud:</p>

      <p>“To think Velgrynd was on this world…”</p>

      <p>The statement was a titanic blow to one member of the meeting.</p>

      <p>“…Velgrynd? Did you say Velgrynd?!”</p>

      <p>“What is it, Emile?”</p>

      <p>The usually aloof Emile was suddenly acting very suspicious. Ignoring all the stares, he began to mumble to himself, a trait stemming from the instincts of Emile the human being, not the <em>yohma</em>. The rest of the group, not knowing this, nervously waited to hear about whatever discovery he had just made.</p>

      <p>“Yes… Yes, that’s it. She <em>is</em> here, in this very world! In which case, we’re…”</p>

      <p>Pure fear ruled over Emile’s heart—emotion from his <em>yohma</em> side. But there was also a drive for self-preservation—and that was the specialty of Emile Hayes, son of Laurent, for he was still kicking inside that body, fooling the <em>yohma</em> into believing he had been fully taken over.</p>

      <p>The fear that Velgrynd was acting against them had crushed the thrall the <em>yohma</em> had over his body, and Emile took advantage of that, struggling as hard as he could. In his mind was a recurrent image, the memory of a beautiful, smiling woman that he’d loved like a grandmother, like a mother, and like a big sister. A memory of an embrace, one that provided absolute comfort at all times.</p>

      <p>The name of the woman who’d held him at a young age was Velgrynd. So Emile called her name, seeking whatever assistance he could find.</p>

      <p class="space-break"><a id="page-168"></a><em>“Help me, Gryn!!”</em></p>

      <p class="space-break">This screamed request wound up becoming the key that changed everything.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">

        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="noindent">“You called for me, Emile? I’m here to save you.”</p>

      <p>She suddenly appeared, saying those words. As tightly guarded as the <em>yohma</em> base was, it almost seemed unfair how little that affected her. This, of course, was Velgrynd, and considering how she’d even managed to half-destroy Ramiris’s labyrinth in the past, the <em>yohma</em>’s Barriers may as well have not existed.</p>

      <p>The <em>yohma</em> couldn’t be blamed for their stunned silence. Even the normally calm and collected Masahiko Amari hadn’t expected something like this. He was sure Velgrynd had a hand in this world’s history, but he hadn’t expected to encounter her like this, before he could even do anything about it.</p>

      <p>“Velgrynd… Why are you here?”</p>

      <p>“You know my name, I see.”</p>

      <p>“Of course. Didn’t you work together with our lord Feldway to help Emperor Ludora with his conquests?!”</p>

      <p>“Ahhh, I guess if we’re connected by key worlds, we can sync up our timelines like that, huh?”</p>

      <p>“What?”</p>

      <p>“Forget it. If you don’t mind, I’ve got some errands I’d like to take care of right away…”</p>

      <p>Masahiko Amari was thrown into disorder…but the coolheaded part of him kept thinking. If they had picked up on Velgrynd’s presence sooner, they could have at least taken some measures against her. But the threat had never even occurred to them.</p>

      <p><em>This is a huge failure. But why? Someone on her level shouldn’t be able to cross dimensions at all. We’re expending every effort to enlarge the Underworld Gate we have, but we still haven’t managed to call in Sir Cornu…</em></p>

      <p><a id="page-169"></a>Velgrynd was an existence on the same level as Cornu, perhaps even higher. Her magicule count was too colossal for Amari to even fathom. But how had she come over to this world? He had no idea. Nor did he know what her objectives were. If at all possible, he wanted to avoid hostilities right now. But:</p>

      <p>“Errands?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, just a simple request. Give up on invading this world and retreat to your own, all right? Do it, and I’ll let this whole thing pass.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd delivered her ultimatum with a smile, but there was anger sandwiched between the words. These beings were trying to hurt the people she loved, and she hated them. Amari could tell.</p>

      <p><em>This is awful. She’s already pegged us as the enemy. But I don’t understand. Wasn’t she allied with Lord Feldway? …Wait. Synchronizing timelines?!</em></p>

      <p>His astonishing brain worked at astonishing speeds, figuring out the truth lurking within what Velgrynd had told him.</p>

      <p><em>Oh… She came here from another timeline. I don’t think she knows our situation, but she didn’t seem surprised by my talk of Lord Feldway and Emperor Ludora. It seems fair to assume she is aware of all events up to the present moment. And judging by how Sir Cornu hasn’t changed his orders, something or other must have happened at a future point in time. It’s likely that…</em></p>

      <p>It was likely, Amari concluded, that she had jumped into this world’s past from her “key world.” It was laudable how sharp his brain was—but sadly, he wouldn’t have time to reap the benefits.</p>

      <p>“I’m not here to negotiate, all right? You annoy me.”</p>

      <p>She wasn’t even trying to be approachable. Amari needed to make a choice fast.</p>

      <p>Velgrynd, meanwhile, was perfectly calm as she brought a hand up to Emile, whom she had pulled over toward her at some point. Her aim was clear at a glance—she was trying to separate Emil from the <em>yohma</em> that was a step away from full assimilation. The <em>yohma</em> resisted with everything it had, but it was likely just a matter of time. And if that was how it was, Amari thought, best to use that time as effectively as possible.</p>

      <p><a id="page-170"></a>“We’re aiming for a world where <em>yohma</em> and humanity live hand in hand, you know. It’s a pity you don’t understand that.”</p>

      <p>“No, because intelligent creatures aren’t about to understand each other’s one-sided desires anytime soon.”</p>

      <p>“Heh. No doubt. But I’m afraid we can’t give up.”</p>

      <p>“That’s your answer?”</p>

      <p>“It certainly is!”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd smiled. “Silly boys. All right… Have at it, people!”</p>

      <p>The final battle was about to begin.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">

        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">The <em>yohma</em>’s eyes opened wide at the people who’d suddenly appeared. The same was true for the other side as well. The most powerful human warriors in this world were even more puzzled by this than the <em>yohma</em>.</p>

      <p>“You were called here.”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>“You have to go, all right? Go and save that guy.”</p>

      <p>And after that short conversation, Velgrynd suddenly disappeared. They had been in a daze to start with, and now they had been summoned to this unfamiliar place—in the middle of all <em>this</em>, no less. None of them even realized they had been carried across physical space. They hadn’t gone through any transport gate; they had simply blipped into this new location without warning.</p>

      <p>It was, in essence, teleportation, carried out on ten or so people at once—a truly astounding, supernatural feat. The work of divinity, something Gensei and the other warriors representing the human race here could never have comprehended. Being told “Have at it, people!” wasn’t much in the way of guidance.</p>

      <p>In difficult times like these, it was important to figure out what you were capable of doing before anything else. When taking an exam, the rule of thumb is to save problems you don’t understand for later and focus on the questions you have an easy answer to first. This strategy can be applied to jobs as well; if you begin a task by <a id="page-171"></a>tackling the things you know how to handle first, the rest often falls into place by itself.</p>

      <p>Here, the group was lucky that some of them knew each other. Having discovered the familiar faces among themselves, they began to negotiate.</p>

      <p class="space-break">Gensei’s eyes immediately went toward Masahiko Amari, his student and trustworthy friend.</p>

      <p>“Masahiko, you’re not the sort of weak man who’d lose to the <em>yohma</em>. His Majesty is sorely grieving your absence. Pull yourself together and come back.”</p>

      <p>Wanting to gauge the response, he began with these words, his hand on the hilt of his sword so he could pull it out at any time.</p>

      <p>Minamoto, lined up beside Gensei as usual, followed his cue.</p>

      <p>“You can’t lose to this, Amari! Please don’t lose your own mind!”</p>

      <p>Like Gensei, he was appealing to Amari’s reason. They were betting that his true self would return, that he could overcome the <em>yohma</em>…but the result was surprisingly instantaneous on Amari’s end. After all, he still hadn’t fully decided whether he was human or <em>yohma</em> yet.</p>

      <p>“I…”</p>

      <p>Before he could continue, Amari found himself at a crossroads. Even for him, this was far too unexpected a development.</p>

      <p>The main issue here was the presence of Velgrynd. He hadn’t dismissed her ultimatum because he thought he could beat her. Quite the opposite—defeat was inevitable now, so he had called off negotiations in order to rile up his allies. Frankly, Velgrynd was on another dimension. There was no debate as to whether they could win or not; the moment they antagonized her, they were sunk.</p>

      <p>So what to do, then? Evacuating from this site seemed to be the best plan. They could have accepted her offer, but that had been shot down. If they said yes to her, the operation would end with nothing in their strategy having been achieved. The blame would all go to Amari and Pulcinella, and Amari wasn’t meek enough to accept those consequences. In fact, the <em>yohma</em>’s defeat felt oddly refreshing to him.</p>

      <p><a id="page-172"></a>All in all, the human side of Amari was winning out—which is why Gensei’s pleading hit home. His human heart was telling him to travel over to them. His intelligence as a <em>yohma</em> was shouting about how it refused to accept defeat. His sensibility as a human told him there was no point trying to escape. His instincts as a <em>yohma</em> were scared witless at the threat of Velgrynd. And as all this information fought each other in his mind, Amari felt sorely pained.</p>

      <p><em>Yes… The</em> yohma<em>’s greatest weakness is the thinness of their sense of self. If they were at least granted names, that would establish a firm sentience in all of them. But then again, that’s exactly why I overcame this</em> yohma<em>. Yes… I am Masahiko Amari. I could never be a</em> yohma<em>—</em></p>

      <p>But he was suffering—suffering in a way only a human being would. Seeing that, Gensei and Minamoto thought they were on the right track.</p>

      <p>“You have to remember, Masahiko! Remember who you swore you loyalty to! Who do you polish your sword skills for? There needs to be a concrete meaning behind your strength, or else it turns into simple violence. You didn’t forget that teaching, did you?!”</p>

      <p>Amari remembered. His loyalty was to His Majesty the Emperor, and his sword must only be swung to protect the weak.</p>

      <p>“Kondo fought gallantly to the end, Amari, before breathing his last. We looked up to both of you so much—you shone like the sun to us. But now…I guess Kondo died because of the <em>yohma</em>! Don’t tell me you actually want to join hands with them?!”</p>

      <p>He couldn’t be fully sure it had been the <em>yohma</em>’s fault, but it wasn’t a blatant lie, clearly, so he went with it. Amari believed it too—and in his heart, he blazed with the thought that it could never be forgiven. There was the sound of something snapping in his mind, and then Amari stopped thinking and turned his ear toward the pleas of his own heart.</p>

      <p class="space-break">Xienhua, meanwhile, was being addressed by the <em>yohma</em>.</p>

      <p>“It’s been a long time. I suppose it’s fate that brought us together here. No need for any words between us. Let’s do it.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-173"></a>With a dauntless smile, Li Jinlong raised his fists. He was a muscular man, making it hard to believe he was in his fifties. If anything, being merged with a <em>yohma</em> had let him regain some of his youthful vigor. He was more ferociously obsessed with Xienhua than ever.</p>

      <p>“You never give up, do you? How many times do I have to beat you down before you admit defeat?”</p>

      <p>“I’ll never admit it. Not unless you kill me. I know you were stronger than me, but that’s in the past now. I’m going to keep up the challenge until I win.”</p>

      <p>Li was intent on taking her position as inheritor of the Dragon Fist. He had never fully abandoned that ambition, even as a <em>yohma</em>.</p>

      <p>“Your tenacity, at least, is second to none.”</p>

      <p>“Ha. The winners write the history books…no matter how they win.”</p>

      <p>Then Li went on a charge, closing the distance between them with his body bent over as if sliding across the floor. His right fist, held in front of him, was like a missile. The energy from every part of his lower body, down to his toes, joined the force propelling his hips, focusing everything into his well-honed fist. Combined with his <em>yohma</em> power, the resulting force could have blown a normal person to pieces.</p>

      <p>If Xienhua had taken this blow cleanly, even she would have been down for the count. But instead, like a flitting leaf, she danced her way around the strike, parrying it. And that wasn’t all. Her delicate hands became balls of electricity, her left one stopping Li’s advancing fist cold. Grabbing it to take advantage of its force, she spun away while holding her front leg out, ending up behind Li’s back. With a forceful push, she threw him to the floor, then used her free right fist for a smashing blow right at the root of his neck, near the back of his head.</p>

      <p>It was a captivating, vibrant move. Li had his fist out, in the middle of a light-speed strike, and he could do nothing but let this happen to him. The pain shot across his body—and with this unguarded blow on a pressure point, not even Li could escape unscathed. But he was still a <em>yohma</em> general. The blow had Xienhua’s accumulated <a id="page-174"></a>battle force inside it; any normal <em>yohma</em> would have instantly been annihilated—but he still managed to stand up.</p>

      <p>“Phew… That hurt,” said Li. “It would’ve killed any of my men.”</p>

      <p>“You always were tough like that, weren’t you?” asked Xienhua.</p>

      <p>“Of course. It’d be no fun for you, either, if it ended in one shot. Now we can <em>do</em> it. For real.”</p>

      <p>With a vicious laugh, Li sneered at Xienhua.</p>

      <p>Xienhua clicked her tongue. “We can ‘do it’? You freak.”</p>

      <p>“Huh? No! I didn’t mean it like that—”</p>

      <p>Li could be oddly pure of heart like that, but Xienhua went back on the attack, not caring at all.</p>

      <p class="space-break">On the undercard of this day of fighting was Billy of the US Secret Service against David Reagan, the Azerian supreme southern fleet commander.</p>

      <p>“Sir, you are under suspicion of treason against the United States of Azeria. I suggest you consider how you’re going to defend yourself in a court of law.”</p>

      <p>“Not too likely, son. I’m no longer even human. Your courts can’t touch me.”</p>

      <p>“In that case, I am going to bring you into custody. If you resist, I inform you that I have permission to shoot to kill.”</p>

      <p>“Don’t make me laugh. I’ve gone beyond all of mankind’s limits. That toy would never work on me!”</p>

      <p>David smiled from ear to ear as he boasted. Billy responded by pulling the trigger without a moment’s hesitation. It’s basic battle tactics, after all, to strike at your enemy while their guard is down.</p>

      <p>The bullet Billy fired was a special one that contained all his fighting force. He could make one in a day, and it took a week to build up the necessary spiritual force to craft another, so he had only seven of these bullets total. The Smith &amp; Wesson Model 27 could hold six bullets, and every chamber was loaded with these sure-kill specials. Most of all, though, Velgrynd had just finished reworking this revolver into a God-class weapon, greatly enhancing the lethality of each shot. It was more than enough force to penetrate David’s protective barriers.</p>

      <p><a id="page-175"></a><em>“Gahhh!”</em></p>

      <p>Much to the commander’s shock, the first shot went straight through his heart. Velgrynd was one matter, but he’d assumed that nobody else here was a threat—a major blunder.</p>

      <p><em>No… What’s going on?!</em></p>

      <p>He could no longer hide his apprehension. Becoming a <em>yohma</em> had freed him, he thought, from the fear of death. No one can escape illness or pain in their lives, but now that he had “evolved,” David was exempt from all of that. But Billy’s gun clearly had the power to hurt him—and realizing that filled David with terror. The weakness inside the human heart had been masked by his new <em>yohma</em> will—but what the <em>yohma</em> who possessed him didn’t realize was that David had been a weakhearted man all along. That had made possessing him trivial, but now it was becoming a severe liability.</p>

      <p>David shot a look to his side. There he saw Li Jinlong struggling against Xienhua. It nearly made him lose his mind. How could something so ridiculous be happening?</p>

      <p>“Are you seeing things differently yet, sir?”</p>

      <p>Billy couldn’t help but rile him a little. This was no fight he could normally have won. In situations like this, he knew that if you catch the opponent by surprise, unnerve him, and make him think you have the upper hand, that opens up chances to score the win. He had six bullets left, although one needed loading into the empty chamber first and he knew David wasn’t likely to let that happen. He had to take the commander down with the remaining five bullets, or else his defeat was set in stone.</p>

      <p>The thought made him hesitate to unload his entire bullet stock on David at once. Now both sides had the same thought—<em>I need to make the right moves here, or else I’ll be the loser.</em> Thus an unexpected stalemate began to unfold.</p>

      <p class="space-break">At least one other matchup, however, was much more uneven. Take, for example, the <em>yohma</em> Delia against a team of six warriors. She didn’t like it much.</p>

      <p>“Hey! Why am I the only one facing six guys at once?!”</p>

      <p><a id="page-176"></a>She was so frustrated, she said that out loud rather than keep it to herself.</p>

      <p>“Well, it still won’t be enough! Get out of here! Go help someone who actually needs it!”</p>

      <p>“No! We came here to save you!”</p>

      <p>Bright, leader of the Seven Sacred Treasures, ignored Delia’s pleas.</p>

      <p>“Then put that sword away!” Delia shouted—just as she deflected a slash from Bright.</p>

      <p>An arrow flew through the air, aiming for this opening.</p>

      <p>“Look out! You’re as tricky as always, huh? What would you have done if that had hit me?!”</p>

      <p>Delia dodged it only because her danger-detection skills had seen dramatic improvements. She was complaining to the archer who’d fired at her, but the young man responsible acted like he couldn’t care less.</p>

      <p>“Sorry, Delia, but could you just let us catch you? Because you’re lookin’ pretty scary to us right now. We’re staking our lives on this, too, you know.”</p>

      <p>A woman with a whip was keeping Delia precisely pinned down, as gloomy as she sounded about it. The archer, responding in kind, stepped up his attack.</p>

      <p>“If you’re trying to help me,” groaned Delia, “you could at least act like you want to talk this out!” But she was forced to dodge their unrelenting barrage as she spoke. It was six against one, and normally the attackers would have enjoyed the upper hand, but Delia actually had the edge here. If she’d wanted to, in fact, she could have laid waste to these six warriors—which would have been a grisly scene.</p>

      <p>It didn’t happen, though, because she didn’t want that. Delia, too, was starting to reawaken to her human self. The <em>yohma</em>’s plan had been airtight, but once they started stealing the names of humans, things quickly went haywire. Even if the extraordinary outlier called Velgrynd hadn’t stepped onto the scene, it probably would’ve fallen apart elsewhere soon. Anyone with the right perspective would’ve seen it clearly enough.</p>

      <p class="tx1"><a id="page-177"></a>The strategic conference room in the <em>yohma</em> base was in a state of chaos, its occupants doing their best to fight off the intruders. The only ones retaining any sort of composure were Velgrynd, who was attending to Emile’s treatment, and Pulcinella the Mad Priest, who opted to just watch the proceedings with arms crossed.</p>

      <p>Pulcinella had been lauded as a great, holy man, but at his core, he exemplified evil and was cunning enough to hide it from everyone. Even now, he was accurately gauging events as they unfolded, working out what his best next move was—pure human greed in action.</p>

      <p>His <em>yohma</em> conscience had been consumed by his human side long ago, but that didn’t mean his assimilation was complete. He’d made absorbing and acquiring power his first priority; the knowledge his possessing <em>yohma</em> had was put off for later. <em>As long as he got his power</em>, he thought, <em>nothing else really mattered</em>. The knowledge was seeping into his brain anyway, but he couldn’t be bothered to try studying it in depth. There were millions and millions of years of memories involved, and even with Hasten Thought, it took a vast amount of time. Besides, if he absorbed a bunch of unnecessary data, it might end up interfering with his own consciousness.</p>

      <p>Those were the concerns behind Pulcinella’s approach to possession, but it would prove to backfire on him. Why? Because thanks to his lack of study, he had no idea who Velgrynd was at all. And that hole in his knowledge drove him to make a lethal mistake. Instead of working out how to deal with Velgrynd, he put his own greed first.</p>

      <p><em>I imagine Masahiko Amari is cunning enough of a man. He must have realized by now that if someone destroys the Underworld Gate, they can become king of this planet. I pretended not to notice, but it’s the only right answer. I know he trusts me. Let’s use these invaders to gain the upper hand for myself!</em></p>

      <p>Pulcinella’s plan was to take advantage of this chaos to break down the Underworld Gate and kill Amari. That, he thought, would qualify him as king of the world, and he thought this fighting was <a id="page-178"></a>an excellent chance for him. The <em>yohma</em> that possessed him had constantly fought on the front lines as one of Cornu’s commanders, so it possessed the extra skill Life Drain. Unlike Luminus’s Energy Drain and Yuuki’s Lifestealer, this skill let him capture and use the energy from dead enemies. The amount he could capture was limited to under 10 percent of his own magicule count, and the skill couldn’t be invoked in battle, so it wasn’t all that convenient. Still, it guaranteed that the more he fought, the stronger he got—a nice side effect.</p>

      <p>Pulcinella’s greed, however, had enhanced this skill by biblical proportions. The result was the brand-new unique skill Fulfiller. If an enemy had been weakened to the point of unconsciousness, he could continually drain it of power until his own body was sufficiently fed. This, again, was hard to invoke during battle, but in a large, confused combat situation like this, it could come in very handy. This conference room, after all, was packed with powerful fighters.</p>

      <p><em>Heh-heh-heh… Play my cards right, and I could gain double the force. Amari wouldn’t even be a challenge to me then. He’ll be my assistant from now on, not Cornu’s!</em></p>

      <p>Nothing but his own desires weighed in Pulcinella’s mind. Even Cornu meant little to him. So he kept waiting and watching, working out who to strike at. Xienhua still held a clear advantage over Li, but their battle was closer than he’d assumed at first. They were exhausting each other, but there was still no clear victor.</p>

      <p><em>I could take power from the weak, but then the stronger ones would get suspicious of me. Going for Xienhua instead would be perfect!</em></p>

      <p>She had been in his sights from the very start. He had been gunning for her since before he’d gone to the Chinese Fiefdoms, and now it was all going how he’d planned. He smiled—then, waiting for the moment when Xienhua and Li were locked together, he struck.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

      <p class="tx1">There were smiles on the faces of Xienhua and Li Jinlong as they exchanged blows.</p>

      <p><a id="page-179"></a>“I’m so happy, Xienhua. I’m getting to fight someone I could never hold a candle to before!”</p>

      <p>Their matches would end with a single blow before, but now Li could hold his own against her. It elated him. He’d always looked up to Xienhua; the fighting ring always loved her, elevating her in ways that couldn’t merely be attributable to genius. Still, the experience gave Li mixed feelings. He felt he would have inherited the Dragon Fist style if Xienhua wasn’t around—but when he first saw the young Xienhua’s talents, he was filled with a desire to see just how far this little girl would go. Perhaps that was the moment when he’d first accepted defeat.</p>

      <p>“Ha! It doesn’t mean anything if you borrow someone else’s force instead of building your own.”</p>

      <p>“Like you know how it works. As long as I can surpass you, that’s all that matters.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, I do know. I’m not fighting with just <em>my</em> own power, either.”</p>

      <p>“What?”</p>

      <p>“Only the inheritor of the style knows this, but it’s no secret or anything, so I’ll tell you. The <em>hun-po</em> I have inherited contains all the knowledge and experience of past generations of my style’s masters. I have taken all of it on, so I’m naturally going to be more powerful than the one I succeeded. The dream of our founder, after all, was to be strongest in the world. An impossible dream, but he kept chasing after it—and that’s why he created this unbroken ‘chain’ for his successors.”</p>

      <p>The story sounded familiar to Li. He recalled rumors about how the successor was always stronger than their teacher. Now he knew why. But even more surprisingly, Xienhua’s power really wasn’t just her own, but something supported by untold generations of martial arts giants before her.</p>

      <p>“So <em>you’re</em> using the power of others too…?”</p>

      <p>“That’s right. That’s why I can’t lose to you.”</p>

      <p>Human beings are capable of forging new paths with the accumulated knowledge of those who came before them. The ideals of Dragon Fist worked the same way. Much like how a building will tilt without a solid foundation, one must constantly strive to <a id="page-180"></a>improve their own core so they can make the most of other people’s power.</p>

      <p>“Are you saying I didn’t train enough?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. If you can’t use the power you were gifted with, it’ll all go to waste.”</p>

      <p><em>“Nngh!”</em></p>

      <p>It was humiliating, but Li realized it was the truth. In power alone, he outclassed her, and yet here he was on the ropes. There was no making excuses for that.</p>

      <p>He could feel his high spirits deflating, but even so, this was fun for him. He had no advantage at all in this battle, but he had a vague idea that victory was within his grasp. This exchange of lethal blows, something neither side would emerge from quite the same as before, made Li’s blood soar. His <em>yohma</em> side was trying to hold him back, but he had no interest in listening.</p>

      <p><em>More… More! I’ll be stronger…and stronger…and I will win!!</em></p>

      <p>Any remaining inferiority complex toward Xienhua was gone now, as his lust for victory rose within him. His <em>yohma</em> side lent him more power in response—a sign that the full assimilation was almost complete. The desires of both human and <em>yohma</em> merged, and Li would make them his own, eliminating the borders in his mind. That, he was sure, would make it possible to beat Xienhua.</p>

      <p>Then, at that moment, Pulcinella was suddenly standing in front of Xienhua, who was still grappling with Li.</p>

      <p><em>“Nnngh!!”</em></p>

      <p>His hand, straight as an arrow, plunged into her back. It all happened in a single instant.</p>

      <p><em>“Kah!”</em></p>

      <p>Bright-red blood sprayed from her mouth as she fell to the floor. She had trained her body to its limits, dipping her toes into the realm of Enlightened half-spiritual life-forms, and that kept her from being killed instantly. But now Pulcinella literally had her by the heart, scooping it out of her chest. Death would come shortly, and Pulcinella couldn’t have been more excited about it.</p>

      <p>Greedily devouring Xienhua’s heart, he invoked his unique skill.</p>

      <p><a id="page-181"></a>“So delicious… Now my powers will reach greater heights than ever!”</p>

      <p>He was right. Power surged through his body. And nobody was angrier about it than Li Jinlong, his servant. The human part of Li was screaming, wholly ignoring the power hierarchy between him and the <em>yohma</em> inside.</p>

      <p>“You! Not only do you interrupt our duel… What have you done to the woman I looked up to?! The strongest are only that way because they beat people fair and square!!”</p>

      <p>He launched a kick Pulcinella’s way. It didn’t work. It was a killer right roundhouse, but Pulcinella simply lifted his right arm to stop it.</p>

      <p>“Puny wimp! I have no need for people who defy me. I will feed upon you as well!”</p>

      <p>He hadn’t fully drained Xienhua of her power yet, so consuming Li as well wouldn’t earn him more than a few extra drops. But, with a sadistic smile, he destroyed Li’s leg.</p>

      <p><em>“Gaaahhh!!”</em></p>

      <p><em>Yohma</em> had no pain receptors, but the human element of Li’s conscious was strong enough that he felt phantom pain from the now-severed limb. Pulcinella simply laughed.</p>

      <p>“How ridiculous! You failed to master your <em>yohma</em> powers. You don’t even understand what it means to surpass mankind, you fool!”</p>

      <p>If he had better understood the characteristics of a <em>yohma</em>, he would have made more thorough use of that power. Then he might’ve had a chance of beating Xienhua. It made Pulcinella laugh, but he was also considering how to educate his own clergy members on this subject. If they stayed firmly <em>yohma</em> for him, all was well, but if the human side started taking root again, that was trouble. Such a trend had its good and bad sides—it’d make his staff more accommodating to his needs, but it also opened up the chance of a betrayal down the line. <em>Yohma</em> had strict castes in place, but with enough greed and desire, they could put their own selves first at this rate. Pulcinella himself was a great example of that, so he knew it to be firmly true.</p>

      <p><a id="page-182"></a>So would it be a good idea to use Li Jinlong as an example of how not to strengthen themselves…?</p>

      <p><em>If so, though, it’d make any betrayal even worse. Best to keep things as they are until I have a system in place which tolerates none of that business at all.</em></p>

      <p>By this point, Pulcinella was already acting like he was king. But he didn’t have too many of his top officials left. He planned to do away with Li himself, and Velgrynd had taken command over Emile. That just left Delia, David Reagan, and the now-questionable Masahiko Amari. He had to watch out for Amari, but a little demonstration of how much more powerful he was, and Amari was bound to fall in line and become his right-hand man.</p>

      <p><em>He’s no fool, after all. Once he realizes he can’t win, I’m sure he’ll lend us a hand. The question then becomes this Velgrynd woman. Maybe I can test my skills a little and make her a sacrifice—</em></p>

      <p>Pulcinella was painting a fairly rosy picture for his own future—as unlikely as it was to come true. But he banished the happy fantasy in an instant and raised his fist to land the final blow on Li. An evil aura surrounded it as it came whirling down toward Li’s head—</p>

      <p>“Move.”</p>

      <p>The moment he heard that word, an unimaginably intense pain racked Pulcinella’s body. It made him roll around on the floor, but Li wasn’t laughing.</p>

      <p>“I can’t have you die here, Xienhua. That would spell the end of Long’s dream.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd, as always, was putting her own priorities ahead of everyone else’s. It was the most incredibly absurd thing to tell someone who was on death’s door. Xienhua saw fit to protest a little.</p>

      <p>“B-but…I…”</p>

      <p>“Regeneration! And also some Healing, too. How’s that?”</p>

      <p>The magic, capable as it was of fixing entire parts of the body, regenerated her heart and even replenished her stamina. It was drastic, but that’s what Velgrynd gave her. Velgrynd had gained a mastery of holy magic during her travels, and while she didn’t need <a id="page-183"></a>it for herself, it had proven handy for all the assorted reincarnations of Ludora she had come to know. It’d occasionally made her the object of unironic worship, not that she cared. She might have been performing divine work with this magic, but it was of no concern to her.</p>

      <p>“Um… I’m healed. I don’t hurt at all. I feel fine.”</p>

      <p>Some people, like Hinata, have a natural resistance to magic. Her kind existed in this world as well, but a “divine miracle” that worked with a person’s spiritual particles had no problem taking effect.</p>

      <p>“I’m sure you do. I thought that the divine miracle Resurrection would be going too far, yes. But good.”</p>

      <p>“Yes…”</p>

      <p><em>There’s an even greater magic than this?</em> Xienhua thought.</p>

      <p>Her body was back to normal now, but that didn’t solve the problem at hand. Pulcinella had been hit with a jolt from Xienhua’s <em>hun-po</em>, the combination of her spiritual and animal souls. It still contained the knowledge and experience passed down across generations of Dragon Fist masters, but it had lost the majority of its force. Unless that was addressed, Xienhua would be in a permanently weakened state. That’d normally have been a huge issue—but Velgrynd was there.</p>

      <p>“I’ll lend you some of my power. It’s dragon force, so it should be a good substitute.”</p>

      <p>More than a substitute. It made Xienhua stronger than ever before—by human standards. It was little more than a rounding error in Velgrynd’s mind, though, so without any more hesitation, she placed her dragon aura around Xienhua. The force stabilized Xienhua’s power, strengthening her entire body. It didn’t bring her to Saint level all by itself, but now Xienhua was fully awakened into an Enlightened state.</p>

      <p>“This—this must be the divine power that Longhuang gave only to our founder…!”</p>

      <p>Li, left reeling at all of this, sounded oddly happy about the turn of events. His expression was exactly as it had been back in his human days.</p>

      <p><a id="page-184"></a>“Heh-heh-heh… <em>That’s</em> how I like to see that kid. It’s hard to aspire to be someone unless they’re high up in the sky.”</p>

      <p>Once again, he considered himself Xienhua’s greatest rival. Even from his perspective as a <em>yohma</em> general, she looked so much more powerful to him. And while Xienhua was too elated to notice, becoming Enlightened had just greatly extended her natural life span. She would eventually become the “Dragon Fist Master,” one of the world’s guardians, after reaching a height that not even Long himself could dream of—but that’s another story.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Pulcinella, whom Velgrynd had so rudely thrown out of her way, couldn’t understand what had happened to him. It might not have been up to the standard of Cornu of the Three Mystic Leaders, but he was sure the power he’d just gained was absolute. Instead, here he was experiencing the most unbearable of pain.</p>

      <p><em>What…? What’s going on?! Why am I feeling pain like some human being?!</em></p>

      <p>The reason was simple—Velgrynd’s dark-red “cardinal aura” could burn anyone who touched it to ashes. She had been going as easy as possible with him, since she had no intention of killing back there…plus, she assumed, having a brush like that would hopefully teach him to avoid any more foolishness. But he was more drunk on the idea of himself as king than she’d thought. He’d failed to see reality, and now he was stepping into territory he never should’ve found himself in.</p>

      <p>“A surprise attack? How clever of you.”</p>

      <p>Those were the words of a tried-and-true minion, one who failed to realize just how yawning the gap in ability between them was. Not even Velgrynd could have imagined anyone addressing her like that. So, not giving him any more thought, she turned toward her next concern.</p>

      <p>Billy and David were still facing each other. Velgrynd, sneaking up behind the latter, slapped her hand down on his head—a cardinal-aura-infused blow that instantly vaporized the <em>yohma</em> <a id="page-185"></a>inside. It was an astonishing show of force, but that was par for the course for her.</p>

      <p>As she did this, Pulcinella stepped up. Realizing he was in trouble, he barked out an order to Delia.</p>

      <p>“Give me your spear!”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>“You can’t access its full power anyway! It’d be far happier with me than in the hands of some worthless coward like you!”</p>

      <p>As faulty as that logic was, it didn’t stop Pulcinella from snatching the spear away. He could promptly feel its power. It made him laugh. Now, for certain, he could end the day victorious.</p>

      <p>Delia was thrown to the ground. Her former teammates ran up to her.</p>

      <p>“You all right?” Bright asked, speaking for the entire team. Delia, hearing this, let a tear fall down her cheek.</p>

      <p>“Don’t be stupid. I’m not human. I’m a <em>yohma</em> who invaded this world—”</p>

      <p>“But you’re crying. Those tears are all the evidence we need to know you’re still human.”</p>

      <p>“Bright…”</p>

      <p>“Besides, you still have all your memories, yes?”</p>

      <p>“Just chase that <em>yohma</em> out of there!”</p>

      <p>“Come on. You’re too brazen a woman to let a <em>yohma</em> beat you.”</p>

      <p>There, at that moment, Delia could clearly hear something shattering in her heart.</p>

      <p>“Hold on, Katarina, you better apologize before you keep that cheerleader act up! What do you mean, I’m brazen?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, I’ll stand by that,” a tearful Katarina replied as she held Delia. “You’re too brazen to go down <em>this</em> easy. That much I believe.”</p>

      <p>The rest of the Seven Sacred Treasures joined her. There was no need for any more words. Seeing her friends shout for joy, one after the other, Delia smiled from the bottom of her heart.</p>

      <p>Pulcinella, watching this, just sniffed at them.</p>

      <p>“Lord. <em>This</em> is why humans are so worthless…”</p>

      <p>David, too, had regained his sanity thanks to Velgrynd. Delia was the last person still faithful to Pulcinella, but apparently her <a id="page-186"></a>human consciousness had won out in the end. Even worse, by the looks of things, Amari couldn’t be trusted to do much better, either. <em>His</em> human side seemed to have the upper hand now, and Pulcinella doubted Amari’d be fighting alongside him.</p>

      <p>Nonetheless, he didn’t see any problems. He was still powerful, and he had just gained one of the world’s most powerful weapons.</p>

      <p><em>This spear… It truly is a God-class menace! It’s not even trying to recognize me as its master, but it’s still strong enough for me. I can easily use this to take care of this annoying Velgrynd woman.</em></p>

      <p>He was endlessly optimistic, if nothing else. But it was simply hopeless, how little he knew his place. Even in his mind, however, there were alarm bells ringing. Now he was poring over the knowledge that the vanished <em>yohma</em> had given him, searching for something related to Velgrynd. If he could examine it closely enough…</p>

      <p>“I suppose I can only rely on myself now. Very well. I will simply take care of you personally!”</p>

      <p>“I’m sorry, are you referring to me?”</p>

      <p>“You truly <em>are</em> a foolish woman! Who else would I be ref—? <em>Hrrgnngh</em>…?!”</p>

      <p>He’d openly demonstrated his intent to kill. That was ill-advised. Velgrynd had let him go this long because she just wasn’t interested in him, but now she recognized him as an enemy.</p>

      <p>Despite it all, Velgrynd had still tried not to kill him with the shot she’d just landed, knowing there was a chance he could come back from his <em>yohma</em> self. The problem with Pulcinella was that he had done little more than take over the will of his <em>yohma</em>; the core of it was still there. The blow she’d just given Pulcinella had shattered that core for good.</p>

      <p>“Well,” she said, beaming, “that’s the end of my job. It looks like that man over there won against the <em>yohma</em> himself, so that means nobody’s possessed any longer.”</p>

      <p>Before all of this began, there had been six mystic leaders in this conference hall. David and Emile had had their <em>yohma</em> powers plucked out by Velgrynd, making them regular human beings again. Amari, Li, and Delia had overcome their <em>yohma</em> without external aid; their mystic powers were still there, but that wasn’t <a id="page-187"></a>any problem in Velgrynd’s eyes. Finally, Pulcinella had just had his <em>yohma</em> core destroyed, which likely meant those powers were gone—but something wasn’t quite right with him.</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh-heh… Well, thank you. Thank you very much. Now the hateful seal that was blocking my powers has been removed!”</p>

      <p>He had fully taken in his <em>yohma</em> powers now. They were starting to externally transform him. His skin turned a shade of light blue, his eyes glowing red, and unlike the other low-level mystics, he was even growing wings like an angel. The gear his <em>yohma</em> possessed had transformed into the holy robes he wore; this garment was untold numbers of years old, making it among the best the Legend class could offer.</p>

      <p>The spear he took from Delia had transformed as well—into a <em>khakkhara</em>, a staff crowned by a set of metal rings. The weapon had accepted Pulcinella as its owner, and while he lacked the magicules to fully unleash its powers, he felt like his magical energy had been doubled.</p>

      <p>Now Pulcinella felt like he was at the very peak of his life. But his foolish arrogance had grown with his strength. Now he truly felt like nobody could stop him.</p>

      <p>It almost offended Velgrynd. <em>Is he really that much of an idiot?</em> she thought—but she decided to let him be. Being an absolute font of strength, she saw no need to panic.</p>

      <p>Pulcinella, not realizing this, began to laugh loudly. “This feels <em>so</em> comfortable. With this power, perhaps I could best Lord Cornu himself…”</p>

      <p>That was how omnipotent he felt at the moment. His powers had, in fact, risen to the level of an awakened demon lord, and he felt like he had surpassed all limits placed on him before now. But he was measuring these achievements using a very tiny yardstick indeed.</p>

      <p>“Forget it. He’s at least ten times more powerful. It wouldn’t even be close.”</p>

      <p>He was making such a stupid mistake, Velgrynd couldn’t help but interject.</p>

      <p>Pulcinella, the target of this derision, was enraged. “Well,” he <a id="page-188"></a>said. “A sad thing <em>some</em> fools here don’t understand how the world works.”</p>

      <p><em>Speak for yourself</em>, thought everyone else in the room.</p>

      <p>It was at this point that Velgrynd realized Pulcinella was talking about her. She didn’t understand why, though. His attitude seemed to indicate he thought he could beat her, but she couldn’t guess what basis he had for that. She had known the <em>yohma</em> for a long while, so she couldn’t believe that someone among them wouldn’t be aware of who she was. Maybe it’d have been understandable among the lowest-level mystics, but a high-end one—a former angel connected to the Three Mystic Leaders, no less—should have been quivering with fear at the mere mention of her name. Against the strongest of True Dragons, that was simply a natural response.</p>

      <p>But Pulcinella’s reaction was just too unnatural. It gave Velgrynd pause. She wondered if she was making some sort of mistake.</p>

      <p>“You know, I’ve been curious—you’re being awfully rude. When you said ‘fool’ just now, you weren’t referring to me, were you?”</p>

      <p>After her long journey, Velgrynd had grown surprisingly patient. She would describe herself as a graceful, piteous woman…and even if that wasn’t <em>quite</em> true, she had certainly cultivated a gentler side of herself compared to before. That was why she asked that question instead of flying into a rage—but Pulcinella took this as a cue to get carried away.</p>

      <p>“You don’t realize? You may have <em>some</em> strength, but you really need to stop being so full of yourself. Because outside of this world, there is an even greater world—”</p>

      <p><em>Wow. He really doesn’t know.</em></p>

      <p>Now it dawned on Velgrynd. Pulcinella had overcome his <em>yohma</em> self and was moving of his own free will. At the same time, she pitied him. Masahiko Amari had been taken over, but had used the experience to gain as much <em>yohma</em> knowledge as possible. This man, on the other hand, sought nothing but power.</p>

      <p><em>And that’s why he’s grown this arrogant. He doesn’t even know the most essential of facts.</em></p>

      <p>Realizing that made her more exasperated than angry. She turned <a id="page-189"></a>toward Gensei and the others, ignoring Pulcinella as he pressed on with his little speech.</p>

      <p>“What do you think is best to do with this man? I broke his <em>yohma</em> core, but his power’s still intact. At this rate, not even I can fully handle this.”</p>

      <p>By “handle this,” she meant taking his powers away from him. But Pulcinella took it the wrong way.</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh-heh! Of course you can’t! It’s a little bit too late to get cold feet, isn’t it?!”</p>

      <p>He took those words to mean that Velgrynd couldn’t defeat him. No matter what he faced, he always saw things breaking his way.</p>

      <p>“If you admit your defeat, I will make you my underling out of respect for your goodwill. You will soon appreciate my mercy when I appoint you to— <em>Brrnnhh</em>?!”</p>

      <p>“Silence.”</p>

      <p>Another slap from Velgrynd. Pulcinella was helpless to react…and only then did he realize something wasn’t going to plan. <em>Am I making a great mistake?!</em> he thought, hurriedly attempting to search through his memories. But he wouldn’t find anything at all. When Velgrynd had destroyed his <em>yohma</em> core a moment ago, all the memory data that came with it had disappeared.</p>

      <p><em>No… No, no!</em></p>

      <p>Pulcinella felt overcome by a sense of dread for reasons he couldn’t define. Leaving him be, Velgrynd turned toward Gensei again.</p>

      <p>“If I let this man live, I’m sure it’d present problems for all of you. I think it’s better to kill him, but what do you think?”</p>

      <p>Whether Pulcinella lived or not was of little importance to her. But no matter what she chose, she couldn’t just leave him like this. Things would be fine as long as Oharu was alive and Velgrynd was around to protect him—but after that, there was no telling. Upon Oharu’s death, Velgrynd would zoom right off to the next soul fragment of Ludora’s, no longer caring what happened on this world…and after that, no one would be able to stop Pulcinella. But Velgrynd also knew that reincarnations of Ludora came back to this world on a cyclical basis, passed down through a family bloodline. <a id="page-190"></a>Letting Pulcinella do whatever he wanted with this planet wasn’t in her best interests, either.</p>

      <p>Neither Gensei nor anyone else could stop him. That much was clear. And that’s why dispatching him right here and right now was the quickest path for everyone.</p>

      <p>“You’re right, yes, but…”</p>

      <p>There was nobody here from Greater Rossiam. Killing one of that empire’s greatest heroes was bound to leave a bad taste in the mouth. Everyone here knew it was the right call, but nobody was too enthusiastic about it. Velgrynd knew that, and that’s why she wanted more opinions. In other words, she wasn’t keeping Pulcinella alive out of kindness—it was because she concluded that killing him right now could cause Oharu untold trouble later.</p>

      <p>So she left the decision to the others. It wouldn’t be an easy one; they were all from other nations. If they talked it over and decided to let Pulcinella off the hook, Velgrynd was prepared to accept that. Amari certainly knew what she was doing here, as did everyone else. That knowledge emboldened them to speak freely.</p>

      <p>“We have no other choice but to execute him,” Amari said. “We can just tell everyone that I did it while possessed by my <em>yohma</em>. If Greater Rossiam demands I be put in their custody, you can go ahead and offer me.”</p>

      <p>“No… I agree that we need to finish him off,” a cautious Gensei replied, “but there’s no need for you to sacrifice yourself. We can give them the whole story and try to win them over.”</p>

      <p>“He’s right,” David said. “I mean, if reasoning with them won’t make them understand, we can just apply the right kind of pressure instead. We in Azeria would be glad to help.”</p>

      <p>“I think your words could be misconstrued, Commander, but I do agree that execution is the right choice.”</p>

      <p>“Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and stuff. That’s what my grandfather always said. I think Pulcinella has nobody but himself to blame for this.”</p>

      <p>Between Billy’s and Emile’s responses, the decision was unanimous among the Azerians. Laurent Hayes, Emile’s grandfather, <a id="page-191"></a>had only relied on Velgrynd’s assistance for the most insipid of things. The recollection made her smile a bit.</p>

      <p>The reaction from the Chinese Fiefdoms, meanwhile, was along the lines of tacit approval. They had been invaded by Greater Rossiam; there was little love lost between them, and so they politely refrained from commenting in depth.</p>

      <p>The Arcians, on the other hand, were thirsty for blood.</p>

      <p>“We can make up any kind of story we want afterward. Let’s kill him.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. That bastard pushed Delia down, stole her weapon… I wish I could tear him apart with my own hands.”</p>

      <p>“I can’t say I blame you. I have no reason to be against it, no.”</p>

      <p>“Same.”</p>

      <p>“…”</p>

      <p>Given how one of their own had been hurt, they certainly weren’t holding back their emotions.</p>

      <p>Hearing all this, Pulcinella realized just how dire the situation was.</p>

      <p><em>At this rate, this woman Velgrynd may just kill me. Before she can—</em></p>

      <p>He tried to find a way out, secretly concentrating his full mind and body on this one goal. Then, noticing Velgrynd had her back turned, he attempted a surprise attack. Any pride he had as a man of the cloth was gone; the laws of chivalry didn’t matter on the brink of death.</p>

      <p>“<em>You’re</em> going to die! Behold the might of my full-bore strike!”</p>

      <p>This was the Divine Dispelling Light of Destruction, a secret, forbidden Spiritualist skill that used divine blessings to destroy evil and its servants. His <em>yohma</em> power was added to this, creating a flow of energy more massive than anything this world had ever measured.</p>

      <p>The shock waves alone caused tremendous damage. The earth shook; the very air seemed to grate against itself. The base that had been remade into the <em>yohma</em> headquarters began to collapse, unable to take the strain. It was impervious to airstrikes and could even serve as a nuclear fallout shelter, but not even that was enough. The <a id="page-192"></a>empty space between Pulcinella and Velgrynd was buried in less than a second—such was the instantaneous effect of the damage, something clear to anyone that could see it.</p>

      <p><em>I won! No life-form exists that could withstand this force. And now I am the ruler of this world— Huh?</em></p>

      <p>As Pulcinella attempted to gloat over his victory, he saw it—the energy force, now shaped like a spear, cleanly inserted into Velgrynd’s unguarded back. But she wasn’t hurt. It hadn’t worked. It couldn’t have. He was fighting Velgrynd, after all. A quantity of energy large enough to destroy this entire continent had been neutralized and dissipated in a single instant.</p>

      <p>“Can you wait quietly until we reach a conclusion, please?” she said, as if nothing had happened. And then Pulcinella knew. He could never defeat Velgrynd. If he had given up at that juncture, perhaps things would have wound up differently. But there was no point theorizing about that. Because Pulcinella, never knowing when to quit, was about to tap into something he never should have.</p>

      <p class="tx1">“Well, what can I say? I never realized there was someone I couldn’t defeat on this world. A grave miscalculation…but you still can’t touch me.”</p>

      <p>“Why is that?”</p>

      <p>“Because I am a very careful man. I always pretended to be a good man so no one would bear a grudge against me. I only stopped because I thought victory was assured. I never imagined there was anyone like you…but victory is still mine. I’ve already taken the necessary measures.”</p>

      <p>“Can you quit stalling, please? Just give me the summary.”</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh-heh… Why the hurry? But all right—I’ll tell you. The nations of Azeria, Greater Rossiam, and Arcia have all been hard at work developing a new kind of bomb. They all work on the same principle, although each nation’s working on a different design—but what matters is the force of this weapon.”</p>

      <p>“And you’re going to use this bomb to kill me?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-193"></a>“No, nothing like that. I believe I can withstand the blast, and if I could, I’m sure that you can.”</p>

      <p>“Oh? So why are you bringing this up?”</p>

      <p>“Don’t rush me. I can certainly understand your anxieties, but…”</p>

      <p>Pulcinella was now teasing Velgrynd, greatly irritating her. She knew that was on purpose, but she played along. Pulcinella was the kind of coward who’d attempt a sneak attack while they debated whether to kill him or not. Taking him out right now was clearly the correct option, but she decided to hear him out anyway.</p>

      <p>The reason for that was simple—it was to keep any future trouble out of her life. If he was going to lay his scheme bare for her right now, it was only polite that she listen to the whole thing. That, and she was sure things would be fine no matter what kind of trick he had up his sleeve.</p>

      <p>It was thus with a placid mind that Velgrynd kept listening…but the next thing he had to say took the smile off her face.</p>

      <p>“But here is my plan! I am going to steal these bombs and set them off above the capitals of each nation. I already have my people in place for it. It’s too late to do anything now!”</p>

      <p>It was a literal bombshell announcement.</p>

      <p>“Are you crazy?! If you do that, it’d claim so many innocent lives!”</p>

      <p>“You have to be kidding me! If you take out the leadership of all the nations, it’d destroy all sense of order!”</p>

      <p>“The <em>yohma</em>’s basic plan was to raise the human race to serve as their bodies, not destroy them! What are you even thinking?!”</p>

      <p>Pulcinella’s lips twisted into a smile at all the shouting.</p>

      <p>“Ahhh, how lovely to hear. Yes, I suppose I can’t blame you for panicking. It deeply pains me as well. Much as you said, Mr. Amari, it is best to help humanity grow and thrive—but the fact is, there are far more people than there are <em>yohma</em>. Being possessed by one should be all it takes to help you survive this era of war. None of it will affect us at all—and we’ll just collect the survivors and raise them instead!”</p>

      <p>The plan had been delayed quite a bit, Pulcinella admitted. But, as he boasted, there was still nothing to stop it. The logic was highly questionable, but he wasn’t terribly off the mark, either.</p>

      <p><a id="page-194"></a>It made Amari grow quiet. Gensei looked just as pale as he turned toward Velgrynd. Pulcinella had done all that talking in an attempt to stall for time, no doubt. The plan was ticking right along, even as they spoke.</p>

      <p>Now, there was nothing Gensei or anyone else could do. The only possibility left to them involved relying on Velgrynd’s teleportation. There would be a lot of casualties, no doubt, but they needed to be sure each nation’s top government officials were brought to safety. They were all evacuated to the Conquering Empire of Japan at the moment, fortunately, so Gensei assumed Velgrynd could guarantee their escape.</p>

      <p>That’s why he gave her a look—but he instantly regretted it. What he saw there was an angry goddess. Pulcinella’s scheme had brought her wrath to the forefront.</p>

      <p>“It pains me as much as it does you to see innocent people die,” Pulcinella continued, failing to read the room. “If I could, I’d try to avoid that as much as possible. But what do you think? Why don’t you let me go for now? If we agree not to interfere with each other, I’ll gladly give you Japan—no, half the globe, even!”</p>

      <p>Given the threat of those bombs, he thought he had ample material to negotiate with. But that was just wishful thinking.</p>

      <p>“Lowlife. I didn’t mind how you targeted me, no matter how low you stooped, but I will <em>not</em> let you do anything that gets my man involved. You will never return to the cycle of life again. I will crush your soul and grant you eternal suffering.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd was, at the core, a vengeful woman. She was strong, and that gave her an “above it all” attitude in most situations—but flip the switch, and she’d fly into a rage.</p>

      <p>“W-wait! I told you, I have no interest in— Wait! Listen to me! My people are going to set off the bombs unless I order them to stop! I have them on standby right now above the capitals of all five nations. Please, let’s all just take a deep breath and—”</p>

      <p>“Will you shut up already? I took care of that long ago.”</p>

      <p>“Eh?”</p>

      <p>Pulcinella couldn’t parse this. Neither could anyone else in the room. What she meant was a total mystery. It didn’t exactly seem <a id="page-195"></a>like a bluff. It had the ring of truth to it, but how could she have protected five different countries while remaining in this conference hall?</p>

      <p>That, of course, was because Velgrynd had Parallel Existence, a skill that made such a feat completely possible.</p>

      <p>She would never leave Oharu’s side for any reason, which kept the Conquering Empire safe. She could also travel instantly to any point she had visited before, and she had been to Azeria, Arcia, Rossiam, and the Chinese Fiefdoms. That eliminated any potential problems. All she’d had to do was send out some Parallel Existences, bring them to each nation, find the <em>yohma</em> hiding in them, and blow them away with their bombs.</p>

      <p>And the task was already done.</p>

      <p>“No… That’s impossible. That’s completely impossible—!”</p>

      <p>Pulcinella frantically tried reaching out to his agents. The result was silence—and indeed, they had been silenced well before now. Faced with this reality, his face twisted in terror. Now, in a very literal way, he understood just how boundlessly dangerous the beautiful woman before him was.</p>

      <p>“Please—please forgive me…”</p>

      <p>“Nuh-uh.”</p>

      <p>It’s said there is nothing scarier than the smile of an angry woman—and everyone there now knew this to be the truth.</p>

      <p>“No, noooooooooo—!”</p>

      <p>“Cardinal Acceleration!”</p>

      <p>Behind the fleeing Pulcinella, there was a flash like a supernova. Enveloped by searing rays of heat, Pulcinella’s soul was crushed to nothing.</p>

      <p>And that wasn’t the only damage. Velgrynd had intended to keep it as small-scale as possible, but it’d had enough force to wipe out a good third of this continent. The survivors could only stare blankly. The goddess before them seemed so beautiful, and so fearsome.</p>
