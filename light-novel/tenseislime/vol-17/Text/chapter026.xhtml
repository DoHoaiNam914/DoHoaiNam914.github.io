      <p class="noindent"><a id="page-268"></a><a id="page-269"></a>Hello, everybody. My name is Raine. What? You don’t know who I am? Don’t give me that shit. You <em>better</em> learn my name, or else you’re in for it. Go back to school, kid.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>Oh, pardon me. I think I lost it a little there. No, no, I’m usually quite modest and graceful, but sometimes I fly off the handle a bit. Just every now and then, you know.</p>

      <p>But since some of you don’t seem to know who I am, allow me to introduce myself. As I mentioned a moment ago, my name is Raine. I work as a servant—no, as a maid. I serve as a faithful maid to the demon lord Guy Crimson.</p>

      <p>I’ve known Sir Guy for a long time. Looking back, I knew him even before the creation of the world. How long ago was that, you ask? How the hell should I know, huh? Do <em>you</em> remember the exact time of day <em>you</em> were born? You don’t, do you? It’s that sort of thing. I’ll be ignoring stupid questions from now on, thank you.</p>

      <p>Regardless, having been derived from the great spirit of darkness, I was invincible. Or I thought I was. I was a little full of myself, I won’t deny that. Consequently, I committed a grave mistake. I joined hands with one of my sisters, a person I had an affinity <a id="page-270"></a>for, and I attempted to stage a surprise attack on one of our other siblings, someone stronger than us. Looking back, I was such an idiot. He was incredibly strong. I thought fighting him two-on-one would make for an easy victory, but we lost big-time.</p>

      <p>The person who beat us was the demon lord Guy Crimson, known at the time as Rouge. And while I’m at it, the sister who fought him with me was Vert, now known as Mizeri. We’re very good friends. My work is Mizeri’s to do, and her salary is mine to receive, after all. We’re still coworkers today.</p>

      <p>“Raine! Quit goofing off and get the cleaning done.”</p>

      <p>Tch. I just introduced her, and already she’s tearing into me. Stupid loudmouth.</p>

      <p>“What did you say?” she asked.</p>

      <p>“Nothing, nothing.”</p>

      <p>“No? I hope not.”</p>

      <p>Close one there. Mizeri’s got a real sharp mind like that. She always notices whenever I take a break, and it’s painfully difficult to pull the wool over her eyes. I’ll get back to cleaning—just for a bit, anyway, so she won’t get mad at me again.</p>

      <p>Regardless—right, right, I was in the middle of my introductions.</p>

      <p>So Mizeri and I lost to Sir Guy, but that unveiled a certain fact to us. If you can break a demon’s “core,” they’ll be eradicated for good. However! If you’re a talented Primal like all of us are, you can resurrect yourself no matter what happens to you!!</p>

      <p>With True Dragons, this process resets their personality even though they keep their memories, but in our case, the personality remains the same, too. Lady Velzard, the Ice Dragon and companion to Sir Guy, “reset” her younger brother in this fashion in order to reeducate him, but that won’t work with Primals like us.</p>

      <p>Isn’t that, like, totally amazing? I wish I could boast about it all day to you, trust me. But, sadly, there are some disadvantages to this. The resurrection process takes a lot of time, but that’s just a little detail. The toughest part is that although you’re immortal and all, you have to be eternally subordinate to whoever you lost to. In our case, that was Sir Guy.</p>

      <p>This discovery triggered a sea change in the power balance <a id="page-271"></a>between demons, creating a new, heavily skewed sort of status quo. You could call this all our fault—or you could say it was thanks to us, to put a rosier spin on it. Mizeri prefers to see it from the former perspective, but I’m more a fan of the latter.</p>

      <p>Did you know that? You aren’t prejudiced against me, are you? Stop looking at me like I’m some wicked child. Besides, you should be paying attention to me. I’m clueing you in on a little demon secret: specifically, how to kill demons.</p>

      <p>In a way, that is. It’s impossible to fully destroy a Primal, but you <em>can</em> make them servile to you. It’s not exactly as forceful as slavery, so it’s not like you have to follow any order given to you or anything. If I wanted to defy Sir Guy, I could. Not that I would. He <em>can</em> force us to obey him a little, after all.</p>

      <p>Next, I’ll talk about the demons directly descended from the Primals. Normally, except for that idiot Noir, Primals create a whole lot of progenies. They have to follow orders from their boss of the same color, so it’s like having a useful army of maids at your beck and call.</p>

      <p>Using the term “create” might cause some confusion. I don’t want to go into all the little details, but here’s a basic rundown. A newborn Lesser Demon has no color associated with it, you see? It’s intelligent, but has no sense of self, and it’s really weak, too. This is mostly the type that humans can summon, what we call the “enslaved” type. When these demons gain sentience, they’re called the “independent” type. When they evolve into Greater Demons, their natures and personalities result in a set of unique characteristics, which make it clearer exactly which color family they belong to.</p>

      <p>That, or a more powerful demon might scout them in order to create their own faction. That may be the more common approach to building a following, actually. Mizeri’s a hard worker, so she still manages her own faction today. She runs several organizations, the Sons of the Veldt being the most well-known one, and they even have clout in the human world.</p>

      <p>Me? Well, I can’t be bothered with all that.</p>

      <p>…Don’t roll your eyes at me, you. What? I’m the same as Noir? <a id="page-272"></a>What utter bullshit! I <em>do</em> have a faction of my own, you know! Being compared to Noir pisses me off, so don’t make that same foolish mistake again, please. Ugh.</p>

      <p>But back to the topic. Newborn demons don’t get involved with factions, but once they evolve into Greater Demons, that’s when they get divided up by color and join one. Some demons are born with a color already associated with them; that’s often the case with reincarnated demons. Demons are immortal, so if they die, they just get reborn like that. Even these, however, can be destroyed if their core is shattered, I think. Demons are pretty tough, though, so maybe even losing their “soul” like that may still be survivable. That’s especially true if you’re closely aligned with the Primal colors. If you’re lucky enough to defeat one, though, you also have to break their core, or your victory will have been pointless.</p>

      <p>By the way, you don’t have to be particularly fearful of a newborn, weak-willed demon. They might have battle knowledge, but they’re just wimps with no experience, so even destroying their temporary bodies might be enough to kill them. They’re nothing worth losing sleep over.</p>

      <p>So, yeah, those are our secrets. And figuring all this out might just have made our loss against Sir Guy worth it. If anything, I think I did a pretty good job there.</p>

      <p class="tx1">It’s with this self-sacrificial spirit that we continue to serve Sir Guy, but it’s actually pretty fun for me. Sir Guy has taken a step back from the struggle for supremacy in the underworld in order to go live on the planet’s surface for a while. He’s a man of integrity, despite everything, so he took us along with him.</p>

      <p>He even told us <em>“you know you’re free to live whatever lives you want, right?”</em> but count me out of that. I want to stick with the <em>winning</em> team. And there’s no way Sir Guy would ever lose, so I think I’m in the best position I could possibly find right now. It’d be kind of neat if Sir Guy <em>did</em> lose, but regardless.</p>

      <p>Here was my answer to him:</p>

      <p><a id="page-273"></a><em>“No; our duty is to be of use to you.”</em></p>

      <p>What do you think? I’m just the most perfect maid ever, wouldn’t you agree? You won’t find another maid as faithful as I am…or so I thought…</p>

      <p>“Precisely. You are our king. We are your subjects. That is the eternal, unrelenting truth.”</p>

      <p>Damn it, Mizeri. Acting like <em>such</em> a good little girl, and <em>now</em> look at her! And the worst part of it is, she probably means every word. It’s always an adventure, trying to deal with this rival of mine.</p>

      <p>Of course, I might see her as my eternal rival, someone I’m burning to get back at my whole life, but—you know—Mizeri seems to trust me well enough, so I stopped trying to teach her a lesson. You just can’t beat her, I don’t think. Maybe it’s not exactly what either of us wanted, but either way, we’re as inseparable as ever.</p>

      <p class="space-break">So after a bunch of wandering around, we settled down at our current base. It’s in a frigid land, one far too cold to support life, but I’m a demon so it’s no big deal.</p>

      <p>Okay, just kidding.</p>

      <p>I mean, for example, when I tried washing some clothes, it didn’t work because they just froze solid. I punched a dress, frustrated, and it just shattered on me. (Yes, I was pretty angry.)</p>

      <p>So, yes, there were some trip-ups along the way, but I’m doing fine here.</p>

      <p><em>“You should be more regretful!”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Raine, I really think you should be more considerate of me…”</em></p>

      <p>Sir Guy gave me a warning, so I was more careful around him afterward.</p>

      <p>Problems like these are exactly what my army of servants is for. Do your best for me, okay? You’re here to make my life easier, after all! And ever since then, I haven’t made a single mistake. I’ve grown a lot, you see.</p>

      <p>Speaking of my work, it involves a lot more than just doing the laundry. Some people call me an “omnipotent maid,” and that really <em>is</em> how talented the two of us are. Cooking, laundry, song and dance, musical performance, even art—we cover it all to handle Sir <a id="page-274"></a>Guy’s requests. I’d occasionally mess up the cooking and laundry, but we’re all capable of learning from our mistakes, aren’t we? The same is true of demons, so let’s just forget about the past.</p>

      <p>My personal talent, by the way, is painting. I just love abstract art. I had Mizeri model for me earlier, and she was so moved by the results that she started crying.</p>

      <p>“No, I was furious.”</p>

      <p>“Then it was a great success!”</p>

      <p>“You, I swear…”</p>

      <p>Mizeri’s acting all annoyed with me, but I don’t care. I wouldn’t describe her as “furious” so much as, you know, just bursting with emotion. That’s something pretty unusual to see from a spiritual life-form like a demon. It made me almost scared of my own talents.</p>

      <p>…Oh, and this goes without saying, but when I paint Sir Guy or Lady Velzard, I always stick to pure representational realism. I’ve got it down perfect, so they always praise me a lot.</p>

      <p>“Oh, sure. You <em>can</em> paint if you actually try. That’s what made me so angry at you…”</p>

      <p>Sounds like Mizeri’s saying something, but let’s just tune it out like always.</p>

      <p class="space-break">By the way, let me tell you about one of my other hobbies.</p>

      <p>Life in the frigid wastes can be pretty grueling; it’s no place for anyone to live, really. There’s an incessant blizzard outside, just a solid sheet of white. That’s our constant background, but within our Barrier, it’s always a lovely summer’s day. We even modified the geography to construct a lake, complete with a white, sandy beach. Sometimes I go over there and just relax on one of our beach chairs, having my demon lackeys serve me. It’s the best entertainment I know.</p>

      <p>I couldn’t tell you just how much energy I waste on my hobbies. Just thinking about it, I can’t resist grinning like an idiot. Sir Guy loves it, too.</p>

      <p><em>“The things she comes up with—yes, Raine’s just the best.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“I have to admit it. You really</em> are <em>amazing, Raine.”</em></p>

      <p><a id="page-275"></a>Hee-hee. Even Mizeri praised me. Hopefully I can keep taking advantage of hobbies in my regular work like this.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">

      <p class="tx1">Oh, right—there’s one other important job I have, one I shouldn’t forget. The demon lords occasionally hold a Walpurgis Council, and it’s my duty to guide all the participants to the event site.</p>

      <p>Originally, as the name suggests, Walpurgis really <em>was</em> just a nice little dinner party with the three demon lords of the time—Sir Guy, Lady Milim, and Lady Ramiris. Lady Milim is the niece of Lady Velzard, and her power is beyond comprehension. There were times in the past where she’d lose it and just go on a rampage, and I can’t even begin to describe how rough that was. We never die, so we could have joined that battle, but it could have led to the destruction of the entire planet—so in the end, it was me, Mizeri, and Lady Velzard stamping out all the aftereffects of the fight.</p>

      <p>If you think I’ll do <em>that</em> again, you got another thing coming. If Lady Ramiris hadn’t lent a hand, we might have been down for the count before things finally wrapped up. Sir Guy’s a big fan of hers, and so are we.</p>

      <p>We respect Lady Milim, too, of course, so if these three demon lords were coming together for a little dinner, of course we were going to give our all to the menu for the occasion. But after a few incidents and events and so on, the Walpurgis Council started to take on a different significance. We simply had more demon lords running around, essentially. It was Sir Guy’s job to ensure the human race didn’t destroy itself, and he brought on a few more people to help with the workload.</p>

      <p class="space-break">The first one—the fourth demon lord overall—was Sir Daggrull.</p>

      <p>He, as a matter of fact, had been the one who’d taken the most damage in the battle between Sir Guy and Lady Milim. He was helping us out as well, you see, ensuring the battle didn’t wreck the whole world. He certainly hadn’t benefited much from it, though, <a id="page-276"></a>given how most of the land he ruled over was reduced to a barren wasteland…but that’s none of my business, so I’m not going to dwell on it.</p>

      <p>There’s magic available to us, of course, so he still found a way to make the land livable, but he couldn’t stop the rapid desertification too well. Things have calmed down by now, but he had a real headache or two at the time. I wished him good luck, of course…from our safe little paradise all the way up here, but still.</p>

      <p class="space-break">The next demon lord after that was Lady Luminus, the Queen of Nightmares. She was the only daughter of the lord of the vampires, and that made her incredibly strong…but let’s talk a little more about her father first.</p>

      <p>That person, you see, was a sort of demigod—the first one ever created by Sir Veldanava—and he was going to serve as a god of humanity before things went awry.</p>

      <p>He had been seeking intelligent life way back in the day, mainly because he wanted a friend to talk to. There were angels and demons by that point, so that desire was fulfilled, but next he wanted to see a bit more diversity. So he tried giving a little help to the species building civilizations on the planet. That was going to be the job of the demigod he created, although it sure didn’t work out that way. He was only a few steps removed from immortal, after all, and he didn’t really have anything to be a god <em>of</em> at the time—that was the problem. I mean, the demigod technically didn’t even have a gender, much like us demons.</p>

      <p>Thanks to that, he had to wait tens of thousands of years for some surface species to prosper well enough. I don’t know all the details, but that’s how I understand it.</p>

      <p>But the demigod didn’t give up. Sir Veldanava expected a lot from him, so he kept carrying out these forbidden experiments. What a bum! He loved beavering away at all that scientific stuff instead of creating any descendants. It’s not up to me to decide whether that was a good thing or not, but I can tell you this much: He was an idiot and a complete nuisance to all of us! I couldn’t even <a id="page-277"></a>tell you how many times those “experiments” brought humanity to the brink of total collapse.</p>

      <p>Despite that, however, all that futzing around on his part <em>did</em> create the race known as High Humans. So while he didn’t create an eternal, immortal race of demigods, he <em>did</em> contribute a lot to the development of humanity.</p>

      <p>…You don’t believe that, do you? Well, you’d be right not to. <em>I</em> sure don’t. It’s not like I was there to witness it or anything.</p>

      <p>From what I’ve been told, the demigod analyzed his own body to create two different species. One was the High Humans, and the other was the vampires, you see. It wasn’t exactly the kind of birthing people were expecting from him, but it wound up paying off, so I guess all’s well that ends well?</p>

      <p>Anyway, by the time Sir Guy was summoned to the surface, there were humans spreading all over the place. The High Humans, I mean. They had built this gigantic country, bigger than anything you see right now.</p>

      <p>But here’s the thing: Both of these species had their pluses and minuses. The High Humans had inherited a lot of powerful magic force, but their mental makeup was an issue. They were silly enough to summon Sir Guy, after all; they must have assumed they were at the very peak of intelligent life. In another world there’s a saying that goes something like <em>pride goes before the fall</em>, and that’s exactly how I would describe it. The whole thing fell apart in the blink of an eye.</p>

      <p>The vampires, meanwhile, had some big problems of their own. Although maybe that actually worked in their favor? <em>They’re</em> still around, after all.</p>

      <p>They all had powerhouse bodies and massive magical force, coupled with near-immortality and a mature, more developed mentality. Which is all great, but their inability to do anything while the sun was out was a real liability. They could never <em>truly</em> rule over the world like that.</p>

      <p>So that dumbass demigod continued with his experimentation. I was around by this point, so I pretty much remember the stuff he <a id="page-278"></a>was up to. The elementals had already split off from the great spirits, so the four major elements had already spread across the world. These elementals began to take in magicules, and in time, they manifested physical bodies as well. And that demigod was helping them along the whole time. The earth element created the high dwarves, the water element created the sirens, the fire element created the flame imps, and the wind element created the high elves.</p>

      <p>This much was allowable in itself, but then that demigod began to go <em>way</em> out of line. That moron actually began experimenting with crossbreeding them, creating all sorts of new species. For a graceful lady like me, the mere thought is simply disgusting.</p>

      <p>This led to all sorts of new races, such as elves, dwarves, ogres, beastmen, and so forth—but those are only the <em>successful</em> examples. A lot of failures were banished into the dark corners of history, and sometimes they’d even devolve into inferior monster versions of the original—the goblins, for example.</p>

      <p>Sir Guy was highly troubled by all this. He felt this needed to be addressed sooner or later—<em>buuut</em>, as long as Sir Veldanava wasn’t deigning to take action, he couldn’t punish the demigod on his own initiative. The way he saw it, the world had become a lot more needlessly complex than it had to be—but, at the same time, a lot more interesting as well. But that’s <em>Sir Guy’s</em> business, you know? Personally, it was no skin off my nose at all, so I was just fine with it.</p>

      <p>“You just like watching me stew in my own juices, don’t you?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, no, not at all! You misunderstand me, Sir Guy. I am your ever-faithful maid.”</p>

      <p>I gave him a beautiful curtsy. Being able to perfectly hide my intentions like this was the result of regular, constant effort.</p>

      <p>So anyway, despite overcoming this and that danger, the demigod was still giving us a lot of trouble. But—get this—it was ultimately his own experiments that did him in.</p>

      <p>“Ahh, my daughter! You are my greatest creation yet—”</p>

      <p>“Your day of judgment is here. Disintegration!”</p>

      <p>He had it coming, really. His “daughter”—another demigod, created from his own body—immediately rendered him into a pile of ash, amazingly enough. You could say he took just one step too far <a id="page-279"></a>that time. It was a great relief to me, but don’t tell anyone about that.</p>

      <p>Those were the top secret events behind the creation of Lady Luminus, the fifth demon lord, and you <em>better</em> not breathe a word about it to anybody else, all right?</p>

      <p class="space-break">So as the demon lord numbers grew, we eventually had a sixth one join the flock. That was Sir Deeno.</p>

      <p>By the way, is it all right if I speak my mind freely for a few moments? …Oh, I already am? Well, no need to hold back, then. Let’s just say it. I <em>hate</em> having to call him “Sir” Deeno. I mean, he’s just a pile of garbage. He never lifts a finger to do a single moment of work. He’s the walking definition of depravity.</p>

      <p>I mean, it’d be one thing if all he did was not work, but it’s even worse than that. He pushes work on <em>me</em> instead! I can’t have this. He’s <em>not</em> getting away with it any longer. If he’s gonna do that, he should bother Mizeri instead. Then I could forgive it.</p>

      <p>But when I made that suggestion to him, what do you think he said?</p>

      <p><em>“No, but when I ask Mizeri, she gets all angry at me, y’know?”</em></p>

      <p>That! Are you <em>kidding</em> me?! I get just as angry! And if he puts it <em>that</em> way, it means he sees Mizeri as a lot scarier than me, doesn’t it? I mean, I get yelled at a lot, too, and it’s not that I <em>don’t</em> resent having to deal with Mizeri sometimes, but…</p>

      <p>What? He and I are a lot alike? What are you, stupid? Are you trying to disrespect the Primal Demons? Some things, you know, are much better off left unsaid. If you don’t understand that, don’t blame me if someone tears you limb from limb. That’s your friend Raine giving you a friendly word of advice.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Anyway, there were now six demon lords, and that made our Walpurgis Councils a lot more like business meetings. It used to be just a fun meal between friends, but now it was more like <em>work</em>, I guess you could say? It’s all such a pain, so count me <em>way</em> out.</p>

      <p><a id="page-280"></a>“Raine!”</p>

      <p>Just kidding. I’m their guide to the meeting, and I’ll do my job.</p>

      <p>Everybody seems so busy, though—well, everybody except one person, but… Oh? It just occurred to me. We’re all working on this like a full-time job, but it doesn’t feel like our main job of managing humanity is getting any easier, does it?</p>

      <p>Take Sir Guy, for example. He’s beyond busy, with Mizeri helping him out all the time outside Walpurgis meetings. I really need to give them all the support they need. When it comes to cooking and laundry, just leave it to me.</p>

      <p>Next, Lady Milim. She’s surprisingly dedicated to her job. If a little squabble arises between two countries, she steps in and punishes both of them; if a powerful magic beast attacks an area, she’ll go around helping people out. Sometimes her behavior isn’t very demon lord–like, but it’s all certainly in character for her.</p>

      <p>Lady Ramiris, meanwhile, is practically a shut-in by now. She never even ventures outside the labyrinth she created for herself. But that’s fine. I owe Lady Ramiris a great deal, so she can do anything she wants, as far as I care. And I guess the same is true for Sir Daggrull, too, huh? All the cleanup work after that bout of mass destruction sure doesn’t <em>look</em> easy to me. I’m sure he’s got no time to devote to other matters, and everything he does to reduce the spread of the desert on his lands is a huge boon to us.</p>

      <p>The one who really impresses me is Lady Luminus. She’s so talented, not at all like that lout of a demigod. While I wasn’t paying attention, she brought the entire vampire race under her rule—and she’s even protecting the humans as well, the species that resulted when the High Humans lost their powers. Vampires used to see humans as nothing but a food source, but now they’re following Lady Luminus’s orders and taking care of them. I have to say, I’m amazed she ever got them to do it! What a job she did. I mean it.</p>

      <p>On the other end of the spectrum, meanwhile, is <em>that</em> lout.</p>

      <p>“Sir Deeno, why don’t you actually try to work a little for a change?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, like <em>you</em> have any right to order me around!”</p>

      <p>It makes no sense. Could there <em>be</em> any worse of an insult than <a id="page-281"></a>this? I really don’t think so. I suppose Deeno and I were just fated to be at each other’s throats all the time.</p>

      <p class="space-break">So given how things are, I wasn’t sure that even six demon lords were enough for the workload. Thus, we began to send out feelers for some new personnel—but then Lady Luminus chose that moment to retire.</p>

      <p>I’m sure it’s because the new person we found was too much of a dolt for her to abide by. He constantly treated Lady Luminus and Lady Ramiris like second-class citizens, occasionally flying into a rage to show off his powers to us, and I’m sure it stretched her patience to the limit. Lady Luminus looks like a beautiful young woman, after all, and it’s easy for a lowlife like the new guy to mistake her beauty for weakness. The easiest way to deal with this, she’d perhaps reasoned, was to install a demon lord that clearly looked more threatening than her at first sight. So Lady Luminus stepped back, and Roy came up in her place.</p>

      <p>“I will continue supporting all of you from behind the scenes. Roy will serve as demon lord to the public in my stead. Are there any objections to this?”</p>

      <p>If Deeno had said this, he’d have been derided as trying to goof off yet again. But Lady Luminus was a much more trusted contributor than that. The way things were going, everyone accepted the proposal at once.</p>

      <p>So began the start of a truly new era, a time when powerful magic-born began popping up all over the place and becoming demon lords. At the very least, they needed to be demon lord seeds, and those who satisfied that requirement—Kazalim front and center among them—and had the ambition for the job began to join our ranks, one after the other.</p>

      <p class="space-break">This marked another turning point for our Walpurgis Councils. By this, I mean the nuances that still define it today—they’re held if three members agree to it, and they’re used for working out treaties and agreements between demon lords. It’s also the place where members decide whether to accept a new demon lord or not.</p>

      <p><a id="page-282"></a>If you ask me, I think the councils are really going in the wrong direction—but Sir Guy’s getting what he wants from them, so I have no complaints. If he’s okay with it, then so am I—and that’s how a new system began to be established.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="image" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">So I took care of matters in and around Sir Guy’s life, occasionally serving as a guide for Walpurgis sessions. Demon lords would occasionally get added to or fall off the roster, and before I knew it, they came to be collectively called the Ten Great Demon Lords.</p>

      <p>That was around when that slime showed up—the demon lord Rimuru. The first time I saw him was at the Walpurgis convened by the demon lord Clayman.</p>

      <p class="space-break">Ah, I <em>do</em> miss Clayman.</p>

      <p>I suppose I should praise his courage for having nominated himself as a demon lord despite being weaker than me. He <em>was</em> very good at the boring bureaucratic work of running a demon lord’s domain, so he was actually quite helpful despite everything else about him. A real useful man, you could say—one who’d always accept an annoying job if you complimented him enough.</p>

      <p>Who knows where it began to fall apart, though…?</p>

      <p>It was really a shame, the way he met his end, but I can’t really say anything about it except that he chose to take on the wrong adversary. Mizeri was the one who picked up Sir Rimuru, but on her way back she told me, <em>“I’m not too sure Clayman has much longer to live.”</em> She wound up being right, too.</p>

      <p>I was appointed to serve as emcee for the meeting, but the moment the topic veered toward Sir Rimuru, things sort of began to happen all by themselves. It was something of a thrill to watch unfold, but some aspects of it bothered me, too. Not about Sir Rimuru so much as with the guy’s attendant.</p>

      <p>“That wasn’t part of Noir’s family, was it?”</p>

      <p>“I think it was. I could sense his presence when I went to pick up Sir Rimuru, so there’s not much room for doubt.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-283"></a>“Oh, no way! He’s selfish to the point of insanity. Why would he ever bow down and serve someone else?”</p>

      <p>“Well, who can say? I have no idea what he might be thinking, and I don’t really want to dwell on it, either.”</p>

      <p>Good point. I think Mizeri had it on the money there. Noir, after all, was as fickle as he was selfish—he was just like me and Mizeri in that sense, but I’d rather not get involved with another person like that. I mean, he fought Sir Guy to a draw! A draw, all by himself, against someone Mizeri and I had ganged up on and lost spectacularly to. I’ve never fought him personally, but that fact alone gave me an aversion to him.</p>

      <p>Or maybe that’s me trying to sugarcoat it. I don’t have an aversion to him; deep down, I <em>know</em> I can’t beat him. I mean, I don’t think either Sir Guy <em>or</em> Noir were seriously duking it out with each other. It had just been a fun little bit of jostling around from their perspectives, but I couldn’t keep up with the blows they were exchanging.</p>

      <p>I’ve got my pride as a Primal to consider, you know, so there’s no way I’m ever going to admit it. It’s just that, deep down, I really don’t want to get in a disagreement with Noir anytime soon.</p>

      <p class="space-break">This is awful. I’m going to be fighting Noir. Why is this happening to me…? I know I’ve been a good girl. It’s just strange. Did someone find out I’ve been stealing snacks from Mizeri? No—I blamed that on one of my Arch Demon underlings, so I’d imagine the heat is off me for that.</p>

      <p>I’m still wondering why, but maybe I should take a new perspective on this. I want this to seem like more of a great opportunity for me. I hate him, after all. He doesn’t lead his own faction; he just does whatever he wants all by himself, and he loves getting in Sir Guy’s way. He could manifest himself physically any time he wanted, but he has no interest in that, much to my annoyance.</p>

      <p>Along those lines, the fact that he’s still an Arch Demon instead of bothering to evolve into anything better just drives me up the wall. It’s like he’s rejecting the whole system this thing runs on. There’s no doubt in my mind that it’s Noir egging on the three remaining <a id="page-284"></a>colors to make this a three-way deadlock—if he’s a demon, he needs to follow the rules and pursue his evolution already!</p>

      <p>I really need to sit down and set things straight with him. He’s strong, yes, but so am I. I don’t <em>think</em> I could beat him, but never say never. A battle is all about having the right matchup in place. Noir doesn’t know my powers, so I think he’s letting his guard down. If I take advantage of that, I might just be able to beat him, for all we know.</p>

      <p>I’m quite good at keeping things positive. I had a plan of action, and my mind was in the right place—and that was how I felt as I set off for the battle.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>“You know, I <em>did</em> feel this intense, murderous gaze upon me, but I was a little occupied at the time. But would you mind calling me Diablo, please, Bleu? …Oh, right, you’ve been given the name Raine, yes?”</p>

      <p>Hearing that gladdened me a little. I always thought he never took an interest in anyone but himself, but there he was, actually remembering my name and everything. Hee-hee! Maybe I should start giving him a little more credit.</p>

      <p>“That’s right. The name ‘Raine’ was granted to me by the great Sir Guy, the Rouge color of the Primal Demons. I’m not like you, named by some mongrel demon lord from parts unknown.”</p>

      <p>Feeling a bit better now, I decided to goad him a bit. I called Sir Rimuru a mongrel, even. I like slimes, actually—I think they’re cute—and Sir Rimuru seems like a well-qualified demon lord, so I had a pretty rosy opinion of him. I thought that, you know, this would be a good tactic to take against Noir, or Diablo.</p>

      <p>It turned out to be a bad idea.</p>

      <p>“Huh? Do you want to die? Or, that is, do you want to be erased from this world forever? Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh… Let me make your wish come true, then.”</p>

      <p>His eyes were deadly serious, too. I mean, Diablo never lets anyone know what’s going through his mind at any time, so I didn’t <a id="page-285"></a>expect that he’d bare <em>that</em> much emotion and get seriously angry at me.</p>

      <p>“Let’s fight, Diablo! Ah, I can’t wait for this. Ever since I sensed you fighting Blanc in the eastern lands, I’ve been hoping for a chance to battle you.”</p>

      <p>I was still talking a big game, but on the inside, I thanked my lucky stars I’d thought to invoke Ubiquital Mist. By creating a copy of myself in advance, I can get right back into the fight if one of them is destroyed. Otherwise, I’d never go up against an opponent I’m not sure I can beat.</p>

      <p>By the way, I really <em>did</em> take an interest in the battle between Diablo and Blanc. I’ve fought Blanc myself before—out of envy, you know. Diablo kept giving Blanc all this attention, so I wanted to see just what kind of power she had, is all. If I recall, we fought to a draw, mainly thanks to Ubiquital Mist. But the fight itself was really a loss for me—no, actually, let’s still call it a draw. I didn’t lose. I’m a smart, capable girl. The only person I’ll ever admit having lost to is Sir Guy.</p>

      <p>But as I pondered this, our battle was growing intense. Maybe I had taken this a little <em>too</em> seriously. I drew from all the powers that I had, attempting to corner Diablo. We were even in terms of magicule count; maybe I had a decent chance after all? But I wasn’t foolish enough to let thoughts like that relax my guard. After all, I knew that Diablo wasn’t really trying against me at all. I hated to admit it, but it was true.</p>

      <p>“Are you being a sore loser? I’m sure you’re still too new inside your physical body to break out your full powers, but that’s no excuse, you realize.”</p>

      <p>I said that and all, but I knew the truth. This guy may have been a creepy freak, but he was no idiot. He was one of the two best demons out there, the only two I personally acknowledged as posing any sort of danger to me. He wouldn’t make the kind of rookie mistakes lower-level creatures would.</p>

      <p>But this was unexpected. Before I knew what was happening, these layered magic circles appeared around me, with glowing letters drawn on them. Like, hang on! And aren’t these spells <em>holy</em> <a id="page-286"></a>magic, the type demons are weakest against?! It’d have been impossible <em>not</em> to be surprised by this. I now had Disintegration, Lady Luminus’s trademark attack, coming at me from every side possible.</p>

      <p>It was at that moment when I realized that I might—<em>might</em>—not win this.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>You were worried, weren’t you? I was all right, of course. What? Wasn’t I just bragging about how Ubiquital Mist ensured I’d be fine anyway? Well, you don’t need to be picky like that. Girls don’t like that sort of behavior, you know. Don’t think—<em>feel</em>. Sharing your emotions like that impresses girls a lot more. Me included!</p>

      <p>But Diablo was being beyond rude to me. I can’t believe he was bringing up another opponent while we were still fighting. I mean, Testarossa? Who’s that? If she’s <em>that</em> special, then bring her over here.</p>

      <p>I was beyond indignant about this treatment, but when I learned later that he was referring to Blanc, I was shocked. I mean, what? I need a moment to calm down. Why does even Blanc have a name now?</p>

      <p>Yes, I’d been expecting Diablo to see through my performance; he had always been sharp, ever since his Noir days, and so I kind of saw it coming, as annoying as it was. If anyone but him had claimed that this multilevel Disintegration <em>still</em> wasn’t his most powerful skill, I’d have laughed in his face.</p>

      <p>Right now, though, the Testarossa question was more important—not just for me, but for Sir Guy as well, who had been watching the proceedings from his hiding spot. That’s how serious it was.</p>

      <p>Diablo had been singing the praises of the demon lord Rimuru this entire time. Constantly going “Oh, Sir Rimuru, Sir Rimuru!” It was downright frustrating to hear, but then he’d casually throw out these incredibly important pieces of information in between all that prattling. It was so underhanded of him, but that’s just how he was, and that angered me even more. Sir Guy was getting annoyed, too, I could tell, but he was holding back for now because of the opponent I was fighting.</p>

      <p><a id="page-287"></a>Over time, I finally managed to get some more info out of Diablo, but it stunned me into silence. It turned out that the demon lord Rimuru had recruited the other Primals to his side as well. I didn’t want to believe it—and the moment I had that thought, I knew that I had been strategically defeated.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, it was the truth, and it couldn’t have been any worse. Blanc was now Testarossa, Violet was Ultima, and Jaune was Carrera. We had managed to build an equilibrium between three different groups within our little clique, but it had all fallen apart in an instant. I really wish this change had taken place over the span of decades or centuries, but reality can be cruel like that.</p>

      <p>We shouldn’t be held down by restrictions, after all. We need to live freely. I’ve often thought that that’s how demons ought to live…but, you know, what’s wrong with competing with each other? It just doesn’t seem right to me, having us unite beneath the same banner. The resulting force would be so strong, there wouldn’t even be any point in fighting any longer.</p>

      <p>But now he’s just gone and <em>done</em> this? Great. I’m starting to seriously fear the demon lord Rimuru now. Up till now, the top two people on my list of deranged maniacs were that idiot demigod and the annoying, insane Noir/Diablo, but today—right now—Rimuru’s cruised up to the top spot.</p>

      <p>Here was a guy I knew I had to constantly watch out for. I couldn’t afford to antagonize him at all costs, even if it meant sucking up to him. Unlike Sir Guy, I’m a good girl. I’d never think of making him angry; instead, I’ll follow the trend and sincerely call him “Sir” Rimuru. Yes. I just decided this. Let’s go with that.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="image" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">So we retreated, leaving the rest to Diablo.</p>

      <p>It was a very rare thing to see. I mean, Sir Guy’s true goal was to deal with this huge power he sensed was about to go off on this planet.</p>

      <p>“Yes, well, I’m sure Sir Rimuru will take care of it…no matter what happens.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-288"></a>That was Diablo boasting to us yet again, but seeing Sir Guy accept it at face value was unbelievable. I’m just a simple maid, though; it’d be beyond rude for me to question his decision.</p>

      <p>So we let Sir Rimuru do whatever he wanted, and in the end, that wound up being the right choice to make, which was a relief. Sir Guy was so worried for Lady Luminus, after all. She ruled over the Western Nations, which made work a lot easier for Sir Guy, so no wonder. I felt the same way, too. There was no way I could do her job.</p>

      <p>Regardless, everything seemed to have been resolved, so good for us. It was a shame that Mizeri had failed at her mission, but she’d been pitted against Blanc/Testarossa, so I couldn’t really blame her.</p>

      <p>“Was she strong?”</p>

      <p>“I didn’t fight her, but she certainly <em>seemed</em> to be. At the very least, earning a name and body let her evolve into a Demon Peer. She’s much stronger than your average demon lord.”</p>

      <p>I’m sure. She was a handful even when I fought her, so if she’d evolved, it might just be too much for me to handle. She was never one to care very much about wins and losses anyway. As long as she got what <em>she</em> wanted out of it, she had no problems accepting a tactical defeat. Even if she lost, it never rattled her. She was third on my list of maniacs, although she had just been bumped down to fourth.</p>

      <p>…Oh, but the demigod’s long gone, isn’t he? She’s still third, then.</p>

      <p>Wow… Doesn’t this mean that the top spots on my list are all on Sir Rimuru’s side? Carrera’s a menace, too, and Ultima can really trip you up if you approach her incorrectly. If he managed to tame all of them, I really have to respect that.</p>

      <p>“Let’s try not to pick a fight with Sir Rimuru, all right?”</p>

      <p>“I’m wondering where that thought came from, but I know what you mean, and I firmly agree. If anything, I wish that I’d given you that advice.”</p>

      <p>“Well, <em>that’s</em> rude. I’m smart enough to mind my behavior around people like that.”</p>

      <p>“Are you? You were the one who suggested we take on Sir Guy, if I recall. I have trouble believing you.”</p>

      <p>Oh, come now. That was just a little youthful indiscretion, you <a id="page-289"></a>know? I’ve grown since then, and I won’t make the same mistake again. But either way, that’s how the two of us began keeping an eye on Sir Rimuru.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="image" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">Bad news! Bad, bad news! Sir Rimuru really <em>is</em> a freak of nature! I just met him for the first time, but it was <em>crazy</em>, how insanely intense he was!</p>

      <p>What? Didn’t I see him at Walpurgis? Shut up. I’m saying that Sir Rimuru is so crazy, that last meeting doesn’t even matter!</p>

      <p>That’s the only way I can describe it, and I don’t think anyone else would do a better job. I mean, listen to this. Sir Rimuru actually decided to evolve <em>us</em> as well! Can you believe that? But it’s true! I may be a demon, but I always tell the truth.</p>

      <p>But now I think we can help out Sir Guy quite a bit. In terms of strength, we’re now to the point where Sir Guy would <em>barely</em> give us passing marks. If I decided to take on everyone in the Octagram, I don’t think we’d beat any of them, but that just goes to show how wonderfully talented the current crop is.</p>

      <p>Well, okay, I bet we could beat Lady Ramiris, but I don’t think she counts in this example anyway. If she went into her <em>complete</em> form, I think we’d lose big. And I’d love to teach that bum Deeno a lesson or two, but if I ever tried acting on that urge, I’d be the one left crying. That’s why I let him off the hook. He should thank me for being such a tolerant person.</p>

      <p>Oh, but I’ve gone offtrack. Let’s go back to our evolutions.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>It all began when Diablo called Sir Guy over. This meant we’d be visiting Sir Rimuru’s nation, but Sir Guy didn’t much like how Diablo was egging him on. I thought about asking to stay at home, since I was bound to get dragged into this conflict, but that would have been shirking my duty. Joining him was definitely the right choice anyway.</p>

      <p><a id="page-290"></a>Sir Rimuru had apparently never met Lady Velzard before, so they exchanged their first greetings. Then, after that, he very politely introduced himself to me as well. He’s certainly easy to fall in love with, isn’t he? I thought about pretending to be this oblivious little girl and trying to flirt with him as much as I could. Not that I did, of course. I know how to read a room, and I was sure my life would be forfeit if I’d tried it. It was the right choice to make.</p>

      <p>So began a nice, harmonious tea session. I observed the proceedings from behind Sir Guy, and it struck me that he and Sir Rimuru shared a decent amount in common. They had the exact same reactions to certain things, and I could tell both of them had their hands full with Diablo. Along those lines, they seemed more alike than not to me.</p>

      <p>It went without saying that I had a much better opinion of him now. But that wasn’t all that struck me. First, there was Sir Rimuru’s attendants. One of them was introduced as Benimaru…but why did he seem so much stronger than your typical demon lord? And the same was true for Shion next to him, too. She had clearly grown stronger since the last time I met her. I could detect a vague aura of evil around her, making me wonder if she had gained some skill giving her an advantage over demons.</p>

      <p>What could it be? Because I seriously wasn’t sure if I could beat her in battle any longer. But if I ever admitted that, it’d have been tantamount to saying I was no longer worth anything. And I couldn’t have <em>that</em>.</p>

      <p>So I tried to keep myself cool and collected, but it took a concerted effort, you know. Besides, those weren’t the only two who were strong here.</p>

      <p>…Um, wait a minute. This aura… It doesn’t belong to Testarossa or any other demon. There’s at least three or four others here. Why are there all these demon lord–class people serving this demon lord? I thought only Sir Guy could get away with that, but perhaps I need to reconsider.</p>

      <p>As I resolved to do that, I began to smell the aroma of tea. Time for a break, then? But we’re maids, so it wouldn’t be mannerly to enjoy tea together with them. I assumed I’d have to wait for another <a id="page-291"></a>chance, but the next thing I knew, I was being guided into the adjacent room. It turned out they had set out some slices of cake just for us. I tell you, I can’t say enough good things about Sir Rimuru. In terms of the consideration he shows for others, he’s <em>certainly</em> qualified to be a king, I can tell you that much!</p>

      <p>Now it was time for the taste test. This was a strawberry shortcake, it looked like. Hee-hee! I don’t like to brag, but I fancy myself as something of a pro in the kitchen. I once captured and held a chef from a first-class hotel until he taught me all his techniques, so I’m reasonably certain that I’m better than some hobby cook.</p>

      <p>What I’m trying to say here is that it’d take more than just okay results to impress someone like me—<em>chomp</em>.</p>

      <p>“Oh, this is <em>good</em>!!”</p>

      <p><em>Huh? Are you</em> kidding <em>me?! This is, like, incredible!</em></p>

      <p>It looks so simple on the surface, but one bite, and you’re exposed to a complex harmony of flavors. They must have gone through the trouble of building each individual layer, then stacking it all up. There are different types of cream between each layer, I think? This <em>must</em> have been an incredible amount of work, right? And given how uniform the taste is, I can see they carefully calculated the distribution of all the ingredients, too.</p>

      <p>“Amazing…”</p>

      <p>Mizeri was just as impressed.</p>

      <p>In the realm of baking, we mainly specialized in dishes utilizing high-end ingredients, such as fresh fruitcakes and sugar-laden pancakes. Honestly, I never thought you could bake a cake that required <em>this</em> much technique to pull off correctly.</p>

      <p>“Was this made with other-world techniques?” I couldn’t help but ask.</p>

      <p>“That’s right,” Shion replied. “This was developed as part of a friendly competition between Mr. Yoshida and Lady Shuna. It’s a strawberry shortcake that uses three different kinds of cream. It uses a tiny amount of powdered blackspell rice, too, so it’s well suited to monster palates as well.”</p>

      <p>This Mr. Yoshida; is he an otherworlder, I wonder? Lady Shuna, I knew already—she was the one who guided us to this room and <a id="page-293"></a>served us the cake and tea. She moved with learned, refined motions, like nothing at all could scare her. I am renowned as a perfect maid, but I had to give her high marks for her service. And if she’s this good of a pastry chef, too… I’ve got some competition, I see.</p>
