      <p><a id="page-60"></a>“Oh? You don’t need to be that wary of me. I’m sure you’re both masters of your technique, but to me, it’s more cute than anything.”</p>

      <p>“Nonsense. Perhaps I can’t stack up to you, but I will at least earn us some more time.”</p>

      <p>“Perhaps so.” She shrugged. “I’m sure asking for your trust is a bit much yet. But all right. Can you just keep him here for me, please?”</p>

      <p>She didn’t mind being maligned, but if it led to a greater burden on the emperor, she wouldn’t stand for it. By her estimation, His Majesty had only a short time left, and she couldn’t bear the thought of her presence causing that last ember to be extinguished. At the very least, she wanted to care for him in his last moments, bringing tranquility to them.</p>

      <p>It was Minamoto who suffered the worst in all this. Just one glance from Velgrynd, and he was frozen to the spot. The sheer dominance in that gaze made him realize the insurmountable difference in their skill. Actually, things went even beyond that. They now understood that this was something completely inscrutable, a foe that made all the demons and mystic beasts they’d engaged in the past seem like children. If Gensei’s sword—a blade he held the utmost of respect for—had failed, Velgrynd was clearly no one to trifle with. But even <em>that</em> was failing to fully grasp the situation.</p>

      <p>Minamoto was frustrated. He had a duty, and there was no way to fulfill it. Still, he at least tried to summon what little mettle he had left to glare at Velgrynd.</p>

      <p>“Are you one of the <em>yohma</em> leaders, then? Striding forth yourself to put an end to all this squabbling?”</p>

      <p>A great deal of lip-flapping to hide the cold sweat. He hoped to at least uncover the identity of this assailant, but Velgrynd understood that well enough.</p>

      <p>“You call them <em>yohma</em> here? They exist in this world, too, then? You really <em>do</em> find them lurking everywhere, don’t you?”</p>

      <p>“Are you saying you’re not?”</p>

      <p>“That’s right. Besides, the <em>yohma</em> you speak of… I can’t be sure they’re the same as the creatures I know.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd could instantly analyze any language from any world and speak it fluently back at its people. This wasn’t dependent on <a id="page-61"></a>any skill of hers; it was more of a latent bodily function, reading the thoughts that bounced between people in this world. But since similar concepts could sometimes be mixed up, she needed to carefully avoid making any mistakes.</p>

      <p><em>The term</em> yohma <em>needed to be addressed</em>, she thought. In her mind the term translated directly to “mystic,” and the mystics she knew were the ones led by Feldway, the mystic lord. They were part of the so-called Aggressors, races that exist in any and all dimensions, and they were an enemy Velgrynd had clashed with many times in her long journey. The idea of running into them yet again made her groan, but she still held out hope that these <em>yohma</em> were something else.</p>

      <p>“<em>Yohma</em> are <em>yohma</em>. That is the only way to describe them. Not even I know what they truly are.”</p>

      <p>The emperor, not Minamoto, answered the question.</p>

      <p>Realizing that Minamoto was immobilized, Gensei opted for a change in strategy. While Minamoto occupied Velgrynd’s attention, he would move to evacuate the emperor from the room. The way the two of them instantly switched roles on their feet with no previous instruction indicated just how deeply they trusted each other. The attempt to extract the emperor was all but doomed to fail, but it was still a strategy worth trying.</p>

      <p>It was the emperor himself who put an end to it.</p>

      <p>“Your Majesty?!”</p>

      <p>“It is fine. Somehow, this person fills me with a sense of nostalgia. And I am already in the safest location in the capital, protected by layers of defense. Where else could I possibly flee to? This person avoided all our security on her way here. I doubt I could ever fully escape her.”</p>

      <p>He was right. The empire—the Conquering Empire of Japan, to give its full name—was currently at war with a vast, powerful enemy, hence their current state of high alert. If someone had actually penetrated <em>this</em> far past their strict defenses, that was as good as being defeated. But more to the point, the emperor couldn’t find it in himself to fear Velgrynd. Like he’d said, she reminded him of old times—times that filled him with a sense of relief.</p>

      <p><a id="page-62"></a>So he decided to trust in Velgrynd. They would go over what was happening, and if possible—he thought—he could recruit her as their ally.</p>

      <p class="tx1">They were still in the bedchamber, enjoying some tea and light snacks brought in by attendants.</p>

      <p>“First, let me introduce myself. I’ve already given my name, but I am Velgrynd.”</p>

      <p>“My name is Gensei. Gensei Araki. I am tasked with guarding His Majesty.”</p>

      <p>“And I am Saburo Minamoto, captain of the Imperial Palace Swordsman Guard.”</p>

      <p>“I see. Good to meet you. And you, Ludora?”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd demonstrated little interest in the bodyguards. She promptly turned her attention toward the one she loved.</p>

      <p>“I never expected such a beauty to be attending to me at my advanced age. I don’t dislike it, but I can’t help but wish I were even a little bit younger.”</p>

      <p>“My. Even <em>you</em> can give out flattery, Ludora? What a rare experience.”</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh… I didn’t mean it as such. But very well. My name is Oharu. I thought I was better known than that in this realm, but perhaps old age has made me grow conceited.”</p>

      <p>His name was renowned far and wide, as was his reputation as a wise ruler. But Oharu was his real, non-regal name, and not one normally spoken in common circles. Not even those relatively close to the emperor used it to refer to him…but it was still a name known and respected by every one of his citizens. Still, to Velgrynd, he was Ludora. Even if it wasn’t considered taboo to call the emperor “Oharu” to his face, she had no intention of doing so in the first place.</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee-hee! You’d have no way of knowing, of course. I only came to this world at the very first moment I met you here. The ‘you’ that I know is named Ludora, and I will keep calling you that.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-63"></a>It was a shockingly rude way to speak to royalty. But one smile from the emperor indicated that this was fully allowed.</p>

      <p>“That is fine.”</p>

      <p>“Your Majesty?!”</p>

      <p>“I don’t mind. A small price to pay, if it earns me the favor of this goddess. However, I’m afraid I cannot allow you to stand by my side in public.”</p>

      <p>“No? Why not?”</p>

      <p>“I have my own position to uphold. If I am waited upon by someone who calls me a name no one’s heard before, it would cause needless worry for my retainers.”</p>

      <p>If Velgrynd were to exercise her powers in front of everyone in the empire, that would likely lead to chaos. The emperor was making this request merely to keep things simple for himself. Velgrynd, understanding that, resolved not to push her personal will on him any further. She wanted to meekly accept any requests Ludora had for her, so for now, she went along with it. That wasn’t as important as learning what was going on here anyway.</p>

      <p>“In that case, we’ll need to figure out how I should present myself at times when I need to be in public. Can you explain to me exactly what the current situation is in this place?”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd was never one to beat around the bush. If Ludora was facing a crisis, she was ready to provide any help needed. Seeing this transcendental being act like that around the emperor immediately gave his two bodyguards headaches.</p>

      <p><em>This Velgrynd is boundlessly powerful, I am sure. Perhaps divine, just as His Majesty said. Wiser to seek her assistance than get on her wrong side, then?</em></p>

      <p>Such were Gensei’s thoughts. But Minamoto was more conflicted.</p>

      <p><em>She seems remarkably reverent of His Majesty. Why is that? It’s almost like everything is entirely natural about this. We completely failed to guard him, but His Majesty is allowing this, and I am in no position to intervene. But what about Her Majesty the Empress, and the imperial prince? How will we explain this to them…?</em></p>

      <p>Minamoto’s mind was pondering real, concrete problems. In some worlds, it would have been a given that someone as lofty as <a id="page-64"></a>a king or emperor would keep one or two mistresses without anyone batting an eye—but not here. The emperor’s spouse was always expected to come from the right sort of pedigree, since any child they produced would become a member of the royal lineage. The women surrounding the emperor were obliged to stay in highly stratified positions; an impenetrable wall was in place at all times between the empress and the concubines. They would have to present Velgrynd to the court as a concubine; there was no other option.</p>

      <p><em>But will this woman be satisfied with that? If she demands to be installed as empress, there’s nothing we can do to stop her…</em></p>

      <p>The worry-prone Minamoto was already thinking well into the future. His duty was to guard the imperial palace, but if the emperor, his wife, and Velgrynd fell into a conflict, the fallout could be disastrous. Perhaps, he thought, he wasn’t worrying too much after all. There was a large burden on his mind, for he was constantly thinking about the safety of the entire court—as opposed to Gensei, who only had to protect the emperor.</p>

      <p><em>Still</em>, Minamoto thought, <em>Velgrynd deserved an answer to her question just now</em>.</p>

      <p>“Allow me to explain. Our empire, the Conquering Empire of Japan, currently finds itself in an extremely tense situation. In terms of the enemies we are aware of…”</p>

      <p>An empire usually refers to a large group of states ruled by the supreme authority of an emperor, but in the Conquering Empire of Japan, that wasn’t quite the nuance. Here, “empire” was more of a respectful term, passed down unbroken across generations, to refer to the island nation located in the eastern part of the world. Its emperor, and the guardians who served him, protected this nation’s citizens from those who sided with evil.</p>

      <p>But outside the country’s borders, the world was in a deep state of chaos.</p>

      <p>The empire lay to the east. To the south there was the United States of Azeria; to the north, the Greater Rossiam Dynasty; to the west, the Holy Arcian Empire; and in the center, the Republic of Chinese Fiefdoms. These five forces had arisen to become the great leaders in their respective regions.</p>

      <p><a id="page-65"></a>Until a few decades ago, they had ruthlessly competed with each other for global dominance, but over time, a sort of equilibrium had established itself. As they carefully watched each other, waiting for their rival forces to decay, they’d wound up building mature international economic relationships. On the surface, war no longer existed, and an era of peace seemed ready to dawn.</p>

      <p>But national discontent over neighbors never fully vanished, and if someone earned a profit, someone else needed to lose out. This dissatisfaction built up over time, smoldering out of sight, and four years ago, it exploded.</p>

      <p>The trigger came when the Republic of Chinese Fiefdoms suffered a large-scale drought. The lack of water led to starvation and rampant disease outbreaks. This unavoidably led to a dissident movement, but the Republic’s government manipulated this discontent, pointing it outside its borders in order to protect itself. Now the entire world had gotten involved.</p>

      <p>For their first move, the Chinese turned their attention southward, to a large grain-producing region. The National People’s Council voted unanimously to invade the United States of Azeria, and that signaled the beginning of war. In a flash, the entire world was in conflict.</p>

      <p>The Greater Rossiam Dynasty up north was the next to react after witnessing the Chinese military moves. They staged their own invasion of the Chinese mainland, and their mission was clear—to obtain land for agriculture and a warm-water port. The region was suffering from an extreme drought, but that would no doubt fix itself in a few years…and so Rossiam returned to its old habit of conquest.</p>

      <p>Naturally, the Chinese weren’t taking this sitting down. All their remaining forces gathered to fight back, plunging the entire nation into a state of war. This was when the Conquering Empire of Japan got dragged in. They relied wholly on these Chinese fiefdoms for their food supply, and so were forced to deploy their military to the Republic on a “humanitarian mission.” That was done in the hopes it’d bring the war to a quick end, but Greater Rossiam was incensed, and Japan’s relationship with Azeria suffered. Japan had <a id="page-66"></a>been forced to pick a side between Azeria and the Chinese, and it chose its main food lifeline.</p>

      <p>The Holy Arcian Empire made no moves at first, but the relative peace there didn’t even last a year. It was soon the empire’s turn to face severe famine, forcing it to cut off the support it had been giving other countries. The bad news continued with an accident at an oil storage facility, and the resulting fire cost the empire three years’ worth of fuel. The evidence left on the scene indicated that it was the work of saboteurs from Rossiam. The mood among the people took a sharp anti-Rossiam turn, and the momentum finally drove the empire to start a military operation.</p>

      <p>One person had suspicions about all these events. This was Pulcinella, the Mad Priest and leader of the Holy Spiritualist Church. Spiritualism was one of the world’s three major religions, alongside Buddhism and the Free Path—and Pulcinella, its most prominent figure, had spoken of a vision that told him of a great, evil presence behind the scenes. Affiliated churches across the land began to investigate this, and they managed to track down a <em>yohma</em> that had allegedly played a major role…but by then, it was too late.</p>

      <p>“So this <em>yohma</em> manipulated people’s greed and set off a bunch of old grudges?”</p>

      <p>“I’m afraid so,” Minamoto replied. “Looking back with a clear mind, it’s simply too convenient a series of events. But once the anger of the people is ignited, it’s not easy to douse the flames.”</p>

      <p>“And it wasn’t just the Spiritualist Church,” added Gensei. “All the world’s leaders picked up on this anomaly within a year’s time. But there are a lot of extremists in the military. They took action in response to the enemy’s sabotage, and by the time we were aware of it, there was no way left to stop the war.”</p>

      <p>The other nations were in a similar state. As things stood, matters were proceeding not at all the way the upper brass wanted them to. The forces that had been deployed were nearly out of their control entirely. Just the other day, out in the ocean, a massive fleet from the United States of Azeria waged an epic sea battle against the Conquering Empire’s proud imperial navy. The result was defeat. The preliminary reconnaissance indicated that the two sides were <a id="page-67"></a>evenly matched, but once the conflict was underway, they’d found that the Azerian force was three times the size they’d anticipated.</p>

      <p>“It was all the work of the Chinese fleet. They betrayed us…and unfortunately, their intentions are nowhere close to what we want.”</p>

      <p>Not even the Chinese commanders were aware of this betrayal, so there was no way for Japan’s intelligence apparatus to have detected it. It was already too late by the time they realized what was up, and now their military was severely damaged. But the defeat wasn’t a total waste, either.</p>

      <p>“There’s a certain piece of intelligence my student risked his life to obtain. There is a man named Kondo who staged a brave, glorious suicide attack on the enemy fleet, but just before his death, he sent a telepathic message that the enemy commanders have been taken over by an unusually fierce <em>yohma</em>.”</p>

      <p>As Gensei put it, Azerian supreme southern fleet commander David Reagan and Chinese eastern fleet commander Li Jinlong had both tapped into strange, mystical powers to interfere with Kondo. Realizing all hope was lost, Kondo kept gathering intelligence until the very end, when contact was finally lost. “But now,” Gensei somberly said, “I fear he lost his life in vain.”</p>

      <p>Hearing this, Velgrynd immediately understood. The Kondo that Gensei spoke of had to be none other than Lieutenant Tatsuya Kondo, a man she knew well. Chances are, she thought, Kondo was so concerned about Ludora because Ludora felt the same as the other emperor he’d once served. Perhaps he’d instinctively realized that Ludora and Oharu shared the same soul. It was the first time Velgrynd had ever felt any affinity for Kondo—and now, she could firmly believe that Kondo’s loyalty was the real thing.</p>

      <p>Now Velgrynd had to wonder about not just Ludora’s lingering regrets but Kondo’s as well. Thinking back, Kondo had seemed frustrated about not being able to protect his home country. That was why he’d done what he did for Ludora, stopping at nothing; it was so he’d have no regrets this time. It made Velgrynd ask herself if there was anything she could do for Kondo, as late as it was. There was only one option. She had to atone for his regrets.</p>

      <p><a id="page-68"></a>So Velgrynd, her mind made up, focused on the conversation, taking it more seriously as Minamoto continued unaware.</p>

      <p>This <em>yohma</em>, wielding the power to possess people’s bodies, was swiftly reported to the world’s top leaders. These leaders weren’t on the front lines, however, and so they had no way to determine exactly who was being controlled. You could suspect someone if they began to act abnormally, of course, but it was hard to recall officers while they were engaged in an operation. The leaders considered publicizing these findings, but it was sure to cause general panic. Soldiers would start wondering if their commanding officers were <em>yohma</em>; the entire chain of command might fall apart. It could also lead to witch hunts within their borders, which would be a disaster. That much, at least, needed to be prevented, and so their investigations continued in secret.</p>

      <p>In the end, they found that these <em>yohma</em>, unlike your average <em>mononoke</em> ghoul, engaged in organized group behavior. They were clearly looking to conquer, and they were active behind the scenes across the world.</p>

      <p>“And also, they’re incredibly strong. In our empire, we use what’s called a <em>kaikyu</em>, an apparition scale, to measure the strength of mystical creatures. Even the weakest of these foes rank on the high end of this scale. It’s unbelievable. These are truly fearsome foes, the type even an advanced swordsman or spellcaster may have trouble holding his own against.”</p>

      <p>The apparition scale, from top to bottom, consisted of six ranks: <em>shinbutsu</em> (gods and buddhas), <em>kiryu</em> (demon dragons), <em>ten’yo</em> (heavenly ghouls), high <em>yokai</em>, mid <em>yokai</em>, and low <em>yokai</em>. Those in the bottom two ranks were called <em>chimi-moryo</em>, evil spirits associated with rivers and mountains, and everything between high <em>yokai</em> and <em>ten’yo</em> were <em>akki-rasetsu</em>, the man-eating fiends. With these <em>yohma</em>, even the weakest foot soldiers were <em>ten’yo</em> class. Kondo and the soldiers serving him had discovered this during their suicide strike on the enemy fleet, and while they’d been defeated by the ringleader, their intelligence had made it through.</p>

      <p>“Kondo estimated that Reagan and Li both ranked as <em>kiryu</em> or higher on the apparition scale…and I firmly believe that is the right call.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-69"></a>“Why is that?”</p>

      <p>“Because Kondo was easily one of the most powerful fighters in the Land of the Rising Sun.”</p>

      <p>Even at the time of this final attack, Kondo’s skill was first class. Mastering the Oboro Shinmei-ryu’s ultimate move—Battlewill—gave him fighting ability on the level of a <em>kiryu</em> class. If that still wasn’t enough to earn him victory, that was likely because the battle was two against one.</p>

      <p>“Yes, that man certainly <em>was</em> of that caliber.”</p>

      <p>“…?”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>“Did you know Tatsuya, perhaps?”</p>

      <p>“I did, Ludora. Kondo personally served you in my world, too.”</p>

      <p>“Me? And…ah yes, you did say this Ludora possessed the same soul I do.”</p>

      <p>“Exactly. And even over there, Kondo fought for you…and died a noble death doing so.”</p>

      <p>“…”</p>

      <p>The emperor fell silent. He looked unsure what to say. The loss of such a faithful servant filled him with a deep sense of disappointment.</p>

      <p>“Oh no, not Kondo…”</p>

      <p>Minamoto stood there blankly, like he couldn’t believe it. That was how exceptional a swordfighter Kondo was. Part of him had wondered if Kondo was alive after all, if he could serve as their final option against the <em>yohma</em>. Being faced with the truth made him unsure what to do next.</p>

      <p>“A pity. I was hoping that Kondo was alive.”</p>

      <p>Gensei, Minamoto’s teacher, retained his calm, detached demeanor, but on the inside, he was fighting hard to hide the sadness of losing that last little bit of hope. It was out of the question for a man in his position to act flustered, unsure what to do with himself. He kept himself disciplined, because he of all people had the greatest obligation to remain tranquil.</p>

      <p>Everybody believed what Velgrynd told them. It was a funny thing to think, but as she told them all about Kondo’s final moments, they <a id="page-70"></a>could just sense she wasn’t lying. But as she spoke, Velgrynd also tried to gauge the strength of this current foe.</p>

      <p><em>If they could beat Kondo before his trip to our own world, then perhaps this “</em>ten’yo<em>” rank isn’t all that strong at all? I’m fairly sure that they mean mystics when they say “</em>yohma<em>,” but this sounds like it’d be no threat at all to me…but, ah, I shouldn’t let my guard down. I can’t make judgments if I have no scale to work with, so let’s wait and see how this works out.</em></p>

      <p>Velgrynd was extremely confident, like any all-powerful True Dragon should be, but having been defeated by Rimuru had taught her how to be watchful as well. She thought it almost impossible that these <em>yohma</em> would pose her any challenge, but she reserved her final judgment for when she had more information.</p>

      <p>To tell the truth, however, her estimations at this point in time were both right and wrong. The magicule concentration in this world was low, so there were no particularly powerful monsters residing in it. The <em>shinbutsu</em>-class menaces were often monsters who happened to traverse here from some other world, and not even they could win against a force large enough to overwhelm them. Swordsmen or casters working in tandem had cut their numbers down to the point that one hardly saw them at all anymore. This meant monsters of that caliber couldn’t survive long enough to build their magicule counts. The environment just wasn’t conducive to the natural creation of strong monsters.</p>

      <p>At this point, Velgrynd, unlike Veldora, could maintain a steady cycle of magicules entirely within her own body. She didn’t need to replenish them from the air, and they were never expelled from her body. That was a skill she’d learned as she traveled through all the diverse worlds she had seen. As a result, she wasn’t paying attention to this world’s magicule concentration, so she hadn’t picked up on that fact yet. It was normally impossible, after all, to go back the way you’d come when traversing worlds. Even if you had an Underworld Gate handy, you’d still be limited by the size of the portal. Someone like Velgrynd, who could use her Dimensional Leap skill with no limitations, was a blatant exception to the laws of nature.</p>

      <p><a id="page-71"></a>Therefore, compared to the magicule-rich environment in which Velgrynd was born, the standards for “strength” in this world were quite low. She did not have to wait long to see this for herself.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">After this conference with the emperor and his guard, Velgrynd had a general grasp of what was going on. The Conquering Empire of Japan had no chance of staging a miraculous comeback; before much longer, it’d fall into the hands of its invaders. All the world’s leaders were aware of the truth, but they were helpless to stop the rampage of the people—and the military that represented them.</p>

      <p>“So what is the enemy currently doing?”</p>

      <p>The enemy’s unified fleet, fresh from decimating the imperial navy Kondo belonged to, was currently an unknown, their movements a mystery. At least some of the empire’s ships should have survived, but all contact with them had been fully cut off.</p>

      <p>“Normally, our fleet would have surrendered the moment its defeat was clear. The news of that should have reached the homeland by now…but still, nothing.”</p>

      <p>“By my estimation, I think they might have been seized by the <em>yohma</em>. Our enemy is not bound by the laws of humanity, though, so perhaps they did not accept our surrender…”</p>

      <p>“I am wondering about Kondo’s phrasing as well. He described it as a ‘takeover’ of their bodies, which indicates this <em>yohma</em> can possess people from the inside. If so, we’re unlikely to have any survivors.”</p>

      <p>Personnel had been assigned to bring back intelligence, but there was virtually no contact from them. If every single sailor had been possessed by the <em>yohma</em>, it would certainly explain this situation.</p>

      <p>“They’re in the Great South Sea, where there’s no escape route. We’ve asked the other nations to try reaching out to them as well, but nothing. They’d have no reason to lie to us about that, so it seems fairly clear that our war power’s been taken from us.”</p>

      <p>It was just one possibility, but if true, it would be disastrous. <a id="page-72"></a>Even the greatest swordsman in humanity hadn’t been able to take on the enemy’s leader, and their elite, well-trained military might have all just been sacrificed to the <em>yohma</em>. They couldn’t expect their military to retaliate going forward, and sending any further troops would likely just be more grist for the mill.</p>

      <p>So Gensei and the others decided to focus fully on defending the imperial capital.</p>

      <p>“All it’d do is buy us some time. You understand that, of course.”</p>

      <p>“Naturally. There’s only one move we can make right now. We’ve deployed some dependable personnel to work out the enemy’s moves. Once they’re done, we’ll gather the most powerful force we can from across the world and defeat the enemy’s leader.”</p>

      <p>“I think the plan’s unlikely to work, but we have no other choice. I mean, if we had Kondo, he could have defeated this enemy if there was only <em>one</em> of them! But now we have two ranking as a <em>kiryu</em> or higher, and he couldn’t even make good his escape. If we can bring together myself, my master Araki, and Amari as well, and join up with the great heroes of all the other nations, then perhaps we <em>can</em> defeat the <em>yohma</em> leaders!”</p>

      <p>Masahiko Amari was another student swordsman, a master who’d competed with Kondo for the title of number one. He was also an expert in spellcasting and an intelligence specialist, and he was out on a secret mission right now. And he was far from the Land of the Rising Sun’s only hidden talent. Emperor Oharu didn’t bring it up, but Gensei wasn’t his only imperial guardian.</p>

      <p>There were great talents from other nations to think of, too, people ranking <em>kiryu</em> or higher that worked both in public and underground. Pulcinella the Mad Priest was one famous example, as was Xienhua, the Holy Fist; based on what information had reached the Conquering Empire about them, they were both forces to be reckoned with. It would take heroes like those banding together to overcome this international crisis; fail, and all of them would fall.</p>

      <p>Oharu knew all too well that this whole idea was a fantasy. And that wasn’t even the end to their problems.</p>

      <p>“The issue is that we don’t know if these are just two enemy leaders we’re dealing with. I hate to think otherwise, but…”</p>

      <p><a id="page-73"></a>“But if there are more,” said Velgrynd, “that’s bad news for us?”</p>

      <p>“Precisely,” Gensei bitterly stated. In order to defeat a <em>kiryu</em>-level monster, he’d like to have at least twice as many fighters ranked equally to it or higher, but if they didn’t have an accurate gauge of the enemy’s size, it’d be impossible to assemble heroes from around the world. For Japan, the top priority was to keep their empire’s key figures safe. There was a mound of problems to deal with.</p>

      <p>Ideally, they’d be able to lure out these <em>kiryu</em>-class <em>yohma</em> one at a time. If that proved impossible, they’d need to fight as many as they could feasibly beat. If the enemy outnumbered them, defeat was unavoidable.</p>

      <p>But then things began to change. Velgrynd, watching Gensei and the others fret over this, offered them an irresistible helping hand.</p>

      <p>“Hmm… Sounds like you have a lot of problems. But all right. I’ll help you out. For starters, I want you to show me the extent of your powers.”</p>

      <p>“Huh? What do you…? This is so sudden…”</p>

      <p>“Well, we can’t form a strategy if we don’t even know our enemy, now can we? I want to know just how strong these <em>yohma</em> are.”</p>

      <p>“What are you talking about?”</p>

      <p>“It’s simple. Your name was Gensei, right? If you were Kondo’s teacher, you have to be at least as good as he was, I’m assuming? I only arrived on this world a moment ago, so I don’t understand what counts as ‘strong’ around here yet. So I’ll start with you first, all right?”</p>

      <p>“Ah… Now I see. Yes, I would outclass Kondo in terms of ability. I have special moves I have yet to show anyone in public, along with powerful finishers only passed down among my style’s originator and his pupils. But I will say that Kondo was unwaveringly strong in his convictions. His spirit was amazing, and his drive to win was far greater than you’d normally see. If I had fought a serious bout with him, luck would have been a major factor in the resulting outcome.”</p>

      <p>So, long story short, they were pretty equal. Slight differences in power were too inconsequential to concern Velgrynd. She just <a id="page-74"></a>wanted a yardstick to work with, so she decided to test him out at once.</p>

      <p class="tx1">They moved over to a practice ground. Gensei had Minamoto leave them, as he couldn’t show his student his most powerful of moves; the only outsider here was the emperor.</p>

      <p>Velgrynd, unarmed, sized up Gensei. He had his beloved blade in his hand, but he began to feel concerned. His opponent’s silk robe, while not restricting her movement, was clearly unfit for battle and unlikely to offer her any protection. The moves Gensei had could kill instantly if he put his heart into them. He didn’t expect them to best Velgrynd, but he wondered if they might injure her.</p>

      <p>“I want to ask a question,” he said, steeling his resolve. “My pardons if this sounds rude, but are you sure you’d like me to use a real sword? Because the very best of my style’s moves could perhaps be a threat to you…”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd understood he only said this out of concern for her. She could have ignored the question, but thought it better to relieve his mind a little. That way, she thought, he wouldn’t hesitate to show off his full force.</p>

      <p>“How very kind of you. But don’t worry. Your weapon—you called it an <em>uchi-gatana</em>, didn’t you? It looks like a high-quality antique, but sadly, it won’t work on me. So don’t be afraid to come at me with everything you have.”</p>

      <p>Gensei’s blade was actually run-of-the-mill, not even meriting a Unique appraisal. In a world as starved for magicules as this one, swords couldn’t do things like evolve over time.</p>

      <p>So, without further delay, Gensei took the invitation.</p>

      <p><em>“Kiehhh!!”</em></p>

      <p>Focusing all his explosive fighting energy, he broke out the mightiest skill in the Oboro Shinmei-ryu—Multilayered Blossom Flash. Unfortunately, nothing blossomed from it. The exquisitely honed move was stopped by a single one of Velgrynd’s fingertips.</p>

      <p>His blade whisked and swished through the air, almost looking <a id="page-76"></a>like it was splitting apart into multiple weapons. Its speed was beyond what a regular person could perceive, but it was simply too slow in Velgrynd’s eyes.</p>
