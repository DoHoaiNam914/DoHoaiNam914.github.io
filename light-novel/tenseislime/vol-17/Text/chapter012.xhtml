      <p>“If that’s your full effort, then I’ve seen enough.”</p>

      <p>“I—I give…”</p>

      <p>Simply calling it a “difference in power” seemed trite. It was like comparing heaven and earth, or perhaps even something beyond that, and the yawning gap between them was now obvious for all to see.</p>

      <p>It was a grave disappointment for Gensei, but thanks to that, Velgrynd now had the information she wanted. Gensei’s <em>Hakkasen</em> was a secret art, one passed down only through the main branch of his sword style; it had never been taught to Kondo. Doubtlessly it was at the very top of this world when it came to almighty force. In terms of the muscle behind it, <em>Hakkasen</em> let its practitioner surpass <em>kiryu</em> and make it to the <em>shinbutsu</em> rank.</p>

      <p>“You truly are a god, then…?”</p>

      <p>“Well, it was my brother who created my world…but no, I am not.”</p>

      <p>“Oh… We could certainly call that a god here, you understand.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, the term ‘god’ can be interpreted in different ways, depending on the time and place. You can think of me as whatever you like, but I will remind you that there are forces out there who could even destroy me.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd recalled that happy-go-lucky slime. Losing to him still annoyed her, but she was no longer convinced that a rematch would go any better.</p>

      <p><em>But I certainly can’t think of Rimuru as a “god,” either. Perhaps the correct way to think about it is that such things don’t exist…?</em></p>

      <p>That was all the thought Velgrynd gave to the question. It didn’t seem like further consideration would provide an answer anytime soon. What mattered right now was the <em>yohma</em>, their enemy in this world.</p>

      <p>“Thank you for confronting me. It was a painful reminder of just how immature and insignificant I truly am. I must use this experience to further improve myself.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-77"></a>Velgrynd paid little attention to this. A theory was quickly beginning to form in her mind.</p>

      <p>Gensei and Kondo were pretty much equal in strength—but that strength was far below what Kondo had when she’d met him. When humans in physical space crosses between worlds, most will die from the resulting exposure to concentrated magicules. On rare occasions, however, the magicules can break down and reconstruct their bodies, making these humans tougher and more resilient.</p>

      <p><em>Right, right, I forgot about that. The magicule counts on this world are so weak. It must be hard to cast any sort of spell, and magical body enhancement likely hasn’t advanced much. If that was powered entirely by his natural strength, he honestly deserves praise for producing that much force.</em></p>

      <p>She recalled the blow she’d felt on her fingertip. It would have been lauded as an A-ranked feat back in her home world—a very impressive one, considering his weapon was Rare-level at best.</p>

      <p>Now she could picture the strength of their enemy.</p>

      <p><em>The</em> ten’yo <em>class is likely somewhere between B and A-minus, I suppose. You’d have to jump up to</em> kiryu <em>before reaching over-A territory, perhaps? If so, I think my theory about the</em> yohma <em>being mystics is right.</em></p>

      <p>“Mystics” was the term given to demi-spiritual Aggressor species. In physical space, they could only function for brief periods if they weren’t incarnated in physical bodies. In a world with as few magicules as this one, possessing someone else’s body was a must—you’d waste far too much energy otherwise. But when in possession of such a body, you wouldn’t be able to fully unleash your latent power, not without tearing the human’s body apart.</p>

      <p><em>It must weaken them terribly. You can’t expect magicule-based protection in this world, so if you use a ton of power at once, you’ll destroy your body. And maybe they wouldn’t care if they were just trying to kill their enemies—maybe they’re holding back because their goal is invasion? That must be why the Kondo of this space-time period was a good match for them…</em></p>

      <p>If the mystics wanted to exercise their full force, nobody on this planet could ever beat them. Reaching that conclusion, Velgrynd smiled, reveling in the knowledge that someone like <em>her</em> was on the <a id="page-78"></a>scene. Even against Feldway, lord of the mystics, she was confident that she’d figure out a way to win—and there was little chance Feldway himself was involved with this invasion.</p>

      <p>And, in fact, it was exactly as Velgrynd predicted. The invaders of this world were a vanguard force of mystics under the command of Cornu, one of the Three Mystic Leaders. The Underworld Gate that had naturally manifested in this world was small, too small for Cornu himself to emerge through. Work to enlarge it was underway, but the world still had a little more time before it could be fully conquered. And while Velgrynd hadn’t inferred all these facts yet, what she had now was sufficient.</p>

      <p class="tx1">As composed as he seemed, Gensei was feeling rather down. And who could blame him? These sword skills he’d believed were the very best had done absolutely nothing against Velgrynd. Not even his most hidden of moves had worked. He intellectually knew she was a being from another dimension, but it was hard for his emotions to accept that.</p>

      <p>Still, he labored to keep his heart tranquil, exercising his finely honed mental strength to its limits.</p>

      <p>“You should be proud,” Velgrynd said to him with a smile. “There are hardly any magicules in this world, and you still attained <em>that</em> much strength. I doubt many others here have come even close to it. If you could only take in more magicules to upgrade your body with, you might’ve made it to Saint level, to say nothing of Enlightened. That <em>is</em> a pity, certainly.”</p>

      <p>“Enlightened? Ah, that is a faraway goal for me.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, not necessarily… I know: As thanks for that demonstration, let me give you a little reward. Hopefully you’re willing to accept it?”</p>

      <p>“A reward?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. If you are interested, I could perhaps reforge that <em>uchi-gatana</em> with my powers.”</p>

      <p>She smiled again. With her Create Material skill, she could <a id="page-79"></a>conjure up a God-class weapon whenever she wanted. Here, she intended to charge Gensei’s sword up with magicules, giving it what it needed to evolve.</p>

      <p>“You can do…?”</p>

      <p><em>You can do even that?</em></p>

      <p>Gensei was bewildered by the idea, but nothing could surprise him at this point. This woman Velgrynd was far too lofty a being for him to fully comprehend; if she says she can do it, Gensei thought, she probably can.</p>

      <p><em>This sword is a family treasure passed down from my ancestors…but perhaps I can trust Velgrynd with it.</em></p>

      <p>Convincing himself this was the right choice, he bowed his head to her and passed his beloved blade over.</p>

      <p>“Please, go ahead.”</p>

      <p>“Certainly. Just leave this to me.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd nodded as she accepted the sword. Normally she’d just have conjured up an azure dragon sword at times like these, but that wasn’t what this situation called for. She closely inspected the blade’s internal composition, fine-tuning her approach as she began letting her magicules flow into it. It took time, and she looked far more serious and focused than she had during their battle. Half an hour passed. The skill and ingenuity of the ancient swordsmith, coupled with the magicules so expertly controlled by Velgrynd, came together to create a divine, glowing aura that enveloped the blade.</p>

      <p>“All done.”</p>

      <p>This sort of weapon evolution usually took centuries to millennia to complete. But in this short time, Velgrynd had recrafted Gensei’s sword into a God-class wonder.</p>

      <p>“Wh-what is this…?!”</p>

      <p>“It’s now the best weapon it can be, is what. Probably more so than any other blade in this world. I doubt you can make full use of its features yet, but…well, either way, the sword now has its own consciousness, so if it accepts you, I’m sure it’ll lend you some of its strength.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-80"></a>She chuckled a little, her radiant smile captivating Gensei.</p>

      <p>“Of course, I can’t say whether that’ll happen for you or your descendants, but…”</p>

      <p class="tx1">It was now evening—dinnertime—and Oharu was in his chamber. Velgrynd had been invited as well, and she was eager to accept the offer.</p>

      <p>The palace’s female attendants were all carefully selected, well-trained, and unfazed by unexpected events. Not even the sight of Velgrynd perturbed them as they prepared a meal for her like nothing was amiss. Minamoto took up guard duty outside the door, with Gensei positioned behind Oharu; only the emperor and his unannounced guest were seated.</p>

      <p>“So what exactly are your plans here?”</p>

      <p>“I’m going to stay here with you. I’ll protect you.”</p>

      <p>“I am certainly happy to hear that, but should I take that to mean you are an ally to our empire?”</p>

      <p>“That is correct, yes.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd smiled. Just being able to share this space with Ludora made her content.</p>

      <p>Oharu chuckled nervously, unsure how to take this. “In that case,” he said, “do you think you could eliminate all conflict from the world and put my mind at ease for good?”</p>

      <p>He was merely joking, of course, but Velgrynd simply smiled back.</p>

      <p>“Very well, then. If you wish for it, I will offer you this entire world as a present. I will gladly do away with whatever countries you’d prefer not to have around, and I can shut down anyone who dares to complain about it. But before that, we really need to exterminate these pesky little <em>yohma</em>, don’t we?”</p>

      <p>Seeing that innocent smile on her face as she replied made everyone unsure how to respond. The attendant setting up dinner almost spilled soup all over the tablecloth. Everyone in attendance instinctively knew Velgrynd meant every word of it. But meaning it and <a id="page-81"></a>actually being capable of it were two different things. This kind of talk was beyond the realm of sensibility; if anyone else had said those things, they’d have been laughed off as delirious rantings. But there was something about Velgrynd that kept them from dismissing the idea. Gensei knew what she really was; Gensei knew this was no joke, but something that was realistically possible. And so did Oharu.</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! Ah, I haven’t laughed like this in ages. Telling a joke that even my attendants here take seriously… You’ve truly outdone yourself. I certainly enjoy how dauntless you sound, though! And I do appreciate the thought, too.”</p>

      <p>For now, the emperor opted to dance around the topic to avoid causing his staff any further alarm.</p>

      <p class="space-break">It wasn’t news by now that Velgrynd was superhuman, a fact made even clearer by their dinner conversation. She wasn’t just physically strong; her thought processes were equally fearsome.</p>

      <p>Only then did Oharu come to realize that she really <em>would</em> do anything for him. If he ordered her to annihilate another country, Velgrynd would very likely carry it out. Concepts of good and evil were mere trifles for her; all that really mattered was Oharu’s will. It made him feel more lost than he had at any previous point in his life.</p>

      <p>He was born as the first heir to the throne, never wanting for anything. He never had any freedom, either, but that—as he was taught from a very young age—was his obligation as a future leader. He had access to anything he needed, but was also forced to give up on the things he really wanted. Things like romance were a fantasy to him. He was wed to the daughter of one of the princes who supported him in the palace. It was mostly a contractual agreement, and he had no right to refuse it.</p>

      <p>As naturally intelligent as Oharu was, he realized by his teens that the only permanent thing in life is change. Everything is fleeting; the world is like a mirage. It’s a good thing to pursue your dreams with all you have, as everything leaves you anyway—but if you choose not to resist fate, just going with the flow and tasting <a id="page-82"></a>the little joys of daily life, that is just as beautiful a way to live. Oharu chose the latter. Even for an emperor with everything, the right to do what he wanted was an impossible luxury.</p>

      <p>That was the main reason Velgrynd came as such a surprise to him. She had so much <em>freedom</em>, nothing and nobody keeping her down…and yet she swore to serve no one but Oharu.</p>

      <p><em>Such a strange woman…or goddess, I suppose. Even if I’m nothing but a substitute for this Ludora person, feeling this honest sort of goodwill makes me feel so…self-conscious, somehow.</em></p>

      <p>Oharu pondered these feelings as he enjoyed the most relaxing dinner he’d had in quite a while.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="image" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">The next morning, a conference was held in the imperial headquarters. The main topic at hand: how to deal with Velgrynd. As Oharu had declared, she was prohibited from acting as his lover in front of any third party—but if that were the case, the first order of business was how to explain her position to the general public.</p>

      <p>Beyond that, there was the issue of her clothing. Being dressed like a foreigner was out of the question; she needed to wear an outfit befitting her social position. The attendants all teamed up to bring in a vast variety of clothing, Gensei and Minamoto offering their input as well as Oharu contemplated how to classify Velgrynd.</p>

      <p>“Perhaps she could become another one of His Majesty’s imperial attendants—”</p>

      <p>“Attendants can’t participate in conferences, you fool,” Gensei said, cutting off Minamoto before he could finish.</p>

      <p>“I suppose calling her a guard would be difficult as well?”</p>

      <p>“We did consider that, Your Majesty, but Velgrynd’s appearance simply attracts too much attention. She is clearly not ethnically native, and I fear people may peg her as a spy.”</p>

      <p>If her facial features were more Japanese, this wouldn’t have been an issue. But Velgrynd had a Scandinavian sort of beauty, which made her stick out like a sore thumb around here. When they introduced her to the rest of the guard and espionage corps, those <a id="page-83"></a>individuals would no doubt ask why a foreigner had been granted such a lofty post. But at the same time, they were sure Velgrynd wouldn’t agree to be sequestered away from all the other officials—and they couldn’t let Velgrynd’s formidable fighting power go to waste when she was so amenable to being their ally.</p>

      <p>But just as they were trying to figure out a solution, Velgrynd herself spoke up.</p>

      <p>“Well, all right. I really don’t like doing this much, and I <em>certainly</em> don’t want to right now, but I’ll change my outward appearance for you. Will something like this work?”</p>

      <p>The next moment, Velgrynd began to transform. Her hair turned dark, as did her eyes, and her skin adopted a warmer shade, almost hinting at yellow, with a touch of red to it.</p>

      <p>“Wowww… You can even pull off a trick like <em>that</em>!”</p>

      <p>Minamoto never saw it coming. Gensei, on the other hand, had assumed she could do that much all along. “I see we had nothing to worry about,” Oharu said, relieved.</p>

      <p>A slight adjustment to the pigment of her skin did wonders to change the overall impression she left. It still wasn’t exactly pure Japanese, but it was close enough that they could explain away the remaining difference. Then, without further ado, she was given the same uniform as Gensei and officially appointed to the Imperial Patrol by Oharu, providing her the right to attend the necessary meetings.</p>

      <p class="space-break">It is worth noting here that the emperor had no fewer than three different organizations charged with guarding him.</p>

      <p>The first was the Imperial Palace Swordsman Guard, the sole force permitted to carry weapons within the palace—however, only Minamoto, their captain, was allowed to personally enter the emperor’s chambers. The second was the similar-named Imperial Palace Spellcaster Guard, which magically protected the emperor from hostile spell-driven attacks and the like. Their main work was keeping a spiritual protective barrier up and running at all times; in terms of individual fighting strength, they were inferior to the swordsmen. Like their sister force, only the captain could personally <a id="page-85"></a>attend to the emperor—but that captain was occupied with defending the capital and hadn’t been seen over the past few days.</p>
