      <p>Finally there was the Imperial Patrol, composed of the Court Guardians that generally operated individually. Gensei was one of them, a highly public figure, but not all of them were listed in the official annals. Some lurked in darkness as they worked to dispel evil; many had so-called supernatural powers, while others operated separately from the imperial chamber, so they could serve as body doubles for Oharu. The Imperial Patrol gathered together people that worked in a variety of ways to keep the emperor safe, and it was generally known that not all of them kept a public profile. Thus Oharu thought that the Patrol would be the best fit for someone like Velgrynd.</p>

      <p>“Right. I hereby name you a member of the Imperial Patrol. And with your current appearance, we likely won’t have to explain much to everyone else.”</p>

      <p>“I will gladly accept the post. And I promise I’ll act strictly as your servant around others.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd, in her brand-new military uniform, sounded remarkably eager in her answer. A sense of doom pervaded among the emperor’s advisers, but no one had any other bright ideas. Even if some problem came up, they all reasoned, as they began their preparations, it’d be trivial compared to the ones the <em>yohma</em> invaders posed.</p>

      <p class="tx1">People began to gather in the imperial HQ’s meeting hall. Oharu was in a dressing room, watching them.</p>

      <p>This HQ was the emperor’s supreme high command, presiding over the imperial army and navy—the two branches of the Conquering Empire of Japan’s military. These were led by the minister of the army and minister of the navy respectively, who were obliged to attend meetings like this. They could send a representative instead, but it was very rare, as it was seen as insulting the emperor.</p>

      <p>Over the past few days of conferences, the main item on the <a id="page-86"></a>agenda had been reporting on the current situation. The decisive battle in the Great South Sea had ended with the imperial navy suffering a major loss. They weren’t even sure what had happened to the survivors yet, something both branches were exercising all their powers to find out.</p>

      <p>That being said, the army was acting a bit like this was someone else’s problem. They didn’t have a way to deploy in the water, they claimed, but Oharu reasoned that they were failing to truly understand the threat involved. <em>Damned fools</em>, he thought. <em>Now isn’t the time to be competing against each other for glory!</em> But as emperor, he couldn’t say it. When you have as much authority as him, your words take on intense weight. He could say what he wanted in private, but in a public place, he had to be careful with every word he spoke.</p>

      <p>Even now, an army officer in attendance was wailing out loud, unaware of Oharu’s inner conflict.</p>

      <p>“Who are <em>you</em>?! And how dare a woman enter this sacred imperial conference?!”</p>

      <p><em>Ahhh, I knew it</em>, Oharu thought, feeling a headache coming on. These people with far more pride than talent, constantly whining about manners and who’s above whom. It was self-evident something like this would happen, but if Oharu had personally introduced her at the meeting, the backlash would’ve been even worse—all his advisers had agreed on that. So he’d left Velgrynd to Gensei instead.</p>

      <p><em>Just as I thought, these men with more hormones than brains are whining about it. Even though she’ll kill them if they rile her…and probably raze the capital while she’s at it…</em></p>

      <p>Oharu heaved a heavy sigh. Perhaps it was the fate of anyone bearing Ludora’s soul to have their hands full dealing with Velgrynd their whole lives.</p>

      <p>“Are you talking about me, perhaps?”</p>

      <p>“Do I need to spell it out for you, you dunce?! This is exactly why— <em>Grnh</em>?!”</p>

      <p>Suddenly, the officer’s grating voice stopped cold. In a move faster <a id="page-87"></a>than anyone could catch, Velgrynd had grabbed the man by his collar and thrust the barrel of a handgun straight into his mouth.</p>

      <p>“It’d be one thing,” she stated with a thin smile, “if we were fighting with swords and lances like in the past. But at this point, when a single pull of a trigger can kill a person, I <em>really</em> don’t think whether you’re male or female matters so much. The <em>important</em> thing in this era is analyzing the situation and making calm, rational decisions, not letting your emotions do the talking. If <em>that’s</em> how you carry on, though, do you really deserve to be here?”</p>

      <p>The man wouldn’t have been able to overpower Velgrynd in the first place, but the sight of a gun, a symbol of violence anyone could instantly understand, sparked a furor in the meeting hall.</p>

      <p>“H-hey! Let the chief of staff go!”</p>

      <p>“Guns aren’t allowed in here! Security! Someone call the palace guard!!”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd laughed, paying them little mind. “Why are all you idiots carrying on over a little toy? You call yourselves honorable imperial soldiers, acting like that?”</p>

      <p>Several of those who heard this turned red with anger, openly glaring at Velgrynd. She paid them no mind as she threw the chief of staff down, pointed the toy handgun at him, and pulled the trigger. A plume of water landed right on his crotch.</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee-hee! Looks like you wet your pants, didn’t you? Better go home and get changed.”</p>

      <p>“H-how—how <em>dare</em> you—?”</p>

      <p>The chief of staff was now quivering in humiliation. But the moment he looked into Velgrynd’s eyes, he lost his voice. Her eyes terrified him. He felt them telling him that any more childish carrying-on would result in his death. The blood drained from his face.</p>

      <p>“Ha… Ha-ha-ha… My pardons. I think I let my emotions get the best of me. Y-yes, those water guns certainly bring me back. I feel like a child again. Much calmer.”</p>

      <p>“Oh? Well, that’s good to hear. If you want to participate in this meeting, mind your manners a little more, would you?”</p>

      <p>The chief of staff eagerly nodded. He was hot-tempered and a <a id="page-88"></a>little arrogant by nature, but he was no idiot. He might have messed up their first encounter, but he would make sure never to repeat that mistake. If he started grousing at her again, the next sinister glare from her would likely give him a heart attack. All that mattered to Velgrynd was Ludora, and the thought of these talentless hacks serving him did nothing to please her.</p>

      <p>For now, at least, she would let the chief of staff go. Having a temper and discriminating against women wasn’t enough to warrant eliminating him from existence.</p>

      <p><em>Heh… I’ve gotten kinder over time, haven’t I? Perhaps because of all the things I’ve experienced.</em></p>

      <p>This was, to say the least, giving her too much credit. Being close to Ludora kept her in a good mood, and that’s about all there was to it. If he hadn’t been there, things would’ve turned out differently.</p>

      <p>Her life over the past long while had seen her jumping from world to world in search of soul fragments, but she wasn’t guaranteed to find one at every destination she was thrown to. If none existed yet, it meant she had to wait several years or decades for the next incarnation of Ludora to be born. To Velgrynd, who saw her lover off at the end in every world she came to, this was akin to torture—and if anyone riled her then, their fate was as good as sealed. The chief of staff, in other words, had been lucky.</p>

      <p>Once the meeting hall settled down, the minister of the navy attempted to move on.</p>

      <p>“Now, Araki, can I ask who this woman is?”</p>

      <p>This minister, a naval general in his fifties, looked at Gensei with a careful eye.</p>

      <p>“Ah yes,” Gensei replied. “I still haven’t introduced her. This is a fellow guard of mine, and she received permission from His Majesty to participate in this imperial conference. Her name is—”</p>

      <p>“You may call me Ryu-oh. It is a pleasure to be here.”</p>

      <p>The name Velgrynd casually handed out, interrupting Gensei in the process, was Ryu-oh. “Ryu” meant “dragon,” as befitted a True Dragon like her, and “oh” came from <em>ho-oh</em>, or phoenix, the <a id="page-89"></a>mystical creature that ruled over fire in this world. This, however, proved to be a major problem.</p>

      <p>“Ryu-oh? As in ‘dragon phoenix’?”</p>

      <p>“Using the character for dragon in your name… What an arrogant thing to do around His Majesty the Emperor!”</p>

      <p>“Or are you perhaps related to him in some way…?”</p>

      <p>Another furor in the meeting hall, just after the last one had subsided. It made Gensei roll his eyes.</p>

      <p><em>Is she doing that on purpose? …No, it’s not that. Velgrynd simply doesn’t care at all about how matters work around here. We prepared that disguise for her, but we honestly should have thought of a name as well…</em></p>

      <p>He saw that as his mistake. And Oharu, in his waiting room, was sighing just as hard. In all his life, he had never experienced anyone causing him this much trouble. In a way, the sheer novelty entertained him.</p>

      <p>So he stepped into the meeting hall.</p>

      <p>“We are facing a severe emergency. What is strange about myself revealing one of the cards I will play?”</p>

      <p>He smiled at the attendees that noticed him. All of them were shortly bowing their heads. If these were the facts their leader laid out for them, they had no choice but to accept them. If they had any complaints, they certainly weren’t about to voice them. So, with that stroke, Velgrynd’s name in this world was Ryu-oh.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

      <p class="tx1">“Let us begin.”</p>

      <p>With those few words from Oharu, the imperial conference was underway.</p>

      <p>“I will start with my report,” said a man as he stood up. This was a naval intelligence officer, and while his briefings had changed little over the past several days, today offered more of a surprise.</p>

      <p>“The enemy fleet has reportedly stopped at the port of Atlantis.”</p>

      <p>“You’re sure about that?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-90"></a>“Yes, sir. We received the report from our operatives on-site, so it has been fully confirmed.”</p>

      <p>“Indeed,” the chief military commander said. “That’s the largest military port out of all the resupply sites they have. But can we be sure this isn’t some deception on their part?”</p>

      <p>“Quite true,” added the naval minister. “The Great South Sea is host to a number of archipelagoes, after all. We’ve heard reports that Azeria has set up secret bases on some of them, but do we have any operatives working those areas?”</p>

      <p>“At the moment,” replied the intelligence officer, “we do not have people at all the many sites they have opened up. However, the size of the fleet that reached the Atlantis port matches the intelligence we had before their deployment, so I think it’s safe to say there’s no possibility of a detached fleet somewhere. We also have word that our imperial navy warships have been seized. I’m sure they want to take their time preparing this fleet so they can crush any further desire to keep fighting.”</p>

      <p>The HQ was already aware of the imperial navy’s massive defeat. Nobody was too shocked about that now, but the idea of so many allied ships being in enemy hands made it hard for them to stay quiet.</p>

      <p>“We’re quite fortunate to know where our enemy is going, indeed. So, um, did any of our forces succeed in fleeing—er, emerging unscathed by the enemy?”</p>

      <p>“How could they?” the chief of staff brusquely pointed out. “If they did, they would’ve contacted us long ago.” He was calmer now, as he’d said, and his observations were wholly accurate.</p>

      <p>“The chief of staff is right. It is safe to assume that all of our surviving fleet has been captured by the enemy.”</p>

      <p>“Tch!” The army minister sighed. “It’s like giving the enemy more war power to fight with!”</p>

      <p>“But what could we have done?” countered the chief commander. “We were dealing with <em>yohma</em>, a complete unknown of an enemy. Even if I were there, I’m sure it would have turned out the same way.”</p>

      <p>“Yes… My pardons. I had no intention of insulting the navy when I said that. But it is honestly frustrating…”</p>

      <p><a id="page-91"></a>“Your apology is most certainly accepted. We’re all just as frustrated about this.”</p>

      <p>The tension in the meeting hall was oppressive. It was the greatest crisis the empire had ever seen in its history. Their force, allegedly the strongest in the world, had been taken out of the war by the enemy fleet. Even worse, so many of their ships—including their newest and most technologically advanced—had fallen right into the enemy’s hands. The danger was unprecedented, and filled everyone present with anxiety and concern. It was pointless to whine about it, but it was also only human to want to. The chief commander needed to behave more maturely, lest this meeting be thrown into further disarray.</p>

      <p>As the atmosphere simmered down a little, Oharu seized his chance to speak. “Does that mean,” he began, “that our imperial forces were taken prisoner?”</p>

      <p>The question alarmed the naval attendees. These were valued soldiers, many of whom they knew personally; of course they’d be worried about them. They were also important allies to the ground army, and their fate was a major issue impacting the military’s entire future direction. In a normal war, international conventions would have guaranteed that prisoners would be kept safe and out of harm’s way, but considering they were dealing with unknown invaders, that whole assumption could crumble. If things worked out like they always had, then fine—but if not…</p>

      <p>All eyes were on the intelligence officer.</p>

      <p>“Well…”</p>

      <p>“Well, what? Won’t you answer us?!”</p>

      <p>“According to eyewitnesses,” the hesitant officer said after his superior snapped at him, “the troops and officers of the imperial navy are manning the very ships that were captured. Some enemy troops were sighted among them, but only a very small number, and they weren’t threatening our forces with guns or anything else. It was described as looking like…our troops had changed sides in the war.”</p>

      <p>Now everyone understood why the officer had been so hesitant. So did Oharu. It was unthinkable for their proud, courageous <a id="page-92"></a>soldiers to have abandoned their duties that easily, much less defect en masse like this.</p>

      <p>“How will we ever explain this to Kondo, and everyone else who risked their lives…?”</p>

      <p>Minamoto’s low muttering echoed across the silent hall. Everyone there believed—prayed, really—that their men had had their minds taken over by the <em>yohma</em>. And Velgrynd was quick to confirm it.</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee-hee! Oh, quit being silly. All of you need to take a deep breath. None of your friends have betrayed you at all.”</p>

      <p>Her statement, delivered with a nod and affirmative smile, provided hope for her audience. The circumstantial evidence they had been presented with made all the naval officers fear that their friends really <em>had</em> betrayed them, but Velgrynd gave them a ray of light to cling to.</p>

      <p>“Ryu-oh? What do you mean by that?”</p>

      <p>The naval minister asked the question on everyone’s mind.</p>

      <p>“It’s simple,” Velgrynd cheerfully replied. “I believe the <em>yohma</em> have the ability to possess people. They’ve only just appeared in this world, and they can’t have much power to wield at all, so instead they’ll build it bit by bit via taking over people’s bodies. They don’t have much supply of the magicules that drive their power, though, so I think it’ll take a long while for your friends to be completely assimilated.”</p>

      <p>Hope now reigned across the room.</p>

      <p>“Ah, so they <em>are</em> being controlled against their will!”</p>

      <p>“If the process takes time to complete, does that mean we can still rescue them?”</p>

      <p>“How dare they make a mockery of our fighting men?! Damned <em>yohma</em>… We must be sure we defeat them all!”</p>

      <p>“We have to stage a rescue operation at—”</p>

      <p>“Wait, wait! It’s not that simple!”</p>

      <p>The hall was raucous once more. Everyone was already taking Velgrynd at her word. Some of the audience wondered why this woman knew so much about their foes, but if she was some manner <a id="page-93"></a>of trump card played by the emperor at this vital moment, perhaps it was only natural she did.</p>

      <p>So the call was made for a rescue, but everyone quickly settled back down when they recalled how difficult an operation that would be. The Conquering Empire had just staged a battle that could potentially decide the fate of their homeland, and they’d been routed. A rescue that’d work under the current circumstances was hard to picture.</p>

      <p>First, there simply weren’t enough ships of war left in the empire. They had lost six carriers, four battleships, four heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and eighteen destroyers. Even if all the remaining ships in the fleet could be cobbled together quickly enough, it wouldn’t amount to even half of those figures. And even if they had all of them running at once, it’d add up to a single fleet at best. Send them on the rescue mission, and it’d cripple homeland defense.</p>

      <p>“But all the world’s leaders are aware of what’s going on. Couldn’t we forge a secret truce and band together to focus on the <em>yohma</em>?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, everybody knows that’s what should be done. But their militaries are all off the rails. It’s impossible.”</p>

      <p>“It’s terrible to see how weak-minded other nations are, but we’re hardly any better, are we? We don’t even have a full grasp of what our ground forces are up to in Chinese lands.”</p>

      <p>“And we’ve just lost a decisive number of them…”</p>

      <p>Even if the world’s presidents and leaders signed a peace treaty right now, it wouldn’t solve anything. If the militaries supposedly loyal to them continued to run amok like this, any announcement of a cease-fire would ring hollow. If they wanted a permanent solution, they needed to do something about the <em>yohma</em> first.</p>

      <p>And even before that, there was another concern beginning to dawn on the audience’s minds, even though nobody had voiced it yet. What was it?</p>

      <p>“You don’t think anyone <em>here’s</em> been possessed, do you?”</p>

      <p>It was the minister of the army who finally came out with it. And given how his eyes were transfixed on the meeting’s naval participants, his thoughts were clear as day.</p>

      <p><a id="page-94"></a>“Wha…?! Now you’re suspecting us?”</p>

      <p>“No, no, I said nothing like that. It’s just, based on what I’m hearing in the report, one can’t help but have that doubt in their mind, can they?”</p>

      <p>“Utter nonsense! If you’re going to bring <em>that</em> up, would you care to explain why your own army’s running out of control over in the Chinese Fiefdoms?!”</p>

      <p>“Ah…that…”</p>

      <p>The conference was hurtling into perilous territory. Oharu saw fit to intervene.</p>

      <p>“Ladies and gentlemen… It is good news indeed that our brave soldiers are safe. I think it’s clear to all of us that they need to be rescued, but do you think we can manage that if we spend all day squabbling in here? As great and wise as all of you are, I’m sure you understand the correct path to take.”</p>

      <p>“““Yes, Your Majesty! My apologies!”””</p>

      <p>Everyone fell silent. Oharu’s dignified air was as honed as it was supreme, but to the man himself, he felt like he was walking a tightrope. He had to rebuke his audience; letting them stew like this wouldn’t solve anything. But he fully understood his officers’ anxieties—which made Oharu all the more frustrated that he couldn’t do anything to help.</p>

      <p>“Ryu-oh, the army minister has a valid point. Are you able to tell whether someone is a person or <em>yohma</em>?”</p>

      <p>It was Gensei who brought up the question. They needed a way to tell friend from foe, or they’d never get anywhere. The hall fell silent again, everyone waiting for Velgrynd’s response.</p>

      <p>“Oh, how could there be any of them in <em>this</em> room? If there were, I would’ve told you all long ago.”</p>

      <p>Everyone immediately relaxed.</p>

      <p>“Ah… Yes, that’s true.”</p>

      <p>It made sense to Gensei as well. If a <em>ten’yo</em>-class <em>yohma</em> could simply transform into a human being, all hope was lost for them. <em>Now</em>, he thought, <em>they still had some hope</em>. But Velgrynd wasn’t finished.</p>

      <p>“Good lord. You’re telling me that you can’t even tell whether someone’s on your side or not? The <em>yohma</em>—I call them ‘mystics’ <a id="page-95"></a>myself—don’t transform into people. They <em>possess</em> them, because they have to in order to survive in this world. And once they fully assimilate their carrier, they transform into something that no sane person would ever call human.”</p>

      <p>If that assimilation wasn’t finished, the barrier covering the imperial capital would be enough to root them out. They might <em>look</em> human, but they’d be something quite different on the inside. They were highly unstable in this state, as Velgrynd explained to the crowd, and until they found more stability, they wouldn’t try walking around and mingling with humans.</p>

      <p>“And also, the ‘privates’ among the mystics—the lowest of their ranks—have intelligence, but no free will. They’re lackeys capable of nothing but following orders, so even a little interrogation would expose them in a flash.”</p>

      <p>A mystic could read the memories of whatever it possessed, but only those that resided on the outer layers of the brain. If asked about something deeper, they’d be left clueless and fully exposed. The explanation from Velgrynd left everyone in the meeting hall feeling much more secure.</p>

      <p>But she still wasn’t done. The grave, somber atmosphere of the meeting came to an end here. Now Velgrynd was monopolizing the event.</p>

      <p>“I suppose none of you have a clue about any of this, so I’ll tell you, but the mystics have a clear hierarchy, or ranking system, to them. The ‘privates’ I mentioned are truly the lowest of the low. Even when they assimilate with someone, the resulting creature is a level weaker than what you’d normally see from a <em>yohma</em>. None of them are beyond a high <em>yokai</em> at best, to describe it with your scale.”</p>

      <p>She made it sound simple, but a high <em>yokai</em> was normally a threat that called for a specialized task force to solve it. Except Velgrynd didn’t seem to care at all.</p>

      <p>“B-but Ryu-oh, if one of these so-called ‘privates’ did complete an assimilation, could they advance into the <em>ten’yo</em> class?”</p>

      <p>“Well, aren’t you a smart kid?” Velgrynd told the army minister. “You’re exactly right.”</p>

      <p>“Wha?!”</p>

      <p><a id="page-96"></a>The minister wasn’t shocked by Velgrynd making fun of him. If even the enemy’s lowliest ground troops could transform into a <em>ten’yo</em>-class menace, the situation was beyond hopeless. It was almost sad, how unaffected Velgrynd acted compared to him, and nobody in the audience could laugh at either of them. They all felt the same way.</p>

      <p>“What’s the big surprise? Even Gensei over there can beat someone at <em>that</em> level. The ‘commanders’ leading these privates might give him more of a challenge, but they wouldn’t be insurmountable for him.”</p>

      <p>These “commanders,” the higher-ranked among the lower classes of mystics, would rate an A rank in other worlds…but until their bodily assimilation was complete, they could only unleash power equivalent to just over a B. Once the process was done, though, and they became a <em>kiryu</em>-class creature, fighting them would be tough. Tough, yes, but Velgrynd thought Gensei could beat them.</p>

      <p>“I am honored by the praise, but Kondo lost against two of them at once. I wouldn’t expect anything better from me.”</p>

      <p>“You really need to stop acting so timid, you know. Kondo stuck to <em>his</em> convictions until the very end.”</p>

      <p>Only then did Gensei realize how fainthearted he was acting. That, and how narrow-minded. He could palpably sense a certain warmth to the sword by his waist. It roused him, restoring his confidence.</p>

      <p>“Yes… You’re right. Being too timid can cost you battles you could have won.”</p>

      <p>“Doesn’t it, though? Not that we’d lose if <em>you</em> fell down that trap. Not while I’m here.”</p>

      <p>So Velgrynd wasted no time kicking Gensei’s resolve to the curb.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Now the imperial conference was taking quite a different turn.</p>

      <p>“So mystics grow stronger the more high-level they are, but it’ll be hard for them to manifest themselves in this world if they have too much energy. I think it’s likely that the toughest ones here right <a id="page-97"></a>now are the ‘generals,’ the lower ranks of the high classes. And that means we—”</p>

      <p>“Wait! Wait a minute!”</p>

      <p>“What’s wrong?” Velgrynd asked, miffed at being interrupted. If Oharu hadn’t been right in front of her, she likely wouldn’t have let this affront slide.</p>

      <p>“Um… You speak of ranks among these ‘mystics,’ but should we interpret these to mean the same thing as our military ranks?”</p>

      <p>“I’m sorry, are you doubting my linguistic competence?”</p>

      <p>“No, that wasn’t my intention. I was just wondering if there are, for example, other staff officers between the commanders and generals…”</p>

      <p>The minister of the navy was asking this question, and everyone else was just as curious about the answer. The faceless crowds that Velgrynd didn’t see as worthy of her attention were life-threatening menaces to the people of this world.</p>

      <p>“If Gensei would struggle against a ‘commander,’ would that place them at <em>kiryu</em> level?”</p>

      <p>“That seems valid to me. I believe those were the ones who defeated Kondo.”</p>

      <p>“Then how strong would their generals be?!”</p>

      <p>A “high-level” <em>kiryu</em> might just make it into the <em>shinbutsu</em> class—the point of divinity, impossible for any mortal to defeat. If that’s who was attacking them, all resistance was futile. Everyone’s faces grew pale as the truth dawned on them.</p>

      <p>“Is there a chance, then, that Kondo lost to these ‘generals,’ perhaps?”</p>

      <p>“Maybe, but I don’t care. It doesn’t matter anyway.”</p>

      <p>Exactly who had lost to whom wasn’t a priority for Velgrynd. All that mattered was that her side had lost.</p>

      <p>“…Oh, right, I just remembered something else. There are only two ways for mystics to reach this world. Either they come through an Underworld Gate, or they’re summoned by a superior class of mystic. I doubt there are any Gates in the sea, so I think we’re dealing with summons here. One general could probably summon ten thousand of them or so, I think?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-98"></a>Velgrynd made it sound so casual, but to her audience, the information was devastating. They all fell silent, just staring at her, because they couldn’t do anything else.</p>

      <p>“But you think you can, um, beat them, Ryu-oh?” the naval minister asked.</p>

      <p>That was the last hope for them all. He almost wanted to laugh, because he knew how ridiculous a question it was. An individual “general” would be enough to wipe out mankind, and if it had an entire army working for it, there was nothing to be done. No matter how powerful this woman calling herself Ryu-oh was, she couldn’t take on an entire army alone.</p>

      <p>“Because we’re dealing with a divine force with powers beyond our imagination, aren’t we? And the idea of man beating god is something you only see in mythology…”</p>

      <p>“All we can do is pray the world isn’t destroyed, can’t we?”</p>

      <p>The chief commander and the ministers all felt the same way. Velgrynd just snorted at them.</p>

      <p>“You all really <em>are</em> a bunch of sillies, aren’t you? The only mystic who could beat <em>me</em>, and even then only maybe, is Feldway, their king. Not that I’d go in expecting to lose, and I doubt he could manifest himself here anyway.”</p>

      <p>Why did she know the name of the enemy’s king? The questions never stopped coming, but no one was brave enough to point it out. Given what they knew about this woman, nothing seemed strange any longer. But there was one thing they needed to confirm.</p>

      <p>“I…certainly would never doubt your strength, Ryu-oh. That’s why I wanted to ask you…”</p>

      <p>It was finally the commissioner of education who drummed up the courage to speak, after having remained silent this whole conference. He was one of the three chief directors of the army, often playing a mediator figure whenever meetings like this fell out of order.</p>

      <p>Velgrynd looked at him. “What is it?”</p>

      <p>“Our nation is on the verge of total collapse. I was wondering if you would…um, step up to take on this foe?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-99"></a>“No. I’ve only got one body, you know.”</p>

      <p>That was a lie. With her Parallel Existence skill, she could easily protect the emperor while engaging his enemies. But there was no reason to tell anyone that. She was appointed a Court Guardian, and that meant she was dedicated to protecting the emperor. She had been given that role as a way to gauge the response to her presence. Relying on someone else to swoop in and save you would stifle all future growth; any country acting that way was doomed to fail sooner or later. It’d just be a matter of time.</p>

      <p>Velgrynd was a caring person, and she hadn’t abandoned this country or mankind in general. Velzard wouldn’t have bothered keeping such weak-spirited creatures alive. Velgrynd wanted to take care of everything here until Ludora died, but what happened after that didn’t matter to her—or at least, that would’ve been her thought process before she’d embarked on this journey. Now, though, she had gained a broader perspective, another change brought about by meeting and interacting with Rimuru.</p>

      <p>What mattered to Velgrynd now was protecting Ludora, the people he loved, and the bloodlines they kept passing down over time. So, with each cycle, she took pains to ensure the people she left behind after she departed weren’t totally helpless. It was hard news to give, but she was declaring to the audience here that she wouldn’t move at all for them.</p>

      <p>“But don’t you worry. I promise you that I will keep His Majesty protected, so you guys just try as hard as you can, all right?”</p>

      <p>In other words, prove you’ve got some guts in you.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Now that they knew the enemy’s strength, the conference moved on to their future measures.</p>

      <p>With Velgrynd’s cooperation, the emperor’s safety was assured. The officers in this meeting, being no fools, understood what she was saying between the lines. They would all try figuring out what to do themselves, not asking her for any more than that.</p>

      <p><a id="page-100"></a>“I want you to keep a careful eye on the enemy fleet’s movements.”</p>

      <p>“Understood. I will redouble our efforts to ensure we don’t lose sight of them.”</p>

      <p>“How much time do we have until the <em>yohma</em> fully complete the takeover of their hosts?”</p>

      <p>“Well, if they had a lot of magicules, it wouldn’t even take a week, but over here, I’d assume a good couple of months.”</p>

      <p>Given her Ludora-appointed post, Velgrynd was obliged to truthfully answer the questions presented to her, not hiding anything. It helped the conference reach a valid consensus instead of flailing around for ideas.</p>

      <p>“I imagine the enemy fleet will need at least a month before they can finish the resupplying and repairs required to leave port. Given how the timelines match up, is it safe to assume they’ll go on the move one month from now?”</p>

      <p>“Hmm, you think so? It may take time for them to reorganize the crews they captured, but the Azerian and Chinese fleets currently in operation could go out to battle right now once they’re refueled, couldn’t they?”</p>

      <p>“If that’s all they need, it’s a bit under two weeks from Atlantis to our empire. They might be hampered by weather, but—”</p>

      <p>“No they won’t. Being able to control weather conditions is a given. You can assume they’ll travel at maximum speed for us.”</p>

      <p>“Ri…right!”</p>

      <p>By this point, the officers were beginning to grasp Velgrynd’s personality. She was incredibly pompous with them, but also very helpful and caring, in her own way. She gave honest answers to their questions, offering advice as well. If they could work out just how far she was willing to go for them, they could avoid stoking her ire. Really, she was a valuable ally, and the more astute in the audience showered her with questions, trying to make the best use of what they had. Thanks to that, a basic plan of action was in place before much longer.</p>

      <p>“<em>Ahem</em>. We could try to meet the enemy on our homeland, but then we wouldn’t be able to help our brave allies being held against <a id="page-101"></a>their will. We need to go out there and defeat the enemy leaders ourselves.”</p>

      <p>“Quite true. I agree with you, but then the question becomes who to send out.”</p>

      <p>“If Ryu-oh is protecting His Majesty, I have nothing to worry about. I’ll do it.”</p>

      <p>“Ah, Araki, if you’ll join the effort, we couldn’t ask for much better.”</p>

      <p>“Allow everyone in the Swordsman Guard to join him!”</p>

      <p>“We would be honored to have you, Minamoto!”</p>

      <p>It looked like they had their basic plan formulated. But Velgrynd once again cut into the conversation.</p>

      <p>“…Are you people serious? Or just suicidal?”</p>

      <p>“How do you mean?”</p>

      <p>The army minister looked at her, eyes aglow. He was hoping she might join in after all, but that was too wishful a thought.</p>

      <p>“I appreciate your drive to do this all by yourselves, but that won’t be enough. You’re facing a large, powerful enemy, so you need to exercise <em>all</em> the force available.”</p>

      <p>Most people there had no clue what she was talking about. But some had already arrived at the answer, the chief of army staff among them.</p>

      <p>“Are you saying our nation alone won’t cut it?”</p>

      <p>This surprised Velgrynd a bit. He’d been the first man to try picking a fight with her, so she’d assumed he was a lot more careless than that. <em>Good thing I didn’t give up on him from the jump</em>, she thought as she nodded.</p>

      <p>“Certainly,” the naval chief of staff added, “now is no time for countries to be fighting each other in the face of this worldwide crisis. All of us here understand that, but as we went over earlier, militaries are going out of control worldwide. It’s frustrating.”</p>

      <p>“I think we really need our rival nations’ support!” Minamoto replied. “If we go in with a half-hearted force, the <em>yohma</em> will just possess us anyway. That’s why we’re using a small team of elites. We’ll need other nations to provide only their elites as well.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-102"></a>This was met with broad agreement.</p>

      <p>“It’s the only way. This isn’t a war any longer. It’s a battle for survival against the <em>yohma</em>, and we can’t afford to be choosy about our methods. We need to drive them away before we can work out our own war.”</p>

      <p>“Right. It’s no longer just our empire’s problem.”</p>

      <p>“Indeed. We need to reach out and get everyone on the same page.”</p>

      <p>There was no other approach to take—such was the feedback they gave.</p>

      <p>“Good job. You’re all weak, so you need to use your heads more.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd, hearing that, gave them a satisfied smile. But to the bureaucrats in the room, the idea was preposterous.</p>

      <p>“Wait just one minute! I’m sure every world leader knows that things can’t stand as they are. But I just don’t think they’d all suddenly want to reach out and join hands.”</p>

      <p>“Mmm, yes, that would be asking a lot. If we suddenly came out and proposed an armistice, nobody’s going to give their immediate approval.”</p>

      <p>“I’m sure <em>we</em> would turn down similar offers.”</p>

      <p>This was sensible. If something were to happen during this armistice, it could send everything tumbling down. For any truce to stick, the involved nations needed to rein in their militaries. And that was far from the only issue, either. Would the citizens ever go for it? What if some nation took advantage of this to hatch some sort of scheme? Once you started suspecting your fellow man, there was never any end to it—and while some cautioned against being paralyzed by too much doubt, they needed to address these concerns before they could ever hope for everyone to come together.</p>

      <p>As things currently stood, building a united front seemed beyond possible—but Velgrynd just smiled at them.</p>

      <p>“So you’re just going to give up without even trying? Well, if so, that’s fine with me. I’ll protect His Majesty anyway, and the capital he rules over.”</p>

      <p>It was clearly meant to provoke. The diplomatic officer in the room had no defense.</p>

      <p><a id="page-103"></a>“All right. Fine. In that case, I will begin to make contacts. Let’s try to be as sincere as possible and at least set up an opportunity to discuss matters!”</p>

      <p>He was almost rebelling against Velgrynd. But that was the whole reason she’d phrased it that way. And it’d worked.</p>

      <p>“We need to, yes. We’re all going down otherwise.”</p>

      <p>“We may go down anyway, but I’d at least like to show a little backbone here, yes.”</p>

      <p>“Right, exactly. Even if we lose, we have to resist with everything we’ve got, or I’ll never forgive myself.”</p>

      <p>“I feel bad for our citizens, though. And my family.”</p>

      <p>“We need to deal with it. We’re fighting the <em>yohma</em>, not a nation we can forge a peace treaty with. It’s a battle for survival of the species, and if we lose, our nation’s history is over. We must do everything we can right now, or we’ll all have to live with the regret afterward.”</p>

      <p>Now all the officers were worked up, ready to do whatever it took, and Velgrynd couldn’t have been happier.</p>

      <p><em>There you go. You need to start taking action and stop debating whether it’s possible. Besides, if you mess it up, I’ll figure something out for you all.</em></p>

      <p>She smiled a bit, keeping that piece of knowledge to herself as everyone else worked out what to do. So began the final resistance of the empire.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Atlantis was the smallest of the landmasses that formed the United States of Azeria. Located on the far east side of the nation, it had a tropical rainforest climate, with thick jungle taking up most of its square footage, but that wasn’t all that made it unique. It also had a metal-producing mine and an oil field, and these bountiful assets buried in the ground had turned Atlantis into the largest military base in Azerian territory.</p>

      <p>That was the beginning of the tragedy. There had once been some ancient ruins near the military base, but they’d had the misfortune of having an Underworld Gate to another world open up right over them.</p>

      <p><a id="page-104"></a>Long ago, the indigenous people of this land had conducted a ritual, a ceremony meant to help them communicate with the gods. It had created a slight rift in space-time, and the mystics that discovered it had stepped up to craft a stable Underworld Gate from it. These mystics possessed the locals, using them to welcome in the Azerians—and now they had seized the base the Azerians had built, using it as a beachhead for their own invasion.</p>

      <p class="space-break">A man in khaki camouflage was commanding a large, racially diverse crowd of people. His black hair was brushed back, his eyes squinted and cold, and there was a glint of intellectual drive behind his glasses. This was actually a former aide of Cornu’s from back when they were in the heavenly realms; he had been a cherub, in the service of the angels, before he’d undergone an evolution into a mystic. He had no name, but called himself Masahiko Amari, which was the name of the man whose body he’d taken over when he’d appeared in this world. (Some of the Three Mystic Leaders bestowed names on those who served them, but Cornu didn’t value his bonds with his own team enough to bother.)</p>

      <p>Race didn’t matter much to the mystics, but Masahiko Amari was Japanese. He was a secret agent sent into Azeria to investigate their military base, a figure powerful enough to challenge Kondo for the title of best in his native land. He was talented, but unlucky. He wasn’t aware that Kondo had been defeated, and by the time he fully grasped the nature of his enemy, it was too late. Hopelessly overpowered, he was defeated and possessed—and given how his body had been strengthened through the use of Battlewill, he was a perfect vessel for a mystic. Over a hundred days had passed since this process began, and now Cornu’s servant—a “marshal” class, on the high end of the mystics’ highest ranks—could perfectly exercise this body’s power. In terms of existence points, he was incomparable, easily reaching ten million, and with Masahiko Amari’s own knowledge and skills, he had improved his powers even further.</p>

      <p>“Hurry up with the expansion work. This Gate is far too small for Cornu to fit through.”</p>

      <p>Normally, a visitor from another world could only fully manifest <a id="page-105"></a>themselves if their magicule count fit within the size of the Underworld Gate. If they couldn’t, they’d have to keep their main body in their original world, send over a separate body connected by a soul corridor, and gradually build up their powers on the other side.</p>

      <p>This, however, didn’t apply to the Three Mystic Leaders. So power-laden were their souls that your average Underworld Gate meant little to them. You’d need a Gate rated for an EP of at least a million to even manifest them at all.</p>

      <p>If you left your main body in the other world, by the way, you could revive your separate body even if it died—but since it had never fully manifested, it would lose a great deal of its strength, perhaps over half. The only things passed on to the new manifestation were its memories and experiences, and you’d need to find another physical body to possess.</p>

      <p>Clearly, then, this mystic approach to world invasion had its pluses and minuses. But if they could expand the size of the Underworld Gate, this separate body could return to the mystic’s original world with its physical form intact, simplifying the process for full assimilation. And thanks to a constant construction effort, this Gate was now much larger than Velgrynd had predicted. Its EP rating was at around a hundred thousand, allowing mystics at the “staff officer” level to fully manifest themselves without any problems.</p>

      <p>Prisoners were lined up in front of this Gate, their minds fully dominated, and one by one, they were possessed by <em>yohma</em>. Taking on physical forms this way had one key advantage for the mystics—it let them seize the name granted to the body they took. As half-spiritual life-forms, they were inherently unstable, but taking on a physical body and name allowed them to establish a clear, unbreakable sense of self. The influx of knowledge they gained from the jump would turn them into decently useful pawns in war—even for the low-ranked “privates” among them.</p>

      <p>“I’m not sure there’s that much need for urgency, Mr. Amari. Everything’s going according to plan. We’ve thoroughly investigated the war-waging power of this planet, but there is hardly anyone that would pose a threat to us.”</p>

      <p>Amari was being advised by David Reagan, who was possessed <a id="page-106"></a>by a “general”-class mystic—almost as powerful as potential demon lords. Like Amari, he had fully completed his physical manifestation, giving him an EP north of six hundred thousand. It was little wonder Kondo couldn’t beat him.</p>

      <p>“Come on,” protested Li Jinlong alongside him. “How many times do I have to remind you? We still have Xienhua, the Holy Fist, on our side. And in <em>my</em> memories, at least, that girl could defeat our staff officers easily.”</p>

      <p>By “staff officer,” he was referring to upper-middle-ranked mystics. In other worlds that would’ve made them as powerful as demon lord seeds. They had leadership roles here, overseeing regiments of a thousand or so and playing a key part of the invasion. Unlike the lower ranks, they were too powerful to trifle with, and losing any of them would put a major dent in their operations.</p>

      <p>Li was right to be concerned, but David just chuckled. “Oh, we’re fine. Pulcinella’s been sent over to deal with her. Xienhua isn’t even a threat to us.”</p>

      <p>It was a surprise to Li, but one that made him smirk. Pulcinella, the Mad Priest—the great, powerful hope of all mankind—had been traveling the world, investigating the vision he’d had earlier. He had wound up waging an intensive fight with the <em>yohma</em>, but had been sadly defeated and taken over…all so another marshal-level mystic like Masahiko Amari’s could be installed. Now the tragedy was complete. He was a <em>yohma</em> ruler, on the same level as Amari.</p>

      <p>“Seriously? I was planning to go over there myself. Guess I was too slow. It’d be easy to kill her, but we’d wind up breaking her beyond repair. Pulcinella probably won’t have any problem, though.”</p>

      <p>It was rather an arrogant way to put it, but David didn’t disagree. The humans in this world were weak. Still, someone as exceptionally powerful among them as Xienhua would serve as a good enough vessel for Cornu, their supreme leader. That’s what everyone thought, which was why they were loath to let the troops serving under them handle this job. As mystics, they were just too strong against humans. It’d never be a fair battle, but at the same time, handling physical bodies they weren’t used to was difficult. <a id="page-107"></a>Along those lines, the work was better handled by Cornu’s direct aides, whose skills were on a whole other dimension. It made David laugh. Xienhua was as good as defeated already.</p>

      <p>“Of course, if Cornu doesn’t want a female body, we’ll find a substitute and I’ll take over Xienhua instead. I guess the man who used to own this body was infatuated with her, and now <em>I’m</em> getting pretty curious.”</p>

      <p>“What a small-minded thing to say. I hardly imagine Cornu will care about something like gender. You should banish the thought from your mind right now.”</p>

      <p>Li and David were half-joking with each other, as if the problem was already behind them. But Amari couldn’t shake his own anxieties. It wasn’t that he was dissatisfied with how things were going right now. He wasn’t ready to call it done and rest on his laurels, either, but they had pretty much set up the entire board for their invasion. Four generals and two marshals under Cornu’s command had completed their manifestations. The Underworld Gate was being steadily expanded, and plans were underway to procure Cornu’s future vessel. Pulcinella and the other two generals were hard at work, and all things considered, this world seemed irrevocably headed for its downfall. The only major job left was to manifest Cornu.</p>

      <p><em>Everything should be in place. There’s no way for them to stage a comeback now. I’m sure I haven’t overlooked anything…</em></p>

      <p>His careful analysis let him conclude that there were no problems left to speak of. But Amari was right to be anxious. It was well near impossible to imagine someone like Velgrynd suddenly stopping by.</p>

      <p>“Any human resistance here is barely worth paying attention to,” he said, shaking off his concerns. “But that doesn’t mean we need to let up. There are still the finishing touches left to consider, and I need everyone to fully devote themselves to them.”</p>

      <p class="tx1">After the imperial conference wrapped up, Velgrynd made a beeline for the palace’s great library. “Library” was the right term for <a id="page-108"></a>the vast floor it was situated on, piled high with untold numbers of tomes. She was here because she had some questions about things she’d heard during the conference—the names of certain countries, and people.</p>

      <p>Take, for example, the Holy Arcian Empire—it certainly sounded related to the kingdom of Arcia she’d once guided. Then there was the United States of Azeria and its current president. His name was George Hayes, which perfectly matched that of someone she’d met before jumping into this timeline. If Velgrynd’s memory served her, George’s father, Laurent Hayes, had been a possessor of a soul fragment from Ludora; she had accompanied him from young adulthood to his peaceful final days.</p>

      <p>That, among several things, had piqued her interest enough that she saw fit to research them.</p>

      <p>If all these familiar-sounding pieces of trivia belonged to the same timeline, it’d be easy to conclude that these nations and people were indeed the same as those Velgrynd knew. But it was also common to see differing worlds that bore startling resemblances to each other. Their origins and rules of nature were clearly divergent enough that one couldn’t call them parallel worlds, but for some reason, they’d share all these suspiciously similar names. This time, too, it might just be another funny coincidence, so Velgrynd thought it wise to explore this world’s history a little.</p>

      <p>Her investigations began with the founding of the Holy Arcian Empire, and through that she confirmed that there indeed used to be a kingdom of Arcia on this planet. The names of its kings and court retainers sounded familiar as well, making it clear that the legacy of the Arcia she knew was still alive in this world.</p>

      <p>When her attention turned toward George Hayes:</p>

      <p>“Ah, I thought so. His father’s name <em>is</em> Laurent Hayes. The president from seven terms ago; there’s no doubt about it. So little George got elected president, too, huh?”</p>

      <p>She remembered George, the boy who respected his father so much, and smiled. He always talked about how much he wanted to be a great president, just like dear old Dad. Laurent passed away peacefully at age sixty-two; George had been twenty-seven then <a id="page-109"></a>and fifty-two years old now, which meant that the leap Velgrynd had made put her into the exact same world as before, twenty-five years later.</p>

      <p>Oharu had presumably been alive a quarter century ago, too, which meant that two different people possessed parts of Ludora’s soul at the same time. It was quite a rarity, but given how strongly the soul fragments reacted just before the death of their possessors, one couldn’t write it off as impossible. That’s why she’d gone to the library to ensure the names weren’t mere coincidence.</p>

      <p>There had been a moment in the past when Laurent Hayes was jumped by a gang of thugs and nearly killed. That was the point where Velgrynd had jumped into the world. She’d promptly saved his life, and that had been the start of their relationship. It was a fond memory for her now, but she didn’t dwell on it for long before continuing her research.</p>

      <p>“I think George had a young son as well…”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd definitely remembered offering the baby her blessings—and looking at the family tree, she saw she was right. Emile Hayes was the name, exactly as her memory told her it would be, and now there was no doubting it at all.</p>

      <p>She nodded to herself with satisfaction. Then she noticed something unusual in the family record.</p>

      <p>“Wait… It’s <em>my</em> fault he married late? Come on.”</p>

      <p>This was nothing less than slander in Velgrynd’s mind. The biographical record she had open stated that Laurent Hayes was constantly shadowed by a mysterious, beautiful woman. That…wasn’t far from reality, but Velgrynd didn’t picture it that way, and she had hardly been a sinister presence in his life. She felt she had a right to complain. After all, she’d told Laurent that he was free to love whomever he liked; she had no intention of binding him down. But it was no doubt hard for a woman to approach someone who had a supermodel-class babe hanging around him all the time. All in all, it was pretty clear that Velgrynd was one big reason why Laurent had married so late in life.</p>

      <p>“I don’t know who wrote this, but I really wish I could send them a letter…”</p>

      <p><a id="page-110"></a>But the author had passed away long ago—which, perhaps, was really lucky for them.</p>

      <p class="space-break">Velgrynd was done at the library, but still making the most of her free time. No one could stop her—no one except Oharu, that is, and he largely gave her free rein over the palace. His instincts told him that was the most moderate option.</p>

      <p>Of course, not everyone welcomed her presence with open arms. The military officers who knew who she was gave her a lot of leeway—but the ladies of the palace didn’t.</p>

      <p>The empress, Oharu’s wife, was among them. “It’s just repulsive, isn’t it?” she said the very first time they met. “For a woman to get <em>that</em> close with His Majesty when we don’t even know where she came from.”</p>

      <p>She was fifty years old, the daughter of a prestigious noble prince. Medicine and sorcery had advanced to the point where the average life span in this world had reached around sixty, and the empress was still extremely active. To Velgrynd, though, she was like a cute puppy dog. Velgrynd had lived with Ludora in many forms across many years, so people like the empress were far from unfamiliar to her.</p>

      <p>“Oh, come on. Your cute little face will go to waste if you spend all day scowling like that. I’m sure Oharu would wish for you to be beautiful for him all the time, wouldn’t he?”</p>

      <p>So Velgrynd refused to play along. In fact, she even brought her hand up, caressing the empress’s hair. It happened quickly enough that the empress couldn’t escape—but the surprise didn’t end there. Before Velgrynd’s eyes, the empress’s skin began to regain a young, glossy appearance.</p>

      <p>“See? Now you’re a lot prettier. But maintenance is so important for things like this. I’ll teach you some breathing techniques you can use for spiritual balance, so make sure you practice them, all right?”</p>

      <p>“…Huh?”</p>

      <p>The empress was speechless. She literally couldn’t find the words. The lady attendants were all staring at her, eyes wide open. They <a id="page-111"></a>had just witnessed the empress fully regaining the beauty from her past. Anyone would’ve been just as surprised.</p>

      <p>“It—it can’t be… You can turn back time?”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd laughed. “No, not turn back time. All I did was energize her skin cells to make her look prettier. She hasn’t changed species or anything, and she’s still just as mortal as before.”</p>

      <p>Everyone has a limited life span, she explained, and using spiritual energy to give her skin cells this jolt wouldn’t lengthen her life. But Velgrynd didn’t quite have it right. It might have been little more than a blip to her, but she <em>had</em> extended the empress’s life. Her body was healthier now, capable of fighting off most illnesses. Her digestion had improved, giving her almost perfect antiaging traits. It would ultimately grant her over double her potential life span, and if she kept up the breathing methods Velgrynd taught her, she’d be able to make the most of all those years.</p>

      <p>“I think I may have been mistaken about you, Ryu-oh.”</p>

      <p>Never one to look a gift horse in the mouth, she instantly became a fan of Velgrynd, as did her attendants.</p>

      <p>“Me too!”</p>

      <p>“Yes, so was I!”</p>

      <p>“Yes, so please, I would love it if you could teach me this breathing technique as well!”</p>

      <p>None of them were going to turn down some free youth, either.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Velgrynd was now a few days into her stay in this world, teaching the palace ladies how to meditate, enjoying high tea, and living a truly elegant life. The military, on the other hand, was busy.</p>

      <p>Talks with the administrations of all the other countries were proceeding slowly at best. There was still no sign they could arrange an international summit anytime soon, and without any progress to report, Oharu hadn’t presided over any new imperial conferences. Pointless meetings just took up time; it was better for them to devote their efforts to something constructive.</p>

      <p>Oharu agreed with that idea, and Velgrynd wasn’t about to object. <a id="page-112"></a>But she was growing unhappy. She was losing valuable time. Even now, the <em>yohma</em> were likely working on their preparations; if they didn’t hurry, figuring out how to hold a summit would be the least of their worries. It’d force Velgrynd to take center stage and fight before humanity could come together to fend for itself.</p>

      <p><em>And, you know, that’s fine and all. But if that’s how it shakes out, me shooing away the mystics isn’t going to end this war…</em></p>

      <p>The thought depressed Velgrynd. Everything would become so needlessly complicated in that scenario. So she decided to lend a bit of a hand. In the end, she really <em>did</em> like being helpful, despite it all.</p>

      <p>“Does it look like the negotiations are going well?”</p>

      <p>She asked the question as she strode uninvited into the foreign ministry’s intelligence office. It was just past noon, but things looked chaotic here, and Velgrynd’s sudden appearance did nothing to mollify the bureaucrats that manned it. Not that she cared, of course.</p>

      <p>“Ryu-oh, we really can’t have this. Only authorized people are allowed in here—”</p>

      <p>“No more talking, please. We’re three days in on this. Have any countries agreed to talk with us?”</p>

      <p>“That, um…”</p>

      <p>As the ministry officer reluctantly explained, the Republic of Chinese Fiefdoms had agreed to a summit only if the other warring nations also participated. The Greater Rossiam Dynasty held the same stance—but this was the same as saying “no” in the most passive way possible, because the response from the United States of Azeria and the Holy Arcian Empire boiled down to “now’s not the time.” Given the current circumstances, it was unthinkable for the leader of a nation to leave its borders, and none of them were in a position to hold a summit anyway, whether conducted live or over the phone.</p>

      <p>“That’s how things are right now,” the haggard-looking official said, “so we’re trying to be as persistent as we can in reasoning with them.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd rolled her eyes. “Well, I’m glad to see <em>you’re</em> taking your time with this. But fine. I’ll help you a little bit.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-113"></a>It was the classic hot-and-cold treatment people like Masayuki would have been well familiar with. But the stodgy bureaucrats here didn’t take much of a liking to it.</p>

      <p>“However—”</p>

      <p>“Well, look who thinks she’s the boss of us now! You might be powerful and pretty, but intelligence is our business, and I’d prefer if you didn’t butt in.”</p>

      <p>As annoyed as he was, even this official had to admit the truth about Velgrynd’s beauty. But while he might have had good reason to not want amateurs commenting on his affairs, his reaction was ill-advised.</p>

      <p>“But if I leave it all to you people, you’ll run out of time before the enemy starts to move! Just let me sit here!”</p>

      <p>So the now-livid Velgrynd pushed the official away and took position by his communications equipment. A quick look around made it clear how it worked, so she promptly took action, reaching out to the United States of Azeria’s intelligence department on the first try.</p>

      <p><em>“You can hear me, right?”</em> she began, not bothering to ask who was on the other side.</p>

      <p><em>“Quit hounding us,”</em> replied a strained voice. <em>“We passed on your nation’s requests to the higher-ups, but the president is a busy man. You have to understand that there’s no time for negotiations.”</em></p>

      <p>They might have been the enemy, but they were being used by the <em>yohma</em> just as much. That must have been why they were at least making an effort to respond instead of flatly dismissing Velgrynd. But they still hadn’t set up a meeting, and the simple reason for this was that Azeria was in a state of internal chaos. Japan understood that well enough, so it hadn’t pushed the matter very much. But Velgrynd didn’t care about any of that.</p>

      <p><em>“Whatever. Just put little George on the line for me, all right? Your president.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“You don’t understand, do you? And you can’t go around calling our president ‘little George,’ either. I keep telling you that we’re busy—”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Tell him Velgrynd is calling, and I think he’ll come right over.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“What?”</em></p>

      <p><a id="page-114"></a>The voice seemed a bit confused by this, but Velgrynd ended the call without further comment. She personally knew the president of Azeria, their enemies, and naturally she wanted to take advantage of that. Now she had to see how they’d respond. If they actually relayed the message to President Hayes, things would start to go quickly. If not, she was planning to make a personal visit. She knew where he would be—in the same spot as twenty-five years ago, although it only seemed like a few days to her. And since physical positions remained constant even in other timelines, she could move right over via Spatial Transport without problems.</p>

      <p><em>I think I’ll head over if they don’t respond to me within one day.</em></p>

      <p>Next, Velgrynd sent out a message to the Holy Arcian Empire. She had thought about how to negotiate with them as well. Precisely working the virtually magical communications terminal in front of her, she immediately opened up a channel, called for someone on the other end, and began making her one-sided demands.</p>

      <p><em>“Give this message to your emperor for me. Tell him to agree to the requests sent by the Conquering Empire of Japan. Do it, and we’ll provide you with another sacred treasure—a sword, a spear, a bow, you name it. Velgrynd herself has personally guaranteed it, so we want you to work fast.”</em></p>

      <p>The recipient of this snippy message had no idea how to react. As far as he knew, he didn’t take orders from anyone calling themselves Velgrynd. He had no reason to agree to this, but this was an official international communications channel. Ignoring her wasn’t an option, but a communications officer like him couldn’t meet with the emperor just because he wanted to. He honestly thought the request was ridiculous.</p>

      <p>Still, he reported this call to his boss regardless. He did so because she had used the term “sacred treasure.”</p>

      <p>The Holy Arcian Empire retained a fighting task force, a national power whose name was renowned even in other nations. They were called the Seven Sacred Treasures—seven people gifted with supernatural abilities in battle—and they were particularly famed for the weapons they possessed. These weapons were conscious creatures, and only when someone was selected by them as their owner could <a id="page-115"></a>they become part of this group. It was a story that had been passed down since the founding of the nation; no Arcian was unaware of it, and most of the rest of the world was familiar with the tale as well.</p>

      <p>Casually stating that you could simply create another one of them was anathema. Doing so during international diplomacy was even worse. All communication records were kept on this channel, and what Velgrynd had said could be used as fodder to intensify the war.</p>

      <p>So he had no choice but to report this. That was a negotiating tactic deliberately picked by Velgrynd. But the communications officer Velgrynd had just kicked out of his seat, along with his associates, had had enough.</p>

      <p>“Wh-what are you…?! Look, I’ll abide by what you did with Azeria. I <em>won’t</em>, really, but at least I could blame all of that on you alone. But there’s no way we can back away from what you told the Arcians!”</p>

      <p>“Y-yeah! And how underhanded of you, using a false name like that. They’re bound to find out the truth soon enough! This is going to be a <em>huge</em> problem!”</p>

      <p>It certainly didn’t seem like a false name to Velgrynd, but to someone who didn’t know her, it must’ve sounded like she was trying to con the other nations. They had her wrong, but she didn’t feel like explaining things to them, so she ignored their protests. Whining about it now was pointless. It was up to the other parties to respond.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="image" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">So Velgrynd finished making her moves. All complaints about them were cast aside, and she decided to have some tea made and enjoy an elegant break as she waited for word from those she had contacted.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the head of the foreign ministry’s intelligence department was silently fuming, ready to try Velgrynd for high treason depending on how the other nations responded.</p>

      <p><em>That stupid girl… She’s strong, I’ll admit that. But she can’t trick me. I kept quiet around His Majesty, but she’s waiting for when we’re at our weakest so she can swindle us with her lies.</em></p>

      <p>She had pulled the wool over everyone’s eyes at the imperial conference, but in retrospect, the things Velgrynd told them all were patently ridiculous. If she was telling the truth, there was no hope left for humanity. He couldn’t tell exactly how powerful she was, but there’s no way they could ever beat an army with mythical strength. The thought had begun to make Velgrynd seem like a villain in his mind—the “denial” phase of the grief cycle writ large, not that he was aware of it. His rage was ratcheting up his anxieties—and just when he was almost at the end of his rope…</p>

      <p><em>“Velgrynd? Hi, Velgrynd! It’s me!”</em></p>

      <p>The message came from the United States of Azeria, and it came at startling speed. And who could it be but:</p>

      <p><em>“Well, hello there, little George! I heard that you’re president now, aren’t you? I sure wish Laurent was around to see what a fine man you’ve become.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Ah, it really is you, Velgrynd,”</em> replied President George Hayes. <em>“I’m so glad to hear your voice! I never thought I’d see you again.”</em></p>

      <p>Everyone overhearing the conversation was stunned into silence. The department official Velgrynd had tangled with earlier, on the other hand, was simply confused beyond belief.</p>

      <p><em>What? Velgrynd wasn’t a fake name? Wait… No, that doesn’t matter. Ryu-oh is personally connected to the president? This makes no sense to me…</em></p>

      <p>He had looked down on Velgrynd as this impertinent compulsive liar, but in an instant, he was almost feeling respect for her. Velgrynd herself, however, didn’t care what any of them thought.</p>

      <p><em>“Now, George, I’m sorry to ask you for favors out of nowhere, but is it okay if we catch up later? There’s something really important that I want to take care of first. Have they told you about what’s going on?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Yes. And you’re right. I have things I want to discuss with you as well, though. Can you hear me out before we move on to this business of yours?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Of course. You’re Laurent’s pride and joy, you know. I almost feel like a mother to you, in a way.”</em></p>

      <p><a id="page-116"></a><a id="page-117"></a><em>“Thank you. I’m happy to hear that. Now, as for the current situation, I think we need to sit down and brief each other so we’re all on the same page.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“I agree with you. Should I take that to mean you’ll carry out my request?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“That won’t be a problem, no. When shall we hold this meeting?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“I’ll tell you once I check with Ludora—um, I mean His Majesty the Emperor.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Oh, yes, you said there was one other person from my father’s generation, didn’t you? Well, all right. I can’t remain on constant standby, but I’ll arrange things so I can sit down and talk whenever you can.”</em></p>

      <p>And just like that, Velgrynd had secured a promise from the president.</p>

      <p class="space-break">It wasn’t much longer before a call came from the Arcians as well.</p>

      <p><em>“Is Lady Velgrynd on hand?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Right here. That’s me.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Thank you. My name is Bright, and I serve as leader of the Seven Sacred Treasures of the Holy Arcian Empire. I am deeply moved to receive the honor of a conversation with you, my lady, but before we begin, there was one thing I wanted to confirm…”</em></p>

      <p><em>“…What is that?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Are you truly the goddess that we worship?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Huh? What’s the point of that question?”</em></p>

      <p>If they wanted to confirm whether Velgrynd was lying, she was awfully curious about how they expected to figure that out.</p>

      <p><em>“Because don’t tell me you have someone there that’s old enough to know if I’m telling the truth or not.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“No, not that…”</em></p>

      <p><em>“And I also have to say that I didn’t think your king heard my name and decided not to reach out to me personally. Is this how small-minded the descendants of Shin have become?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Shin? Wait, do you mean Shin, our divine founding emperor?! Because if you dare to insult the Arcian imperial court—”</em></p>

      <p><em>“And one other thing—why are you people called the</em> Seven <em>Sacred Treasures? Because I’m rather sure that I left you with twelve God-class weapons, not seven. You haven’t somehow had any lost or stolen from you, have you? Because I’d hardly dream that you don’t even have twelve people worthy of being picked by those treasures.</em> That’s <em>certainly not the case, is it?”</em></p>

      <p>Bright’s anger quickly vanished. At that moment, the leader of the Seven Sacred Treasures was convinced. The woman on the other line calling herself Velgrynd was truly the goddess he knew.</p>

      <p><em>I recall my own master telling me that there were twelve treasures. It was a true story, one passed down orally across generations, and if she knows that, she has to be the real thing…</em></p>

      <p>There had indeed been twelve sacred treasures. The imperial government, seeing a need to protect their arsenal for desperate times, decreed that only seven would be made public knowledge.</p>

      <p>However, that didn’t mean there were twelve people possessing them all, either. Currently, just as Velgrynd had surmised, the number was only eight. Across the four-thousand-year history of the Holy Arcian Empire, three sacred treasures had been lost. One was taken away by a traitor, and two went missing after their owners went off to battle and never returned. As a result, the Arcians currently had only nine treasures left. One was kept in secret, possessed by the emperor’s personal bodyguard and assistant, and another one was masterless, stowed away in the national archives as an imperial treasure.</p>

      <p>Having Velgrynd guess the truth like this unnerved Bright. But that wasn’t all that convinced him. Just hearing her voice put him in a state of awe. The sheer force behind it told him she was for real; that was most of the reason. So, regardless of what she had to tell him, Bright bowed his head to the communications equipment he was using. The fact she had no way of seeing this didn’t matter. It was respect for Velgrynd that drove him to do it.</p>

      <p><em>“I sincerely apologize, my goddess. I will immediately report to the emperor of Arcia and give him your demands!”</em></p>

      <p><em>“…Oh, you will? Well, no more time-wasting, then, all right? Get moving.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Yes, my lord!”</em></p>

      <p>Velgrynd wasn’t done complaining yet, but she let Bright off the <a id="page-118"></a><a id="page-119"></a>hook for now. She had achieved her goals. Now she had two nations doing her bidding.</p>

      <p class="tx1">“Well,” she muttered to herself, “guess I’ll tackle the Greater Rossiam Dynasty next.”</p>

      <p>Working her communicator, she opened a channel with the Rossiam intelligence department. However, the channel that should’ve worked was being blocked by some kind of interference.</p>

      <p>“That’s strange. Hey, you over there; when was the last time you made contact with Greater Rossiam?”</p>

      <p>“Early this morning!” the official she’d pointed at hurriedly replied. “We make regular contacts with each other six times a day, in the daytime and evening.”</p>

      <p>Being at war, they kept this window open regardless of the time difference. This was based on an agreement between all the countries involved, meant to speed up negotiations depending on the state of the war. Normally it’d be used to work out the terms of an armistice, but for now they exchanged information on the <em>yohma</em> over this hotline. Given that they had all let their militaries run out of control, they needed a firm grasp of current affairs so they could work out how to explain matters to their citizens.</p>

      <p>“Was there anything unusual up to now?”</p>

      <p>“Not in particular, sir…”</p>

      <p>“No progress,” the hesitant official said, “but no abnormalities, either.”</p>

      <p>The time was almost here for their regular afternoon contact. It was doubtful that the other side simply wasn’t on duty, and given their dedication to retaining backup communications equipment, a mechanical error was hard to picture. As the official thought, it seemed fair to consider the possibility of an unfolding emergency.</p>

      <p>But even in the midst of this, Velgrynd was her usual self.</p>

      <p><em>This world isn’t at the level where you can magically interfere with communications like this. It’s all but inevitable that the</em> yohma <em>are up to something. And of course they have to do it right when I’ve got business to take care of… Unlucky for them, I suppose. Or not? Perhaps this is Ludora’s own luck coming into play. Ah, he never lets me down!</em></p>

      <p>Her mind was bursting with optimism. And she was right—magic in this world was more the realm of offensive sorcery and energy-sapping curses, and it was hard to cast spells that could directly rejigger the physical laws of the world. But praising Ludora for this was going overboard. The Oharu of this realm had no such powers; all of this was better chalked up to mere coincidence. To put it bluntly, the mystics had luck going against them. The moment Velgrynd had begun to play an active role, their invasion was all but doomed.</p>

      <p>Nimbly working the communicator, Velgrynd began to draw two intricate magic circles in the air, each about a foot in diameter and illuminating her equipment with an eerie glow. They transformed her magical force into electronic signals, transmitting them to the remote receiver in Greater Rossiam, where they acted against the mystics’ jamming to destroy it in an instant. It was a trick that not even the master sorcerers of this world could comprehend, much less your average person.</p>

      <p><em>“Is anybody there? Please respond if you are—”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Ah, finally! Mayday, Mayday, Mayday, the</em> yohma <em>are attacking the royal palace! They cut off all links with the outside! We thought we were done for!”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Oh, don’t panic, silly. This is the Conquering Empire of Japan. I won’t say that we’re not going to help you, but I can’t say that I appreciate being asked for favors out of nowhere like this.”</em></p>

      <p>She had a good point. It brought the soldiers from Rossiam who heard her response back to their senses. There was a pause as they discussed matters, and then the line was taken by a calmer voice.</p>

      <p><em>“Pardon our alarm earlier. This is Sergey, director of the Foreign Intelligence Department of Greater Rossiam. It embarrasses me to admit this, but we want to ask for your support. We’ve been sending messages out across Rossiam, but we have yet to receive any other response. I apologize, but could you reach out to the rest of our lands for us?”</em></p>

      <p>As Sergey explained, they would provide Velgrynd with ciphers <a id="page-120"></a><a id="page-121"></a>linking her to Rossiam’s military bases if she agreed to it. The royal forces were keeping up their resistance, but the <em>yohma</em> clearly had the upper hand. The Rossiam noncombatants were evacuated, but their hiding spots would clearly be rooted out before long, and after that the royal family’s protection couldn’t be guaranteed. That was why Sergey wanted to call for backup from across the nation and bring the royals to safety while the <em>yohma</em> were thrown into chaos.</p>

      <p>The fate of Greater Rossiam was riding entirely on how Japan decided to deal with them. And yet:</p>

      <p><em>“Didn’t I tell you that I don’t appreciate receiving all these demands from you?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Wait, wait, if you can assist us—”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Calm down, won’t you? It doesn’t matter to me what’s happening with you at the moment. I’m the one who deserves to make demands of you, all right?”</em></p>

      <p>She was giving Sergey her terms, not the other way around, and she wasn’t willing to take no for an answer. It was incredibly selfish of her, albeit undoubtedly much in character.</p>

      <p><em>“But you can’t just—”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Here are my demands. We’re going to hold an international summit to determine the future direction for the world, so I want your royalty or any other supreme commander from your nation to attend. Promise me that, and I’ll assist you.”</em></p>

      <p>“How?” is what Sergey should have been asking, but somehow, he could take her claim at face value. He looked around the room he was in, taking glances at the nobility he was charged with guarding.</p>

      <p><em>It’s my duty to protect them all. For now…</em></p>

      <p>He understood there was no other option. Trusting the words of some foreigner he didn’t know would normally have been a terrible idea, something he’d never dream of doing. Right now, however, even if he wound up betrayed by her offer, it wouldn’t delay their downfall anyway.</p>

      <p><em>In terms of the risk, it doesn’t matter whether I believe her or not. In the end, at least, I might as well dare to dream of some kind of hope. I hate to get all the royalty mixed up in this madness, but…</em></p>

      <p>But Sergey was still ready to commit.</p>

      <p><a id="page-122"></a>“Excuse me. I’m sure this must sound ridiculous right now, but the other party is demanding we participate in an international summit. Would it be possible for you to attend, Your Majesty?”</p>

      <p>“…I will agree to it.”</p>

      <p>He was answered by the most powerful person in the room.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>Emperor Magellan of the Greater Rossiam Dynasty was thirty-five years of age—still young, but in his tenth year on the throne. He was thus an ambitious ruler, using his absolute power to invade the Chinese republic in order to gain a firm hold on all the northern lands. There were those against it among the military ranks, but many hawks as well, and so Magellan’s will had taken precedent as the war began.</p>

      <p>Now Magellan was facing a serious setback. Faced with an enemy unimaginable by human standards, he was plagued by how sheerly powerless he was. It was far too late now, but he regretted every decision he’d made. All had been going well until he’d undertaken his first operation against the Chinese, but now it had destabilized his entire nation.</p>

      <p>He might have had the luxurious tastes of royalty, but he was not that inept of a ruler. Under normal circumstances, the citizens wouldn’t have minded their emperor living an elegant, refined lifestyle if their own prosperity was assured. But the war had changed everything. They wanted to seize more arable land for their people; they wanted to obtain an all-year port for the sake of their defenses. Everything about the war was because of Rossiam’s desires alone, and it had led to an invasion that wholly backfired on them—an explosive situation where they could neither take action nor retreat. And by the time they realized it was the <em>yohma</em>’s work, things were just too chaotic to recover from.</p>

      <p><em>It all seems so foolish now. I never should have lent an ear to that man…</em></p>

      <p>Magellan’s most trusted confidant at the time was the one who’d turned his interests toward war. They later found out that he had <a id="page-123"></a>been taken over by the <em>yohma</em>. These were strange creatures; instead of simply overthrowing the world, they seemed to enjoy making humanity fight against each other, guiding them toward their own doom. That’s why Magellan was still alive.</p>

      <p><em>Those</em> yohma <em>are fiendishly powerful. We can’t beat them. At this rate, even if we had Pulcinella here, we still would have lost…</em></p>

      <p>He recalled that confidant of his, possessed by the <em>yohma</em> and laughing in his face. It made him shiver. Even worse, the Mad Priest he counted as his last resort was also on the enemy’s side now.</p>

      <p>Thanks to that, there was apparently rioting going on in the capital. The nation was at war, for certain, and the people couldn’t be blamed for their anxiety—but there had been no fighting within Rossiam’s borders, and the food supply had never given out. It was no time for rioting to occur at all, but things just kept getting worse. It was all being fanned by the mystics, the possessed people who placed their faith in Pulcinella.</p>

      <p>By now, the court could no longer be protected only by the Imperial Defense Department. If it was dangerous outside the palace as well, it’d only be a matter of time before they were all caught. So Magellan, bereft of hope either way, had no choice but to agree to this request from an enemy nation.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

      <p>Sergey saluted Magellan before returning to his communicator and engaging with Velgrynd again.</p>

      <p><em>“We accept all your demands. However, unfortunately…”</em></p>

      <p>Greater Rossiam was in a state of emergency. Even if they wished to send their king out to a meeting, there was simply no way to do so. That’s what he wanted to say. If the offer was to help out if they agreed to the summit, that likely meant Japan was sending reinforcements. If those forces moved quickly enough, there was a chance they’d be saved. Or, really, Sergey didn’t mind if he lost his life in the effort—he simply had to be sure the imperial family, the symbol of the dynasty, would make it through this.</p>

      <p><a id="page-124"></a>But then something surprising happened. Velgrynd agreed to offer her aid—and that meant their future was assured.</p>

      <p><em>“Very well. I’m glad you’re not as stupid as I feared you were at first. I’m going to deploy a Gate over there, so go through and come over here, all right?”</em></p>

      <p>Just as she stopped talking, the air began to warp in front of Sergey and his comrades. The other side of the rift in space revealed the place Velgrynd was sitting. This was Dimensional Connection, the supernatural ability to link two places together regardless of distance.</p>

      <p>“““No…”””</p>

      <p>Everyone there except for Velgrynd was united in shock. They now understood who held supreme authority here. No matter what, they must never get on the bad side of that woman.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">“Wait… Why are people from Greater Rossiam here?”</p>

      <p>“Whoa, whoa, am I dreaming? Ow…”</p>

      <p>At least one person was pinching their cheek, unable to accept reality.</p>

      <p>“I can’t believe it. Our records talk about people in the <em>shinbutsu</em> rank who can cast teleportation magic, but…”</p>

      <p>Others tried their best to analyze what was going on, but their brains just couldn’t keep up. They couldn’t be blamed. No one could imagine connecting two spaces so far apart from each other.</p>

      <p>“Uniting three nations so instantly…”</p>

      <p>Only the most resilient could realize what the meaning of this was.</p>

      <p>“My goddess… You are truly a goddess!”</p>

      <p>The staff at the foreign ministry’s intelligence division were all astonished by Velgrynd’s power and abilities. At this point, nobody dared to defy her. Even the top officials were busy cultivating newfound respect for her, no longer afraid to brownnose her if need be.</p>

      <p>“That just leaves China, but if we have three nations agreeing to this summit, that satisfies the conditions, doesn’t it?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-125"></a>“Yes, my lady, it does!”</p>

      <p>“Okay, so you guys can handle the rest of the negotiations yourselves for me?”</p>

      <p>“““Certainly!”””</p>

      <p>Nobody was foolish enough to refuse, of course, the officials all staking their pride on successfully reasoning with the Chinese.</p>

      <p>Velgrynd nodded and turned toward the befuddled Greater Rossiam leaders in the room. “So is this all of you? I’m sorry, but anybody outside the room you were just in is beyond what I could agree to. If we destroy the <em>yohma</em> quickly enough, though, I think we can save all of them.”</p>

      <p>They could do nothing but eagerly nod at this. Not all of the imperial court had made it through the rift, but they cared more about saving their own hides than whoever was left behind. There was no way they could pin the blame for any of that on Velgrynd.</p>

      <p>“We thank you for your assistance.”</p>

      <p>Sergey, overcoming his confusion first, thanked her. It made Magellan realize that he needed to do the same.</p>

      <p>“Allow me to offer my appreciation as well. Once this is all over, I promise you may accept whatever you want as a reward.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd snorted a bit, not sounding too interested in what he had to offer. Emperor or not, she acted just as arrogant around them all.</p>

      <p>“I don’t need anything, thank you. I’m sure you can’t fulfill my wish anyway. Just help me out with this operation, all right?”</p>

      <p>“We—we will, yes. Of course.”</p>

      <p>Magellan was put off by this flat refusal, but he wasn’t small-minded enough to lose his temper over it. Here, the title of Emperor of the Greater Rossiam Dynasty didn’t have that much meaning. Even he understood that his life had been spared mainly because she found him useful.</p>

      <p>“May I at least ask the name of the woman I owe my life to?”</p>

      <p>“Call me Ryu-oh, please.”</p>

      <p>“Very well. And again, Ryu-oh, I thank you.”</p>

      <p>“Not a problem. Now, I’ll let you know once we have a time and date for the summit, so for now, rest easy here, all right?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-126"></a>Velgrynd was acting every bit like an empress now. She was the law here.</p>

      <p>A staff official quickly stood up and ran out of the room so he could order living spaces prepared for these unexpected guests. Another one bowed to Magellan and his entourage, ready to show them around. They would be waited upon in a reception room until their rooms were ready. All this role assignment was done without any previous discussion; their teamwork was a sight to see. Even Velgrynd was a little impressed.</p>

      <p>Then the most self-important of the foreign ministry’s officials decided now would be a great time to try buttering her up.</p>

      <p>“Lady Ryu-oh, please, instead of black tea, try this top-of-the-line <em>gyokuro</em> green tea as well!”</p>

      <p>No need to waste time as they awaited the Chinese response, he reasoned. Nor this chance to make himself look good around her.</p>

      <p>“Oh, how thoughtful of you.”</p>

      <p>“Thank you very much! My name is Kanji Yamamoto, and your words alone fill me with supreme satisfaction!”</p>

      <p>Yamamoto never let up for a moment—one of his greatest talents, his staff thought.</p>

      <p>“This is very tasty. It has an airy sort of sweet aroma, but such a refreshing aftertaste.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I’m very proud of it. It’s provided by one of my favorite stores.”</p>

      <p>“I like it.”</p>

      <p>“In that case, I think you may enjoy some of the snacks here as well.”</p>

      <p>Yamamoto next took out some <em>fondant au chocolat</em>, an elegant sweetness exuding from it. This was an almost decadent luxury to enjoy during wartime. He had obtained this treat for himself, exercising his power and finances to the fullest, but he was offering it to Velgrynd now. The taste was more than satisfactory to her.</p>

      <p>“Kanji Yamamoto, was it? I’ll remember that name.”</p>

      <p>“Y-yes, my lady! I am tremendously honored!”</p>

      <p>She was making this offer despite never having bothered to remember the name of any other human being in her life. She <a id="page-127"></a>could be surprisingly vulnerable to brazen bribery like this. Perhaps Yamamoto deserved the victory, though, quick as he had been to realize that money wasn’t likely to move her.</p>

      <p>After a period of waiting:</p>

      <p>“The Chinese have responded! They said they’ll attend the summit!”</p>

      <p>Good news rang across the room—and with that, the five-nation summit was a done deal.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="image" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">“What? Is that the truth?”</p>

      <p>“Well, of course. Why would I lie to you?”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd’s report came as a total shock to Oharu. A summit like this was thought to be impossible, but she had achieved it with the greatest of ease.</p>

      <p><em>Once again, there’s just no guessing how far she’ll go. I’m lucky she’s on my side, but if it’s strictly based on her affinity for me…well, it’s almost too absurd to believe.</em></p>

      <p>These friendly terms could instantly change at Velgrynd’s whim. The thought scared Oharu. A trusting relationship is something built gradually; normally, it involved spending lots of time with each other, working out what the other party allows and what riles their anger. Nations worked the same way; if they couldn’t share their values with each other, it’d be hard to get along very well. Invaders like the mystics were obviously enemies, since there was no reasoning with them. It seemed a pity to resort to violence against these clearly intelligent creatures, but the line had to be drawn somewhere.</p>

      <p>And then we had Velgrynd here.</p>

      <p>“Isn’t that wonderful, Ludora? I’ll work out a site for the summit, too, so what time works for you?”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd was clearly exercising her full trust with Oharu—and that, he thought, was why he needed to stay on his guard. The conclusion he reached: fight kindness with kindness. He had no choice but to trust her, so there was no need to stew over it. All he had to <a id="page-128"></a>do was express the gratitude he felt with all his might. It was the only way, he believed, that he could repay her.</p>

      <p>“I thank you, Velgrynd. And it’d make me even happier if you keep helping me like this.”</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee-hee! Oh, don’t worry about it.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd laughed, expressing the joy deep in her heart. To her, Ludora’s happiness was her own as well, so Oharu’s decision had been absolutely correct.</p>

      <p class="space-break">It was decided that the summit would take place after lunch the next day. They needed to formulate a strategy against the <em>yohma</em> quickly, so there was no time for grand arrangements; Oharu decided it best to prioritize efficiency. Time differences, or any other business the other leaders had, were not at all a concern to him.</p>

      <p>This was duly relayed to, and agreed upon by, the other nations. It was fully up to the foreign ministry’s intelligence department to handle this, which led to some tense moments, but Velgrynd couldn’t have possibly cared less about them.</p>

      <p>“Ah, Yamamoto, right? Keep up the good work.”</p>

      <p>That compliment alone was the greatest consideration she’d give anyone. It was doubly unfair, since it was Yamamoto’s staff working long hours while he mostly sat around, but Velgrynd was already making her next set of demands to them.</p>

      <p>“All right, so make sure you have a site set up by tomorrow morning. Something solemn and impressive, as befitting His Majesty the Emperor.”</p>

      <p>“G-gladly!”</p>

      <p>It was beyond unreasonable of her, but Yamamoto had no right of refusal. In fact, he even seemed a little grateful for it. Perhaps this was awakening him to certain fetishes he didn’t know he had—but, again, Velgrynd neither knew nor cared.</p>

      <p>“Oh, and can you move a communicator over to a bit of a larger room for me?”</p>

      <p>“What for, my lady?”</p>

      <p>Given that this summit would take place over voice lines, Yamamoto was planning to place the equipment in the largest meeting <a id="page-129"></a>hall they had, not “a bit of a larger room.” He was wondering what Velgrynd meant by that.</p>

      <p>“Well, because I’m going to have people from all the other nations here, too, like what I did with Greater Rossiam. That’ll save people some trouble, and don’t you think it’ll eliminate a lot of wasted time, too?”</p>

      <p>“What?”</p>

      <p>What he thought about it was moot. This was beyond the realm of common sense. Yamamoto couldn’t believe it—but if it was possible, some part of his mind told him, then yes, it’d be better that way.</p>

      <p>“Or do you have a complaint about that?”</p>

      <p>“N-no, my lady! I would never! I—I will promptly begin working on it! At once!”</p>

      <p>“Oh? Thank you, then.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd smiled, her anger quelled for now, and left. Yamamoto looked around at the ministry officials around him.</p>

      <p>“What will we do, sir?”</p>

      <p>“What do you <em>think</em>, you fools?! We’ll do exactly what she says, of course! The site needs to be moved at once!”</p>

      <p>“All right!”</p>

      <p>“And move a communicator into meeting hall number two at the same time!”</p>

      <p>“Roger that!”</p>

      <p>So began a long, sleepless night for the intelligence department.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="image" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">The fate of the human race was riding on this day.</p>

      <p>Meeting hall number two had been transformed overnight, and Velgrynd was satisfied with the results. A communicator was in place, along with a set of ornate chairs and soft cushions for relaxing on. All the extraneous fixtures had been taken out of this largish meeting hall, and the refined decor matched the tastes of the world leaders due to visit. Some light fare and drinks were spread on a table against the wall, with several servants waiting nearby. <a id="page-130"></a>Everything was first-class in make, ensuring that no one would question the Conquering Empire’s finer tastes.</p>

      <p>“I like this. Well done, Yamamoto.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, my lady! Thank you very much. Simply hearing that from you makes me feel like I, Yamamoto, am ascending toward the heavens!”</p>

      <p>Kanji Yamamoto was nothing if not an erudite sycophant. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to curry favor with Velgrynd, and he had succeeded with flying colors. Velgrynd, after all, had always been a connoisseur of the finer things in life; impressing someone like her was a feat in itself, and the military officers who stopped in to look were amazed he’d pulled it off in a single night. Yamamoto’s own staff held their heads high, just as proud as their boss.</p>

      <p>“Right. We’re short on time, so let’s get started.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd sat down on a chair. Elegantly, but with a sense of urgency, she nimbly worked the communicator. The first nation she reached out to was the United States of Azeria.</p>

      <p>“Hi, George. Doing well?”</p>

      <p>“Y-yeah. It really brings me back, seeing you act all crazy like this again. But…maybe it’s weird to say, but I’m relieved you haven’t changed at all.”</p>

      <p>President Hayes couldn’t be blamed for his confusion. After all, the communicator had been dropped entirely in favor of a Dimensional-Connection-driven trip right into the room. The Azeria cabinet members with him could scarcely believe their eyes.</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee-hee! Why would I ever change? I know it’s been twenty-five years for you, but to me, we only left each other a few days ago.”</p>

      <p>“Ah yes, right you are.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd and George chatted about the past a bit longer, Yamamoto making sure they weren’t interrupted. With a casual look, he put the servants to work—and in a few moments, the befuddled Azeria cabinet members were able to relax and take in the situation a little more.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Velgrynd’s conversation was accelerating in pace.</p>

      <p><a id="page-131"></a>“Oh yes, how I remember! There was never a dull moment around that man, you know.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, he mentioned to me how you always put up with his big talk.”</p>

      <p>“I sure did. Like how he declared the day before a big hurricane that it’d be clear and sunny the next day.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, I know that story, trust me. He told it to me before bed lots of times. And it really <em>was</em> sunny, thanks to you.”</p>

      <p>“Mm-hmm. There was this baseball game that day, and the neighborhood kids were looking forward to it. He was always messing around with them, telling all sorts of lies like that. Perhaps that’s why he said it to me, like ‘Hey, what’s the harm if something I say comes true for a change?’ And I actually agreed to it. It was the dumbest thing, I tell you.”</p>

      <p>The idea of her single-handedly quelling a hurricane gave everyone in the room pause.</p>

      <p>“You’re kidding me…”</p>

      <p>“She’s not even trying to hide how abnormal she is…”</p>

      <p>Some of them couldn’t be bothered to conceal their surprise any longer. Velgrynd didn’t notice, and wouldn’t have cared if she had.</p>

      <p>“Oh, was <em>that</em> why? Because Dad just talked about how hilarious it was when the kids got all freaked out about it. I didn’t know <em>that</em> was the reason…”</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee-hee! Oh, but the kids were really happy, too. Their team was excited to play that day. There was a really long home run, if I remember.”</p>

      <p>“I’m sure there was. My child loves baseball, too, you know…”</p>

      <p>Then Velgrynd spotted the clouds forming over George’s head. The change was slight, something most people wouldn’t notice, but she was reading the emotions framing the thoughts around this conversation, so she could pick up on it.</p>

      <p>“Actually, how is Emile doing?”</p>

      <p>Emile Hayes, George’s son, was the reason for his sudden melancholy, Velgrynd surmised. She deliberately brought up his name to George, hoping it’d make it easier to talk about.</p>

      <p><a id="page-132"></a>“Ahhh, there you go again, Velgrynd. Nothing ever escapes your notice, does it?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, that’s not true. You’re just like a son to me, is all. I worry about you.”</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh… Well, thanks. I really don’t think this is the kind of thing the leader of a nation should be talking to anyone about…but you’re really all I can count on. Can you lend me a hand, maybe?”</p>

      <p>“Of course. You’re Laurent Hayes’s son, after all.”</p>

      <p>George shed a tear. “My son needs help,” he whispered, as he explained what was going on. It turned out to be a very delicate situation.</p>

      <p>Azeria’s Department of Defense was already aware that the nation’s military had been taken over by the mystics. That alone was terrible news, but as George explained, David Reagan, the fleet commander in the middle of the crisis, had sent an emissary over to central command to give them his demands. He’d asked them, in essence, to hand over the entire government to the <em>yohma</em>. They weren’t aiming to wipe out mankind; they just wanted to rule over this world and turn it into their personal paradise. Destroying any governments, they likely believed, would just result in a lot of annoying cleanup.</p>

      <p>“So they’re asking us to bow to their commands. If we do it, they won’t rob our top officials of their free will, and they’ll guarantee their personal safety.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm… Well, why don’t you accept that?”</p>

      <p>“Because it looks like they’re deploying out into the Great South Sea to stage an attack on our capital. That, and they intend to tell the truth about this whole war to our people. It’d destroy any authority our government has, and it’d set off panic we’d never be able to control. Honestly, I’m at the end of my rope.”</p>

      <p>They had been offered a choice, and opinions were split over which option to take. Either one, though, didn’t hurt the mystics at all. And besides, Velgrynd thought, the <em>yohma</em> wanted to enslave humanity, procuring the healthy bodies they’d need for the numbers of mystics they expected to immigrate here in time. A supply of fully controlled slaves would be ideal, and since this world had <a id="page-133"></a>five different superpowers, destroying one of them would teach a lesson to the others. The humans far outnumbered the mystics; even a tenth of them would be more than enough physical bodies for the invaders’ needs.</p>

      <p>“I see. I’m sure the Chinese are in a similar situation, and I think Rossiam must have refused the offer, because the royal court’s door is about to be taken down by rioters. I’d say Japan had it relatively easy by comparison.”</p>

      <p>“It’s only a matter of time either way, I’m sure. The combined Azerian-Chinese fleet is coming soon, isn’t it?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. Not that it’s a problem with me around. But you were going to tell me about Emile?”</p>

      <p>The Azerians and the Japanese officials in the room, Yamamoto included, weren’t so sure Velgrynd should just wave off the fleet like that. But they all opted to let George speak first, fearing the worst if they interrupted him and sparked Velgrynd’s ire. Everyone had a common understanding at this point that defying this woman was out of the question.</p>

      <p>“Emile was the emissary Reagan sent. He’s got my son’s face, my son’s knowledge…but he had this incredibly evil look in his eyes…”</p>

      <p>His son was grown now, serving in the military, and had unfortunately been deployed with the fleet at the center of this.</p>

      <p>“It’s okay, George. Calm down. What did I always say to you?”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd gave him a reassuring, unwavering smile, the most ladylike of expressions. It had the power, they said, to assuage anyone who saw it.</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha! Keep a cool head, right? Oh, I remember, Velgrynd.”</p>

      <p>George regained his composure, recalling his duties as president.</p>

      <p>“Good, good. And don’t worry. I’ll save Emile for you. And while I’m at it, I’ll protect Azeria’s honor as well.”</p>

      <p>“Thank you. I have nothing to worry about now. Please, save our United States…and save my son, too.”</p>

      <p>“You can count on it. We have around two months until the <em>yohma</em> fully assimilate into their human hosts. Emile’s just fine, all right? And so’s the rest of the fleet.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-134"></a>“That’s certainly a load off my shoulders. But they set off three weeks ago. We only have a few days left before the attack…”</p>

      <p>“Oh, it’s all right. That’s what today’s summit is for.”</p>

      <p>“All right.” George nodded back. “I promise we won’t hesitate to help in any way we can. I just hope this summit bears fruit for us.”</p>

      <p>He stood up, the rest of them silently watching Azerian cabinet joining him. Their conversation was over, and the guides opened the door at Yamamoto’s signal.</p>

      <p>“We will take you to the waiting room now.”</p>

      <p>Listening to Velgrynd’s powerful words made everyone in the room feel relieved. They all voiced their thanks as they filed out.</p>

      <p class="tx1">The next group Velgrynd summoned was the contingent from the Holy Arcian Empire. They had just crossed the ocean using Dimensional Connection, something they didn’t understand at all, and one could only imagine how flummoxed they must have felt.</p>

      <p>“No,” voiced one minister. “We were in a safe room only a tiny number of people know about. How did you…?”</p>

      <p>“Well,” the indignant Velgrynd said with a snort, “if you didn’t want people to pinpoint your location, you need to isolate it as much as you can with a Barrier or whatnot and cut off all contact with the outside. Not that you can hide something like that at <em>your</em> level, but…”</p>

      <p>“Contact with the outside…? Oh! Did you follow our transmissions to identify where we were hiding?”</p>

      <p>A younger man in the group spoke up. He had a God-class bow on his back, so Velgrynd assumed he was one of the Seven Sacred Treasures. “That’s right,” she said, not too interested in him otherwise. The Arcians were up in arms about this, but she wasn’t about to put up with it. Something like that was child’s play for Velgrynd, and she wished people didn’t carry on about it all the time.</p>

      <p>“So you’re Velgrynd?” a more arrogant team member asked. “I am Zangu, current emperor of Arcia. I understand you’ve been posing <a id="page-135"></a>as the goddess Cardina, the one who bestowed her blessings upon our founder Shin?”</p>

      <p>He was young, in his early twenties; a beautiful man with blond hair, blue eyes, and a well-balanced frame. His full name was Zangu Euran Dolte Arcia, Emperor of the Holy Arcian Empire, in the flesh.</p>

      <p>“Cardina? Oh, right, they called me that, too. Something about how they were too lowly to call me by my real name or whatever. I had no idea my <em>nickname</em> was the one that stuck. Don’t tell me the real one didn’t survive in the records?”</p>

      <p>“You refuse to admit it, then? What a farce! Or do you think your beauty gives you free rein to rant and rave all you want?”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd was lying; he was convinced of it. But that attitude of his was a major problem. And if the leader of a group is in the wrong, it often takes more than an apology to make up for it. Some underling going on like this could have the blame pinned entirely on them, or someone higher up could show enough remorse for everything to be forgiven. But if the highest person on the totem pole made the incorrect choice, it could lead to events they’d never be able to take back.</p>

      <p>Bright, leader of the Seven Sacred Treasures, almost had his eyes pop out when he heard Zangu speak. <em>You idiot! After all the explaining I did, you still don’t understand how fearsome Velgrynd is?! And before that, like, right after we had this wondrous supernatural thing happen to us, I think it should be crystal clear that it’s the work of the gods!!</em></p>

      <p>He had reason to be so perturbed. Dimensional Connection was clearly nothing a bunch of puny humans could achieve. Whoever could conjure such a spell must be either a god or someone close to it. Angering someone like that was ill-advised at best, and it was his own emperor doing it, no less. Bright had no idea how to make up for this.</p>

      <p>But he wasn’t the only one reeling at this. Kanji Yamamoto was just as aggravated.</p>

      <p><em>Whoa, whoa, was the emperor of Arcia that brainless all along?! What are we going to do about this? Because he’s going to anger Ryu-oh before long, and then who knows what terrors we’ll see…?</em></p>

      <p>Yamamoto’s mind raced. This was his problem, too. So the first thing he did was give a message to one of his assistants.</p>

      <p>“Bring His Majesty here at once.”</p>

      <p>“But, sir, that’s—”</p>

      <p>“Say no more, fool! I know it would be disrespectful of us, but he’s the only man who can stop Ryu-oh!”</p>

      <p>The assistant stopped protesting. It was clearly the right thing to do. “Right away, sir,” he softly said before zooming off.</p>

      <p>Normally, Kanji Yamamoto was the worst kind of middle manager, acting like some supreme being while doing little actual work. But when it came to judging whom not to cross in his line of work, he was a born genius. He had leveraged that skill well, and it had brought him safely through this crisis so far.</p>

      <p>But as everyone in the room sensed the danger, the emperor that had triggered all this remained as casual as ever.</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh-heh… Cat got your tongue, now that you realize I won’t be tricked that easily? Well, it’s understandable, I suppose. I know a con artist like you wouldn’t know this, but I’m not like the foolish rabble around me. You see, I too have been accepted by one of our Sacred Treasures! I have the seventh position among their ranks, in fact. And <em>that</em> is the man you were attempting to hoodwink!”</p>

      <p>Zangu was tremendously proud of himself. And he was telling the truth. A God-class sword was hanging from his waist, and it was faintly glowing. Velgrynd had noticed it, of course; she just hadn’t spoken until now because she was so aghast.</p>

      <p>“…Are you kidding me? You have me right here, and <em>that’s</em> how you react? Could someone this incompetent really be descended from Shin?”</p>

      <p>But as she lamented over this, something dawned on her. Clearly, from the way he’d refused her when she’d first reached out, this Zangu hadn’t trusted Velgrynd from the very beginning. It was in a king’s nature to be very cautious, so she hadn’t chided him for it at the time. But if Zangu still doubted her despite being <a id="page-136"></a><a id="page-137"></a>told of these secret matters only someone there at the time would have known about, it was a real pity…in many different ways, too. Being so mistrusted despite her revealing these secrets was, well, unthinkable—and if these secrets were common knowledge, it showed the emperor wasn’t keeping his confidential information very secure. Either scenario was unacceptable, and if the emperor was <em>this</em> slow to pick up on that, it was a serious issue that called all his qualifications into question.</p>

      <p>“Incompetent? Are you referring to me?”</p>

      <p>“You don’t even understand that? What a pity. But you <em>have</em> gone through over four thousand years of history in the meantime, so I suppose any bloodline would deteriorate.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd grinned. Zangu’s outlandish behavior exasperated her, but she still wasn’t petty enough to get angry over this much. But Zangu himself was livid.</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh-heh… So not only do you try to keep up the act; you mock me to my face? Foolish girl! Let me ask you this, then! Not only do you dare to claim the name of a goddess, you even bragged to us that you can copy her powers? Well, if you can create a sacred treasure, let’s see you do it right now. But beware! Fail, and you’ll be exposed for what you <em>truly</em> are!”</p>

      <p>“I don’t really want to.”</p>

      <p>“Hmph! I won’t listen to excuses. <em>You’re</em> the one making impossible promises, and <em>you’re</em> the one who needs to pay the price for them. Oh, but I won’t kill you. You <em>do</em> seem decently powerful, and you certainly have the beauty to match. I’ll make you into my personal plaything, so don’t you worry!”</p>

      <p>There was no end to Zangu’s foolhardy ranting. Everyone except him and Velgrynd were holding their breath, waiting for what would happen next. Clearly Zangu was in the wrong, but the fact Velgrynd was being patient with him despite all expectations to the contrary gave them a glimmer of hope. They all looked at her, praying that this would somehow end peacefully.</p>

      <p>“Well? You really can’t do any of that, can—?”</p>

      <p>“I would like to say a few things to you, but all right. I <em>did</em> make that promise, so I’ll give you what you want.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-138"></a>Velgrynd, cutting Zangu off, produced an azure dragon sword, pooling her magicules together and building it with Create Material.</p>

      <p>“Will this suffice? I doubt <em>you</em> can use it to its fullest, but it has God-class abilities, I will assure you.”</p>

      <p>“Wha…?!”</p>

      <p>Zangu, instinctively accepting it, was instantly charmed by its glow. It was the mark of the real thing; there was no more doubting her words.</p>

      <p>As a king, Zangu wasn’t entirely inept. He was extremely arrogant at the best of times, but not a tyrant. He even had enough of a conscience to listen to the words of the people he ruled over. This was the first meeting of the five superpowers in ages, so he was being more high-handed than usual today, lest anyone think he was a pushover. That was Zangu’s mistake, and at long last, he had come to realize it.</p>

      <p><em>Then it’s really true? No, it can’t be. It’s all just so ridiculous, isn’t it? Someone from mythology, thousands of years ago, just showing up in this modern age? That’s impossible!</em></p>

      <p>His mind succumbed to confusion. But as he did, Velgrynd—perhaps cutting him some slack because he was descended from a former Ludora—treated him as gently as possible. If this had been some unrelated person, the talking would have ended long ago, and there would likely be blood all over the walls. But Zangu, despite having all the luck in the world, simply couldn’t accept it. In fact:</p>

      <p><em>…No, wait a minute. If a goddess from mythology actually exists, who would be more appropriate to be at my side? Yes… Yes! If I can get my hands on her, all our problems will be solved!</em></p>

      <p>It was an outlandish idea, but he sincerely felt he was snatching victory from the jaws of defeat.</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh-heh… Yes, now I see! Velgrynd, my goddess! You’ve traversed across time to meet me, haven’t you? What a gallant thing to do for love! But very well. Allow me to reply to your feelings for me in kind. I swear that I will love and cherish you for the rest of my life!”</p>

      <p>He was horribly mistaken, and he had a room full of witnesses watching it all. Velgrynd was bewildered.</p>

      <p><a id="page-139"></a>“Huh? What kind of joke is that?”</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh… No need to be shy, now. We will have to wait until the end of hostilities to hold the formal introduction, but once everything is taken care of, I will gladly accept you as my true empress. It is said that Shin never managed to father a son with his beloved goddess, but what will <em>we</em> bequeath to the world, I wonder? With the blood of divinity, I’m sure Arcia will reach greater heights than ever before!”</p>

      <p>Zangu’s impressively arbitrary delusions stunned Velgrynd into silence. Really, as her mind caught up with things, she wondered if she had ever been so insulted her whole life. Or maybe it wasn’t that she couldn’t keep up with this nonsense so much as she didn’t want to believe it was really happening. It proved, either way, that even the omnipotent can feel totally lost sometimes.</p>

      <p>And if that’s how Velgrynd felt, the audience was expressing an even wider range of reactions. The Seven Sacred Treasures in the room, for example, were beside themselves with shock. They wanted to shout “Stop him, stop His Majesty right now!!” to the ministers there, but had to make do with glancing suggestively at them instead. Their instincts told them that something horrible would happen at this rate. It was the right of no man to make a goddess do his bidding; they needed to quiet Zangu down before divine punishment came winging his way.</p>

      <p>But the ministers didn’t move. They couldn’t, really. With Velgrynd’s face now expressionless, her beauty stood out all the more—and it made this even more terrifying, especially considering how guilty they all felt.</p>

      <p>Clearly, the ministers wouldn’t be any help. The Seven Sacred Treasures, starting to sweat a little, turned toward their leader. Bright, feeling their stares, cursed his bad luck.</p>

      <p>This was hardly welcome news for Japan, either. The intelligence department’s officials, nervous about this summit after working on it overnight, now wondered just how stupid the Arcian emperor was. He had a lot of guts, no doubt, but if Velgrynd flew into a rage, they’d all pay for it, and they sure didn’t want to.</p>

      <p>“Well? A splendid offer, is it not? And you’d hardly receive as <a id="page-140"></a>much attention from some ancient, senile emperor with barely any time left in his life. I, on the other hand, would spend every evening—”</p>

      <p><em>“What?”</em></p>

      <p>The air froze in the room. Everyone realized at once that what they had feared was happening.</p>

      <p>Zangu, facing the full brunt of Velgrynd’s anger, was unable to move. He realized he had gone too far, but he just couldn’t swallow the words.</p>

      <p><em>Wha…?! Wha…what is this divine energy I feel?! The goddess of mythology—it’s even more than I ever imagined. And I wanted to make her my wife? How could I even have dared…?</em></p>

      <p>He struggled to keep his thoughts even barely coherent. Then, more than he’d ever wanted to, he understood just how foolish he had been. He’d thought that adding a goddess’s blood to his family line was a splendid idea, and maybe it was on the surface, but some things just weren’t ever going to be possible. It was told that Shin, the founder of Arcia, had earned the love of a goddess, but not even they had had children. Zangu, the distant descendant of Shin, never had the right to receive the affinity of anyone from the heavens.</p>

      <p>Besides, as described in the ancient records, the personality of this goddess—even assuming that half of it was mere myth—was beyond intense. Whenever anyone insulted those she loved, she would breathlessly destroy entire countries over it. They had conducted excavations in the areas the ancient records said were affected, only to find the ruins of cities under the ground. The outer walls of the buildings they’d dug up were all melted by an intense flame, reportedly transformed into a glass-like substance.</p>

      <p>Only now was the memory of these reports suddenly occurring to Zangu. His mind could picture a future where the countries composing Arcia were seared by flames, and it turned his face pale. <em>Perhaps</em>, he thought, <em>I have committed the ultimate taboo</em>—but it was too late now.</p>

      <p>His utter destruction was all but assured by this point, but it was at this moment where someone finally took action. It was <a id="page-141"></a>Yamamoto. If he allowed Velgrynd to fall out of control, he would be the one taking complete responsibility. The lives of everyone in the room were in severe danger at the moment, but compared to his reputation, that seemed like a second priority to him. He was habitually bossy and not too passionate about his work, but he wasn’t rotten enough that he’d run away from his responsibilities. In fact, from the moment this war had broken out, he took it as a given that someone needed to step up and take action, and he saw that as his own role. That was what drove him to react before anyone else to Zangu’s words.</p>

      <p>“You insolent buffoon! What could possibly drive you to insult His Majesty, our emperor?! This could potentially be the basis for war itself, but what say you about that?!”</p>

      <p>He shouted this before Velgrynd could say anything—or, really, to keep her from opening her mouth at all. It is a human tendency to grow calm if someone else nearby angrily spouts off before them, and that applied just as well to a True Dragon, quelling her rage before it had a chance to explode. It was the greatest play of the day, and it was all Kanji Yamamoto’s work.</p>

      <p>And now some of his setup was paying off, too.</p>

      <p>“What’s all this noise?”</p>

      <p>The emperor he’d called over (at the risk of his own neck) appeared with the most perfect timing possible.</p>

      <p>“Oh, Your Majesty—”</p>

      <p>“Ryu-oh, don’t let the words of the young bother you. I’m sure Zangu here was merely testing you, to see if you were truly worth trusting.”</p>

      <p>Oharu rushed in, addressing Velgrynd as calmly as he could. He was in a panic internally, jogging down the hallway for the first time in several decades, but he showed none of it. As far as the world knew, he was every bit the stately ruler he claimed to be—and catching sight of him made Velgrynd forget all her ire. Regaining her reason, she thought over what she was told.</p>

      <p>“So he deliberately tried to bait me in order to see how far he’d need to go to anger me—”</p>

      <p>“Y-yes, indeed, um, probably something like that?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-142"></a>Assuaging Velgrynd was Oharu’s primary task. He would gladly accept an insult or two if it meant calming this room back down. And it worked.</p>

      <p>“Ah… Yes, I see. I didn’t want to think the descendant of Shin was that suicidal anyway. It makes sense.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd nodded deeply and flashed a smile—a gentle, beautiful smile, relieving Oharu greatly. “Now,” he said, swooping in to take the lead, “I’m sure our Arcian guests are very tired, so let’s take them to the waiting room.”</p>

      <p>The emperor normally wouldn’t have been doing this himself, but he had little other choice. Everyone moved at once, like the spell had been shattered, and the world dodged one serious bullet.</p>

      <p class="space-break">The Arcia of future generations, by the way, was much friendlier toward the Conquering Empire of Japan than before—but particular respect and popularity was awarded to those with the last name Yamamoto. They were even listed in history textbooks, credited with saving Arcia from grave danger. It was the sort of fact that always showed up in final exams, so nearly everyone who went through the Arcian school system was familiar with it.</p>

      <p>So Kanji Yamamoto would come to be described as the Arcian ally who talked the emperor Zangu back to his senses. All his groveling had given him immortality, not that he could have known it at the time.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">With the Arcians gone, calm returned to the room. The emperor retired to his chambers to receive some medication for his upset stomach, so Velgrynd decided to go back to work.</p>

      <p>“Still, it’s been quite a while since anyone tried to test me like that. Zangu was his name, wasn’t it? He’s certainly growing in a fascinating way, isn’t he? Just like I’d expect from the progeny of Shin.”</p>

      <p>“Y-yes, I’m sure. Ha-ha… I was quite surprised as well.”</p>

      <p>Yamamoto sorely wanted Velgrynd to shut up about this. But he <a id="page-143"></a>knew his reputation was flying high in the department right now, so he hoped they would be patient with her.</p>

      <p>“So that just leaves…”</p>

      <p>“The Republic of Chinese Fiefdoms.”</p>

      <p>“Right, yes.”</p>

      <p>As allies with the Conquering Empire, the Chinese were the last to agree to talks, as long as the other nations were committed to them. Velgrynd hadn’t directly spoken with them yet, so she wasn’t aware of all those details. The head of state—officially titled the general secretary—was invited, as were several government figures and their bodyguards. They greeted Velgrynd in her room, hiding any shock they might have had.</p>

      <p>“I am Wang Rongren. You are Ryu-oh?”</p>

      <p>“That’s right.”</p>

      <p>“Hmph! You look exactly like a human to me…but we won’t be deceived so easily. Have you now infiltrated our closest ally, <em>yohma</em>? Or is this all a deception to make us think so?”</p>

      <p>Wang Rongren wasted no time antagonizing Velgrynd. The Japanese in the room were starting to sweat anew, as she herself muttered “Again?” under her breath. Judging by Wang’s performance, something was clearly up back in his homeland, and Velgrynd opted to refrain from off-the-cuff remarks before she could figure out what.</p>

      <p>“I don’t know where this is, but we’ve volunteered to venture into the tiger’s den. Don’t assume your schemes will harm us <em>that</em> readily, cursed <em>yohma</em>!”</p>

      <p>At Wang’s shout, the bodyguards with the Chinese made their move. They were dressed in white <em>changpao</em> robes, giving them flexibility as they worked in strict, refined synchronization. They were obviously martial arts masters to a man…not that any of it mattered to Velgrynd.</p>

      <p>“<em>Yohma</em>, we concede your strength is fearsome. But know we will never forgive you for the name you stole!”</p>

      <p>“Yes! The ‘dragon’ in your name was taken by Long, the progenitor of our Dragon Fist style! And no <em>yohma</em> should ever dream to bring that name to her lips!”</p>

      <p><a id="page-144"></a>The bodyguards roared with white-hot rage. But the reaction from the Japanese was remarkably muted. Everything was thinking the same thing—<em>not again; she’s the real thing, you know</em>. But Velgrynd picked up on something else.</p>

      <p>“Long, you said? Ah yes, someone by that name <em>did</em> call his skill set ‘Dragon Fist,’ didn’t he? And <em>this</em> is the world that Long lived in, too. You all must be his students and he passed his skills on to you, didn’t he? How delightful.”</p>

      <p>Even with the time she’d spent at the royal library, not even Velgrynd had a grip on every single famous person in history. Japan wouldn’t have any books lying around about hidden martial arts schools in foreign countries anyway. It would have been understandable, therefore, if this Dragon Fist inventor Long hadn’t immediately rung a bell with her—but she acted like he was some long-lost friend. It befuddled the Chinese before her.</p>

      <p>“Why are you acting like this is some grand discovery for you?”</p>

      <p>“Trying to hide the truth? Well, good luck. We are the best of their elites, and we’ll crush you and your attempts to destroy us!”</p>

      <p>“And we’ll start with you, the one who took our master’s noble name. We must restore the pride of our homeland!”</p>

      <p>The bodyguards assumed fighting poses. Velgrynd, watching this, just beamed at them. “Oh my, you’ve certainly honed your drives for battle…at least, by the standards of this world. I can tell you’ve striven to improve yourselves—and to train constantly. I’m so glad you’re still taking Long’s teachings so seriously.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd was now looking at these martial artists not as enemies, but as her beloved pupils. The difference in attitude only enraged her adversaries further.</p>

      <p>“How dare you ridicule us…?”</p>

      <p>“Let her. We should all just leap upon her at once—”</p>

      <p>They were ready to rely on their fists, but someone stopped them—a smaller figure, the only one among them wearing a robe embroidered with the character for “dragon.”</p>

      <p>“Halt. This isn’t anyone you could ever beat.”</p>

      <p>The clear, refined voice suggested the person with dark eyes and dark hair was a woman.</p>

      <p><a id="page-145"></a>“L-Lady Xienhua?!”</p>

      <p>“But…”</p>

      <p>The bodyguards tried to refute her, but the sight of Xienhua, the Holy Fist, stopped them cold. She was the most powerful among them, ever coolheaded and always defiant against any enemy in her way, and they could tell she was anxious and sweating.</p>

      <p>“I’ll take her on.”</p>

      <p>And with that challenge, nobody else dared to speak up.</p>

      <p>“You’re the current master? Your will impresses me. You deserve praise.”</p>

      <p>“I am. I have taken on the <em>hun-po</em>—the spiritual and animal soul—of the Holy Fists of the past, the ones who have inherited the greatest power there is. And if you are truly the real Longhuang—or ‘Ryu-oh,’ as Japan calls you—may I ask you for a fight?”</p>

      <p>“No problem. I’ll be glad to educate you…and I hope you appreciate the honor.”</p>

      <p>The arrangements were made all too quickly.</p>

      <p>Before anyone else could intervene, they were unsuspecting audience members, waiting to see how the fight would go.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

Part of the master’s internal strength was passed along as well, which meant that each generation held more fighting spirit within them, refined to a higher quality. It wasn’t a given <a id="page-147"></a>that the successor would inherit every single ability, but as long as <em>hun-po</em> was among the ones passed down, there would be hope for the next generation—and, with the hope that an all-powerful martial artist would be born following his teachings, Long had breathed his last.</p>
