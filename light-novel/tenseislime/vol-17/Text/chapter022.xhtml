      <p><a id="page-231"></a>This was starting to feel bizarre to Caligulio. Why was someone like him, at the peak of the imperial military, receiving a lecture in economics from the demon that had put the Empire through so much pain? He didn’t know, and it confused him.</p>

      <p><em>Why does a demon know this much about human economic policy, huh? I was educated in it as a lower-level country noble, but I don’t think most top-class military officers would know much about it…</em></p>

      <p>And to think he didn’t have it fully right, either? There were also regional handicrafts and specialty products, but that didn’t seem like the correct answer. Caligulio didn’t think of Testarossa as someone who would normally keep finding fault with him like this.</p>

      <p>“So what is it?”</p>

      <p>“The underground trade.”</p>

      <p>“What?!” he couldn’t help but exclaim. There was no way black-market trade would be allowed in the Empire. He trusted in that, but the bluntness of her response threw him.</p>

      <p>“Oh, is that strange to you?”</p>

      <p>“Well, of course! The emperor of our land wields his power to ensure the equality of all his citizens. The nobility is a different matter, of course, but even a commoner can rise up in life through military service—”</p>

      <p>“I know all that. I’m not talking about surface matters. The black market is a necessity for practical business. Do you know why?”</p>

      <p>If she was calling it a “necessity,” Testarossa must have meant it. But Caligulio still just couldn’t believe it. Black-market trading was tantamount to treason against the emperor; if it were that rampant, imperial secret agents would have picked up on it by now. There was no way the late Lieutenant Kondo would’ve overlooked it, for example. They feared him as “the stalker of the halls of information”; Caligulio doubted he’d have just let this slip past him.</p>

      <p>“I don’t believe it,” he blurted out. “Are you saying Lieutenant Kondo just let this slide?”</p>

      <p>Testarossa gave him a chiding look. “Are you really that hardheaded? He <em>did</em> let it slide, because it wasn’t a bad thing at all.”</p>

      <p>“What do you mean?”</p>

      <p>“Well, as a merchant, I’m sure being affiliated with a noble sounds <a id="page-232"></a>nice, but who you get to sell to is basically dictated by the title of your employer. Do you think the merchants of low-ranked nobles can compete with their brethren serving earls and dukes?”</p>

      <p>“Ah…”</p>

      <p>“The answer is no. It’s impossible. You’re forced to do the bidding of whoever holds power over you. And that’s where underground merchants come in. Groups like the Echidna Club that ruled over the imperial black market, along with their successors—the Cerberus secret society—they were all able to exist because they were seen as necessary.”</p>

      <p>“…”</p>

      <p>Caligulio could feel the blindfold coming off. As Testarossa put it, merchants had a <em>need</em> to be free. They’d never aggressively pursue profit if they were working for a fixed salary. Trying to restrict that by force would just have been met with resistance, and besides, it’d put the customers they served in a bind. Kondo knew that, so he’d never tried to seriously intervene in the black market.</p>

      <p>The same was even true for human trafficking, as publicly illegal as it was. If a village was facing famine and could no longer keep itself fed, there was a need to reduce the number of mouths. While legally forbidden, it had to be done, or a great many people would die—and if it came to that extreme, selling them off gave them a better chance of surviving than any other resort. That was a rather extreme example, but one that had been seen several times in the Empire’s history.</p>

      <p>Inconvenient truths like that were all over the place, treated as open secrets by the government. One big problem was trade with foreign nations. Since the Empire had never so much as acknowledged the sovereignty of countries besides itself, foreign trade was officially prohibited. This, however, wasn’t something that any sane economic policy would allow to exist for very long. And that was how groups like Cerberus had taken root in the Western Nations.</p>

      <p>Testarossa dispassionately lectured Caligulio about all this. He wailed to himself about why a demon was so up-to-date on such things. It made him feel like an oblivious idiot, and it saddened him.</p>

      <p><a id="page-233"></a>“Well, thank you very much for the detailed rundown. I appreciate it.”</p>

      <p>“Not at all. But regardless, that made handling the regional nobles pretty simple, you see. I explained to them that free trade would be fully allowed going forward, and they all lined up to join our side. Plus, as Sir Rimuru proceeds with his plans, we’ll be laying rails between the Empire’s regional cities as well. That’ll ensure the wealth gets spread across more of the Empire as a whole instead of being concentrated in a small handful of cities. Between all of that, they readily pledged their support for Emperor Masayuki.”</p>

      <p>Caligulio was certainly convinced. The Empire was home to some cutting-edge scientific advances, but they didn’t have the time or money to connect all its cities. The reason was obvious—the great majority of the imperial budget went to R &amp; D and the military. The transport of food and goods was also important, but the supply network only extended to the cities near the capital. Deliveries from the far regions were instead made via magic or airship.</p>

      <p>Now these left-behind cities were a part of Rimuru’s development plans. And once they had been informed of this, it was easy to win the favor of the regional lords. This negotiation hinged on a huge amount of money and labor streaming into these regions, but Rimuru—and Testarossa—could make all of that possible. They had researched the economic conditions of these lords, using that knowledge to their advantage in the talks. Caligulio was impressed—they weren’t a disloyal lot to start with, but with <em>this</em> thorough of an approach, they were receiving fabulous results. He resolved to revise his own approach in the future.</p>

      <p>“So that just leaves the old money.”</p>

      <p>“Indeed.”</p>

      <p>“And, knowing how you work, I presume you’ve built a dossier outlining all their illegal deeds?”</p>

      <p>By this point, Testarossa had Caligulio’s full trust. He didn’t know what kind of scheme she had hatched, but if she said it was “no problem,” he was certain that she was right.</p>

      <p>“Don’t put words in my mouth, now. You don’t see anyone foolish enough to commit outright felonies these days in the Empire. <a id="page-234"></a>A lot of cleanup work took place over the past few decades, and I’ve determined that much of it was Kondo’s doing.”</p>

      <p>So the <em>real</em> villains among the nobility had already been purged. Testarossa had been stationed in the Empire for a while now, but she felt that people around here were generally calmer in spirit than they used to be. A little research gave her the reason—it was because the truly abhorrent crimes had largely ceased to be committed. All that remained were necessary evils like Cerberus and small-time villains that could be safely ignored.</p>

      <p>“But how did you cajole the old money to our side, then?”</p>

      <p>“Well, I actually have a conference scheduled for this afternoon. I plan to reach a final agreement with them there, and I’d like you to join me, please.”</p>

      <p>That was a clear order. Testarossa was supposed to be serving as Caligulio’s assistant, but he didn’t mind this at all. Faced with this obvious difference in talent and skill, all he could do was nod at her words.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="tx1">Only four people were in the reception room—Minitz, the organizer of this meeting; Caligulio, the Secretary of the Military; Testarossa, the diplomat from their partners in Tempest; and Mithra Hilmenard, head of the “old money” nobles and their current negotiation partner.</p>

      <p>Mithra was in his early thirties, still young, and some might have wondered if he was too inexperienced to be leading an entire faction like this. But that didn’t apply to him, for he had virtually every talent one could think of.</p>

      <p class="space-break">Mithra’s mother was once queen, the partner of the emperor before Ludora. This made her Ludora’s biological mother.</p>

      <p>The Empire’s imperial palace employed a unique system where the role of “empress”—the legal wife of the emperor—was not a position anyone could take. <em>That</em> role in the emperor’s life belonged only to Velgrynd. Instead, several “queens” lived in the inner palace, competing against each other for supremacy. These women <a id="page-235"></a>were voluntarily offered by the nobility, and their bloodlines were all impeccable in terms of noble rank. Whichever of these queens became pregnant with the emperor’s child first was deemed the winner, welcomed in as the official queen of the Empire. Their child, after all, was promised to be the heir to the throne.</p>

      <p>Ludora himself had had several queen candidates of his own ensconced inside his palace, but he’d never favored any of them. They were sent over by powerful nobles hoping their daughter would be named queen, but in the end, they had all been sent back before any child could be conceived. There was discussion about the new emperor inheriting them, but it was decided that Masayuki had no need for this system—and this decision was made by a figure whose identity would likely remain a mystery for all time…</p>

      <p>Regardless, Mithra’s mother was one of the “winners” of the inner palace. She had completed the major feat of delivering Ludora, earning her the loftiest of reputations for all time.</p>

      <p>As a reward, she was offered two options. She could either stay in the palace, exercising her extensive influence while Ludora grew up, or she could accept a staggering monetary payoff and marry herself off to the clan of her choice. No stops were left unpulled when handling the emperor’s mother; her words held great authority across the palace, and even if she left that palace, she was never to be disrespected. Thus she didn’t hesitate to take her leave and marry the duke of Hilmenard.</p>

      <p>The child that resulted was Mithra Hilmenard, which meant Ludora was his half-brother. This gave Mithra unshakable power, enough to make people kowtow the moment they caught sight of him. He had a villainous visage, a face that suggested brutal violence might come at any time, and it daunted anyone who saw it. He had no eyebrows, and one glance from him could strike fear in the hearts of whoever it landed on, robbing them of any desire to defy him. He was neither over- nor underweight, and he wasn’t particularly tall, but his sheer dominance was a force to be reckoned with. Even the very highest of nobility felt something ominous about him—they suspected he was up to unscrupulous dealings in the black market, or that crossing him even once would make their lives <a id="page-236"></a>forfeit. That was what made him so qualified to lead the old money faction—that force of dignity which refused to bend to anyone else.</p>

      <p>In a fight, Caligulio would undoubtedly beat him; that was true even before the general had gone through his awakening. But it took more than sheer muscle to survive in this world. You couldn’t expect a decent life unless you had ample food, clothing, and shelter—and if you rebelled against Mithra, you were guaranteed to lose all three.</p>

      <p><em>What a monster to negotiate with</em>, Caligulio thought. <em>I had aimed to run the military someday, but now that I’m doing it, it’s all too clear how hard a job it is. I can’t believe I have to try dealing with freaks of nature like this…</em></p>

      <p>Minitz was here, so it’d likely work out in the end, but if it were a one-on-one negotiation, he’d have been on the ropes. But this time, they had a valuable helper on hand.</p>

      <p><em>Lady Testarossa, huh? She frightens me profoundly, but I couldn’t ask for a better ally. And now that I know she’s the fearsome Blanc herself, I don’t think anyone could ever beat us.</em></p>

      <p>Mithra before him was a scary sight, but Testarossa was scarier. That thought helped him regain his serenity. Newly calm, he recalled what the demon had told him a moment ago.</p>

      <p><em>Well, hold on one minute… Lady Testarossa said “most” of the nobles wouldn’t be a problem. Does that mean Sir Mithra is one of the problems…? But that’s strange… Kondo, after all, would never show any mercy—not even to His Majesty’s half-brother. Does that mean Sir Mithra isn’t up to anything nefarious after all…?</em></p>

      <p>He doubted it. It just seemed so impossible in his mind. Mithra scared people precisely because he was seen as this untouchable villain. If he made everyone fear and revere him like this at first sight, there’s no way he’d be someone <em>normal</em>.</p>

      <p>The clock reached the appointed time, bonging loudly—the signal for the conference to begin.</p>

      <p class="tx1">“So you’re the hooligans attempting to usurp the throne? Let me hear why you’ve called me here.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-237"></a>This pompous question was raised by Mithra.</p>

      <p>“One moment, Your Grace,” replied Minitz, catching the blow. “That is all a misunderstanding.”</p>

      <p>“What is? It’s the truth, is it not?”</p>

      <p>“We are following the official procedures of imperial household law. I would like very much for you not to call it usurping the throne.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, sure. Don’t get cocky with me just because you have Lady Velgrynd as an ally!”</p>

      <p>“Don’t be ridiculous!” Minitz bellowed.</p>

      <p>Not even someone as calm as him could shut his eyes to this affront. Certainly, from an outside perspective, it must have looked like Velgrynd was siding with the Empire. But that was a very wrong assumption to make. The truth was actually the other way around—they were only able to maintain this peace because they’d <em>finally</em> managed to get on Velgrynd’s good side for once. Loose lips sink ships, as they say, but with Velgrynd, the consequences were far worse. She could destroy entire nations—literally wipe them off the map. Keeping her happy was entirely up to Masayuki, and while he seemed to have a gentle disposition, what if he was more selfish instead? It made Caligulio shudder to think of it.</p>

      <p>“Sir Mithra, Prime Minister Minitz is telling you the truth. Lady Velgrynd is a friend to Emperor Masayuki, but she is not an ally of our empire itself. If Emperor Masayuki wished it, she wouldn’t hesitate to destroy our entire country.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, exactly. And I’ve even heard her state that if a nation ever burdened Emperor Masayuki, she would immediately burn it to ash. We cannot afford to anger her, no matter what!”</p>

      <p>“…You expect me to believe that?”</p>

      <p>“No, no, I can’t blame you for not believing it. So, please, let’s begin by hearing your opinion on this subject.”</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh-heh… You mean whether I side with the Empire, or oppose it?”</p>

      <p>“Not that.”</p>

      <p>“What?”</p>

      <p>Minitz promptly answered Mithra’s arrogant question. He then proceeded to tell Mithra his true feelings.</p>

      <p><a id="page-238"></a>“Listen to me. I don’t want this to get out, but I’d like you to understand how I actually feel about everything, Your Grace. That is why I want to tell you the truth.”</p>

      <p>“Quit beating around the bush. If you want my opinion, just ask for it.”</p>

      <p>“In that case, let me ask a question first. Duke Mithra, do you want to rule over the Empire? Or would you like to join hands and help us out?”</p>

      <p>“…What?”</p>

      <p>Not even Mithra had expected this. He had been expecting a tough negotiation, but this sounded like they were perfectly okay with handing the Empire over to him. And this interpretation was absolutely correct.</p>

      <p>Minitz had become prime minister through an improbable course of events; it was a role he’d basically had no choice but to accept. If Mithra wanted the job instead, Minitz would gladly give it to him. Stabilizing the Empire was priority number one, and that had largely been achieved. Minitz pictured a lot of room for change within the Empire’s political structure.</p>

      <p>Caligulio had seen through Minitz’s thoughts, too.</p>

      <p><em>Yes, I know we’d like his cooperation as we try to unite the nobles on our side. Letting Sir Mithra take this job wouldn’t break our promises at all. But isn’t that a little unfair, Minitz?!</em></p>

      <p><em>This</em>, he thought as he gritted his teeth, <em>was exactly why Minitz’s brother had a grudge against him</em>.</p>

      <p>“What, are you saying you’ll give the prime ministership to me?”</p>

      <p>“I appreciate how quickly you picked up on that. Now, will you listen to our viewpoint for a moment?”</p>

      <p>“…Very well.”</p>

      <p>Mithra reluctantly nodded, perhaps sensing he was out of the loop on some matters.</p>

      <p>So Minitz began to speak. As he put it, Masayuki himself did not want the position of emperor—but if he abandoned the Empire right now, the resulting political instability could lead to serious disruption. They were also aware of a new, unknown enemy <a id="page-239"></a>stalking them, and if they ignored it, it would create serious trouble for everyone in time. In light of that, Tempest and the Dwarven Kingdom had also welcomed Masayuki as emperor.</p>

      <p>Velgrynd would listen only to the will of Masayuki. To put it another way, if he didn’t become emperor, she wouldn’t hesitate to abandon the entire empire—and even if she didn’t strike against it, losing their guardian dragon posed a huge problem. Along those lines, it was far better for all the citizens if Masayuki accepted his invitation to the throne.</p>

      <p>“As I stated,” Minitz concluded, “His Majesty himself sees the throne as a heavy burden to bear. If someone were to rule in his place, I think it would be welcomed without major complaint.”</p>

      <p>This made sense to Mithra. He understood that Velgrynd’s affinity was a vital question for the Empire. Masayuki was a must in order to keep her on their side; if they didn’t have him on the throne, she might very well leave the Empire entirely. This also meant, however, that as long as he remained emperor, it didn’t really matter if someone else actually ran politics. In fact, perhaps it’d be better for the Empire’s growth if they didn’t tether him to his post too much.</p>

      <p>“The demon lord Rimuru,” Testarossa added with a sweet smile, “wishes to build a fruitful relationship with Sir Masayuki as well. If Sir Masayuki is to become emperor, then Sir Rimuru will provide the maximum amount of assistance that he can. So I hope it’s clear to you that this is not at all an attempted usurpation of the throne.”</p>

      <p>Mithra had been informed of that aspect in advance. It was known across the Empire that despite having trounced them in combat, Rimuru wasn’t demanding much in the way of reparations. He wanted friendly ties going forward, and if that were the case, Mithra didn’t see any reason to doubt Testarossa.</p>

      <p>So what was the right move to make? He had been given two choices, but he wasn’t limited strictly to those. If there were other paths available, he had the freedom to take one. However—as Mithra half-resigned himself to his fate—it was unlikely that any other path would bring him victory.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

      <p class="tx1"><a id="page-240"></a>Would Mithra lead imperial politics as prime minister, or would he take Minitz’s side and make the nobles follow him? To be honest, Mithra wasn’t terribly interested in the decision. What he <em>really</em> wanted was to hole himself up in his mansion and devote himself to his passion of painting. Between his noble bloodline and his power as duke, Mithra was seen as a born ruler—but that was all a great misunderstanding.</p>

      <p>His mother had been beautiful enough to earn the love of Ludora’s father, after all. She was a strong-willed woman, her aura resembling Velgrynd’s in a way, but that was only on the surface. Despite that dominating atmosphere, she was actually a very placid woman—if she hadn’t been, she would have taken position as queen the moment she’d given birth to Ludora. She was allowed to enjoy every luxury possible as Ludora’s mother, for the short period until he attained full independence, but she wanted her freedom over any of that.</p>

      <p>It was a highly unusual choice to make, but not long after she earned that freedom, she fell in love with Duke Barsa Hilmenard. Barsa was a handsome young man, leading to rumors among the general public that it was Mithra’s mother who wooed him first—the former queen having her way with whatever man she wanted. But it was absolutely the other way around, and it was pure love that brought them together and led to Mithra’s birth. They were still passionately in love with each other, although that didn’t matter here.</p>

      <p><em>I have no great desire to be a politician, either. Dealing with all these office seekers and hangers-on makes me sick. But…</em></p>

      <p>Much to Mithra’s chagrin, he was a very popular, charismatic figure. He was smart, too, to the point that none of his more underhanded schemes had ever been exposed. This had given him a great number of devotees, and many of his affairs would go running off in their own directions before he could do anything about them.</p>

      <p>The worst example of this was when a certain earl had lost his social standing thanks to Mithra.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p><a id="page-241"></a>Mithra had accidentally bumped shoulders with him one day. The earl wasn’t watching where he was going, but he still refused to apologize about it. At the time, Mithra was still in his early twenties, so the earl no doubt saw him as unworthy of attention. He might’ve acted differently if he’d known Mithra was the son of a duke, but that’s just speculation at this point.</p>

      <p>“You!” he bellowed. “I’m an earl, you know! Where are your manners?!”</p>

      <p>Mithra still recalled how he’d just stared at the earl in response. <em>If he’s this angry over something so small</em>, he thought, <em>perhaps he has a calcium deficiency?</em> (He had just learned the term from an otherworlder friend of his.)</p>

      <p>“What a bother,” he muttered to himself. He wasn’t a duke yet by this point, which meant the earl outclassed him. At the same time, he’d been taught that he should never bow his head to someone below his family’s title, so he legitimately wasn’t sure what to do. That’s why he said those words—and things really <em>did</em> become a bother.</p>

      <p>“You’re bothering Sir Mithra!”</p>

      <p>“What is a mere earl doing, haranguing Sir Mithra like this? What a sorry sight <em>this</em> is…”</p>

      <p>Mithra’s friends were already causing a commotion.</p>

      <p>Just then, a group of knights clad in black appeared from some unknown hiding spot. Several of them accosted the earl.</p>

      <p>“Ah, ahhh…”</p>

      <p>The panicked earl only then recalled who Mithra actually was. But that realization had come too late for him.</p>

      <p>The captain of the knight team went up to Mithra, saluting him.</p>

      <p>“Allow us to decide what to do with him.”</p>

      <p>“…All right, sure.”</p>

      <p>Mithra couldn’t say anything else.</p>

      <p>The newspapers the next day were filled with evidence of assorted injustices and fraudulent behavior on the earl’s part. Whether all the crimes were true or fabricated, Mithra didn’t know. The only clear truth was that the earl was soon arrested and stripped of his title.</p>

      <p>It went without saying that the encounter made people dread Mithra more than ever. A mere brush of the shoulder had brought <a id="page-242"></a>an earl to his doom. It taught Mithra just how much power he had, a lesson he’d find hard to forget.</p>

      <p>Mithra would later have similar things happen on several occasions. He’d never meant any of it, but before he realized it, he had become one of the most formidable, awe-inspiring nobles on the scene.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>From those experiences, Mithra knew the power of his words. It turned him into a quiet man.</p>

      <p>On this occasion as well, his dukedom’s talented intelligence officers informed him that Ludora had, indeed, disappeared. Whether he was dead or just fleeing the throne didn’t matter. What did matter was whether Velgrynd, the Empire’s guardian dragon, would preside over Masayuki the Hero as the new emperor.</p>

      <p>As the report he was given stated:</p>

      <p><em>“The identity of the mysterious Marshal is believed to be none other than Velgrynd the Cardinal. She is attached to Sir Masayuki, and that likely means he has inherited the soul of the true Emperor Ludora.”</em></p>

      <p>Anyone with even the slightest reasoning ability would have understood the hopelessness of trying to defy this. Unlike most royal families, bloodline wasn’t a major factor when it came to imperial succession. The public might attach a lot of importance to it, but to the true power brokers in this empire, it was known that Ludora’s soul was the most vital factor. Mithra, as a duke, was naturally aware of all this.</p>

      <p><em>…If we play this wrong, it’d mean more than the end of my noble line. If my followers decide to riot over it, it’d be their lives at stake. I need to brace myself and take action.</em></p>

      <p>Mithra was an intelligent noble—and this was the obvious choice for him.</p>

      <p class="space-break">Ideally, he’d like to keep a healthy distance away from politics while retaining the influence he held over the nobility. If he could keep hold of his noble title, money would never be a problem for him. His stipend would be enough to let him paint in peace <a id="page-243"></a>without forcing himself into government work. It certainly wasn’t impossible.</p>

      <p>So that was Mithra’s ultimate dream. Plan B for him was to retire back to his homeland. Focusing on the administration of just his countryside dukedom, sticking strictly to serving as lord of his dominion—that’d work, too. It’d keep his days somewhat occupied, but there’d still be time to paint. It’d keep the number of annoying people in his life to a minimum, too. He saw it as a good compromise.</p>

      <p>The absolute worst case was anything that sparked Velgrynd’s rage. That alone had to be avoided at all costs, and that’s why he was fighting so hard over this right now.</p>

      <p>So Mithra had decided to propose a plan of action. He’d use his notoriety to exile himself from the capital. He’d be his usual, arrogant self, enough that people would think he was just too much trouble to bother with. If enough of them turned against him, they could then contrive some sort of story, at which point he’d pretend to fly into such a rage that he’d give up his seat. Negotiations would be cut off, but then Mithra would pretend to realize the position he’d put himself in, and flee the capital to save face.</p>

      <p>That was the kind of story he’d wanted to concoct, but instead, Minitz was giving him these two crazy options.</p>

      <p><em>“Do you want to rule over the Empire? Or would you like to join hands and help us out?”</em></p>

      <p>The answer was no to both questions. But saying that, he thought, was a bad idea.</p>

      <p>So Minitz continued talking. Testarossa, the diplomat from Tempest, joined in as well, trying to justify their position. But Mithra didn’t need all that explanation. He knew all of it in advance. It was vital in any negotiation, after all, to come in with a firm grasp of all the facts.</p>

      <p><em>Well, what now? I don’t want to choose either of those options. Get involved with national politics in the current state of affairs, and I’ll just work myself to death, I’m sure of it. If I put in any more hours than I already do, I won’t just lose my painting time. I’ll have no time to play with my beloved daughter, even!</em></p>

      <p><a id="page-244"></a>Mithra did, indeed, have a three-year-old daughter, as cute as could be. He also had a newborn son…but what troubled him was his wife’s behavior. The moment his son was born, she’d stopped so much as looking Mithra in the eye.</p>

      <p>She was the daughter of a marquis, and a woman Mithra had fallen in love with at first sight. He’d asked her to become his wife, and they were living together the very next day. But now she was distant, always brooding over something, and it had unnerved him as of late. Their marriage had begun with some sense of cold formality at first, but given the circumstances, that was to be expected. She had given him the son he had long waited for, and he wanted to take his time and help the love between them grow, but…</p>

      <p><em>Yes… I have to steadfastly refuse this, or I won’t even have enough time to talk to my wife any longer. I don’t care that much what happens to the Empire, but I have to keep my own family from falling apart!</em></p>

      <p>Mithra steeled his resolve once more. He wanted today to end with an amicable agreement, but now he’d have to inject at least a little strife into it.</p>

      <p>It was time for his answer.</p>

      <p class="tx1">“This is pointless. You’re <em>not</em> usurping the throne? Save that nonsense for someone with the time for it, please. And—Lady Testarossa, was it? What right do <em>you</em> have to comment on our empire’s internal affairs? I know the Empire lost to you in the war. But we’ve already established peace with you, in exchange for our territorial airspace and a treaty between our two nations. We now have diplomatic relations with each other, but do you think you have the right to interfere with our very sovereignty?”</p>

      <p>Going this far all at once was a risk, but Mithra still committed to it. The person he was rebuking was the chief diplomat of Tempest, a nation with a terrifying amount of soft and hard power. She was the demon lord’s fully ordained representative in foreign lands, and Mithra couldn’t deny the possibility of another war if he angered her. He was fully aware that Testarossa was actually the <a id="page-245"></a>demon Blanc—and that he was being astonishingly rude with a great demon feared by the entire Empire.</p>

      <p>“Hmph! I won’t tell you to leave this room, however. I’m sure that your leader has an interest in the future direction of his friends, after all.”</p>

      <p>“Well, I’m deeply obliged to you, then.”</p>

      <p>Mithra had been hoping to anger her, but she just shrugged it off. It threw him.</p>

      <p><em>I thought she’d reject me out of hand if I went this far… What’s she after?</em></p>

      <p>He didn’t want her flying into a rage on him, but her staying <em>this</em> calm was just as unexpected. Getting her <em>too</em> angry would be forfeiting his life. Saying what he had just now made him feel like a few years had been shaved off his life span, so going any further required due consideration.</p>

      <p><em>What now? Should I take another step?</em></p>

      <p>It was one boundlessly scary step to take. So he decided to aim his saber elsewhere.</p>

      <p>“I am the half-brother of the great emperor Ludora, you realize. We don’t even know if he’s alive or dead yet, but here you are, deciding by yourselves to name this total stranger Masayuki to the throne. And <em>now</em> you’re shameless enough to ask for my assistance? I completely fail to comprehend what is going on in your mind!”</p>

      <p>Mithra kept talking, raising his voice a little. Depending on how she reacted, he’d need to change his tune at a moment’s notice. The real battle was now in progress.</p>

      <p>But unfortunately, his bet backfired on him in the worst possible way.</p>

      <p>“Oh dear, are you voicing displeasure about my decision? Because if you think you can avoid any consequences because you’re related to Ludora, I’ll need to teach you how wishful that thinking is.”</p>

      <p><em>G-gehhhh! Lady Velgrynd?!</em></p>

      <p>A silent scream emanated from Mithra’s mind. He was so shocked, he thought his soul was going to leap out from his throat. This was beyond merely losing a debate—he was completely cornered. He knew it was all over now, and the thought made him feel <a id="page-246"></a>oddly relieved. That, perhaps, was why he felt driven to simply say what was on his mind from now on.</p>

      <p>“Heh. You are Lady Velgrynd, our former Marshal and the guardian dragon of the Empire, are you not? I wasn’t aware that you would be part of this conference. It’s an honor to meet you.”</p>

      <p>First, he’d demonstrate that he wasn’t particularly impressed by her. Deep down, he wanted to run from the room immediately, but it had already dawned on him that this was impossible.</p>

      <p>“Oh, I’m sorry. I don’t feel I’m worthy of the throne or anything, but considering all the people who call the Empire home, I think installing me as emperor would be the best option we have…”</p>

      <p>Now Masayuki was there, too, coming through the door right after Velgrynd. This hadn’t factored into Mithra’s plans at all. The way things were going, he was forced to assume that his life was forfeit by now. But something still bothered him.</p>

      <p>“Hoh? You seem rather unconfident, Your Majesty. Do you think you could take the place of my half-brother like that?”</p>

      <p>He was trying to talk down to Masayuki as he spoke, but he half meant what he said, too. If he was going to be executed either way, he thought, he might as well try to bluff a little more.</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! I was just a normal student until a little bit ago, you know? It’s not a matter of being confident or not. I never even imagined being an emperor before.”</p>

      <p>“Heh. Pathetic. You think you can lead a mighty empire that way?”</p>

      <p>Mithra’s lips were moving on cruise control, but…</p>

      <p><em>Huh? What kind of nonsense is he talking? I didn’t realize from the way Minitz and Caligulio reacted that this isn’t what my investigating staff told me…</em></p>

      <p>Mithra’s spies had told him the new emperor was an ambitious, power-hungry young man. He had overwhelming support from the citizenry, and even the demon lord Rimuru, who couldn’t have cared less about the Empire, was reportedly an avowed fan of his. The nervously chuckling young man in front of him didn’t seem to match that description at all.</p>

      <p><a id="page-247"></a><em>What’s going on here?</em></p>

      <p>Mithra unconsciously turned toward Masayuki again.</p>

      <p>“Well…um, to be frank, that’s not really my thing, no.”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>Mithra couldn’t help but groan. He wasn’t alone.</p>

      <p>“Y-Your Majesty! I’ve asked you time and again to hold yourself with some more dignity!”</p>

      <p>“Indeed. Recruiting Sir Mithra to our side would have a great effect on the future of our government. We need people we can share the workload with—for our sakes as well.”</p>

      <p>Minitz and Caligulio were both entreating him.</p>

      <p><em>If that’s how he’s acting around me, it’s already too late. Asking me to join them after hearing this travesty of a conversation…</em></p>

      <p>Mithra couldn’t have felt more strongly against it if he tried. But he also thought that leaving this room alive would be better than a summary execution. He was no fool; he understood that he no longer had any freedom in these talks.</p>

      <p>“You silly fools. Have you forgotten that you promised not to force Masayuki into anything?”</p>

      <p>“N-no, Velgrynd, they’re not forcing me into anything! It’s all right!”</p>

      <p>“Sir Masayuki!”</p>

      <p>“Your Majesty!!”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd sounded just a little miffed. Masayuki hurriedly tried to assuage her, much to the eternal gratitude of Minitz and Caligulio.</p>

      <p>“Oh, and Masayuki? I’ve been meaning to ask you—would you mind referring to me by the nickname Gryn from now on?”</p>

      <p>“Um, okay. So…uh, Gryn?”</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee! How nice of you, Masayuki. You’re so honest with me—not at all like Ludora. If you don’t mind how Caligulio and Minitz act around you, then it’s nothing I need to intervene in. How fortunate for the both of you.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, my lady! Thank you!”</p>

      <p>“I will never forget this favor!”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd seemed to be over it. That was a relief. Mithra, watching all this, marveled at how tough their jobs must be.</p>

      <p><a id="page-248"></a><em>I see… They want to reel me into this for more reasons than merely stabilizing the government. What they really want is someone who’ll deal with Lady Velgrynd and take the heat off themselves a little. Still, though, this Masayuki…</em></p>

      <p>Mithra began to see the emperor as someone very much like him. And, again, he wasn’t alone.</p>

      <p>“Now, um…can I call you just Mithra?”</p>

      <p>“I still have not accepted it, but you appear to be emperor, yes. You may therefore call me whatever you want.”</p>

      <p>“All right, then. What do <em>you</em> think of me, Mithra? Do I just look like a normal young man to you, maybe?”</p>

      <p>“What are you talking about? You are the emperor. There’s nothing normal about you—”</p>

      <p>“No, like, I’m not talking about that. I just want you to take a deep breath and give me your honest opinion.”</p>

      <p>“Again, what do you mean?”</p>

      <p>Mithra couldn’t understand what Masayuki wanted to say. But the results of this exchange would set his fate in stone.</p>

      <p>“You think I’m just an average kid, don’t you?”</p>

      <p>“Are you asking if I think you’re improper for the throne? Then to be brutally frank with you, you are a far cry from my half-brother. You don’t have the capacity to lead anyone, much less an entire empire.”</p>

      <p>Saying it would no doubt spell his doom. But Mithra was already in a state of sheer desperation. If he was already helpless in Velgrynd’s hands, he at least wanted it to be painless. As furious as Velgrynd undoubtedly was, he assumed she would at least afford him that luxury. But the reaction was even greater than that—not from Velgrynd, but from Masayuki.</p>

      <p>“Mithra! That’s amazing! You’re exactly the kind of person I needed!”</p>

      <p>“What?” Mithra replied, unsure what Masayuki meant.</p>

      <p>“I mean,” a suddenly roused Masayuki said, “thanks to my ability or whatever, people just assume I’m this totally amazing person.”</p>

      <p>He excitedly described his unique skill Chosen One, and all the <a id="page-249"></a>suffering it had caused him. It had later evolved into the ultimate skill Lord of Heroes, a truly astounding ability. Anyone could see that giving the highest seat in the government to a complete amateur was a bad idea, but for some reason, Masayuki was always an exception in people’s minds.</p>

      <p>“What…?”</p>

      <p>“No, like, what I’m saying is that having someone like who you understands what I <em>really</em> am…like, it makes me so <em>happy</em>…!”</p>

      <p>Tears began to fall from Mithra’s eyes.</p>

      <p>“Masayuki… No—Your Majesty!”</p>

      <p>The young man’s pain was not unfamiliar to him. He understood it well himself. And that wasn’t all. As he now realized, if he was capable of understanding Masayuki, perhaps the opposite was true as well.</p>

      <p>“H-hey, no ‘Majesty’ stuff, please! I just thanked you for seeing who I really am!”</p>

      <p>“Ah yes, exactly. Yes, I understand you very well. I’ve experienced much of the same pain myself.”</p>

      <p>“Oh?”</p>

      <p>“Listen to me. There was one time when all I said was ‘What a bother’ and that was enough to get a man arrested. Honestly, there were times when I thought about never saying another word my whole life. That was impossible, of course, but it’s really hard, not being able to say what’s truly on your mind.”</p>

      <p>“I totally understand you! In my case, I try doing that, but it just doesn’t come across right. It gets interpreted in all these funny ways to just boost my reputation even more. It’s like, give me a break—I wake up one morning and now I’m emperor?”</p>

      <p>“A scary thought, yes.”</p>

      <p>“Right? It really <em>is</em> scary. My old friend Jinrai was just the worst when I first met him. He understands me a lot better now, but he actually tried to pick a fight with Rimuru on my behalf, you know? I can’t count the number of times I wanted him to quit saying my name all the time…”</p>

      <p>“Ah yes, that’s very familiar to me. That’s why I didn’t bring <a id="page-250"></a>anyone with me here. I’m too afraid to. There’s just no telling what might come out of their mouths.”</p>

      <p>It had happened on more than one occasion—an out-of-line remark from one of his attendants leading to a breakdown in negotiations. For <em>this</em> one, at least, he simply couldn’t afford that risk.</p>

      <p>“It’s so common, isn’t it? I thought I was the only one this whole time.”</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! We’ve both had it hard.”</p>

      <p>Now Masayuki and Mithra were chatting like they’d forgotten anyone else was in the room. They were all smiles now, and the buds of friendship were already forming.</p>

      <p>“…I suppose that carrying Ludora gave your mother some manner of immunity to it. I’ve lived for a very long time, but I’ve never seen anything like this.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd was just as surprised. But, out of respect for their newfound friendship, she decided not to remark on it.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">With Masayuki and Mithra now fast friends, all ill feelings were banished. Mithra was now promising his cooperation, but since he didn’t want any direct involvement with politics, he would remain leader of the noble “old money” faction and provide Masayuki with behind-the-scenes support instead. He wanted to keep his valuable free time, and as they spoke to each other, it became clear that this was the best way to move forward.</p>

      <p>“I will continue to manage the nobility dissatisfied with the current situation, but should I find someone with the right talents, I will endeavor to suggest that they offer you their assistance.”</p>

      <p>“Thanks. We’re really short on good people.”</p>

      <p>“That would be better for the military as well. Needless rebellion could cause us to lose good personnel. If you’re helping us out, Sir Mithra, we can take our time to win over any potential rebellious elements.”</p>

      <p>So things worked out fairly well in the end.</p>

      <p class="space-break"><a id="page-251"></a>With that, the conference was over.</p>

      <p>“One moment,” Testarossa said as Mithra stood up. “May I have a word with you, Sir Mithra?”</p>

      <p>His heart skipped a beat. He recalled the venom he’d spat in Testarossa’s direction as well. He thought that had faded into the background, given the amicable terms they’d come to, but perhaps he was just kidding himself.</p>

      <p>“Yes?” he said, trying to keep his voice calm as he sat back down.</p>

      <p>“Our conversation just now left me curious, so I did a little investigating. You have a secret skill, don’t you?”</p>

      <p>“Huh? No, I have nothing like that—”</p>

      <p>Mithra tried to deny it once he realized the topic wasn’t what he thought it would be. Testarossa cut him off.</p>

      <p>“Oh, don’t get me wrong. It’s an unconscious type—ah yes, I see it’s the unique skill Wicked Scoundrel. It’s the type you can inherit and pass across generations, too. From your father, probably? Did people fear him?”</p>

      <p>“…”</p>

      <p>They were terrified by him. Mithra had been told that this was the destiny of every eldest son in the Hilmenard family.</p>

      <p>“Well, if you become aware of it, I think you’ll be able to use it to your advantage in future negotiations.”</p>

      <p>Telling him this was the sort of meddling Testarossa wasn’t generally known for. She almost never did something like that, but she could be kind to the humans she’d taken a liking to.</p>

      <p>“I had that sort of power…?”</p>

      <p>“You sure do. I won’t tell you how to use it, but—here, let me give you another big gift.”</p>

      <p>“Mmm?”</p>

      <p>“Your wife’s just as scared of you, too.”</p>

      <p>“What? That’s silly. She’s a very graceful woman. We’ve never had an argument. I haven’t even raised my voice once around her.”</p>

      <p>Mithra laughed off the idea. Testarossa gave him a chuckle.</p>

      <p>“Oh, it’s very true. It’s a piece of information I kept in my pocket, <a id="page-252"></a>just in case it gave me an advantage in this negotiation. Your mother was probably immune to it, so it wasn’t any problem for her, but the same can’t be said for your wife.”</p>

      <p>“That’s impossible…”</p>

      <p>“But she’s still family to you,” Caligulio told a disturbed Mithra. “You understand that, don’t you, Sir Mithra?”</p>

      <p>“Right, yes,” Minitz added. “You just had a second child, didn’t you? I’m sure your wife loves you very much.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd, however, was there to immediately shoot them down. As cruel as it was, it was still the truth.</p>

      <p>“Oh, you silly people. That second child is the son that you’ve been eagerly waiting for, isn’t he? From your wife’s perspective, she’s given birth to a lawful heir, so now her job’s done. Have you even told her your true feelings?”</p>

      <p>“How do you mean…?”</p>

      <p>“Have you ever said you love her? Have you ever told her out loud ‘thanks for giving me this child’?”</p>

      <p>Come to think of it, Mithra couldn’t recall doing anything like that. His face turned pale as he realized his foolishness.</p>

      <p>“Putting your love into words like that,” Testarossa said, “is actually a very important way to ensure your love lasts. Why don’t you take this opportunity to express to her exactly how you feel?”</p>

      <p>Mithra eagerly nodded at her. “I’ll be on my way, then!” he said before darting out of the room.</p>

      <p>He made it home just as his wife was about to leave the house. He had just barely made it in time…and, understanding well the warning Velgrynd and Testarossa had given him, he heeded their advice. It saved him from having to experience a painful divorce.</p>

      <p>Ever since then, Mithra was eternally thankful for the two of them. He vigorously supported the new emperor in whatever he did, becoming one of the Empire’s staunchest supporters.</p>

      <p class="space-break">With that, all three major noble factions were in the pocket of the new emperor Masayuki. They had anticipated that it would take several years to stabilize the new government, but they wound up pulling it off in just a few months.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">

      </div>

      <p class="tx1"><a id="page-253"></a>The night after I befriended Sir Mithra:</p>

      <p>“So Lady Testarossa was right all along, eh?”</p>

      <p>“Pretty much. Some of that was luck, but having the demon lord Rimuru’s support counted for a lot. So did Lady Velgrynd’s presence.”</p>

      <p>I was enjoying a celebratory drink with Minitz at a restaurant in the Empire. Our concerns with the nobility were now largely taken care of, and the only problem that remained was the Aggressors. We had our spies deployed across the Empire to look into them, reporting back on whatever seemed amiss. I was sure they’d tell me if they found something, and we also had the reorganized Imperial Knights stationed in our provincial towns. We couldn’t let our guards down yet, but we could at least breathe a little easier now.</p>

      <p>As a result, I intended to drink to my heart’s content tonight. We had a lot of fun, talking about the things we’d gone through and discussing our future hopes for the Empire. Looking back, I never thought I’d become this friendly with Minitz. He was a reliable worker, but I never meant for us to become close personal friends. Now he’s an important war buddy of mine, a trustworthy friend helping me support Emperor Masayuki.</p>

      <p>We were carrying on into the evening, getting just the right level of tipsy, when Minitz broached a new topic with me.</p>

      <p>“By the way, how does it feel, having the kind of power that’d let you beat anybody?”</p>

      <p>I thought about it for a moment.</p>

      <p>“A little empty, actually. I feel like I have no goals left to reach for.”</p>

      <p>“Then you won’t need this anymore, will you?”</p>

      <p>Minitz presented me with an envelope. It was decently thick, presumably filled with documents.</p>

      <p>“What’s this?”</p>

      <p>“Don’t open it here,” he softly stated before emptying his glass. He stood up, placing the glass on the table.</p>

      <p>“Whoa, are you done for the night?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. That envelope contains a report on you. I did some digging <a id="page-254"></a>a few years back, so I’d have something on you just in case. You can have it, though. I sure don’t need it now. There were a few points that bothered me, so I’m having a little extra investigation done right now. It was kind of a surprise to me, though, so maybe you’re better off not knowing.”</p>

      <p>“Mm?”</p>

      <p>“If you’re not interested in your own past, go ahead and just burn it without reading it.”</p>

      <p>Minitz offered no more explanation than that. He just waved and headed out instead of answering any of my questions, never even turning back as he left.</p>

      <p>I was alone now, and in no mood to drink any further. Minitz’s words stuck with me. These papers definitely had something to do with me—some weakness of mine? I had no family, and I’m not going to deny that I’ve had shady dealings in the past, but I never participated in anything that’d earn me prison time. Minitz would know that, I assume…</p>

      <p>The only guess I had was that it involved my former wife. My past, and all that…and come to think of it, I never did complete my revenge. By now, I could easily crush anyone I wanted, whether they were an earl or not. That “I could do it any time” sense of useless pride had caused me to give up on the notion entirely.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, it might be a good idea to face up to my past already,” I muttered as I left the restaurant. “It’ll help me turn the page.”</p>

      <p class="space-break">So I returned home to my office, and I opened up Minitz’s envelope and read through the contents.</p>

      <p>“No way…”</p>

      <p>What I saw was shocking enough that I couldn’t help but mumble that out loud.</p>

      <p>Seeing the name “Earl Bullduff” made me realize that I’d even forgotten the name of my target for revenge. That was fine, but what was written beyond that was hard to believe. This Earl Bullduff was now the leader of a sect of countryside nobility—one small enough that I was safe ignoring it in general. The member list included the name of the barony my ex-wife came from, and the entire roster <a id="page-255"></a>consisted of barons, viscounts, and other low-end nobles. I’d have known about this sect if they were larger in scale, but considering they didn’t even number ten people, they must have escaped my attention.</p>

      <p>However, there was no overlooking this.</p>

      <p>“…The nobles that joined this faction have likely had their family inheritance compromised?”</p>

      <p>I hurriedly read on, wondering what this meant. All the families involved had been run by virtuous, upstanding men in the previous generation; they never dealt with criminals, and they ruled their lands properly and with respect. That’s why they’d been cornered so easily.</p>

      <p><em>It is believed Earl Bullduff forced an affiliated merchant to take on vast amounts of debt, allowing him to make this merchant do his bidding.</em></p>

      <p>Thoughts began to race through my mind. If this was true, Earl Bullduff could never be forgiven. But even before that…</p>

      <p>“Mamia!”</p>

      <p>I couldn’t help but shout her name. What if Mamia had actually loved me all along…? Once I had that thought, I could no longer sit still. I hurried for the door.</p>

      <p>“S-Sir?! Are you going out this late at night?”</p>

      <p>“Some business came up. Assemble my private guard at the airship dock. Get me an agent from the intelligence bureau, too.”</p>

      <p>“…! At once, sir.”</p>

      <p>The head butler of my household is a very capable man. One look at me, and he knew this was serious business. Saying nothing more, he quickly executed my orders for me.</p>

      <p class="tx1">I had a solid set of evidence gathered for me before sunrise. The report Minitz gave me was accurate; there’d be no talking his way out of this. But one person was pathetically crying at me, refusing to accept reality.</p>

      <p>“It’s over for you,” I said.</p>

      <p>“N-no! Who do you think I am? I’m Bullduff! Part of the Eight <a id="page-256"></a>Wise Rulers, famed across the countryside! What right do you have to arrest me?!”</p>

      <p>Even at this point, the foolish man refused to admit to his crimes. But Bullduff had good reason to try weaseling his way out of this. The nobility, after all, were given legal immunity in the Empire, which made it impossible to arrest them without a warrant released by the imperial palace. The knights of the Imperial Guardians, however, all had the right to write such a warrant, along with certain members of our information bureau.</p>

      <p>And so:</p>

      <p>“Earl Bullduff, your warrant has already been verified. We have testimony from the victims. Please understand that there is no talking your way out of this.”</p>

      <p>The agent I’d brought along with me had the right to arrest him, of course. Taking in someone as lofty as a noble earl was a major endeavor, but we had all our bases covered. I wanted to execute him myself, but that would have been going beyond my authority, so I held myself back. If <em>I</em> was the one killing him, I’d do it instantly and painlessly—and I had no interest in extending that mercy to this man.</p>

      <p>“Q-quit being ridiculous! What right do you have to—?”</p>

      <p>“Silence, Bullduff. Have you forgotten my face?”</p>

      <p>I went right up to Bullduff, so he could see my eyepatch well.</p>

      <p>“Wha…? Wait, are you Caligulio?!”</p>

      <p>“Oh, you knew?”</p>

      <p>“Of course I did! Your exploits are famed across the Empire. I heard you tasted defeat at the hands of those dirty monsters, but I’m sure you’ll vindicate yourself before long!”</p>

      <p>He seriously had the wrong idea here. If Lady Testarossa had heard that just now, his fate would have been even worse than it already was. I could tell him that…but better not. Get him too angry at me, and I might be dragged into doing something I didn’t want to.</p>

      <p>“I’m amazed that you aren’t ashamed of yourself. You were laughing the whole time while I was kicked out of my baron family, weren’t you?”</p>

      <p>“…!! That…that’s a misunderstanding.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-257"></a>I hadn’t explained anything to him yet, but that statement was tantamount to an admission of guilt.</p>

      <p>“This is stupid,” I said, my expression remaining unchanged. “The Empire’s supreme court will decide your fate. You’d better be ready for it. Their inquisitors aren’t nearly as nice as me.”</p>

      <p>Bullduff turned white as a sheet. “Wait… Please, wait! Sir Caligulio! I’m sorry! I’ll admit to it—”</p>

      <p>“Take him away.”</p>

      <p>At my signal, the knights dragged Bullduff off. His failure to take this seriously was exasperating. The imperial supreme court’s purpose wasn’t to go over all the details behind his crimes with a fine-tooth comb. It existed as a tool for taking down political opponents and stripping them of their rights. Admissions of guilt didn’t matter. Their inquisitors weren’t looking for testimony from suspects; their job was to take suspects’ dignity away and make them obedient.</p>

      <p>“Have fun writhing in pain,” I said softly as I saw him off in the distance, “and feeling the hate of all your victims…me included.”</p>

      <p class="tx1">After sending the knights home via airship, I took my personal autobike and headed for a small, remote town. I drove for a while, and soon I began to see familiar sights. There, beyond the hill, the mansion was the same as it always was. I’d thought it huge back in the day, but it actually seemed pretty tiny to me now, less than half the size of my manor in the capital. Still, this place was important to me.</p>

      <p>“This sure brings me back. It’s barely changed at all.”</p>

      <p>I found myself unconsciously whispering these words. Maybe I was nervous. I was, after all, about to meet the woman who’d dumped me…or not. I knew now that that had been my misunderstanding. All I needed was courage.</p>

      <p>It was a little past noon, and I recalled how my ex-wife would usually relax in the garden around this time. Trying to pump myself up as much as possible, I rang the doorbell.</p>

      <p><a id="page-258"></a>“Yes? Who is it?”</p>

      <p>The voice was familiar. It belonged to the assistant head butler of the manor, a man around ten years older than me.</p>

      <p>“It’s me, Caligulio. I never intended to come back, but I’ve got important business here. Could you call Mamia—er, Ms. Heath for me?”</p>

      <p>I heard a slight gasp on the other side of the door. There was a beat, and then he replied “Very well” and led me to a reception room where I’d wait for Mamia.</p>

      <p class="space-break">Now all I had to do was open my heart to her before that man could return. By “that man,” I’m talking about Baron Nezt Heath, the person who kicked me out and took over the Heath family.</p>

      <p>He was out, called over to the house of his friend Viscount Zook, so he should have been currently traveling to the next town over. I knew this because I’d arranged it. I had sent the knights out last evening to arrest Bullduff’s cronies, and as I had, I’d ordered them to keep their hands off Zook for the time being—on purpose, of course. We already knew that Zook was Nezt’s superior, so once he learned about Bullduff’s arrest, he was bound to reach out to Nezt.</p>

      <p>Now, just as I’d hoped for, Nezt was on the move. A round trip between this town and the next one took a half day on the fastest horse. I had heard he’d left early in the morning, so he was unlikely to return until after dark. I needed to get everything settled before then.</p>

      <p>“Sorry to make you wait, Sir Caligulio. I suppose I should say ‘long time no see’ to you?”</p>

      <p>My first taste of Mamia’s voice in ages made my pulse accelerate.</p>

      <p>“There’s no need for formal titles between us. Are you doing well?”</p>

      <p>Mamia was notably thinner. She had makeup on, but she wasn’t trying to hide the bits of gray starting to appear in her hair. I deduced that she didn’t have the money to beautify her appearance, which made a few facts apparent to me. This was a sudden visit, I knew, but a nobleman’s wife would normally have paid more <a id="page-259"></a>attention to her appearance than that. Of course, she’s always my Mamia, no matter how she looks, but…</p>

      <p>Minitz’s report stated that Nezt liked to spend extravagantly, and what I saw indicated that he didn’t value her much. It sorely angered me.</p>

      <p>“Oh, I hardly deserve the right to drop yours, Sir Caligulio. I am merely glad that you seem to be fine and healthy.”</p>

      <p>Her attitude toward me was still hardened. She was nervous, unsure what I was doing here.</p>

      <p>“So may I ask what brings you here today? Are you finally going to execute me?”</p>

      <p>I saw that coming.</p>

      <p>“What are you talking about?”</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee! My husband left here this morning in a great rush. I’m sure he was up to no good—you must have some evidence against him, don’t you? And I’m the woman who betrayed you. I can’t think of any reason why you would have mercy on me.”</p>

      <p>Her eyes looked beyond fatigued, bereft of all hope. We had been separated for twenty years; I had gone through a lot in the meantime, and this was true for Mamia, too. I didn’t know if I had the right to ask what she’d been through, but still, I had to clear up this misunderstanding between us.</p>

      <p>“I do have a reason. You were my wife. And my love hasn’t changed at all since then.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, don’t be silly—”</p>

      <p>“I’m not being silly,” I avowed.</p>

      <p>“What are you…?” Her eyes wavered a little. “I am a foolish woman. Lower than a dog. There’s no value in you remembering me. I committed a major crime, one that can never be forgiven. I did something to you I can never take back…”</p>

      <p>She choked up, tears streaming down her face. She put up a bold exterior, but her words made her recall exactly what she’d done.</p>

      <p>That’s right. Now I remember. Why had I hated Mamia so much, forgetting the one most important thing? My father-in-law, the baron, was a fine man, a lord that I respected. I took in his one and only daughter… How could I have been so stupid?</p>

      <p><a id="page-260"></a>“You did nothing wrong. I was a fool. I failed to notice that man’s little trick, and I hurt the one person I swore that I’d protect.”</p>

      <p>I spoke slowly, making sure I was understood. Mamia gave me a surprised look. Now, I was sure, she would listen to my story. I didn’t want to waste the opportunity.</p>

      <p>“It still pains me to this day that I chose not to believe in you. I understand what you and the Heath family are dealing with. Could you trust me one more time?”</p>

      <p>“What is the meaning of all this?! Like I told you, I have no right to do that. And <em>you</em> have the right to do away with all of us.”</p>

      <p>“No, <em>I’m</em> the one without any rights. I abandoned you all. That was my crime. I swore I’d become a knight who protected you, and now look.”</p>

      <p><em>So give me another chance.</em> I watched Mamia closely, hoping my request came through.</p>

      <p>“Am—am I really allowed to believe in you again?”</p>

      <p>The tears never stopped flowing from her eyes. I wiped them with a finger and firmly nodded.</p>

      <p>“I’ll never abandon you again.”</p>

      <p>Mamia flew into my arms, and I held her, swearing this from the bottom of my heart.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">

      </div>

      <p class="tx1">The servants of the Heath manor were assembled for questioning.</p>

      <p>At the time, everyone who had worked in this house took collective responsibility for protecting Mamia. The one who drugged me was still there, so all the required evidence was quickly gathered.</p>

      <p>“I wish I had been told about this,” I said to the head butler, who had officially taken the position after his father died.</p>

      <p>“We were coerced,” he replied, speaking on behalf of everyone else. “He took over the family’s debts for them, but he said he’d turn them over to a criminal enterprise. If he did that, it would endanger the lives of both the lady and the master of the house…so when he told us that, we had no choice but to play along with the scheme he presented to us. I truly apologize for this. It’s all thanks to how weak-minded we were.”</p>
