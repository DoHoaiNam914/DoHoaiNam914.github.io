      <p>Trying to open, then enlarge the Underworld Gate on this world had come back to haunt him…and thanks to that, Cornu lost his entire army and sustained injuries so grievous that they would take several decades to recover from. The fallout was nothing short of shocking, but that was none of Velgrynd’s concern.</p>

      <p class="tx1">“Well, I suppose goddesses have always been like that. Clearly, much of the fault belongs to the humans that angered her.”</p>

      <p>These were the first impressions offered by Oharu after being briefed on everything that had taken place.</p>

      <p>“I’m sorry. I thought I was turning it down pretty low, but, um, I guess I pack a lot more of a punch than I thought?”</p>

      <p>Trying to say that in a cutesy voice wasn’t going to help matters. But Oharu didn’t call her out on it, and if he wouldn’t, no one else was about to. Velgrynd had done it, and there was nothing left but to forgive her.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, although “devastating” didn’t even begin to describe the damage, Pulcinella was the only one who had died. However, the area between the Azerian naval base the <em>yohma</em> had used as their headquarters and the hidden cove they’d used as a military port was completely obliterated.</p>

      <p>The shock waves shook the ocean, leading to large-scale natural disasters, but Velgrynd quelled them before anything serious occurred. The steam from the evaporated seawater created storms, but she used climate control to make them go away. The wrecked cove turned into a small mountain of pure magma, but that was already taken care of. Some forested land and the like was lost, but aiming some High Healing at the land—a move that made no sense to observers—let Velgrynd create entirely new environments before the day was through.</p>

      <p>So while the geography of the world had been irrevocably <a id="page-198"></a>changed, the actual impact was pretty low. That was the ultimate conclusion people reached, and that marked the end of the <em>yohma</em>’s invasion—all solved with the help of one moody goddess.</p>

      <p class="space-break">A few years passed.</p>

      <p>Velgrynd never intervened in human history again. Oharu didn’t want her to. Her power was transcendent, and in a world without serious magic like this, things would just turn into a farce whenever she showed up. Therefore, she left matters to him. He might make mistakes sometimes, but as he warned her, those experiences would help humanity in time.</p>

      <p>So the goddess stayed by Oharu’s side, calmly watching over the workings of man. In time, the end came. Oharu’s life had run out.</p>

      <p>Velgrynd was there, along with Oharu’s family and close advisers, as well as anyone else who had been involved with the emperor and his consort. The sleeping Oharu awoke to find himself surrounded by them.</p>

      <p>“I am happy. I have been blessed with the honor of being loved by a goddess, and I have…enjoyed the peace that brought me. I worry for those I leave behind…but I refuse to allow you to fight for my sake. You must always strive…for a peaceful resolution. There is nothing good about conflict…”</p>

      <p>Those were Oharu’s last words.</p>

      <p>Conflict was something he was willing to stomach if it were for his own sake. But if it was for the sake of his loved ones, it quickly became unavoidable. It would cost not just him, but his loved ones their honor. He could perhaps rile them into action to dispel their fears—but doing that on a national or religious level could never be tolerated. Saying you were fighting for the sake of someone besides yourself sounded nice, but all that did was shunt responsibility onto the other party. Oharu was trying to say that each one of them, individually, had to bear responsibility for what they did.</p>

      <p>After experiencing an era wracked by vast sea changes, Oharu held a dream that he could pursue a world without conflict. He didn’t know how to make it come true, but he constantly thought over potential solutions. He had a responsibility, and he was sticking <a id="page-199"></a>to it. He never stopped trying to understand the other side’s perspective, and he used that understanding to reach common ground through talking.</p>

      <p>With those two pieces of advice, Oharu breathed his last. His expression was a picture of serenity; his death was no doubt a painless one.</p>

      <p>“You worked so hard. I’m very proud of you.”</p>

      <p>Velgrynd reached out to caress the late Oharu’s face. Then his body began to glow. The light compressed itself into a small, crystalline form, the shining soul fragment. Velgrynd held it tightly against her chest, then shed a tear filled with equal parts love and heartrending pain.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">

      <p class="tx1">Now that Oharu, the reincarnation of Ludora, had passed on, Velgrynd had no further reason to stay.</p>

      <p>“I’m off. Good luck to you all.”</p>

      <p>She thought about adding “I doubt I’ll see any of you again,” but decided against it. The thought, she was sure, would come across.</p>

      <p>“I only wish I could continue to chase after you, Lady Longhuang.”</p>

      <p>“Well, you can’t.”</p>

      <p>“Maybe not. But I’d prefer to hold on to hope instead of giving up here.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah… I suppose I’ve visited this planet several times over the years, after all. There’s no such thing as an absolute. Keep up the good work, okay?”</p>

      <p>“Yes!”</p>

      <p>Xienhua looked energized. Several onlookers had the same dream. They were charmed—they couldn’t <em>not</em> be charmed by the divinity of the living goddess before them—and they held hope in their hearts that someday, they would run into Velgrynd the way Xienhua had.</p>

      <p>“May we meet again, someday.”</p>

      <p>Masahiko Amari’s parting words represented the thoughts of everybody on hand.</p>

      <p><a id="page-200"></a>Velgrynd flashed a soft smile. There was no telling what was on her mind, but the smile immediately captivated everyone who saw it.</p>

      <p>“Yes,” she said, enjoying the moment. “Someday.” And then she flew off.</p>

      <p class="space-break">Several decades passed after Velgrynd’s departure. Humanity was at peace once again. Some nations had nursed aspirations of domination, but the whole <em>yohma</em> affair had nipped all that in the bud. The lesson would doubtlessly be retained for at least a few generations to come, and no major wars were likely to erupt before then.</p>

      <p>George Hayes returned to his role as president of Azeria, serving out his term and then retiring to support his son. Emile wound up establishing an entertainment agency, hoping to make this world struggling under war and famine just a little bit brighter. For Emile, whose genes had come from one of the world’s genius-level swindlers, it was work he was born for—and he really did make the world brighter, bit by bit.</p>

      <p>And Masahiko Amari supported him the whole way.</p>

      <p>Amari left the army soon after the peace treaties were signed. He’d asked for permission to resign in order to take on responsibility for the whole war, and Oharu (who had still been alive back then) had granted it. He had been freed from his responsibilities in the Conquering Empire, except for a certain secret mission Oharu gave him. Soon, he was working with Emile, helping him out with financial support and using his bottomless personal connections to help the agency grow into one of the big names of the industry in just a few years.</p>

      <p>Rumors went around that the agency used all manner of underhanded tactics to achieve its success. Amari had several mafia outfits working under him, forcing him to stay out of the public eye for much of his life. But he and Emile remained close, with Emile calling on him for help whenever a problem occurred.</p>

      <p>In time, the agency Emile founded grew to the point where it was one of the largest, most well-known companies in Azeria and across the world. And there was actually a very fascinating rumor about the company.</p>

      <p><a id="page-201"></a>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>One of the biggest stars in Emile’s stable was a beauty by the name of Longhua. She was active in show business for several years before retiring, only to stage a comeback after a few more years had passed. This was, of course, another person taking on Longhua’s stage name, but nobody knew exactly who she was in real life—and this became a pretty famous story in the entertainment industry.</p>

      <p>However, one rumor had it that Longhua’s real name was Xienhua—and, weirdly enough, that every other performer who performed as Longhua <em>also</em> had that same real name. It was like something out of a fairy tale. There was no way all of them could be the same person, but seeing her perform, one couldn’t help but wonder…and so the fan theories continued.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>These rumors were little more than tabloid fodder, but it went without saying that every Longhua really <em>was</em> the same person.</p>

      <p>Thanks to having taken in Velgrynd’s aura, Xienhua had gained de facto eternal youth. That made it hard for her to keep participating in human society without raising eyebrows, so she relied on Amari for help. And it wasn’t just her, either. Those who had overcome the <em>yohma</em> possession by themselves, like Li Jinlong and Delia, had absorbed their <em>yohma</em> powers and reached the Enlightened level.</p>

      <p>They were far from alone. Out of the rank-and-file soldiers and officers who’d found themselves involuntarily possessed, the great majority had been released from their <em>yohma</em> prisons by Velgrynd. But some of them became Enlightened as well, and all of them were being managed by Amari. Gensei Araki and Saburo Minamoto were their mentors, teaching them the evil-dispelling Oboro Shinmei-ryu sword style.</p>

      <p>The fighters of the future were being raised there, and in time, they would form an international anti-<em>yohma</em> organization. And until the promised day came, their fight would never be over.</p>
