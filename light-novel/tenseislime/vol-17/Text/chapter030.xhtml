      <h2 class="chapter-subtitle"><a href="toc.xhtml#toc-chapter029">(ORIGINALLY WRITTEN FOR A <em>SLIME</em> MERCHANDISE CAMPAIGN RUN BY ANIMATE, AN ANIME RETAIL CHAIN IN JAPAN)</a></h2>

      <p class="noindent"><a id="page-298"></a><a id="page-299"></a>My name is Vester, and it was always my dream to conduct useful research for the world at large as I served the great Heroic King Gazel. It didn’t quite work out for me that way, but instead I became a minister in the Armed Nation of Dwargon, following in the footsteps of my father.</p>

      <p>Or that’s who I <em>used</em> to be, I suppose. But thanks to my own foolish envy, I lost that position long ago.</p>

      <p class="space-break">The corps of engineers I was assigned to at the time was working with elven technicians to develop a new kind of weapon. It was a top secret “magic-armor soldier project,” as we called it, and a man named Kaijin was chosen to lead it. He was a commoner whose family ran a blacksmith forge, but he had a broad range of knowledge, and the constant effort he put in won him the adulation of his staff. He tended to get hotheaded at times, but there was no denying his talents as a boss.</p>

      <p>But no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn’t see eye to eye with him. Not because he was a commoner, mind you. Even at the time, his abilities were more than worthy enough for him to be called a master craftsman. And that’s why I was so jealous of him.</p>

      <p>Kaijin had become well known through his family business alone, but he was also putting up serious research results. I, meanwhile, <a id="page-300"></a>was a humble researcher, a one-trick pony by comparison. I came from nobility; my father was a marquis, and I was already destined for a ministerial position in time. While my father was still capable of reigning over his holdings, I would serve in the army and devote myself to research, but it was to be nothing more than a hobby for me.</p>

      <p>It was tremendously frustrating. I have no talent for politics. I don’t have the coolheadedness of my father, and I certainly don’t have the raw charisma of King Gazel. But even so, the staff at the marquis’s manor were all top talents, and I’d be guaranteed an environment where I could thrive in politics without really trying. What’s more, some of them were in ministerial positions themselves.</p>

      <p>But things like government administration and policy were all decided by King Gazel and his cadre of elders. My seat would be for little more than show; I wouldn’t be missed if I never attended a meeting, and no matter how hard I tried, I’d never actually help the king at all. I was sure at the time that I’d never be allowed to do anything substantial for my nation.</p>

      <p>That’s why I was so opposed to Kaijin. <em>He</em> could serve our king even in his blacksmith role. I’ve got nothing but research talents, and it just seemed so unfair to me.</p>

      <p>Besides, I didn’t have the time to leisurely devote myself to research. My father had fallen ill; his condition was only getting worse, and the day when I’d become head of our noble holding was near. I needed to put up serious results soon, or my life would end without King Gazel ever taking notice of me. The thought of that was too painful to bear.</p>

      <p>So I ignored Kaijin’s opinion that we needed to keep the pace of our development slow and steady. I forcibly conducted an experiment that led to one of our spirit cores—the keys to our whole project—going out of control. The whole thing was a failure, and the entire project was shut down, never seeing the light of day.</p>

      <p>I was in a daze afterward, but my family maneuvered for me behind the scenes. Somewhere along the line, Kaijin left the military, shouldering all responsibility for the incident. The next thing I knew, I was a minister.</p>

      <p><a id="page-301"></a>Now I wasn’t even in a position where I could give an honest apology to anyone. I had grown blind to the fact that the only joy I found in life was when I got to harass Kaijin about something—a terribly boring way to live.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">

      <p class="tx1">“Yeah, sorry about back then.”</p>

      <p>Out of nowhere, something drove me to apologize to Kaijin. He shot me a funny look, like he didn’t know what I was talking about.</p>

      <p>“Sorry about what? Rimuru didn’t give you the budget to increase production on those models, or?”</p>

      <p>“No, he’s already given his approval for that. His Majesty cajoled Sir Mjöllmile into giving us all the funding that we need.”</p>

      <p>“Great. So why the apology?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, I’m talking about long ago. You know—pestering you, running you out of the military. Half of it wasn’t me so much as my staff doing my bidding, but still… I know it’s too late, but I realized that I never said sorry for any of it.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, it sure <em>is</em> coming late. But didn’t you apologize to me for that ages ago?”</p>

      <p>Kajin gave me a chuckle. I think I did once, not long after I came to this country. I’d meant every word of it, but still, I wanted to give him an official apology sometime.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>Every single day in this nation is a cavalcade of surprises. I know that sounds like nothing more than an excuse, but I wanted to get that off my chest before anything else.</p>

      <p class="space-break">He’s too busy to <em>think</em> about it right now, he tells me!</p>

      <p>King Gazel could be a pretty capricious man, but Sir Rimuru is the most wildly free and uncontrolled person I’ve ever met. Just look at him—counting on me for such an important job.</p>

      <p>The first difficult job I had was educating the monsters. When he <a id="page-302"></a>asked me to teach them the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, the (admittedly rude) first thought in my head was “Is he nuts?” (By the way, the “abacus” he provided as a tool for teaching math turned out to be quite a useful device, enough that we adopted it in Dwargon. Sir Rimuru produced a sample for us, and the design of the model we used was pretty much identical.)</p>

      <p>And I was teaching them more than basic comprehension. There were classes devoted to practical skills, too, and I was charged with teaching them manners as well. Manners! To monsters! Could I be blamed for thinking this whole operation was a farce?</p>

      <p>I asked Sir Rimuru what the point of that was, and he just smiled and said, “Well, you know, I want us interacting with humans going forward.” That sounded insane to me, but I had no right to refuse him. I just nodded and said “very well” to him.</p>

      <p>The work, however, turned out to be much more engaging than I’d assumed. The female goblins I taught, led by Lady Shuna, were quite enthusiastic about learning how to properly carry themselves. The males were no slouches, either, learning how to politely handle visitors, hoping to mitigate their often vicious-looking appearances.</p>

      <p>All the monsters I worked with were much more eager to learn than I’d expected. It was fun for me to teach them. We agreed that I’d keep this up until they could prepare a research lab for me, but even now, I regularly participate in these classes—that’s how valuable that time is to me.</p>

      <p>So, in the meantime, they finished building the lab inside a spot called the Sealed Cave. Looking back, they didn’t give me much more than the bare minimum, but the thought of devoting myself to research once again made my heart soar. In the process, I was introduced to Gabil the dragonewt, becoming close friends with him as I realized that we shared the same mission. His outside-the-box ideas greatly motivated me, encouraging the spirit of inquiry that I had almost forgotten about.</p>

      <p>I wasn’t at all sure what would happen to me when I was first brought here, but by this point, I have nothing but appreciation for King Gazel. I can honestly state that I’m happy here. But that <a id="page-303"></a>doesn’t mean my life’s wholly free of problems. And that’s what I had just come to Kaijin’s place to discuss.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>I had already given the apology I was thinking about, so it was time to delve into my main business.</p>

      <p>“Really? Well, I appreciate you saying that.”</p>

      <p>“Sure, sure. But that’s not all you’re here for, right?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, you could tell?”</p>

      <p>“Of course. You’ve always been in the habit of bringing up a thorny issue only after going through a round of idle chitchat first. Putting it off, kind of.”</p>

      <p>He might have had a good point. I’d been acquainted with Kaijin for a while, so he probably knew my disposition well. I braced myself and stated my business—no point beating around the bush.</p>

      <p>“Well, to tell you the truth, I wanted to discuss something with you.”</p>

      <p>“Discuss? Well, it can’t be anything <em>that</em> serious if you got your budget.”</p>

      <p>Our budget <em>was</em> important, but no, it wasn’t that.</p>

      <p>“Oh, it <em>is</em> serious. Much more so than my budget.”</p>

      <p>“…Is it?”</p>

      <p>I got the idea that he couldn’t picture me being troubled about anything more important than my budget…but never mind that. It was a thorny issue, but I was sure Kaijin could find me an answer.</p>

      <p>“Well, over in Sir Rimuru’s lab…”</p>

      <p>“Whoa, whoa! You’re talking about the top secret lab he keeps for his personal stuff? You sure you should be talking freely about it?”</p>

      <p>I really shouldn’t have been. I knew that well enough without him telling me…but I just couldn’t keep quiet about this any longer! After all, I knew for a fact that Sir Rimuru was giving physical bodies to hundreds of demons at once in there! There were also a few Arch Demons among them—I’d seen those fearsome creatures receiving bodies with my own two eyes. I’d even witnessed <a id="page-304"></a>Sir Rimuru giving them names! How could I begin to express the horror I felt?</p>

      <p>Yes, I had a duty not to disclose any secrets, but this was really something I had to tell King Gazel about, wasn’t it? And Sir Rimuru never asked me to keep quiet about this, bear in mind. We already have a technology-sharing agreement in place, and I’m free to provide the results of my personal research to Dwargon anytime I want.</p>

      <p>But…well, you know…</p>

      <p>“All right. I’ll try to keep it abstract, then. In that lab, he’s currently mass-producing the kind of war power that would allow him to take on the entire world at once. I thought, you know, that King Gazel should know about this as well.”</p>

      <p>Kaijin had a valid point, so I tried to be as indirect as I could. But his reaction was a lot more vigorous than I anticipated.</p>

      <p>“Wait. Wait, wait, wait, <em>wait</em>! Vester, what is this stuff you’re saying outta nowhere?!”</p>

      <p>“Mm? Was that too abstract for you to make sense of it?”</p>

      <p>“No, you idiot! In fact, it’s about as <em>non</em>-abstract as it gets!”</p>

      <p>Was it? I didn’t think so. I was still hiding the more important parts.</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! Don’t worry, Kaijin. I’m sure <em>you’d</em> be agonizing over it too if I gave you all the details. But for now, I just want to hear your reaction to that.”</p>

      <p>“You expect me <em>not</em> to worry about that? Because you’ve always had this habit of trying to escape from reality whenever something bad happens to you like this.”</p>

      <p>I found that pretty rude of him. But I was too worried about what I knew to let that bother me.</p>

      <p>“So what do you think I should do?”</p>

      <p>Should I keep it locked up in my mind, or should I report back to King Gazel? Kaijin gave my question some thought, scratching his head as he answered me.</p>

      <p>“Vester, I think you’re a little tired out. Why don’t you just head home for today and enjoy a drink or two?”</p>

      <p>He grinned at me. Great. He’s running from the question.</p>

      <p><a id="page-305"></a>“That’s not really an answer, you realize!”</p>

      <p>“Oh, lay off me, you idiot! And quit dragging me into something <em>this</em> vital!”</p>

      <p>That was perfectly justified of him, but I wasn’t going to back down.</p>

      <p>“Aw, don’t say that! You’re doing me a favor here!”</p>

      <p>“I abandoned my country, you realize. I don’t have the kind of responsibility a Dwargon marquis like you has.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, don’t be so distant! You’re a boss to me now, Kaijin! I respect you a lot! Didn’t you always used to tell your staff that noble titles didn’t matter nearly as much as social standing?”</p>

      <p>“Sure, sure, bring <em>that</em> up now! Is this why you were apologizing earlier? You always <em>were</em> crafty like that…”</p>

      <p>Our verbal scuffle continued for a little while after that, with me trying to drag Kaijin into this and him trying to make a clean escape. But I could already see where this was going. Kaijin was a responsible man, and I knew he’d never just try to run from me if he’d heard this much of it.</p>

      <p>“Tch… All right. Give me the rest of the details.”</p>

      <p>“I knew you’d say that eventually.”</p>

      <p>As expected, Kaijin agreed to hear me out. I gave him a satisfied smile.</p>

      <p class="tx1">So we went over to a high-end tavern located inside the labyrinth. Dwarves and drink are never far from each other, and while I look more like an elf on the outside, it’s still a favored hobby of mine. And all the wonderful drink they manufacture in this nation! The staff at this tavern’s thoroughly trained to not reveal secrets to anyone, too, so even if they overhear something they shouldn’t, they’ll never tell a soul. We were guaranteed to be safe in here, so it was perfect for discussing delicate affairs like this.</p>

      <p>“So what are <em>you</em> thinking about doing?” Kaijin asked. I decided to be honest with him.</p>

      <p>“If I stay silent and something bad happens afterward, I’d feel <a id="page-306"></a>terrible. I haven’t been told to keep quiet about it, so I feel I have a duty to file a report.”</p>

      <p>Kaijin gave my response a thoughtful nod. “Yeah. That wouldn’t count as an illegal tip-off under the terms of our original agreement, I’m sure. Besides, aren’t you still officially a marquis of Dwargon?”</p>

      <p>I was. It was something even I forgot about on occasion, but my home nation had never stripped me of my noble title, and I’d never voluntarily given it up. I mean, really, I was just back at home in a daze, and the next thing I knew, King Gazel kidnapped me and sent me over to Sir Rimuru. There hadn’t been any time at all back then to work out what my position in Dwargon would be.</p>

      <p>The nobility in the Dwarven Kingdom do not own their domains. All land is technically owned by the king, and we pay rent to the government to gain the right to oversee it. The definition of “domain” is likely quite different from other nations’ as well. Dwargon has only three large cities, located in the central, east, and west sides of the nation. Beyond that, you had the manors that line the bases of our mountains and the living spaces built into the mines excavated within natural caves.</p>

      <p>These living spaces, divided into wards, are what the nobility manage. We were overseeing family registers, to borrow a phrase from Sir Rimuru. That means we look after the residents of the ward that we run, accept the taxes they pay us, and carry out our other duties as nobility. The number of families we oversee depends on our noble title, but as a marquis, I actually made quite an income.</p>

      <p>After committing as bad a blunder as I did, costing me the confidence of King Gazel, I was sure that my title would be seized as well. But I was still being treated as a marquis to this day, and that meant my yearly tax revenue was still streaming in. The talented stewards that supported our family were taking care of all that business for me, even now. My family was still receiving their payments, and since I hadn’t been officially exiled from my homeland, I was actually free to go back and live there whenever I wanted.</p>

      <p>I didn’t want to do that, of course, and I didn’t plan to. Living here was just too much fun by comparison. My personal servants had also joined me here, and I was enjoying a more luxurious <a id="page-307"></a>lifestyle in Tempest than I had over there. The food’s great, the drinking scene is spectacular, and I can do all the research work I want. It’s like heaven to me. Sir Mjöllmile can be stingy with my budget sometimes…but now I’m drifting well off-subject.</p>

      <p>“Mmm, yes, I am. And considering my position as marquis, not telling King Gazel would be akin to betraying his trust.”</p>

      <p>“I don’t think keeping quiet is the same as betraying him, but yes, I do think it’s your duty to make a report.”</p>

      <p><em>Yeah, I guess so…</em></p>

      <p>I didn’t really need him to tell me that anyway. But the problem was, <em>how</em> would I report it?</p>

      <p>“So you think I should just say it all? Like, he’s building enough firepower to destroy the world?”</p>

      <p>“Whoa, whoa, did you drink too much? And for that matter, is it <em>that</em> grave of a thing in the first place?”</p>

      <p>Mmm… This <em>is</em> some good drink. I couldn’t get enough of this mellow taste. It was refreshing, aromatic, and just so wonderfully mild. I could feel it freeing me of all my concerns. But…yeah.</p>

      <p>“You know about Ultima and Carrera, right?”</p>

      <p>“Oh? Well, of course, but seriously, are you all right? I’m getting whiplash from these changes of subject.”</p>

      <p>“I’m not changing the subject. And I’d <em>have</em> to be drunk to talk about this kind of thing.”</p>

      <p>“Wait, so are you telling me…?”</p>

      <p>“You guessed it. Those two are part of the firepower he’s building.”</p>

      <p>“Huh… I see. Well, that’d certainly explain why the police overseeing the adventurers are so damn strong. I never saw them in the Tempest security forces, so I figured they were some kinda secret force out training in the wilderness somewhere.”</p>

      <p>I began to think Kaijin was finally grasping the seriousness of all this. Nobody in Tempest ever dared to defy the city’s police force, and nobody dreamed of complaining about any of its court verdicts. Why? Because they regulated the conduct of criminals with absolute, overwhelming power. Anyone who saw them could tell that they were insurmountably powerful fighters; in terms of adventurer ranks, even the lowliest police officer would spill over the A mark.</p>

      <p><a id="page-308"></a>“But… Wait, what? So the police is their world-conquering firepower?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. It’s the perfect camouflage, isn’t it?”</p>

      <p>“Well… I’m not so sure, but…”</p>

      <p>Kaijin looked confused. I could understand why. The thought of these fearsome, world-destroying demons serving as the police force protecting our citizens…</p>

      <p>“So assuming I told King Gazel about this, how do you think he’d react?”</p>

      <p>“W-well…that…hmm. This <em>would</em> be hard to tell him, wouldn’t it?”</p>

      <p>“Right? There’s no way anyone would believe me. People might even start disgraceful rumors saying that I’ve gone mad. I think I’d still have the king’s trust, but all the intermediaries between him and me would try to cast doubt on it, I’m sure.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah,” muttered Kaijin, finishing off his cup. He was staring at me, no doubt cursing me for getting him involved. So I gave him a smile.</p>

      <p>“What do <em>you</em> think I should do?”</p>

      <p>“Well…now I’m not sure you should just meekly tell him. It’s a tricky question for me, too…”</p>

      <p>Kaijin and I fell silent for a little while, pondering the correct answer. The monotony was only broken by Sir Deeno, whom we had invited over.</p>

      <p>“Whoa, Vester! It’s no fair, you two having all the fun. You shoulda called me in sooner! And buy me a drink while you’re at it, too! Then I’ll listen to whatever problems you got for me!”</p>

      <p>He gave me a broad, reassuring smile. I wasted no time asking him.</p>

      <p>“All right, Sir Deeno, what do <em>you</em> think I should do?”</p>

      <p>I was drunk. Which meant that I completely forgot that <em>he</em> was a demon lord as well.</p>

      <p>“Forget about it! Just palm the responsibility off on someone else! And if he gets yelled at, that’s just bad luck for him!”</p>

      <p>Sir Deeno shot us a thumbs-up to accentuate his point.</p>

      <p>“No, I really don’t think—”</p>

      <p>“It’s fine, it’s fine,” he continued, interrupting the concerned Kaijin. “Like, honestly, I’ve been asked to report a bunch of things, too, <a id="page-309"></a>but I ditched <em>that</em> responsibility real quick. I got raked over the coals for that, so I promised myself that I’ll do more reporting…but it’s up to me <em>who</em> I report to, right? So I just told whatever random guy I decided on, and that wound up working out just great. <em>They</em> wind up getting yelled at, and <em>I</em> can hold my head high and say I did what was asked of me. I feel so refreshed every day now. <em>Highly</em> recommended!”</p>

      <p>And with that sage advice, Sir Deeno ordered his first round and began drinking. I suppose he was already done with this conversation. Heh… Now I feel like an idiot for agonizing over this.</p>

      <p>“Right! I think that’s exactly what I’m going to do!”</p>

      <p>“Excellent! Good idea, Vester! No wonder you’re my boss!”</p>

      <p>Having a demon lord like Deeno give me that encouragement made me feel a bit proud of myself. It was odd.</p>

      <p>“He’s poisoning your mind, man. You can’t use this guy as a reference. Think it over!”</p>

      <p>Kajin had been carrying on for a bit now, but even his prattling sounded comforting to me.</p>

      <p>“Let’s drink! It’s on me tonight, guys. Let’s see how far we can go!”</p>

      <p>“Yeah! That’s the spirit!”</p>

      <p>“Whoa, whoa, are you all right?! Because I think even top management like <em>you</em> can’t afford to go crazy in this joint—”</p>

      <p>“Hey, quit sweating the small stuff, old man! Just chill out and let’s have at it!”</p>

      <p>“<em>You</em> just want to drink on someone else’s tab!”</p>

      <p>“Well, yeah. How’s that a problem?”</p>

      <p>“It most certainly is not! My mind’s free of troubles now, Kaijin, so now it’s time to celebrate. Let’s paint the town red!”</p>

      <p>I felt like king of the world, and before long, the party began in earnest. Hopefully I won’t have to deal with a bunch of other stupid trouble tomorrow—that was the only wish in my mind as the three of us clinked our full glasses.</p>

      <p class="tx1">“Sir Vester, you must be very tired,” said the agent I gave my report to.</p>

      <p>Looks like he didn’t believe me after all. That was exactly what <a id="page-310"></a>I’d anticipated, but I still had no regrets. After all, I had done so much regretting the moment I saw the tab after I sobered up that I think I broke my “regret” emotion for good.</p>

      <p>“Yeah…maybe you’re right, ha-ha-ha. But don’t say I didn’t file the report, all right?”</p>

      <p>With that, I ended my regular contact call.</p>

      <p class="space-break">My report would be verified much later, but nobody questioned whether I was responsible. <em>Some</em> did, actually, but the nameless agent took all the heat based on our magical call records. It really <em>did</em> turn out the way Sir Deeno said it would. I’m so glad I thought to discuss it with him.</p>
