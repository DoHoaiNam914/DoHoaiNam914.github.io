      <p class="noindent"><a id="page-204"></a><a id="page-205"></a>My name is Caligulio. I used to command the Armored Division, which boasted the most powerful force in the Eastern Empire, and that whole time, I was little more than a fool.</p>

      <p>I went on about how what I did was for His Majesty’s sake, but really, my eyes were focused strictly on my own fame. Now I see how little meaning there was to advancing my career like that. I mean, a man from low-level nobility rising to command an entire force before age forty really <em>is</em> something to crow about. Receiving a barony from one’s in-laws seems like so much garbage compared to being a division commander. It’d be foolish to use that as an excuse, but I don’t think you could blame me for becoming arrogant.</p>

      <p>And I still regret it all, of course.</p>

      <p>Still, I should note that I started my career getting chased out by my in-laws. I was born into a knight captaincy, my family having selected me to marry a baron’s daughter from the main family. I was happy, I suppose—until I was cheated on and forced to accept a separation. My wife, or my ex-wife, was irreplaceable to me at the time. I thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world, and I thought I was the happiest man in the Empire. She said she felt the same way, so I thought she was the one who picked me, but I was wrong. I was complacent, really.</p>

      <p>But a year later, when my father-in-law died, I was unceremoniously <a id="page-206"></a>tossed out. I still remember it now…or it shows up in my nightmares now and then, that is. But there’s no way I could ever forget how she looked when she addressed me.</p>

      <p>“It was a good dream for you, wasn’t it? A dirt-poor knight, getting to play a make-believe noble. But that’s in the past now. My father ordered me to marry you, but now I’m finally free. And it’s your fault, you know. You couldn’t even father any children.”</p>

      <p>I was so desperate, I wanted to scream. I couldn’t understand what she meant at the time, but the bottle she thrust before me told the whole story. She had been drugging me the entire time.</p>

      <p>Maybe I could have lodged a complaint and filed legal proceedings. But I was fighting a baron and his family. My ex already had a lover on the side, a wealthy merchant, and that made things even worse for me. He had already paid off all the baron’s servants to talk trash about me.</p>

      <p>So the merchant got the noble title and my ex got a life of luxury. All <em>that</em> even though my father-in-law had lectured me about how a noble must remain proud, even if he lives austerely. I’m sure <em>he</em> never liked living that way. But that’s all water under the bridge now.</p>

      <p>Back then, I never thought about bringing my complaints to the people from the main family that took care of me—like family, too. My own parents died in an accident when I was still a boy, so nobody stuck up for me during any of this. So, sure, I guess it was just a matter of time before the baron kicked me out of that place.</p>

      <p class="space-break">Looking back, I think I might’ve gotten a lot of motivation from the whole experience. The anger and hatred I felt after being betrayed by the girl I love kept propelling me forward. I wanted to move up in the world and get my revenge, I suppose you could say. I was still in my early twenties. Young. Ready to use that hate-driven energy to work myself to the bone.</p>

      <p>I toed the line with death more than a few times. I put up some serious results. I didn’t hesitate to take on dirty work, and I was pretty good at undercover operations. I was friends with this other merchant, and I tried cutting him as much of a deal as my rank <a id="page-207"></a>would allow me. I also took on some money-laundering work, passing around the cash to the nobility to build connections for myself.</p>

      <p>So thanks to all that hustling, all that striving for the top, I was a field-officer-class soldier by my mid-twenties. I was a knight academy graduate, so I got to kick things off as a warrant officer—going up in rank every year or two, in other words. Pretty fast, right? But it only worked because of the way power means everything in this empire.</p>

      <p class="space-break">By this point, I began building my own faction in the military, so I could gain a tighter grasp on it. That’s when I met Minitz.</p>

      <p>He was from nobility, but he <em>loved</em> to fight. Which was pretty unusual, yeah. Whenever he went back home, he always wanted to set right off for the front lines, despite how much more upper-class he was than everyone else. That baffled me.</p>

      <p>But anyway, he was definitely a talent, so I made use of the guy. I wasn’t looking to have him like or respect me, so I was never too shy about asking him for money or whatever. But he was weird that way. He actually <em>liked</em> all my orders, and he always carried them out. Of course, he was using me just as much the whole time, so I guess we were pretty much even. We happened to be a good match, considering the goals we had and all, but it’s true that we had a trust going, too. As long as I kept hunting for promotions, I always needed to seek out new battlefields—and as battle-crazy as he was, I was sure Minitz would take any order I gave him, as long as he could keep using his connection to me to see some action. Besides, I didn’t have any family anyway. It wouldn’t hurt anyone if I died, which let me be as crazy as I wanted without repercussions.</p>

      <p>So Minitz and I had this oddly trusting relationship going. Then Kanzis came along. He was famous for being a thorn in the army’s side for a while, but all that mattered to me was how useful he was. On <em>that</em> front, he passed with flying colors, and I suppose Kanzis saw me that way as well. He started takin’ a liking to me, too, probably because of how I’d say yes to pretty much any military op. He was known for his overwhelming strength, but his rep in the military was in the toilet. He’d defy orders all the time, sometimes <a id="page-208"></a>going berserk during battle. He was transferred into my command because of how hard he was to handle, I guess, but to me he was a godsend.</p>

      <p>Minitz, Kanzis… I used them as much as I possibly could. I’d come up with ops that any normal guy would hesitate to even touch, and I’d make ’em run them. But it kept paying off for us, and before much longer, we were so high up that nobody could bitch and moan about it anyway.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">So I reached the upper officer ranks in my early thirties.</p>

      <p>My command didn’t give me much time on the front lines by that point. That’s because I lost my sight in my left eye, thanks to a certain someone attempting to poison me when I was younger. But that didn’t mean I was any less powerful. Our nation had already opened itself up to a new power, called science, and that made it easy for them to create an elaborate artificial eye for me. I usually kept it under an eyepatch anyway, though. <em>It’d put the enemy off their guard</em>, I thought.</p>

      <p>I had assumed that my strength would wither on me as I aged, but I felt more energetic by the moment. I looked about my age on the outside, but internally, I was just brimming with stamina. It was like I was constantly in the prime of my life; nothing scared me at all. Ranking duels were a particular interest for me, but I put my dominance over the military ahead of that. I could sense that a commander rank was within reach, and by my estimation, that’d give me more power than the Imperial Knights serving His Majesty.</p>

      <p>So I kept building up my faction. I used old man Gadora in my drive to steadily strengthen the Armored Division; I had the merchants I knew provide money to modernize it as well. All the preparations were falling into place; I was building a résumé for myself; and so, just past my mid-thirties, I was named one of the Empire’s three Generals of the Guardians.</p>

      <p><a id="page-209"></a>Life couldn’t have been going better for me. And I guess that’s why, in between my duties, I began to think a bit—like, what’s that baron family who kicked me out doing right now? After I had someone look into it, though, I was thrown into distress. None of it was my fault, but…<em>why</em>?</p>

      <p>Well, it was obvious. At the time, I had obtained enough power to crush them all several times over. My banishment from their house was a pretty famous story, so it turns out that the military under me had taken action without me telling them to. Not that they directly knocked on their door or whatever. They just gave a careful word or two to our business relations, like <em>“Don’t tell me you’re still dealing with the people who did</em> that <em>to our commander”</em> and stuff. I’m sure the big-name merchants who were told that had no choice but to defer to my will. I was on the fast track to the upper echelon of the army, after all.</p>

      <p>Besides, unlike in the West, the imperial economy didn’t really allow for free trade to start with. On paper, only the nobility or military were allowed to conduct merchant activity. Nobles had the right to name merchants to serve as their employees and conduct business in their name; these merchants could then earn a salary through the profits they earned in business.</p>

      <p>That, I’m sure, is why the man who took my wife wanted a noble title so badly. That way, he could keep up his merchant work for whatever high-end noble he was working with, setting up his sons or daughters with noble marriage partners all the while. That title would then earn him the legal right to conduct business on his own. It was a classic pattern, something you saw all the time.</p>

      <p>So, yeah, now that merchant was a baron and all…but I bet he hadn’t been counting on me climbing <em>this</em> high up the career track. The guy whose face he’d laughed at while booting him out the door was now a general, shockingly enough. The military ran on a huge budget, leading to all sorts of business opportunities, and it was the high-ranking officers who decided which merchant got what kind of business. As one of three Generals of the Guardians, I’m sure it’s clear what sort of say I had. I didn’t control the entire budget, but <a id="page-210"></a>the influence I had put me on the level of a noble earl or higher. No way some baron could compete against that, of course, and so all his military business connections were shut down.</p>

      <p>Hearing that made me feel a little empty inside. I’d wanted to get revenge with my own two hands, but now it was already mine without my even having done anything. Still, I thought, that wasn’t any reason to let up. I’d already been betrayed once. If I went all soft now, it just meant more people trying to take advantage of me.</p>

      <p>I’d made it up to the rank of general in no small part because I couldn’t father any children. Advance high enough in the military, and you were automatically awarded a noble title upon retirement. The more you achieved, the loftier the title. Me, I didn’t have any kids and I wasn’t gonna have any, so no matter how fancy the title I got was, that lineage would end in just one generation—no real threat to any of the other nobles.</p>

      <p>The military hates it when nobles recruit their own private forces, and in turn, nobles hate it when military officers get rich. The military gets the power, the nobles get the money—that kind of separation was considered really important, and one side bleeding into the other was seen as taboo. That’s why so many of the top military brass were single. It meant they could dive into battle without concerns about creating widows or orphans, yes—but really, this kind of competition with the nobility played a bigger part.</p>

      <p>But now I was starting to have an idea. The baron who’d betrayed me was on the skids, sure, but his life hadn’t been totally destroyed or anything, right? Really, it was like a divine revelation to me. I still had stuff left to do, didn’t I? The only reason that family’s still alive is because they’re nobles. Low-end or not, it’s a barony, so they can live decently off their imperial stipend alone. If I can just take that title from them, they’ll be ruined, with nowhere to go.</p>

      <p>And they weren’t the only people I needed to purge. There was her new husband’s merchant father, for example, and the earl who hired him. If <em>they</em> weren’t around, I never would’ve had to go through any of that.</p>

      <p>So there you have it. I had to eradicate the enemy, or they’d get me next. But destroying an earl required even more power than <a id="page-211"></a>what I had already. And <em>that’s</em> when I began to aim higher—and try to obtain the kind of force that could beat anybody on the planet.</p>

      <p class="tx1">“Right, so after that, I was pretty much in my own little world. You know, I could understand just how low-down and dirty it was, what I was doing and all, but it’s like I couldn’t <em>see</em> it, kinda.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. Honestly, you weren’t much of a pretty sight back then.”</p>

      <p>“You would’ve been perfectly justified abandoning me then, really. Then <em>you</em> woulda been a general, not me.”</p>

      <p>“Ah, that work was never my thing. Besides, I never hated you or anything. It was the same deal with Kanzis. Whether I’m a good guy or a bad guy, I want to deal with the people I like, essentially.”</p>

      <p>“<em>Pfft</em>! You always were weird like that.”</p>

      <p>“I’m aware…but I sure don’t need <em>you</em> reminding me.”</p>

      <p>The men shared a laugh—Caligulio, the skinny officer in his forties, and Minitz, a man in a freshly tailored suit.</p>

      <p>They were in the Elf Club, an exclusive members-only joint located inside the Labyrinth. It was the stage they’d chosen to reminisce and discuss their past follies, all while sampling a wide range of the club’s drinks.</p>

      <p>Normally the venue was off-limits to all but a carefully selected member list. You had to be on the list to enter, and only after undergoing a set of body checks and paying the entrance fee. They’d never have been allowed to set foot in it usually, but after the Tempest/Empire summit the other day, it had been opened to higher-up imperial officers. That move had been suggested by Rimuru, who’d said he wanted to put this war behind them and build a better relationship going forward, and the two of them knew that. That’s why they hadn’t hesitated to take him up on this offer.</p>

      <p>“But, yeah, you know what happened after that. I took control of the whole army and got aspirations of taking over the world. Then <em>this</em> nation beat us, and here I am.”</p>

      <p>“‘Beat’ you makes it sound like a schoolyard brawl. To be more accurate, you couldn’t even put up a fight.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-212"></a>“Heh-heh… No doubt.”</p>

      <p>“But I’m glad I got to see it, you know? Seeing for myself that Emperor Ludora and the Marshal—or Lady Velgrynd—weren’t the most unimaginably powerful people in the world after all.”</p>

      <p>“I can’t see how the thought makes you happy, but if you’re glad, I’m glad. So are you planning to make up with your brother?”</p>

      <p>Minitz gave Caligulio a self-deprecating smile. “I pretty much have to. He’s the marquis banding together the nobility. With Sir Masayuki set up as the new emperor, it’s our job to support him with everything we got.”</p>

      <p>Although Minitz was born into the family of a noble marquis, he’d joined the army anyway, out of a desire to prove his talents. Those talents had brought him this far, in no small part because of the preferential treatment he received as a high-born noble. Still, there was no denying Minitz’s real strength. Nobody thought ill of him at all, and anyone who did received a lesson on how stupid they were in short order.</p>

      <p>So it was Minitz’s younger brother who eventually became marquis, but he wasn’t very fond of it. He resented Minitz, in fact, for palming the job (and all the stress it brought) off on him. Caligulio had learned about that just a bit ago, so he was relieved to hear his friend wanted to mend fences with the man.</p>

      <p><em>A peaceful agreement was never possible for me</em>, he thought. Minitz, at least, had the good luck of owning a family fortune and the freedom to use it however he wanted. He had the strength to back up his extravagant habits, though; if he didn’t, he and his brother would have been branded debaucherous failures. Caligulio doubted that the two really disliked each other <em>that</em> much, though. Minitz’s brother said it wasn’t fair, the lot he received in life, but so would anyone else put in that position, really. It took someone like Minitz to get away with abandoning his noble title like that.</p>

      <p>“Yeah… I’ll be counting on your support for that, <em>Mr. Prime Minister</em>.”</p>

      <p>Minitz might have escaped his noble obligations, but as part of the new Masayuki-driven administration, he had been appointed prime minister, one of the most powerful posts in the whole Empire. <a id="page-213"></a>The conversation between Masayuki and Rimuru had gone something like this:</p>

      <p>“Y-you know, we were in that big meeting and all, and I didn’t want to rock the boat…but the more I think about it, there’s just totally no <em>way</em> I could be an emperor! I’ve never even studied politics before, and…well, okay, I did in high school and stuff, but that was just, like, skimming the textbook for the stuff I needed in the test!”</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! No flaking out on that now.”</p>

      <p>“No?”</p>

      <p>“Of course not! You see how I’m muddling through this well enough. You can grow into the role just fine!”</p>

      <p>“You’re being way too optimistic, Rimuru! Seriously, quit joking around with me like this!”</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha… You’ll be fine, you’ll be fine. Everyone will help you out, too.”</p>

      <p>“You’ve got the biggest ‘not my problem’ look on your face right now. I can tell. That, and I bet you’re glad you have another friendly monarch you can schmooze with!”</p>

      <p>“No, no, no… Besides, like I said, you got a lot of people you can lean on, don’t you? Like Minitz over there. I think <em>he’d</em> be pretty reliable.”</p>

      <p>Minitz, sitting nearby, made eye contact with Rimuru—a serious mistake. He was pretty sure Rimuru was acting entirely on a whim, but either way, he had stood out too much in that conference for his own good. Being branded a capable man by Rimuru, he was promptly assigned to be an adviser to Masayuki…and that, once the dust settled, had evolved to the position of prime minister.</p>

      <p><em>Great…</em></p>

      <p>All Minitz could do about it now was laugh. He had Masayuki personally pleading with him for assistance, and it wasn’t the kind of thing he could just turn down. Besides, when push came to shove, Minitz really liked Masayuki. It was better than getting browbeaten under Velgrynd’s gaze all day.</p>

      <p>This, of course, led to one little problem—the post of prime minister was already occupied. Minitz figured he could make this man <a id="page-214"></a>his assistant, however. The emperor had the exclusive right to name his cabinet, so if the current prime minister wanted to complain to Minitz about it, he was barking up the wrong tree. He might have anyway, of course, but Minitz didn’t care. He had come to know far, far scarier people in his life, and if the old minister gave him any guff, he’d just point him in their direction.</p>

      <p><em>Yes… I suppose this will work out in time.</em></p>

      <p>He had received more than enough of an education, as the heir to a marquis family. He may not have realized it, but his performance was hardly unsatisfactory. It might have been a slog at times, but as Minitz saw it, he was capable enough out on the field. So he decided to bounce Caligulio’s jab back at him.</p>

      <p>“Don’t make me laugh, Mr. Secretary of the Military… And I’ll remind you that <em>you’re</em> the only surviving division commander left, so you got a lot of work to do.”</p>

      <p>Under Emperor Masayuki, the Empire’s military would undergo a massive round of reform. If Minitz took the cabinet position of prime minister, the current one would become deputy prime minister. Secretary of the Military was on the same level as that.</p>

      <p>Masayuki didn’t know much about government, but he did remember the importance of having a civilian politician oversee the country’s military affairs. He mentioned that to his new assistants, and that was immediately reflected in the new system. In fact, though, all he said was “Don’t we need a minister controlling the army?” He didn’t order it, and he hadn’t postulated any kind of grand theory about a civilian-appointed minister holding supreme authority over the military. As a result, the Secretary of the Military was still selected from among the army’s commanders, a somewhat skewed take on the idea—and now Caligulio was now both secretary and commander of the army.</p>

      <p>That was the concern behind Minitz’s observation, but Caligulio laughed it off. “No need to worry about that. We won’t have a war for a while to come—and besides, as long as <em>I’m</em> running the army, I won’t rattle my saber at any foreign country.”</p>

      <p>Those were his honest, resignation-tinged feelings.</p>

      <p>Given the geography of the Empire, there were no longer any <a id="page-215"></a>neighboring states they could war with. The Jura-Tempest Federation and the demon lord Milim’s domain were off-limits, of course. Fighting the Armed Nation of Dwargon at this point was unthinkable; the dwarves were backing them at the moment, and they needed to build and maintain a peaceable friendship with them. An airship invasion of the Western Nations was plausible enough, but it was doubtful the demon lord Rimuru would ever allow it. There really was no adversary left for them to point their spears at. The only ones were already within their borders—the powerful nobles that controlled the regional militaries, who might not know their place and could potentially be plotting rebellions as they spoke.</p>

      <p>“We’ve already sent word across the Empire. The nobles should be replying soon, but have you heard from Krishna?”</p>

      <p>“He hasn’t made any notable moves yet. Your brother’s factions have all sworn their loyalty to the new emperor, and I think that’s keeping the other factions in check for now.”</p>

      <p>“Well, even if the nobles did reply, it’d be the same thing. I don’t think it’ll be enough to silence the sons of the emperor before Ludora, or the families with blood relations to him.”</p>

      <p>“I’m sure. We just sent out word that Emperor Ludora has passed away, so I’m sure some people will mistakenly assume their turn’s approaching. That would only come with Lady Velgrynd’s consent, of course, but…”</p>

      <p>“They’ll likely allege that the imperial household law no longer has any teeth and should be ignored. The fools don’t even realize how angry that’ll make Lady Velgrynd.”</p>

      <p>Caligulio thought Minitz was right. The idea of rebellious nobles refusing to fall in line with this new emperor didn’t scare him at all, frankly. His and Caligulio’s victory was all but assured. The real problem was the hit the nation would take power-wise.</p>

      <p>The faker who’d taken the place of Emperor Ludora (not that Caligulio thought he was that, given how he’d been serving him his whole life) had been in cahoots with an unknown invader called the Aggressors and attempted to throw the world into chaos. They had fought one of their leaders, a man who called himself Cornu, so they knew full well what the threat was. Velgrynd had come along <a id="page-216"></a>to save the day, but if not for her, the whole Empire would have fallen. The being that had once been Emperor Ludora had wanted powers along the lines of a god’s, after all; they couldn’t dismiss the possibility that he’d seek to use the Empire’s people as pawns in this endeavor.</p>

      <p>Of course, nobody but a few people in the Empire knew what the emperor’s face looked like, so if someone claimed to be Emperor Ludora, they could just reject him posthaste. The enemy wasn’t likely to try something sneaky like that, after all. The Ludora that Caligulio knew was never one to open diplomatic talks with his enemies.</p>

      <p>“Now is certainly no time for the nation to be fighting amongst itself.”</p>

      <p>“No, it is not. I’ll put out some feelers along those lines.”</p>

      <p>“If you could, thanks. I want to gather up the remaining Imperial Knights and reorganize the Imperial Guardian force at once.”</p>

      <p>This would be Caligulio’s first big job as Secretary of the Military, and it was more difficult than even he could have imagined. He had to begin, for one, by figuring out just how many of them had survived. Caligulio didn’t even know exactly what missions the Imperial Knights were assigned to. Their locations were unknown, so before anything, he had to get in contact with them all.</p>

      <p>Some would want to leave the force, no doubt. Krishna was one of them. He was practically worshipping the demon lord Rimuru as a god, and he had already declared his intentions to quit his post and go live in Tempest. Caligulio had asked him to remain in service until things calmed down—he was too good of a man to lose—but he seemed ready to defy that order the moment he had a chance.</p>

      <p>It was Adalmann who ultimately stepped in. “It’s important,” he advised Krishna, “to clean up your own messes. If you leave while the Empire is still in a state of chaos, I’m sure it would sadden Sir Rimuru as well.”</p>

      <p>“Yes!” Krishna shouted back. “That was an extremely convincing argument, Sir Adalmann. The only thought on my mind was that I have been saved…but I need to bring Sir Rimuru’s mercy to the ears of all the Empire’s innocent citizens!”</p>

      <p><a id="page-217"></a>That wasn’t exactly the reaction Caligulio had expected, but Krishna was back at his post and hard at work, so he left it at that. No point dwelling on the details.</p>

      <p>But Krishna was far from the only officer looking for a change of career. A hefty percentage of the Empire’s soldiers were starting to voice a desire to remain in Tempest. Caligulio understood their feelings, and he didn’t want to force anyone to come back…but any further defections could affect the Empire’s future ability to fight, so clearly they needed to ponder this issue a little. A large number of people had died in this war. They’d had it coming, more or less, and it wasn’t a problem worth rehashing, but that didn’t mean they could simply ignore this problem.</p>

      <p>The only Single Digits still alive, for one, were Bernie and Jiwu—just two in all. They would be directly answerable to Masayuki from here on, serving as his bodyguards. Velgrynd would have been more than enough on that front, perhaps, but they’d doubtlessly be helpful as advisers or go-to contacts for smaller missions, so Masayuki’s request had been approved.</p>

      <p>Caligulio saw fit to take advantage of all this to reorganize how the Imperial Guardians were set up. It would depend on how many surviving Guardians there were, but he didn’t see a need to stick to the set number of one hundred. He intended to do away with the ranking duel system entirely; to him, numbers shouldn’t be allowed to be so important among the soldiers. If they were strong enough and absolutely loyal to the emperor, he didn’t mind opening the doors a little wider for them.</p>

      <p>His plan called for them to be deployed in groups of three across the Empire’s cities, firming up the imperial defense. Three in one place might not be enough to defeat a high-level Aggressor, but they could buy a lot of time anyway. Ideally they would remain highly mobile, covering each other and providing backup. The Empire had more than a hundred cities, though, so they needed a lot more personnel. The regional forces were still intact, however, which was why the Guardians could work with them to cover matters for the time being.</p>

      <p>Either way, the Guardians would continue as a going concern, <a id="page-218"></a>built mainly around Enlightened-class warriors and kept prepared for future combat.</p>

      <p>“It’s an uphill battle for both of us, isn’t it?” muttered Minitz as he finished his drink.</p>

      <p>“Yeah,” replied Caligulio. “But it feels oddly worth it, too.”</p>

      <p>This was a passing observation, but he meant it. Thinking he was working to better the Empire, as opposed to just trying to earn a higher rank, made the days a lot more fulfilling.</p>

      <p>“Plus, now that I’ve heard Lord Rimuru’s plans, we need to restore order and stabilize the government immediately. If we’re late on this, we’ll be left behind by the rest of the world.”</p>

      <p>With Rimuru and Masayuki’s approval, rail-laying work had already begun. In likely just a few more years, the Empire would enjoy a future where they were fully connected to the rail network. Even the little bit that had been discussed at the conference made Caligulio quiver, but that was far from all.</p>

      <p>“And, you know, what about our plan to rule the world’s skies? I mean, that demon lord is ridiculous. He said it while we were all drinking, but I’m informed that he physically <em>cannot</em> get inebriated. He meant every word of it.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, Zamdo was quite excited as well. He even offered his personal assistance for the project. He’s really more an engineer than a soldier, though, so I’m sure that’s where his interests lie.”</p>

      <p>“So we’ll have these ‘magitrains’ connecting every nation on the surface, and then we’ll begin mass-producing our airships and build a stable market for them… It’s a scary thing for someone like him to come up with, but I think we can make it happen. After all, the only reparations he sought after the war’s end were the rights to our airspace. He didn’t ask for anything else! In fact, he’s helping us rebuild. How could we ever turn him down?”</p>

      <p>“Indeed. His Majesty Masayuki gave the go-ahead as well, so that’s not a problem, either. It’s what happens in the future that matters the most.”</p>

      <p>Caligulio thought to himself as he spoke. Something about Tempest just didn’t add up to him. The words of the demon lord Rimuru—words that sounded like he was making things up as he <a id="page-219"></a>went along—would be placed into concrete, executable plans by the next day, or even later that evening.</p>

      <p>He had apparently considered a plan to mass-produce airships ever since he’d known the Empire had them, but he was ready to provide an R &amp; D base for the project immediately, which was unheard of. An entire floor of the dungeon was now serving as a hangar for airship repairs and upgrades.</p>

      <p>Zamdo was having the time of his life working there. He’d been given free rein to order whatever materials he wanted without worrying about a budget, which put him in the habit of saying things like “So heaven exists right here after all!” on a regular basis. He was already amped up after surviving what he had, and this only added to his intensity. It made Caligulio jealous, seeing all of Zamdo’s desires fulfilled like that, but he had to cheer Zamdo on. He would need to work hard if Tempest and the Empire wanted to retain friendly ties.</p>

      <p>But enough about him. It was time to discuss their future.</p>

      <p>The demon lord Rimuru’s proposal offered broad support for upgrading infrastructure around the Empire. Having just been badly defeated, there was no way they could say no to that. The Empire could certainly provide its own labor, so they didn’t have to rely on Tempest for everything. Caligulio’s thoughts were very different from the Western Nations’ on that front. As long as he wasn’t clouded by his own desire, he was capable of intelligent, impartial decisions.</p>

      <p>Along those lines, he concluded that what the Empire needed the most at the moment was the restoration of domestic order. The Empire wasn’t in a state of disarray at all, but once the details behind their defeat became known, it would undoubtedly shock their citizens. Rimuru would be seen as the hateful enemy of anyone who’d lost their family, of course. Krishna and other officers were working to stave that off, but Caligulio needed to tackle the issue as well.</p>

      <p>Also, as Minitz warily pointed out, the more powerful nobles were making ominous-looking moves. They would need to welcome Tempestian forces into their empire for the sake of future <a id="page-220"></a>development, but they couldn’t afford to let that lead to disputes, no matter what.</p>

      <p>There was a mountain of problems to address.</p>

      <p>“Yeah. But you know, Caligulio…”</p>

      <p>“What?”</p>

      <p>“Don’t you think the demon lord Rimuru has it much worse than we do?”</p>

      <p>“Mmm?”</p>

      <p>A moment of thought, and Caligulio felt Minitz was right. They had been told about all these plans for future development, and they were just beginning to put in the hours to make them happen. But that went without saying. Things like restoring order and developing your home nation aren’t things you do because you’re ordered to. You beaver away at it daily because you want to make your home a better place. They were facing an unavoidable battle with the Aggressors sometime soon…but, as they’d just realized, they weren’t all that nervous about it. They had too much work to handle in the meantime, burying and dissipating any potential anxieties.</p>

      <p>“You think he’s trying to have us not worry about it?”</p>

      <p>“I’m sure, yeah. But maybe that’s not all. It could be that the demon lord wants to handle the Aggressors with his nation alone. That or he doesn’t see them as a major problem, but…”</p>

      <p>Of course it was a problem. But the demon lord Rimuru was more focused on his grand future plans than any of that stuff. Caligulio and Minitz admired how bold a leader he was, and King Gazel likely felt the same way. The whole way Rimuru acted around them indicated that he didn’t see the Aggressors as much to sweat about. Maybe it was just a bluff, or maybe he really <em>did</em> feel that way. Caligulio did think he was just trying to keep them from worrying themselves sick, but even so, he had to agree with Minitz.</p>

      <p><em>If he’s seriously thinking about dealing with the Aggressors by himself, we’ll need to find a way to assist him. At the very least, we need to prevent any attempt at an internal revolt. We can’t have anyone dragging him down like that.</em></p>

      <p>Caligulio was ready to serve his leader.</p>

      <p class="space-break"><a id="page-221"></a>So the two of them left the club after drinking for around an hour. The next day, they put Masayuki up on his palanquin and set off for home.</p>

      <p class="tx1">The moment he reached the capital, Caligulio was swamped with work.</p>

      <p>Some regions of the city had been damaged during the war, but there was no need to think about rebuilding immediately. They planned to work on that in tandem with Rimuru and the Tempestians later on. No, the first order of business was reorganizing the military. All surviving (or resurrected) soldiers and officers were now safely back in the Empire, and he quickly gave them new duties. Maintaining order was top priority, so he kept an eye on Krishna’s reports and sent soldiers out to any region facing unrest.</p>

      <p>Fortunately for him, some seven hundred thousand soldiers and officers remained loyal to him. Even those who wished to move to Tempest were being cooperative with this effort; Rimuru, after all, had promised them jobs after the turmoil had subsided. “Don’t make up your mind right now,” he told a large group of them assembled at the coliseum. “Just take your time and think it over, okay?” That’s what he said after Rigurd came out and presented a fairly detailed immigration plan to them all.</p>

      <p>Rimuru wasn’t trying to convince any of them, hoping instead to respect their individual desires. But the two-hundred-thousand-odd potential immigrants in the audience were pretty enthusiastic about the news.</p>

      <p>“Aggressors? We’ll rip those guys apart!”</p>

      <p>Certainly, they were ready for a fight. And while they had lost the power in their souls, they still had their surgically enhanced bodies. Some of them still merited an A rank, so they were nothing to sniff at.</p>

      <p>So Caligulio wanted to figure out any way he could to keep the <a id="page-222"></a>imperial capital peaceful. But then a bigger problem popped up. The <em>real</em> thorn in his side, as he’d predicted, was the nobility.</p>

      <p>Nobles from up and down were demanding an audience with him, putting a damper on his work. He wanted to turn them all down, but some of them were big names whose support he wanted for future purposes. Minitz’s overtures and Krishna’s military coercion did what they were asked for as well, preventing any major crises from developing, but it certainly took a lot of stamina from Caligulio.</p>

      <p>Just then, though, the demon lord Rimuru sent over a lifesaver—Testarossa, that most beautiful of demons.</p>

      <p>The first job Testarossa took was delivering a speech to win over the masses; a talk that would soothe the frayed nerves of a shocked, defeated populace while fully ignoring the nobles. Caligulio worried that this was no job for a demon, a race practically born to strike fear in people’s hearts. But he didn’t need to, surprisingly enough. Demons lived off people’s emotions, and if you wanted to cleanly remove the terror and anxieties from the minds of an entire populace, they were the most qualified group you could find.</p>

      <p>“What a surprise. Here you are—Blanc, or Lady Testarossa, who put the Empire through so much pain and strife…and look at how much you clearly care for our people…”</p>

      <p>“Why wouldn’t I? That is the job assigned to me by Sir Rimuru, our overlord.”</p>

      <p>“Well, yes, naturally, but I was expecting you to be rougher…or, I’m sorry, I mean that I didn’t think you’d take such a reserved, moderate approach.”</p>

      <p>Caligulio chose his words carefully around her, sweating. He regretted being too honest, but Testarossa didn’t let it bother her.</p>

      <p>“We can’t afford to have Sir Rimuru gain a bad reputation around here, after all. Of course I’d be more careful with how I hold myself…but that winds up thinning out the effect, too. Trying to strike the right balance is tough, you know? If you eat up <em>all</em> of someone’s emotions, that usually has a bad effect on them in some way.”</p>

      <p>The observation made Caligulio wince. He certainly didn’t want <a id="page-223"></a>that…but Testarossa wouldn’t make that sort of rookie mistake. She had ordered Moss to keep close track of her underlings, so success was basically a given.</p>

      <p>But she had a point, too. Taking the moderate approach made it difficult to fully control the emotions of a crowd. Between having lost close relatives in battle and a new emperor, many of the Empire’s citizens were simply too frazzled to remain calm. Not all their sadness had gone away, and the buds of anxiety and dissent were still there to grow. Caligulio had peacekeeping forces in place at key places around the city, ensuring that any rioting or conflict was prevented before it could begin.</p>

      <p>“If anyone defied you, it would be a lot cleaner and easier to just kill their whole clan, but…”</p>

      <p>“Ha…ha-ha-ha… Very funny…”</p>

      <p><em>She wasn’t joking,</em> Caligulio thought. It made him respect Rimuru, the one who’d sent Testarossa over, all the more. Blanc <em>always</em> meant business.</p>

      <p>So, in time, the citizens began to simmer down, with none of them foolish enough to attempt an armed rebellion. Seeing things progress to this point was a relief, but Testarossa already had other ideas in mind. She decided that, as the most effective and quickest way to provide mental care for the people, they had best introduce the new emperor Masayuki to them before long—in other words, stage a coronation. If he could give a speech as well, Testarossa reasoned, the citizens would view it as the legitimate dawn of a new era.</p>

      <p>“Huh? Me?!”</p>

      <p>“Is that a problem?”</p>

      <p>“No… Never mind…”</p>

      <p>Masayuki gratefully accepted the idea. There were tears in his eyes, but they were meaningless before Testarossa’s smile.</p>

      <p>“Oh? What are you doing, making Masayuki cry like that?”</p>

      <p>It was Velgrynd who butted in.</p>

      <p>“My,” Testarossa calmly replied, “what a regrettable way to put it. I’m not into <em>that</em> sort of play at all.”</p>

      <p>The two beauties exchanged smiles. Their gazes smashed into each other, creating a fearsome pressure in the room.</p>

      <p><a id="page-224"></a>It was Masayuki and Caligulio who took the brunt of it. Masayuki held out, praying that he could leave soon. Caligulio, on the other hand, tried a little impromptu meditation, easing his heart to overcome this storm. But no matter what either of them truly wished for, the coronation was now a done deal.</p>

      <p class="space-break">Countless citizens completely occupied the main square in front of the imperial palace. Masayuki was there, looking down at them from a balcony on one of its highest floors.</p>

      <p>He had come here via Velgrynd’s teleportation, making this basically his first public appearance in the Empire. He was now dressed as an emperor should be, and as long as he kept his mouth shut, one could perhaps detect an air of dignity about him if they squinted hard enough.</p>

      <p>The appointed time was here. Caligulio began things with a few opening words, followed by Minitz, the prime minister, offering a rundown of recent events. The Empire had faced a major defeat, and as a result, the previous emperor Ludora had passed away. The new emperor, Masayuki the Hero, had already been crowned, and through his actions, peace had been reached with Tempest; they would build a friendly relationship going forward, and they had also opened official relations with the Dwarven Kingdom. And so on.</p>

      <p>In order to prevent a recurrence of Michael’s Castle Guard skill, they needed to convince the people that Ludora was at the root of all the Empire’s problems. If they could refer to him as dead and reduce the number of his believers, that’d be even better. That was the context behind introducing Masayuki as the new emperor, but a large number of people had trouble swallowing this, openly asking why someone not even related by blood was taking the throne. Velgrynd stepped up to answer them.</p>

      <p>“Please quiet down, you silly fools. My <em>name</em> is Velgrynd. Velgrynd the Cardinal.”</p>

      <p>Hearing the name of the Empire’s guardian dragon gave every one of its citizens pause. <em>Could it be?</em> they all thought in unison.</p>

      <p><a id="page-225"></a>“By the laws of our imperial household, I hereby name Masayuki the Hero as our new emperor!”</p>

      <p>As she spoke, Velgrynd unleashed her overwhelming dominance. An almost visible wave rolled over the audience—the famed “cardinal aura,” its divinity clear as day in anyone’s eyes. Then, like it was an afterthought, she motioned in a certain direction, speaking to the people.</p>

      <p>“Behold, as we salute our new emperor!”</p>

      <p>The moment she fell silent, the Divine Aerie of Fire began to spew lava. The massive volcanic eruption was easily visible from the center of the city. It was a little <em>too</em> gigantic to be called a “salute,” and while it was akin to playing with matches to Velgrynd, it shocked the common citizens speechless. Now there was no doubting it. Some of them might have had doubts—maybe they’d set things up in advance, employing magic or explosives to trigger the eruption—but it was a divine, sacred mountain doing the erupting. Engineering that without the permission of the Flame Dragon who called it home would lead to wrath too horrible to picture. No one who called this capital home would ever have attempted anything so stupid.</p>

      <p>And that wasn’t all. Several bolts of molten lava shot out from the volcanic crater, reaching all the way to the capital—but they were all deflected by an invisible protective wall. It could be nothing but their guardian dragon in action.</p>

      <p>“M-my god…”</p>

      <p>“It’s her. The dragon god herself!”</p>

      <p>“Our empire’s guardian dragon has manifested herself before our very eyes!!”</p>

      <p>The excitement was palpable. As time passed, they began to realize just how monumental these events were. Velgrynd herself had given her approval. At long last, they realized that Masayuki the Hero was now truly their emperor. And while Masayuki’s center of popularity still lay in the Western Nations, he was also well known around the Empire.</p>

      <p>“Whoa, whoa, are you serious?!”</p>

      <p><a id="page-226"></a>“You mean <em>Lightspeed</em> Masayuki?!”</p>

      <p>“Isn’t Masayuki the most powerful of Heroes the world has ever seen? Hell, no wonder the demon lord Rimuru couldn’t say no to him!”</p>

      <p>Praise was raining down, as if read off a script by a team of talented actors. That was Masayuki’s power for you. He was famous everywhere—and now his unique skill had been powered up, extending over a broader range and having untold impacts on everyone that knew him. The result was the sort of cheering he had grown accustomed to.</p>

      <p><em>“Maaaa-sa-yu-ki! Maaaa-sa-yu-kiiiii!!”</em></p>

      <p>It was in perfect harmony, like the voice of every imperial subject was united as one. <em>That’s</em> Emperor <em>Masayuki to you, sillies</em>, Velgrynd thought—but the emperor himself didn’t seem to mind, so she let it slide.</p>

      <p>If anyone was truly livid about this, it was Testarossa. The citizens had the completely wrong idea that Rimuru wouldn’t dare try to cross Masayuki, a thought that made her furious to the core—but she was the one who’d inadvertently led them to that conclusion. She couldn’t complain about it to anyone here, so she just had to smile and put up with it.</p>

      <p>So Masayuki now had the people on his side. It went far easier than anyone had anticipated, and thanks to that, the name of the “divinely ordained” emperor of the Nasca Namrium Ulmeria United Eastern Empire became known to the entire world.</p>

      <p class="tx1">The capital’s residents, driven by new hope, regained their old energy. The pain of those who’d lost loved ones wouldn’t be forgotten that easily, but even they were now taking new steps, moving on with their lives. The normal routine was returning, and to Caligulio, nothing could have been more joyful to see.</p>

      <p>But there was still a long way to go before he could truly relax. With the emperor having been officially named, those bothersome nobles were starting to show signs of activity.</p>

      <p><a id="page-227"></a>The nobles were Minitz’s duty, and Caligulio wanted to palm off all responsibility for them on him—but that was just him being selfish, and the nobles didn’t care who they reached out to as long as they were connected to the new emperor. That’s why he kept getting hounded for appointments.</p>

      <p>He looked toward Testarossa for help. “This nation’s nobles?” she matter-of-factly replied. “I don’t think the great majority of them are any big problem.” Caligulio didn’t know what she meant, but he interpreted this to mean that Testarossa was making some key below-the-surface moves for him. Minitz was doing his job as well, so Caligulio decided to focus on what he could do instead.</p>

      <p>Then, before even a few days had passed, the requests for audiences began to dwindle.</p>

      <p>“Um, excuse me, Lady Testarossa, but…”</p>

      <p>He assumed she was intimidating them into submission, but was too timid to ask. This stately lady elegantly enjoying some tea before him was Blanc, a demon feared by the Empire for ages. He still found that hard to believe, but it was the unvarnished truth. And no matter what vile, terrorizing methods she’d used, he wouldn’t find it strange at all.</p>

      <p>“Oh? Well, that’s mean. Why are you looking at me like I just threatened your life? I haven’t done anything bad to you.”</p>

      <p>All villains think that way—that they’re different, somehow. Caligulio suddenly felt very small, even though he was in his own office; it’d be impossible for him to say anything like “how could I <em>not</em> be afraid” to this virtual queen of the underworld.</p>

      <p>“No, um, ha-ha-ha, I don’t have any suspicions about you or anything. I’m thankful every day for all the help you provide me. I was simply wondering what sort of methods you employed to keep the nobility at bay…”</p>

      <p>“I’d prefer if you didn’t worry about that and just stuck to your own work, please.” Testarossa took a sip of tea, then let out an elegant little sigh. “But all right. I’d feel guilty if I took <em>all</em> the credit for it, so I’ll tell you. Let me begin with the conclusion: The nobles weren’t any problem at all.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, but <em>why</em>, is what I was curious about…”</p>

      <p><a id="page-228"></a>“First, the nobles of this empire are divided into three large factions. You’re aware of that, of course?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, my lady. There’s the military faction, led by Minitz’s brother, the marquis. There’s the ‘old money’ faction, which plays a central rule in the emperor’s support…and finally, there are the countryside nobles.”</p>

      <p>The military was the keystone of the Empire, one of its largest organizations, and many nobles tried to curry favor with this unmovable institution. That made them one of the largest, most powerful factions, but despite the fact that a marquis (two ranks down from the top) was leading it, relatively few of its members were from high nobility. The “old money” faction, on the other hand, mainly consisted of the sort of highly connected nobles that had links to the emperor. They symbolized the concentration of power among their ranks; if you weren’t at least an earl, you wouldn’t even have a chance to speak in public among them. The regional nobles, meanwhile, were the least organized, just a rabble who’d come together because they wouldn’t be allowed to speak up as individuals. They were only a group at all because they happened to share the same goals, and little more.</p>

      <p>Testarossa nodded at Caligulio’s rundown. “Right, exactly. Now, starting with the military faction…Minitz already has them wrapped around his finger, doesn’t he?”</p>

      <p>“No, no, he and his brother aren’t getting along very well—”</p>

      <p>“Oh? Not really. He was just all pouty, is all.”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>“He had his elder brother take the marquis title for him, and he found the responsibility to be crushing. He was just rebelling a bit—getting to grips with his position while still retaining his good name.”</p>

      <p>Testarossa smiled a bit.</p>

      <p>“It’s something weak people do all the time.”</p>

      <p>“Is that true, my lady? How did you even find that out…?”</p>

      <p>“Not telling, sorry. You’ve heard the expression ‘what you don’t know can’t hurt you,’ haven’t you?”</p>

      <p>The truth was that Moss had investigated all that in a single <a id="page-229"></a>night. He had no free time, what with Testarossa using and abusing him; really, despite being a Demon Peer and lauded as the “King of Ash,” he arguably had it the worst out of anyone in Tempest. But he had no one to complain to, so he just kept his head down and dealt with the harsh work conditions that were placed upon him.</p>

      <p>Moss had snuck into the marquis’s residence and read through the journal hidden in his office. He’d then informed Testarossa of the secrets he’d found inside.</p>

      <p>Even the marquis’s strict security may as well have not existed, as far as Moss was concerned. He’d also uncovered a few useful tidbits of information that could help improve their relations; these he casually dropped in Minitz’s lap. This was clearly a criminal act, but to someone who didn’t have a clear understanding of what “bad” was, it barely counted as a crime.</p>

      <p>“Ah yes, ha-ha-ha. I’ll trust in you, then, Lady Testarossa. It’d be boorish of me to inquire further, wouldn’t it?”</p>

      <p>Caligulio ran from the question. It was a smart decision. Whatever the background circumstances were, Minitz was on his way to patching things up with his brother—and if so, all was well. Best to just focus on the final results.</p>

      <p>“All right. So that’s the military faction. What about the others?”</p>

      <p>“Well, the countryside nobles demonstrated to me that they’re ready to submit to you.”</p>

      <p>“Huh? Since when?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, they fell in place immediately. The most important thing to them, after all, is that people can live in peace without starving. The Empire’s rural areas are well stabilized by now, so the only concerns they had left were about our political direction.”</p>

      <p>“I—I see…”</p>

      <p>“And by the way, do you know how the rural nobles fund themselves?”</p>

      <p>“Well, mainly with the crops they harvest in each region. They retain what they need, pay their taxes, and then sell the remainder to their affiliated merchants. The revenue from that keeps the regional lords funded…is how I understand it.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, that’s mostly right, but you’re wrong on one aspect.”</p>
