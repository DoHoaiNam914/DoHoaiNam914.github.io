      <p><a id="page-31"></a>Um… I think the air’s shifting around Gob’emon, too. Now I was concerned we weren’t going to hold a business meeting at all…but the next moment, Don Gabbana strode in, as if on cue.</p>

      <p class="tx1">“Alecchio, <em>what</em> are you doing?”</p>

      <p>“Oops. Sorry, boss. I was just saying hello to an old acquaintance of mine.”</p>

      <p>“You were? Hmm. But isn’t that man over there hurt? Here, use this.”</p>

      <p>What a farce. The bad guy kicking up the dust, and the good guy swooping in to calm things down. Gabbana’s trying to make me owe him a favor, ain’t he? And keeping my head underwater all the while, I might add.</p>

      <p>Alecchio, no doubt having picked up on this, sprinkled the healing potion on Bydd without further complaint. That was bound to leave a stain on his suit—but, whoa, it immediately repaired his ear. Only a Full Potion could have been <em>that</em> effective.</p>

      <p>“Ohhhh! Just imagine, using an invaluable Full Potion on someone <em>that</em> low-born!”</p>

      <p>“Sir Gabbana never fails to amaze! Why, I suppose even a secret elixir worth a fortune in itself is a trifling matter to him!”</p>

      <p>“Indeed, indeed. With Alecchio’s muscle and Gabbana’s riches, they make a practically invincible team, no?”</p>

      <p>Hearing all this chitchat from the gallery was doing little to lift my spirits. I felt a pall over my mind. Things had suddenly grown very ominous, like I had just awoken from a nightmare.</p>

      <p>I shot a glance at Bydd, and he was frozen in place. I could only guess he felt the same way I did. I mean, come on! We had grown used to having Full Potions around, mind you. Whenever Bydd had some spare time, he’d go up to Gob’emon and ask for a little training, and I couldn’t tell you how many arms and legs he might lose in the process…in a single day, no less. No way he’d be alive without our Full Potions.</p>

      <p>Thanks to that, we couldn’t imagine life without these potions, <a id="page-32"></a>really. Only when I overheard the conversation around me did I realize all over again just how lucky we really were.</p>

      <p>“Ah, and look! Look at the shining badge on Gabbana’s breast!”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I can see it, too. That seal on it is glowing a little.”</p>

      <p>“It is! That means it’s made of real magisteel, you know.”</p>

      <p>“No doubt about it. It’s just like the rumors say. That up-and-coming group, absorbing one criminal mob after another. That’s who that seal belongs to…”</p>

      <p>Pulled in by the appreciative crowd, I stole a look at Don Gabbana. What I saw shocked me. There, shining on his left breast, was a familiar coat of arms—three snakes intertwined with each other.</p>

      <p>How would I not recognize it? We only spent three bloody days bickering over its design. I think Sir Rimuru kicked it off by saying, <em>“Why don’t we go with snakes? Better to keep it simple, I’d say, instead of bothering with dragons and whatnot. Snakes symbolize knowledge, and greed, and eternity and stuff, so it’d be perfect for REG.”</em> Then Big Mama countered with <em>“That’s right, and snakes can signify drunkenness as well, which</em> we <em>certainly identify with,” and then I was all “Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! In that case, let’s have three entwined snakes, all entangled like</em> we <em>are after the eighth refill!”</em></p>

      <p>Yes, this was clearly the seal of REG, and while I didn’t know all our employees personally, should I have taken this to believe that REG had absorbed Don Gabbana’s group…?</p>

      <p>Instantly, I felt like a fool for acting so scared. This was a chance, not a threat—I could use old Gabbana here as a foil to show people exactly what sort of position I was in.</p>

      <p>“You, I believe, are president of the Gabbana Merchant Group, right? How do you intend to atone for this incident?”</p>

      <p>“Pardon me?”</p>

      <p>“Ah, you’re oblivious to the facts, then? You gravely injured one of my bodyguards. Bydd here, you see, refused to play along with that rabble-rouser because this is meant to be a serious business meeting—and look what your man did in response!”</p>

      <p>“…<em>What</em> did you call me?”</p>

      <p>Heh-heh-heh… This is <em>so</em> wonderful. Both servant and master were befuddled by my return salvo.</p>

      <p><a id="page-33"></a>“Wh-who’s that man daring to defy Gabbana?!”</p>

      <p>“He’s affiliated with REG—you know, that shadowy group!”</p>

      <p>“That’s right. And I hear REG’s even brought a certain well-known armed group into its fold. But look at <em>this</em> man!”</p>

      <p>“He’s certainly in a hurry to die, I assume. Or does he have something up his sleeve?”</p>

      <p>“Are you telling me this Four Nations Trade Alliance has the power to openly compete with REG?!”</p>

      <p>Our audience was getting on my nerves, but being the center of attention wasn’t a bad thing for me right now. Not that I had time to bask in it.</p>

      <p>“…You’re a dead man.”</p>

      <p>“Hold on, Alecchio, hold on. Not here. Besides, there’s no fun in <em>merely</em> killing anyone.”</p>

      <p>“If you say so, boss. I’ll tackle him later…”</p>

      <p>Better do something about these two men threatening me before handling anything else. “Quiet, all of you!” I shouted—my voice smooth as butter, not quavering at all. I could sense that I was back in my element.</p>

      <p>It hardly seemed believable that I’d feared Alecchio a moment ago. I mean, I spend all day discussing matters with people (and monsters…actually, mostly monsters) far scarier than this. Don Gabbana would seem like less than a flea to Sir Veldora—he could release just a little bit of his aura, and the man would be a pile of dust. Perhaps Alecchio could withstand that, but it’d still be no competition. Anyone who even thought about bringing harm to Sir Veldora would immediately cease to exist.</p>

      <p><em>That’s</em> how scary he is, and I deal with him on a near-daily basis. I’ve even put my foot down with him, steadfastly refusing his requests for a raise in allowance. Besides, the town I now call home is practically crawling with magic-born rated a Calamity-level threat or higher, and I’m managing all their finances, aren’t I? Here they were, these titans who could single-handedly level a smaller kingdom, and they were sheepishly plodding out of my office after I yelled at them for demanding a budget increase. <em>That’s</em> what my regular life has become.</p>

      <p><a id="page-34"></a>This reminded me of a chat I had with Cien a fair while ago.</p>

      <p><em>“I tell you, Testarossa’s talented, she works fast, and she couldn’t be more help to me. Beautiful, too. I’m rather jealous of you, Cien!”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Huh? Oh my… Ha-ha-ha. You’re a very funny person, Sir Mjöllmile. I haven’t laughed this hard in a while!”</em></p>

      <p>That <em>was</em> a hearty laugh, considering how calm and levelheaded he usually was. After that, we managed to strike up a friendship for whatever reason, enough so that we’d go out for drinks now and again.</p>

      <p>The way he put it, Testarossa was a truly fearsome demon. I suppose she doesn’t let on much with me—she’s usually so elegant, with that lovely soft smile, so I never thought of her as scary at all. But I knew all about the events leading up to her takeover of the Council, so I always tried to be prudent in my behavior. <em>Sexual Harassment Is a Crime!</em>—that’s one of our office’s slogans, you know.</p>

      <p>Regardless, I say all this to show that I have numerous kinds of crazy and amazing people constantly knocking on my door. Now that I’d recalled that, I had no reason at all to fear Don Gabbana or Alecchio.</p>

      <p>“You damned—!!”</p>

      <p>Both of them were fuming, faces red with fury, but I couldn’t have cared less. And I think even Bydd was picking up on this reality, too.</p>

      <p>“Hey, look, Mjöllmile’s too much of a gentleman to say it, so lemme spell it out for you—you better not talk to him like that, okay? Because I’m one thing, but <em>he’s</em> the sort of person you’d never <em>dream</em> of speaking to that way!”</p>

      <p>Look at him, egging them on. But the entire room’s eyes were on us now. We had the perfect stage. Let’s take Don Gabbana down and establish exactly where I stand around here.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="image" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">I flashed the room a bold smile. I’m not exactly useful in a fight, but I get a lot of compliments about how threatening I can make myself look.</p>

      <p><a id="page-35"></a>“Yes, Bydd is exactly right. Perhaps I shouldn’t have let things slide at first. Indeed, perhaps I should have given you the discipline you needed from the start.”</p>

      <p>“You’re absolutely correct, Mjöllmile. Then I wouldn’t have had to take his abuse and get my soddin’ ear talked off.”</p>

      <p>“Indeed, sorry about that. So, again, how should we settle this, Bydd?”</p>

      <p>“How about we start by receiving an apology, huh? Maybe we can reconsider if they show us the right attitude!”</p>

      <p>“Fair point, yes. So—Alecchio and Gabbana. If you apologize right now, I will pretend none of this happened. But if you insist on stirring the pot with me, well, that changes things, doesn’t it? Because by my name as Gard Mjöllmile, finance minister of the Jura-Tempest Federation and director of the Four Nations Trade Alliance, I promise you that I’m not afraid to fight! So what’ll it be, you two?!”</p>

      <p>I tried to grandstand as much as possible. Their faces stiffened.</p>

      <p>“God damn you…”</p>

      <p>“Hold on, Alecchio. Calm down. I think there might be a misunderstanding at work here, but if we did something to anger you, I will gladly apologize. You said your name was Gard?”</p>

      <p><em>“Gard?”</em></p>

      <p>“Ah, I mean, Sir Mjöllmile…”</p>

      <p>Don Gabbana didn’t like being corrected like this one bit. But so what? I’d already beaten him. This meeting hall was full of powerful merchants, supporting the financial fortunes of Englesia and many other nations—and now, in front of all these power brokers, Don Gabbana had to acknowledge who I was. I suppose he expected me to back down long ago, but he’d have to be disappointed. He was staring me down, his snakelike eyes full of murderous rage, but I wasn’t scared in the slightest. The old me might’ve given him a tearful apology, but I’ve grown since then, haven’t I?</p>

      <p>“Very good. So what am I misunderstanding, exactly?”</p>

      <p>I tried throwing Don Gabbana a life raft. He responded by bowing his head, exposing the throbbing blue veins on his temples.</p>

      <p>“It seems my bodyguard was out of line with you, causing you <a id="page-36"></a>trouble. I think he was a little too excited for his own good, so if you could overlook his behavior for me—”</p>

      <p>“Pardon? You think you can just smile and say sorry after seriously injuring someone? My man Bydd here suffered the shame of having his ear torn off, you realize?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, and I provided a potion so he—”</p>

      <p><em>“Ha!”</em></p>

      <p>I tried to scoff as loudly as I could.</p>

      <p>“And you think that cheap drug can smooth all this over? That tells me all I need to know about you!”</p>

      <p>Sir Rimuru, worrywart that he is, provides me with enough Full Potions that I actually carry several on my person as a habit. They <em>were</em> cheap to me—that much was no lie—so I kept going on the offensive.</p>

      <p>“Indeed, if <em>that’s</em> all the talent you have, I don’t think you have what it takes to join the vast project I planned to propose. Leave this chamber at once!”</p>

      <p>My thunderous voice made Don Gabbana wince. Then, in a cold, penetrating voice, he rumbled, “I hope you don’t regret this”—softly, so only I heard it—and took Alecchio out of the meeting hall.</p>

      <p>Complete victory was mine. The hall was deathly quiet, but the moment Don Gabbana disappeared from sight, cheers erupted—some for me, some not as much. The common sentiment, I’m sure, was that nobody expected someone like <em>me</em> to kick Don Gabbana out of this event.</p>

      <p>While I had people’s attention (and momentum was on my side), I decided to go right into my opening statement. I followed it by revealing the “make Blumund a logistical hub” plan Sir Rimuru and Veryard had discussed with me, successfully earning the interest of most of the audience.</p>

      <p>…Interest, yes, but I didn’t expect anyone to volunteer to join our plan right this moment. The reason was simple. I had just picked a fight with Don Gabbana, one of REG’s most public faces, and I’m sure they all expected a hit man would rub me out soon enough. If the main organizer was gone, well, they could all aim to become his <a id="page-37"></a>successor afterward—and besides, if the core of this plan was no longer breathing, the entire project itself was in danger of collapsing. It was nothing the merchants here would jump into that easily, I suppose.</p>

      <p>But that actually worked in my favor. Simply surviving today built people’s trust in me, after all. Plus, I was publicly pitting myself against <em>the</em> REG, and given that I was the “G” in that acronym, victory was all but guaranteed. So I gave them my pitch as fervently as I could, and saw my audience react with just the kind of excited enthusiasm I was hoping for.</p>

      <p class="tx1">The next morning, as we left our hotel, we spotted a carriage parked nearby, painted entirely black. Pretty gutsy move. This was a public place, you know.</p>

      <p>“Get in,” Alecchio growled at us. I grinned back at him as I climbed up, Bydd and Gob’emon leading the way. “…You sure got guts, you know that?” he said, blustering as he hopped in last, but he sounded like nothing but a sore loser to me.</p>

      <p>“So where are we going?”</p>

      <p>“Somewhere good. Enjoy the trip. It’ll be your last.”</p>

      <p>Alecchio said no more to me after that, so I followed his lead as the wagon clattered on.</p>

      <p class="space-break">We reached our destination after around twenty minutes. Judging by the distance from the hotel, we were likely in the city’s more affluent neighborhood—just as I thought. I breathed a sigh of relief. If I had been taken into Don Gabbana’s territory, that would have been cause for at least a little distress, but now there was nothing to fret about. No, we were at the location the Sons of the Veldt used as their Englesia headquarters. I had assisted with its renovation, so I knew the site well.</p>

      <p>“Okay, get out. You’ve got people more fearsome than you could imagine waiting for you. Ahhh, I can’t wait to see you piss your pants as you grovel for your life before them.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-38"></a>I turned a piteous eye on the ranting Alecchio. Honestly, I felt a little bad for him.</p>

      <p>“Hold on, you. Why’re you lookin’ at me like that?”</p>

      <p>“Mm? Well, fine, I’ll tell you. After all…”</p>

      <p>After all, it’d be over for him soon.</p>

      <p>“After all what, you bastard? What’re you talking about?”</p>

      <p>Even Alecchio had sensed something off about my attitude. I saw a little bit of concern on his face, even.</p>

      <p>Several men were milling about in front of the building before us. They ran up when the carriage stopped.</p>

      <p>“Alecchio,” one of them said, “I have a message.”</p>

      <p>“…What?”</p>

      <p>“We have some pretty high leadership waiting down below.”</p>

      <p>“High leadership? The Seven Blades?”</p>

      <p>“No…higher.”</p>

      <p>“Don’t tell me the elders from the Sage Cabal are here? Or the shadow forces of the Darksky Horde…”</p>

      <p>“These leaders are serving as guides.”</p>

      <p>“…The three bosses, then?!”</p>

      <p>Alecchio sounded pretty surprised, but I had never heard of any of these groups, so I couldn’t imagine who they referred to. I inferred they were all part of the Gabbana family, and probably new recruits, too. Not even I have a full grasp of all the groups REG now has under its umbrella—which is partly why we end up with unhappy events like these. But it’s not like the Western Nations had <em>this</em> many powerful gangs in the first place…</p>

      <p>“We’ve already guided Gabbana inside.”</p>

      <p>“Right. Let’s go.”</p>

      <p>So Alecchio, looking more tense than before, took us into the building.</p>

      <p class="space-break">We were going into the basement, and it was actually quite luxurious down there. The Sons of the Veldt used to have an altar, but we took all that out and converted it into an audience room. Sir Rimuru wanted a place with a lot of atmosphere, something befitting a shadowy secret cabal, and so we made no compromises on <a id="page-39"></a>any little detail. This may even be fancier than the chamber Sir Rimuru uses in Tempest to receive his finest guests. As that nation’s budgetary overseer, it’s my job to ensure we’re not wasting vast sums of money—but as REG, we’re just a bunch of criminals, and we can use our filthy lucre any darn way we like.</p>

      <p>“…And why are <em>you</em> so calm right now?” Alecchio asked, perhaps a tad anxious.</p>

      <p>“Well, who knows?” I replied.</p>

      <p>He clicked his tongue at that and said no more as we proceeded three floors down, finding ourselves in front of a large door.</p>

      <p>“Come in.”</p>

      <p>“V-Vigan? Of the Seven Blades? <em>You’re</em> guarding the door?”</p>

      <p>“Pfft. Alecchio, eh? I used to respect you, you know. I even thought about recommending you for a position in the Blades the next time we had an opening. Damn idiot.”</p>

      <p>“Wha—? Vigan?! What did I—?”</p>

      <p>“Just get your sorry hide in here!” Vigan glared at Alecchio’s servants. “And all of <em>you</em>, wait here for me. I’m only letting Alecchio and our guests in.”</p>

      <p>That was valid. Best to keep the number of people who knew I was one of the bosses to a minimum. I silently followed his orders.</p>

      <p>“…Here we go,” Alecchio said as he came in, the rest of us following. Vigan joined us at the rear, closing the door behind him. This door was magically enhanced, ensuring no conversations leaked out of this room—no matter what happened in here, no one on the outside would ever know.</p>

      <p>Despite being so deep down, the room was filled with dazzling light, the flames from an untold number of candles dancing around us. The candles were key, Sir Rimuru insisted, even if magic would be far easier. That kind of extravagance, he said, only adds to the allure.</p>

      <p>There were no real dividing walls down here, so it was more of a vast chamber than a room, really. That was why it could work as an audience chamber, but as a rule, only our top leaders ever went inside—in other words, the sort of people who knew my real identity. Right now, though, over half of the people occupying this <a id="page-40"></a>chamber were unfamiliar to me. There were nearly a hundred of these leaders, and they all kept their gazes on me as I strode into the chamber.</p>

      <p>“Hey!”</p>

      <p>Alecchio shouted to stop me. I ignored him. He attempted to place a hand on my shoulder, but Vigan kicked it away even before Bydd and Gob’emon could act. I suppose he had been briefed on me when he was assigned door-guard duty.</p>

      <p>The reaction from the management I didn’t know ran the gamut—some were surprised, while others looked simply befuddled. The leaders I <em>did</em> know all promptly took a knee in reverence, and seeing that must have made the truth dawn on the others, because they quickly followed suit.</p>

      <p>“N-no… S-Sir Mjöllmile is one of our bosses?!”</p>

      <p>Don Gabbana’s flustered yell rang across the quiet chamber. We kept the air cool down here, but with us being in such a vast underground room, his voice had an echo to it. Apparently he had just been delivering a speech to some of the people here, people I knew well. No doubt he’d been trying to convince them to kill me as a lesson, in order to show the Four Nations Trade Alliance exactly where it stood with him.</p>

      <p>“That’s right. The man you’ve just spent this entire time impassionately pleading with us to kill is one of our very own head honchos.”</p>

      <p>He was answered not by me, but by a figure in an eye-catching, revealing dress. This was Glenda Attley, an extremely talented woman who posed as the REG boss in our place, and what she just said confirmed all my suspicions about Gabbana. Funny how it seemed like they were talking about someone else, though, not me.</p>

      <p>“G-<em>gehhhhh</em>?!”</p>

      <p>The normally composed Don Gabbana could barely remain upright. Once upon a time he was a godlike figure to me; I never thought I’d witness him in such a sad state.</p>

      <p>“Well done, Glenda. Thanks to you, everything’s going well with our project. Our conference yesterday was a smashing success.”</p>

      <p>“Thank you very much for the compliment, boss! If you could bring my merit points into consideration as well…”</p>

      <p><a id="page-41"></a>“Certainly, certainly. I’ll provide you with double the usual.”</p>

      <p>“Well, how kind of you. I’m glad you’re so understanding!”</p>

      <p>Glenda guided me toward the platform that used to house the altar. We had three seats in a row up there, and I sat myself down on one of them.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="image" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">After seeing Glenda’s reaction to me, nobody in the room voiced any concern about me being their boss. That’s how much they all feared her, I suppose.</p>

      <p>And now, before my eyes, Don Gabbana and Alecchio were being held down, ready to be whisked away to their fates. One of them had publicly voiced a desire to have a boss killed; the other had treated me with the most abject of rudeness; and now we needed to figure out what to do with them.</p>

      <p>The other leaders were apparently unanimous in their agreement that the two of them should receive the death penalty.</p>

      <p>“There is no way to compensate for this arrogance except through death.”</p>

      <p>“We’d better not kill them quickly, either. Let’s torture them for a week first, to teach any other disloyal members a lesson.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. Sacrificing them to a demon could be interesting. That, or using their corpses to create a chimera.”</p>

      <p>“You’ll recall how that man so gleefully described all the ways we could kill our own boss. Why don’t we try them on him instead, I say?”</p>

      <p>It was a downright brutal conversation, let me tell you. The color drained from Don Gabbana’s face, his breathing growing ragged. I could see a wet spot in his pants, but I pretended that I didn’t.</p>

      <p>Alecchio wasn’t looking much better. I was sure, now that he’d realized his impending doom, he was trying to work out whether to attempt resistance. But we had the strongest of underground leaders in this room. If I’d been alone, he could certainly have killed me in a few seconds, but many of these other leaders were formidable fighters in their own right. It’d be impossible to overpower all of them—he stood no chance against Glenda alone, in fact.</p>
