<p class="noindent">Yuuki Kagurazaka is a genius.</p>
<p>Even back in his original world, Yuuki had a special power—a sort of supernatural observational force, one you could call psychokinesis. He was born with this power, but he never felt any urgent need to do something with it. After all, he knew if he told someone about this power of his, he’d be made into a spectacle. Life was thus rather humdrum for him, but he enjoyed it well enough. His parents were kind to him, and he had a decent number of friends. He never found it hard to scare up some money when needed, so he had access to basically anything he wanted. He had absolutely no complaints.</p>
<p>But one day, Yuuki was befallen by sudden misfortune. Right when he entered middle school, his parents passed away in an accident. It wasn’t their fault; their car was hit head-on by a truck driver who fell asleep behind the wheel, and they died instantly. Only Yuuki, sleeping in the back seat, survived. He thought it was unfair, of course. He hated the driver who caused the accident, but there was nothing he could do about it. Japan was a nation of laws and regulations, and personal revenge wasn’t part of that picture.</p>
<p>The ensuing court case revealed a number of things. The transportation company the truck driver worked for had bitten off more than it could chew. They put the brunt of that on their field employees, who toiled on even though they knew they were overworked. The driver, too, was a victim here.</p>
<p>So was it the transportation company’s fault? Well, the facts didn’t paint a clear picture there, either. If they turned down a job from a big firm, they might not have gotten another order from them again. It wasn’t easy to say no to a longtime client. The transportation company should’ve responded by improving their business structure, but skilled drivers were tough to come by, and they didn’t have the financial wherewithal to bring on and train younger talent.</p>
<p><em>That’s so messed up</em>, Yuuki lamented. The world was just so unfair, and he was just so powerless.</p>
<p>Who should he hate for it? To be honest, society itself had serious problems. Yuuki considered exacting his revenge on society, but that was beyond his own capabilities. As a genius, he thus knew his own limits. The world had advanced to completion, in essence. Supernatural powers or not, having a little strength on your side didn’t mean you could change anything by yourself. You weren’t gonna beat an army, and even if you could, there was no future awaiting you past that. Yuuki thought about giving in to despair, destroying all of society, and rebuilding it from scratch…but that’d cause nothing but misery for vast numbers of people, and he just couldn’t commit to that.</p>
<p>If Yuuki wanted to change society, the only way was to pound the pavement and attract more people who shared his beliefs. He could then become a politician and improve his nation in his own image—that was the only plan Yuuki came up with. A long, patient path. One that <em>was</em> possible if he really put his mind to it, but it’d only bear fruit decades into the future.</p>
<p>Yuuki was at an impasse…and before he made his decision, he wound up traveling between worlds. But whether this was a stroke of fortune or misfortune for him was another question entirely…</p>
<p class="space-break1">It was the sheer malice of the demon lord Kazalim that brought Yuuki to this world. Kazalim had lost his physical body, retaining possession of just his spiritual one, but he still hadn’t lost his powers as the Curse Lord. He was biding his time, making the necessary preparations to resurrect himself, and he’d execute his plan only when he summoned a body suitable for his spirit.</p>
<p>Of course, he carefully examined the constraints he’d put on this summoned target. Failure was absolutely out of the question for this ritual, so he’d use his powers of domination to carve a cursed seal before the summoning. The summoned target’s heart and mind would be crushed, completely unaware of what happened; Kazalim would then seize the power within their soul, snatching away the body and resurrecting himself.</p>
<p>Kazalim’s sole mistake was summoning Yuuki for this ritual. None of the curse-driven magic the demon lord tried on him worked.</p>
<p>With his genius-level talents, Yuuki quickly surmised how this world operated. In the midst of the journey, he obtained all the powers he wanted—the powers to change the world. It was pure, unadulterated energy, a power from the soul that he could alter to his liking. The name of it: the unique skill Initiator. He had told Rimuru that he lacked any special skills, but that was a bald-faced lie.</p>
<p>The first thing he initiated with this power was Anti-Skill, the ability to cancel out anything hostile coming his way. That immediately foiled Kazalim’s scheme—not only was Kazalim defeated, but he even had to capitulate to Yuuki.</p>
<p>Now Yuuki found meaning to life in this world. Here, it was eat or be eaten. The laws governing civilization were still incomplete, and it’d be a while until they even approached perfection. Therefore, it was left to him to become this world’s leader—and guide it in the right direction.</p>
<p>Yuuki had decided to tackle this unfair world head-on. It was a challenge that drove him forward. This world was his for the taking.</p>

<p class="tx1">Yuuki had escaped the chaotic scene at the cathedral with his three servants, Laplace, Footman, and Teare. The group promptly tried to flee the Holy Empire of Lubelius—they considered staying nearby and gauging the situation but ultimately decided that remaining there was too dangerous. The berserk Hero Chronoa wasn’t the kind of pushover Yuuki could control; she was a fearsome figure, one who saw any living, breathing being in sight as her enemy. Granville must have known that when he offered to fight alongside Yuuki. He hated to admit it, but <em>this</em> time, his enemy had the upper hand.</p>
<p>“What a travesty, though, eh? We finally gave the demon lord Luminus the slip. We were one step away from nabbin’ a Hero, the greatest weapon anyone could hope for…and <em>now</em> look,” Laplace lamented.</p>
<p>“Hoh-hoh-hoh!” Footman chortled. “Her strength was nothing I’ve seen in this dimension. It is a pity we couldn’t bring her to our side, but against <em>her</em>, everybody there would’ve been killed, no?”</p>
<p>That was the logical conclusion, but Yuuki wasn’t sure things would go that easily.</p>
<p>“Yeah, who knows? ’Cause in the end, the demon lord Rimuru’s a freak of nature, huh? And Luminus and Leon were on-site, too, so we’re talkin’ three demon lords and a small army of decent magic-born. No matter who won, it sure wouldn’t surprise me,” Laplace replied.</p>
<p>“Precisely,” said Teare. “Granville is a former Hero himself, so he’s quite strong, too. I can’t even fathom who would come out on top.”</p>
<p>Laplace and Teare weren’t as optimistic as Footman. Like Yuuki, they were also contemplating a possible victory for Rimuru’s side.</p>
<p>Certainly, for Yuuki’s purposes, Chronoa annihilating everybody on the scene would be the best way to end the day. That’d rub out Rimuru, a tremendous nuisance; Granville, a pain in the ass; Luminus, a likely future threat to him; and even Leon, the nemesis of Laplace and his cohorts. With all of them gone, the West was as good as under Yuuki’s control—and while Chronoa would still be a handful, she wasn’t that scary to him if she lacked any sentience. For all he cared, they could just bait her with some monsters and banish her to the other side of the desert or something.</p>
<p>If an adversary was all strength and nothing else, Yuuki wouldn’t even see it as a threat. That was why he hoped, at least, to find out who survived, but…</p>
<p>“No, we were right to run. If we got involved, I don’t think any of us would’ve come out unscathed. And besides…”</p>
<p>His instincts told him something bad was about to happen. They needed to figure out their position in this free-for-all, if only so they could form a strategy, but Yuuki trusted his instincts and chose to flee anyway. If Chronoa was defeated, the surviving demon lords would no doubt be openly hostile to him. Rimuru had probably noticed Yuuki’s betrayal by this point; he couldn’t talk his way out of that any longer.</p>
<p>With this defeat, they had lost their base of operations, their position, and everything else in the West—and all, Yuuki thought, because he was foolish enough to fall for Granville’s offers. He was thus willing to accept this result as his just deserts. That was why, when it was time to flee, he didn’t hesitate for a moment. This firm decision-making acumen was one of his greatest assets, and it had seen him through some difficult spots time and time again.</p>
<p>Yuuki assumed this would be another one of those times. But he soon came to realize how sorely mistaken he was.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Suddenly, as Yuuki’s group quickly traversed the landscape, a single man stood before them, blocking their path. Next to him was a blue-haired girl whose beauty immediately drew your attention, wearing a dark-red maid outfit that looked extremely out of place.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>“Who’re you?”</p>
<p>Yuuki froze, sensing the danger. The man ignored Laplace’s question, his eyes transfixed on Yuuki; nobody else mattered to him.</p>
<p>“Hoh-hoh-hoh! If you mean to get in our way—”</p>
<p>Footman took a step forward, ready to eliminate this duo. The next moment, he was sent crashing to the ground by a new figure—another girl, wearing the same dark-red maid outfit as the blue-haired one. This girl’s hair was green; she was none other than Mizeri, who had been on assignment in Englesia until a few moments ago. The appearance of Testarossa put an end to that mission, and so she flew over.</p>
<p>And with Mizeri here, the blue-haired figure must have been Raine. The two of them served only one man—the demon lord Guy Crimson, Lord of Darkness and the most powerful being in the world. His rouge hair, darker than blood, fluttered in the breeze, his crimson eyes twinkling like gems as he beheld Yuuki.</p>
<p>“Hey. The first time we’ve met, I think? You’ve been attracting my interest.”</p>
<p>Guy’s gaze was frozen upon Yuuki. No one else was permitted to enter his sight. Yuuki, detecting this, wasn’t sure whether to feel happy or sad about that. Given the way Mizeri just dispatched Footman, he had a decent idea of his foes’ powers. And not just that—the colors of their hair, and the unusual maid uniforms, matched those of a curious group Kagali, Kazalim, and Clayman had all told him about. This man before him stood at the very peak of the world—a peak he wanted for himself. If he had the ambition to conquer the world, Yuuki would have to face him sooner or later.</p>
<p>“Ah, so you’re Guy Crimson, hailed as the most powerful of the demon lords? It’s an honor to meet you. My name is Yuuki Kagurazaka. To think that <em>you’d</em> come to <em>me</em>—did you want to join forces?”</p>
<p>Yuuki grinned at Guy, never letting himself be overpowered. This was, he knew, very wishful thinking. One of Guy’s maids had just knocked Footman to the ground; there was no way they came here to extend an olive branch. He knew that, but he still put up a friendly facade. That was how he negotiated—making an outrageous statement or proposal and gauging the other side’s circumstances and goals from their reaction.</p>
<p>“Aaahhh-ha-ha-ha! You’re funny. That’s quite an attitude to take in front of me. And maybe that wouldn’t be such a bad offer, but it looks like you and Leon are enemies, eh? And besides, aren’t you traveling to the East now? Because personally, I ain’t a fan of Ludora gaining any more war power.”</p>
<p>Negotiations were off the table. Yuuki didn’t expect Guy would take the offer from the start. It didn’t faze him—he was too busy scrutinizing whatever information he could glean from Guy’s words.</p>
<p>Ludora was the emperor of the Nasca Namrium Ulmeria United Eastern Empire. Guy’s name-dropping him meant the two had a relationship—and most likely not a friendly one.</p>
<p><em>…So they want to eliminate us before we can reach the East? I really don’t want to tangle with the strongest demon lord here, but if this is what it’s come to, so be it…</em></p>
<p>There was no avoiding a battle with Guy. Escape was futile. Silly little tricks were meaningless in this situation. Going after Guy with everything they had, Yuuki decided, offered them better chances.</p>
<p>“Hmm… Well, all right. If you’re opposed to us, that serves me just fine as well. This way, I can test out the powers of the strongest of demon lords before I come to the East.”</p>
<p>Yuuki meant to antagonize Guy. At the same time, a great excitement welled within his heart until it spilled out and coursed through his entire body. Right then, at that moment, he had decided to take the powers he had bottled up and unleash them all against the strongest demon lord. Defeat, he thought as he sized Guy up, wasn’t even imaginable to him.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Yuuki was certainly confident. In fact, in a one-on-one match, he was sure he could beat anyone. He could tell Chronoa was a pretty dangerous foe, but nothing more. With a concerted effort, he could win, if only after a struggle—but they were sharing a venue with multiple demon lords who were clearly not on his side. Leon, Luminus, even the incredibly softhearted Rimuru, had likely noticed Yuuki’s true intentions. Rimuru had realized some time ago that Yuuki was his enemy, but that actually benefited Yuuki back at the cathedral—had he tried using Rimuru to his advantage, Yuuki would’ve fallen into a trap. Yuuki didn’t know that at the time, but either way, he had the right idea about Rimuru now.</p>
<p>Yet with all his confidence, not even Yuuki was stupidly bold enough to take on three demon lords <em>and</em> Chronoa simultaneously. He didn’t need his instincts to tell him that retreating was the best option. Now, though—this was different. The man standing in front of him was all the warning he needed—and once he realized that, Yuuki resolved to handle matters with everything he had.</p>
<p>Guy flashed a bemused smile. “Oh, you think you can beat me?”</p>
<p>“Well, kind of. I was planning to knock you out sooner or later anyway, so this is just accelerating the timetable a bit.”</p>
<p>Yuuki’s attitude quickly stoked the murderous ire of Raine and Mizeri—but they’d never open their mouths without their master Guy’s permission. The demon lord was the absolute ruler, and any concern for his safety was therefore a sign of disrespect. Guy was a capricious demon lord, merciless to anyone he deemed not worth his time. Raine and Mizeri just barely earned that acceptance for themselves, but get on his bad side, and they’d be killed in an instant, no doubt. That was the clear difference in power between Guy and his maids.</p>
<p>Laplace couldn’t move. He was like a frog transfixed by a venomous snake. If he tried to assist Footman, Raine would certainly retaliate. It was four against three, numerically speaking, but the yawning gap in strength was extremely cold comfort to him. He might be able to take on Raine and Mizeri alone, but with Guy around, he didn’t stand a chance.</p>
<p>Yuuki seemed ready to take on Guy, but Laplace saw that as a foolhardy challenge. <em>Forget it. Anyone but this dude! Chronoa was on another dimension herself, but this Guy Crimson’s a cross-my-heart monster, I tell ya. This ain’t even gonna be a fight. We can’t run, and who knows how long the boss can hold out…? I s’pose that’s gonna be the key to survival here…</em></p>
<p>Laplace deserved praise for identifying even a small slice of Guy’s potential force. But beyond that, his strength of heart—the ability to consider fleeing instead of collapsing to the ground heartbroken—demonstrated his true worth. He knew about Yuuki’s strength, but Yuuki was hiding exactly how much he had from them. Would it even work against Guy?</p>
<p>Still, even if Yuuki was no match for Guy, Laplace intended to rescue Footman, take Teare, and get out of there. Yuuki would no doubt pick up on this and give him a hand—that’s how much Laplace trusted him. The only problem with this plan was that Raine and Mizeri were abnormally strong menaces themselves. They weren’t careless enough to give Laplace an opening to save Footman; he hesitated to make any untoward moves against them. He wanted to find a way to rescue his friend…but the problem, it turned out, had a ready solution.</p>
<p>“Hey. Let him go.”</p>
<p>The order came from Guy to Mizeri, who (of course) offered no resistance, immediately releasing Footman.</p>
<p><em>…Well, that was easy. Now I guess we got an escape route after all.</em></p>
<p>Laplace was almost beginning to feel optimistic about his chances when things took a different turn.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry—if you beat me, I’ll let you all go unhurt.”</p>
<p>Guy seemed to be contradicting himself. What did defeating him have to do with letting Yuuki’s group leave? It was hardly reassuring at all. Thus, distressed and depressed, Laplace decided to just watch the proceedings, praying for Yuuki to win.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Yuuki was the first to act. His supreme confidence—driven by the firm belief that no magic or skills worked on him—led him to unleash a kick on Guy. It was a sharp, heavy kick that seemed to shift halfway, its trajectory veering in midair before finally landing hard on Guy’s head. But it was Yuuki’s face that wound up wincing.</p>
<p>“Eesh… You’re so <em>solid</em>.”</p>
<p>His Anti-Skill worked against all things, penetrating the defenses of any foe—but despite being directly attacked, Guy stood there, totally serene and not demonstrating an ounce of pain. There was no trick or trap involved. It was just that Guy’s body was more solid than diamond itself, and the mix of toughness and flexibility was a truly ominous threat. That’s just how Guy was.</p>
<p>“That barely triggered an itch. Some battle this is. Humor me a little more, would you? ’Cause otherwise I’m killing all of you.”</p>
<p>With a smile, Guy conjured flames in his right hand. It was the elemental magic Napalm Burst, a searing fire reminiscent of a dragon’s long, twisting form. At a temperature of several thousand degrees, it could instantly vaporize any human being; and now those draconic flames were wrapping around Yuuki’s body.</p>
<p>“You’re wasting your time with magic!” Yuuki shouted, trying to throw the self-satisfied Guy off guard—then leaped away, a chill running down his spine.</p>
<p>“Huh. You got some good instincts, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Guy smiled as he asked the question, but Yuuki was too busy rolling on the ground to answer, frantically trying to put out the flames. Anti-Skill <em>did</em> work, and it <em>did</em> prevent Guy’s spell from injuring him. But the magic fire, which should have immediately extinguished itself, simply kept on burning. Even worse, it consumed oxygen just like a normal fire. Left unattended, it would have starved Yuuki’s lungs of air and killed him.</p>
<p>What felt like ages to Yuuki was just a few seconds. That’s why he took no damage, but if Yuuki failed to notice and kept attacking Guy, that would have sealed his fate. He’d instead focused on putting out the fire, as ridiculous as it made him look.</p>
<p>Then, gauging Guy’s reaction, Yuuki considered one possibility he sincerely didn’t want to believe in. He hated to admit it, but he needed to check how feasible it was. So standing back up, Yuuki asked the question, not really expecting an answer.</p>
<p>“…Why didn’t you follow up and attack me again? This isn’t some kind of chivalrous duel.”</p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha! Quit playing dumb. You must’ve realized by now, right? I’ve picked up on the secret to your powers!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p><em>I knew it</em>, mused the disgusted Yuuki. His Anti-Skill was omnipotent, capable of annulling all forces—but when faced with the sort of Arts that fused magic together with skills, he couldn’t cancel both at once. That was the only flaw to his skill—and therefore his sole weakness. Plus, no matter how much he could power himself up, Yuuki was still just a human being. Perhaps he could generate antibodies to dispatch any poison attacks, but he couldn’t go for very long without oxygen.</p>
<p>This weakness—one created simply by being a living creature—made Yuuki comprehend the extent of his disadvantage.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Guy stood there, composed.</p>
<p>“See, there’s this man I know who can cancel all forms of magic…but if we ever fought, I’d still win. Why? Because he can’t cancel out anything <em>besides</em> magic. And as far as I know, there’s no way to perfectly block the laws of physics in this world. Put all your focus on one point, and you’ll open up a hole somewhere else. It seems like <em>your</em> ability applies to skills as well as magic, but…”</p>
<p>He looked down upon Yuuki, airing his thoughts instead of landing another strike. The detached, casual air was all carefully calculated. It’d be easy to kill Yuuki, after all, but that wouldn’t be any fun. Instead, Guy wanted to break his heart and force him to admit defeat in his despair. He already had him worked out—Yuuki’s attack told him all about what made him unique, and he had come up with countermeasures.</p>
<p>No matter how well he could dispel magic and skills, he was human—and thus eminently beatable. Humans were weak, sporting frail bodies laden with vulnerable points, and it wasn’t even worth formulating a strategy for killing them.</p>
<p>Even in terms of core physical ability, there was a wide gap between Yuuki and the demon lord. With Yuuki’s kick earlier, Guy left only a single small barrier in place as he tried blocking it, but it didn’t even leave a scratch. Look at their respective magicule energies, and it was comical to compare them at all. Guy was on the level of a True Dragon, and for him, it’d be simple to launch another magic spell while Yuuki was busy dispelling the first.</p>
<p>“But just killing you on the spot would defeat the whole purpose of me showing up. Why don’t you try entertaining me while I’m here?”</p>
<p>Guy lorded over Yuuki and taunted him. He wanted to corner Yuuki, make him unleash his full powers, and only then would he utterly overwhelm him and claim victory.</p>
<p class="space-break1">Yuuki, meanwhile, could tell what Guy was thinking—painfully so—but he had no response. The breezy confidence vanished from his face as he coolly analyzed the situation and pondered a way to make it out alive. He was a rare genius, and his genius-level brain told him that the difference in strength was cataclysmic. But he didn’t give up, instead mentally groping for any and all alternatives.</p>
<p>The only hope he found was that Guy took him so lightly.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, with this much of a difference, I can see why he’d look down on me. But he’s also just a tad bit arrogant.</em></p>
<p>Yuuki still had some tricks up his sleeve. One was the supernatural ability he was born with; another was Avarice, the skill he took from Maribel. The third was Instigator, capable of creating skills on the fly as needed. With those, he thought, he could make it through.</p>
<p><em>Not killing me when you had the chance was a real bad idea!</em></p>
<p>Gathering his breath, Yuuki turned back toward Guy.</p>
<p>“Well, just because you’ve spotted a few of my abilities doesn’t mean you’re safe to order me around yet.”</p>
<p>This wasn’t sour grapes. He really believed this. If an opponent became riled up and lost their cool, that made them more likely to commit an error. That was the aim behind his taunting—but as he verbally parried with Guy, he also ran his powers up and down his own body, powers he usually kept bottled up. His spiritual force flowed, focusing itself around his soul, and he was using it to enhance his physical body—from human to Enlightened, and from Enlightened to Saint.</p>
<p>It was an evolution, one that lifted him even higher than Hinata, and when it was done, Yuuki stopped breathing. A full Saint was equivalent to a spiritual life-form—Hinata was still too much a prisoner of her own physical body, but Yuuki was already a level above her. Respiration was no longer required.</p>
<p>Having disposed of his human weaknesses, Yuuki was now striking a much stronger presence. If you converted his energy stores to magicules, they were now closer to Leon’s or Luminus’s.</p>
<p>But Guy wasn’t moved. “What a disappointment,” he said, wholly non-agitated. “Is that your full power? Then we could duke it out a million times, and you’d <em>still</em> never beat me.”</p>
<p>“Yep… And in that case, let’s have some fun!”</p>
<p>With Yuuki’s signal, the battle began anew. And then…Yuuki found out exactly why Guy was considered the strongest being.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

<div class="pc-rw"><img alt="" class="ornament" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Nothing but despair ruled over the landscape. Yuuki was now sprawled on the ground. Before Guy’s overwhelming power, absolutely none of his attacks struck for damage. No petty tricks would work on him. Even Yuuki’s greatest attacks, moves he spent untold hours honing, failed to land a scratch upon Guy.</p>
<p>“God <em>dam</em>mit!!”</p>
<p>Yuuki lacked the strength to so much as stand up. Turning toward Guy and cursing him was about the best he could manage. But his heart was still unbroken, something he deserved high praise for.</p>
<p>Laplace had burned the battle into his memory, never blinking once.</p>
<p><em>It makes no sense to me. It ain’t that the boss is a wimp. It’s that Guy’s just too much…</em></p>
<p>Yuuki was, indeed, stronger than Laplace imagined. He had some kind of eerie, supernatural force, and he used it to test out a variety of approaches with Guy. From simple throwing stones to fiery blasts, heavy pressure, and spiritual interference—all were lightly shrugged off. Even with over thirty times the muscle of an average human, even with attacks lobbed at hundreds of miles an hour, it was just child’s play to Guy. Not even Anti-Skill, the keystone of Yuuki’s defense, could fully disable Guy’s magic.</p>
<p>“That’s not gonna work on me any longer, y’know.”</p>
<p>As he warned, Guy had apparently found a way through Anti-Skill. It was a shocking revelation for Yuuki. Kazalim and Clayman had taught him much about the Ten Great Demon Lords, including the fact that Guy and Milim boasted another echelon of power. But not even these advisers could’ve known just how much of a gap there really was. If they had, they never would have endorsed his world-conquest fantasies.</p>
<p><em>So this…is what a Catastrophe-level guy is like…?</em></p>
<p>It was well after the fact, but now Laplace realized there were things in this world that must never be prodded. Even he had some powers he kept secret from his own friends—but they were meaningless before an opponent like Guy. That showed how overwhelming a foe he was. No tactic imaginable could bring this demon lord to his knees. Even Yuuki, a man clearly more powerful than Laplace, was helplessly toppled as if he were an infant.</p>
<p>At this point, escaping alive was next to impossible. Someone, Laplace concluded, would need to make the ultimate sacrifice. But he kept up his usual calm demeanor as he took a step toward Guy.</p>
<p>“Yep, I’d expect nothing less from the great demon lord Guy Crimson. We’re the Moderate Jesters, y’see; kind of a jack-of-all-trades outfit, and our boss—Mr. Yuuki here, I mean—hired us for some assorted odd jobs. So now that he’s been defeated, we’re not really under any obligation to continue serving him—”</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>“Laplace, what are you—?”</p>
<p>It was incredibly petty, but Laplace seemed ready to betray his friend at that moment. He didn’t know Guy personally, but the demon lord’s selfishness and arrogance were the stuff of legend. He had no interest in the weak and refused to so much as talk to anyone he didn’t consider worth his time. Taking this attitude toward Guy all but ensured Laplace’s instant death…but it was also guaranteed to turn Guy’s attention toward him, and Yuuki could doubtlessly use that opening to make good his escape. It was a chance Laplace was willing to bet on.</p>
<p>The one absolute rule among the Moderate Jesters was to never betray your friends—and <em>especially</em> not your client. That was why Laplace believed Yuuki would immediately understand his intentions. Footman had a temper and tended to act before thinking, but his friends were always on his mind. Teare, meanwhile, was stronger than Clayman but so timid that she shied away from exercising her full force. Both of them had a tendency to get carried away, but they could be trusted to take care of Yuuki. Thus Laplace decided to sacrifice himself.</p>
<p>“I just wanna help you, Mr. Guy, sir. So could you at least spare my life?”</p>
<p>He couldn’t have announced his betrayal more clearly. Footman and Teare acted confused; Guy showed Laplace a bemused grin.</p>
<p><em>All right. Gotta keep angering him!</em></p>
<p>Laplace had no intention of dying. He knew he didn’t have much hope against Guy, but maybe there was a way to get out of this alive. Thus he didn’t hesitate to speak once more…but before he could:</p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha! No need to force it, Laplace. Oh, man… Do I really look that helpless to you?”</p>
<p>It was Yuuki who spoke, staggering to his feet.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Yuuki was prepared to die. But at the same time, he could feel insatiable resentment filling his heart. He was disappointed in himself, and it riled him—and Laplace’s words only deepened his anger.</p>
<p>No way Laplace would ever betray him. This was all an act, he correctly surmised—a performance made because he trusted in Yuuki, despite his cavalcade of blunders. That made him as happy as it did sorrowful.</p>
<p><em>If I had even more power…</em></p>
<p>The thought bubbled up from within his heart of hearts. It was a desire nobody could ever answer—but something deep inside him reacted.</p>
<p class="space-break2"><span class="special"><em>…You want power? Then take my hand.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>Huh?</em></p>
<p>Yuuki was confused for a moment. He wondered if his mind was playing tricks on him…but the voice was far too clear and distinct for that.</p>
<p class="space-break2"><span class="special"><em>Let me take over, and you’ll score the most powerful force imaginable. Even world conquest would be easy as pie, I think, if you took my hand. Now make your choice…</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break1">The voice’s offer made Yuuki extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p><em>Shut up. I’m me, all right? You’re not my friend. And I’m not cheap enough to achieve my goals with the help of someone I don’t even know!</em></p>
<p>He couldn’t have been clearer. Yes, to him, an ambition this big only gained meaning because he’d fulfill it himself. It was a stance Yuuki refused to budge on.</p>
<p class="space-break">…</p>
<p class="space-break1">The voice fell silent, apparently unsure what to say. And to Yuuki, if the voice was gone, it no longer mattered to him.</p>
<p>Desperate though this moment was, something else weighed on Yuuki’s mind. Guy, it seemed, had some kind of purpose for him. That might’ve just been because he wanted to enjoy this battle with Yuuki, but there had to be some other reason. He did say he wasn’t “<em>a fan of Ludora gaining any more war power</em>”—but turn that around, and if Yuuki didn’t side with Ludora—let alone the Eastern Empire—then perhaps there’d be no reason to kill him and his friends.</p>
<p>And as for why Guy didn’t kill Yuuki right then…?</p>
<p><em>Eesh. I couldn’t overpower him at all, but from here on out, it’ll be a battle of wits, won’t it? And rather than forcing such an awful role upon Laplace, I’ve got a much better chance if I do this myself!</em></p>
<p>Yuuki roused his spirits and got back to his feet.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Brushing his bangs out of his face, Yuuki smiled defiantly in spite of the desperate situation. “Yeah, I never thought you’d be <em>that</em> powerful, but now that I fought you, I’m sure of it. You don’t want to kill us at all, do you?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? What makes you think that?”</p>
<p>“Well, I mean, if you really wanted to, you could’ve massacred us a long time ago. So why did you keep beating me within an inch of my life but no further?”</p>
<p>Yuuki couldn’t have sounded more confident with the question. Anyone would think it an incredibly reckless thing to do, facing an opponent like Guy who had just demonstrated such impenetrable might. But Guy still seemed entertained.</p>
<p>“Oh, you noticed? Well, you don’t need to know why.”</p>
<p>Yuuki shrugged at this denial, but he expected as much. So he calmly moved on to step two.</p>
<p>“Okay. I got an offer for you, then.”</p>
<p>“An offer?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. If you let us go, I think we can help you out a little.”</p>
<p>“Help <em>me</em> out?”</p>
<p>“Right. I guess you don’t want us cooperating with the Eastern Empire, but I’d like you to reconsider that.”</p>
<p>“Go on.”</p>
<p>“What I mean is: If we’re trying to conquer the world here, then sooner or later we’re gonna have to fight the Eastern Empire. And I just spent the past however many minutes learning how strong you are—I can feel it in my bones. I think it goes without saying that I don’t plan to challenge you for a while to come, okay? So it’d be more natural for me to head over to the Empire and take <em>it</em> down first, right?”</p>
<p>This was coming completely out of left field. It left Footman and Teare in the dust, certainly, and Laplace simply stood there as well, helplessly confused. He had just hatched a plan, was all but ready to die for it, and Yuuki—his one lifeline—had stomped all over it. Now, he thought, it was solely up to Yuuki’s negotiations. The ball was in his court, but his fearless attitude gave Laplace an unstoppable cold sweat down his spine.</p>
<p><em>It’s crazy—the premise is just crazy. So why is Guy enjoying this?!</em></p>
<p>Laplace was right. Something about Yuuki’s offer made Guy grin ominously.</p>
<p>“Are you still trying to challenge me?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I’m looking to conquer the world, remember. And I can’t win against you right now, but I’m gonna surpass you someday. You’ll see.”</p>
<p>As roughed up as he was, barely able to keep himself upright, Yuuki remained defiant. He maintained his bold stance, as if the thought of being killed for his insolence had never occurred to him.</p>
<p>Against someone like Guy, this was absolutely the correct tack to take. If you foolishly tried begging for your life, he’d immediately lose interest—and all that awaited you next was destruction. He may not have realized it, but Yuuki had made the best choice possible.</p>
<p>“And if you four topple the Empire, would that benefit me in some way?”</p>
<p>Yuuki braced himself. They were at the crux of this discussion. He returned Guy’s piercing gaze and nodded emphatically.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I don’t know why yet, but <em>you</em> don’t want the Empire to conquer the West, either. Am I wrong?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Guy and the emperor Ludora had some history; that much was certain. It all came down to this. Yuuki pleaded his case, mixing in a bluff or two.</p>
<p>“And I’ve got a lot of enemies to defeat, you know. Yes, I want to lend a hand to the Empire for now, but I’m not gonna affiliate myself with it. I’ll eat away at it from the inside, and I’ll use it for my own goals.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I see. So if the Empire shares a goal with you, you’ll help, but beyond that, there’s no telling what will happen? And you’re thinking about borrowing the Empire’s forces to take down Leon and Rimuru. Aren’t you, you bastard?”</p>
<p>Guy sharpened his eyes upon Yuuki, seeming to see through everything. There was no taking back what Yuuki said. Guy and Leon’s relationship was a mystery to him, and there was no way he’d know what Guy thought of Rimuru, either. He couldn’t know how his words would be construed—but still Yuuki made no effort to hide his ambitions.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I’ll conquer them all, and then I’ll beat <em>you</em> last, demon lord Guy Crimson.”</p>
<p>He deliberately made himself sound as brazen as possible. The rest was up to Guy’s judgment.</p>
<p><em>Following Laplace’s lead would’ve gotten us killed anyway. Sorry, man, but you’re gonna have to play my game instead.</em></p>
<p>He silently apologized to his comrades. It was all or nothing, and Yuuki was nothing if not greedy. He was making a dangerous bet—if he was going to survive, he wanted everyone else to as well. But the bet paid off.</p>
<p>“The Moderate Jesters, you said? <em>Ah-ha-ha!</em> Your ambitions certainly <em>are</em> a joke, aren’t they? A joker card meddling with all the other pieces in our game. I like it. You’re making a pretty convincing offer. You’ve got courage, at least, and for that I’ll let you go this time.”</p>
<p>Yuuki never did find out what Guy’s mission was. All he knew was that he and his team were safe. Raine and Mizeri voiced no complaints about the decision—as Guy proclaimed, Yuuki and the Jesters left the scene without further incident.</p>

<p class="tx1">Once Guy was no longer in sight, Yuuki and his group headed for the rendezvous they had arranged with Kagali’s team. They assumed they were safe now, but nonetheless, everyone wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The moment they sighted Kagali waiting for them, Laplace turned to Yuuki and spoke.</p>
<p>“Are you <em>kidding</em> me? I can’t believe this. All those declarations you made to a living monster like Guy…”</p>
<p>“<em>And</em>,” added Teare, “you even made him let us all go! I thought we were done for back there.”</p>
<p>“Hoh-hoh-hoh! Well, <em>I</em> believed in the boss from the start,” said Footman.</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> weren’t thinking a damn thing the whole time,” retorted Laplace.</p>
<p>Yuuki cast Laplace a sidelong glance, then sat down on the ground, exhausted. “What do you want from me? It was the only way we <em>might</em> have gotten out of there alive. And it worked, too, so I don’t want to hear any complaints about it, okay?”</p>
<p>The damage he suffered was far more emotional than physical. He went to lie down right there, limbs spread out, and closed his eyes, body language indicating he’d tolerate no further argument.</p>
<p>Left with nothing else to do, Laplace and Teare explained matters to the oblivious Kagali.</p>
<p>“He <em>fought</em> with Guy?! I-I’m amazed you lived to tell the tale…”</p>
<p>Her first reaction was abject surprise. It didn’t take long for it to turn into sheer exasperation for Yuuki.</p>
<p><em>Ah</em>, thought Yuuki as he felt the breeze against his cheek, <em>it’s great to be alive</em>. Then he had another thought. That mystery voice he heard beckoning in the middle of battle—what <em>was</em> it?</p>
<p><em>A split personality of mine or something? No, that’s ridiculous… But hang on. I don’t think there’s some hidden power within me, although I can think of one possibility.</em></p>
<p>His thoughts had taken him to a power he had obtained just recently—the unique skill Avarice. With it, he figured, the more he desired something, the greater his powers would grow. Nothing he threw at Guy in battle had any effect—including Avarice, the strongest of the sin-based skills.</p>
<p><em>The skill’s a total mystery. And when it comes to magic and skills, I guess, you can always find something better than what you got, huh? Guy’s magic overwhelmed my Anti-Skill—I need to figure out how that worked…</em></p>
<p>Considering Yuuki’s sheer confidence, getting so easily defeated by Guy came as a shock. But Yuuki wasn’t about to give up. He had survived, and he needed to think up a plan for next time. His ability to turn the page like that was part of what made him such a powerful foe.</p>
<p>He truly believed he’d obtained power beyond any demon lord; that he was the strongest of all—and even if he wasn’t, with enough research and the right strategy, he could defeat any opponent. With the backup provided by Kagali, Laplace, and many others, he had created a decent-size force for himself. All was going well…but he had experienced nothing but failure lately, and now, that day’s encounter with Guy had utterly shattered his confidence.</p>
<p>But that was, in its own way, a stroke of good luck.</p>
<p class="space-break1"><em>This has gotten so, so exciting. And that’s how a game works, right? The more difficult it is, the more impassioned you get…</em></p>
<p class="space-break1">Yuuki wasn’t fazed one bit. Already, he was deliberating with himself.</p>
<p>Even with Initiator, Yuuki couldn’t read Guy’s abilities. Given its unusual propensity for creating its own skill sets, Initiator should be easily able to analyze a target’s unique skills. The opponent would have to actually use the skills for it to work, but Yuuki believed that, faced with his powers, nobody would go around hiding their hand.</p>
<p>But it hadn’t worked on Guy. And at this point in time, that meant his opponent’s skills were something beyond even unique. He wanted power. More power—enough to beat Guy with. Deep in his heart, the flames of greed roared high.</p>
<p><em>It must mean there’s a chance I can still evolve my Avarice skill. Lord knows I’m greedier than anybody out there. If I can give it some of that greed…</em></p>
<p>Reaching that conclusion filled Yuuki with a nervous excitement that made him tremble. He thought about it a bit. Losing to Guy reminded him of the unfairness of the world. He wanted to resist it and emerge victorious—that was his prime desire.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, turning toward the voice inside him. His consciousness sank deep, deep, into the furthest recesses of his mind.</p>
<p class="space-break2"><span class="special"><em>Willing to join hands with me now?</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break2"><em>No. Not that.</em></p>
<p class="space-break2"><span class="special"><em>So why are you here?</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break2"><em>I have an errand for you.</em></p>
<p class="space-break2"><span class="special"><em>An errand?</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break2"><em>Yep. I thought you could give me your powers.</em></p>
<p class="space-break2"><span class="special"><em>Don’t be silly.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break2"><em>I’m not. I’m serious.</em></p>
<p class="space-break2"><span class="special"><em>What kind of stupidity is—?</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break2"><em>Sorry. You’re in my way.</em></p>
<p class="space-break2"><span class="special"><em>…?!</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break2">The next moment, Yuuki pictured his desires until there was nothing else left in his mind’s eye. He all but begged for the realization of his true goals, using his powerful will as a weapon that bowed to no one.</p>
<p>He was challenging himself to battle. And then the World Language rang loud:</p>
<p class="space-break2"><span class="special"><em>Confirmed. Conditions satisfied. The unique skill Avarice has evolved into the ultimate skill Mammon, Lord of Greed.</em></span></p>
<p class="space-break2">Yuuki opened his eyes, defiantly grinning. Then he spoke softly—too softly to be heard.</p>
<p>“I’ll be sure to make good use of your power.”</p>
<p>That day—that moment—that location—marked the birth of the world’s most heinous magic-born.</p>
