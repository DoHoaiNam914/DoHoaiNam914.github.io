<p class="noindent">Great to see you for the first time in a bit. This is Fuse.</p>
<p>Volume 12 had no afterword to it, so it really <em>has</em> been a long time, hasn’t it? I’m not active on Twitter or anything, which makes it feel that way all the more. I do try to keep my author page on the web novel site syosetu.com updated, advertising the stuff I’m up to and so on, but I’m not sure that a lot of people know about that page. If you’re interested, please check it out—I usually try to post some new info around the release dates for new volumes!</p>
<p class="space-break1">Now, let me talk about the story for a moment.</p>
<p>As I’m writing this afterword, the synopsis for Volume 13 has already been released and posted around. It says stuff like “a devastating bloodbath at the hands of Tempest’s mighty forces,” but what’s up with that? Aren’t these blurbs meant to, you know, advertise the crisis the protagonists are facing and stuff? And then the heroes overcome it, and it’s way cool, et cetera, et cetera. But here we have a “bloodbath.” There are no stakes, no drama, just the hero kicking tons of ass…</p>
<p>…Wait a minute. Maybe this is all reverse psychology, and our heroes are facing serious trouble up ahead! I don’t think it’ll work out like that, but boy, who knows where the truth lies, huh? You’ll just have to see for yourself in the next volume!</p>

<p class="noindent">Now for an announcement! This was advertised in Volume 12 so you may already be aware of it, but <em>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</em> is going to receive a televised anime adaptation!</p>
<p>Having this thing I wrote as a hobby get turned into print books, then a manga, and then an anime… As the original author, I’m simply overwhelmed with emotion. I only made it this far because of the support everyone’s given me—it’s thanks to all of you that this work’s able to exist! If you’ve become a fan and think it’s a fun and exciting series, I couldn’t be happier.</p>
<p>Thanks for continuing to support <em>Slime</em>!!</p>
