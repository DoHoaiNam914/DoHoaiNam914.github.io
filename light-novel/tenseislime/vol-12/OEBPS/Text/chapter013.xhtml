<p>“You know, I think I’ve gotten better at using my Chosen One unique skill, too. I’m not getting showered in praise after everything I do, like before. But now I’m not able to use it when I <em>want</em> to, so please don’t expect too much of me, all right?”</p>
<p>He was really being a sore loser about it, trying to weasel out any way he could, but I knew that wasn’t the truth. After all, Masayuki was as popular as ever, and he still wielded massive influence around the world.</p>
<p>“But don’t you want to show off to Kenya and the gang?”</p>
<p>“I, um…”</p>
<p>If he accepted the job, I was willing to let him teach whatever weird stuff he wanted to the kids and bask in their adulation.</p>
<p>“Hey, it’ll be all right! You can do it!”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“No buts! I helped you out when you had to face off against Bovix, remember?”</p>
<p>Masayuki’s party had already made it past Floor 50, where Bovix had served as guardian. During that expedition, I used my avatar to put my thumb on the scale a bit, softening up the guy enough so they could defeat him and take all the credit.</p>
<p>“That <em>did</em> save my hide, yes…”</p>
<p>“So do we have a deal?”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>Between coaxing him and soothing his ego, I finally got a yes.</p>
<p>“You <em>have</em> been a big help to me, Rimuru. I really did wanna pay you back sometime, so…”</p>
<p>He still didn’t sound too enthusiastic, but he took the job of Volunteer Army general anyway. We received no complaints from those volunteers, either—in fact, the reaction was more like “All <em>right</em>!!” and “Victory is ours!!” and so on. To them, it was like going in with twenty points already on the board. No matter how much of a hangdog expression he gave me, there was no turning back.</p>
<p>“I knew this would happen…”</p>
<p>Masayuki said he had more control over the Chosen One skill these days, but what did he mean by that? Maybe my hunch was right, and he was lying…or maybe some of Masayuki’s <em>real</em> luck was operating on him, skill or not? That’d be even more of a surprise, actually. Leon was the opposite—everything he did tended to make him look as bad as possible. This was apparently the case even back in his Hero days; I guess it can be hard to fight your true nature.</p>
<p>“Now, now… I’m sorry all this got decided without you, but think about it! You’re gonna be a banner who’ll inspire the entire army!”</p>
<p>I tried to commiserate with him as much as I could—but regardless, Masayuki the Hero was now leading our twenty thousand (mostly) human volunteers.</p>

<p class="tx1">So the corrected organizational chart had fifty-two thousand troops on the right wing and fifty thousand on the left. Benimaru was at the very top, the generals of each army corps below him.</p>
<p>We thus had over a hundred thousand soldiers to work with, but I was still iffy on whether we could take the imperial force with that. No need to panic, though. All our preparations were continuing on apace. We had one hundred and fifty thousand troops in the Western Deployment to back us up. Each of the Western Nations was prepping support units from their respective knight corps. As a final, <em>final</em> defensive line, we’d get the Western Nations’ army set up as well. The total would be over two hundred and fifty thousand, I was told, and if push came to shove, I’d be relying on them.</p>
<p>This was the figure we cobbled together from all the mercenaries and support troops, but it was hard to tell if it was a lot or a little. Testarossa had cajoled and threatened the Council into cooperating with us, not that they had much choice—if we lost, after all, it’d be their turn next. We wouldn’t be tapping into any of these forces unless things looked pretty grim for ourselves.</p>
<p>Regardless, we had the terrain advantage, as well as Veldora and additional support from demon lords like Luminus and Leon. Even Milim agreed to pitch in; the Beast Master’s Warrior Alliance serving Carillon would be ready to deploy at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>Plus, as my personal trump card, I had the Black Corps under Diablo at the ready. Benimaru had full command over the entire military, so honestly speaking, the hierarchy didn’t give me direct control over any force. In practice, though, the Black Corps took orders from nobody but Diablo and the three demonesses under him. They were a fully independent army, totally out of Benimaru’s control.</p>
<p>That was the sum of our forces. And we hadn’t factored in what moves Yuuki would make.</p>
<p>“A war, huh?” I muttered to myself in my room. Did the Empire <em>really</em> want to conquer the Western Nations? Guy had used the term <em>game</em> to describe his motives. It sounded like there were some connections there—some kind of restless ulterior motive pointed at the Empire. But even so:</p>
<p>“No matter who comes along, if they lay their hands on our little paradise, I’ll crush them.”</p>
<p>Those were my true feelings. I had no intention of making the same mistake twice. I’m a demon lord, and I can’t afford to put the wrong things first.</p>

<p class="tx1">Meanwhile, as Rimuru and his companions were preparing for war, the Eastern Empire was doing much the same thing…except they spent far more years preparing. Slowly, carefully, step by step, their preparations for a grand offensive took shape. Before long, the Empire would wake from its long, long slumber…and only a small amount of time remained until the storm began.</p>
