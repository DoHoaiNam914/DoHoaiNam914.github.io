<p class="noindent"><a id="page-17"></a>Michael—or the former emperor Ludora, I guess—and Feldway the mystic lord were gone. The fight hadn’t been settled, but I suppose both sides were too injured to continue.</p>
<p>That led to some unaddressed concerns for me, but for now, I wanted to celebrate the fact that we were all okay. I could worry about sweeping things up and working out plans later. Unfortunately, Carillon, Frey, and the others were still stuck in evolutionary sleep, so I arranged for them to be left with Testarossa and politely sent on their way.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I told her. “I know you’re tired and all…”</p>
<p>“No, please, don’t worry about us. Take your time to recover from your fatigue. You need to regain your strength.”</p>
<p>It was painful for me to receive that advice, but I might as well follow it. I could think about other stuff once things settled down a bit. First, it was time to rev myself up with a little party.</p>
<p>I was hoping to invite Laplace, but when I sent Diablo to pick him up, he reported the guy was already gone. I guess even Diablo knew how to worry about his friends, at least a little. So, along those lines, I opted not to try tracking down Laplace just for the sake of this party. Our promise to fight together was still ongoing; if he ever needed any help, I was planning to give it. For now, though, I thought it better to leave him alone.</p>
<p>So I returned to our capital city of Rimuru, where I received some rather unexpected news.</p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-18"></a>One section of the town’s outer border had been burned to the ground.</p>
<p>Geld and his forces had kept the area defended at all times, so fortunately, the damage wasn’t as bad as it looked. They had demolished some of the surrounding buildings in order to create firebreaks, so the number of casualties was kept to a minimum as well.</p>
<p>The lack of fatalities was a great silver lining, but it still wasn’t very pleasant news to be greeted with. Regardless, it was all in the past; no point freaking out about it now. So I decided to be patient and wait for Geld to provide me with his report.</p>
<p>Geld, however, wasn’t the only one waiting in line to brief me.</p>
<p>We were all in the town’s large banquet hall. My top staff, who had outdone themselves once again in this battle, were seated, a small army of attendants—including Shuna, Haruna, and Gobichi’s servants—busily scurrying around and preparing meals for everyone. I wasn’t a great fan of conducting our briefings in this festive atmosphere, but given the urgency, I didn’t have much choice.</p>
<p>Veldora was by my right side. He stubbornly refused to vacate that seat, and it wasn’t like I could ever convince him otherwise. That selfish streak of his was nothing new to me, so I was used to dealing with it. Best not to let it bother me—it was a lot easier to ignore him than try to change his mind about anything.</p>
<p>So he was on my right, and I had Benimaru seated on my left. Shion and Diablo were standing behind me, ready to listen to whatever I had to say. I knew Diablo wouldn’t care, but I really wished Shion would at least dine with me—but no, she insisted on eating later. I guess it’d violate one of her self-imposed rules or whatever, but that was fine.</p>
<p>As for the people giving me reports tonight…</p>
<p>I had Geld in front of me right now. Adalmann was opposite Benimaru, looking uncomfortable. I suppose his evolution had completed successfully, and he seemed a little different to me. I intended to have him lay it out for me later. Ramiris was right in front of Veldora, and Treyni and Beretta were standing behind her, waiting on her hand and foot. Charys, meanwhile, was pouring Veldora’s drinks for her, and Ramiris was too busy stuffing herself to care much about reporting back to me.</p>
<p>“Awww, I always knew you’d be all right, Master! When that reckless, no-good sister of yours blew apart the top levels of my labyrinth, <a id="page-19"></a>I gotta admit, I wasn’t exactly feeling good about our chances—but I still believed we’d be fine if you were around. I wasn’t worried a single bit from the very start!”</p>
<p>Ramiris said all of this with a straight face as she enjoyed a flagon of juice. It was truth intermingled with bald-faced lies, but nobody bothered to point it out.</p>
<p>“Kwaaah-ha-ha-ha! But of course! Even against my sister, I wasn’t the slightest bit intimidated. I simply let my guard down a bit is all—and thanks to that cowardly intruder’s attempt to strike me while I was down, my fight against her was completely spoiled!”</p>
<p><em>Uh-huh.</em></p>
<p>I definitely thought he <em>was</em> intimidated, and honestly, the evolved Velgrynd really was a menace. I gave Veldora no better than even odds to defeat her, besides. Why couldn’t he hold off on the big talk for a change?</p>
<p>That was my opinion anyway. But Veldora was greeted by massive applause nonetheless.</p>
<p>“You never fail to amaze me, Sir Veldora. There is much I could learn from you…,” Charys said, solemnly nodding to himself.</p>
<p>“Truly a tremendous battle. I thought my evolution strengthened me, but now I know just how far I still need to go.”</p>
<p>Benimaru was chiming in, too. And his praise actually seemed genuine, which made Veldora give him a smug smile. But the good times stopped when Ramiris opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“Awww, you’re so careless sometimes, Master. Still, that’s probably gonna be all right!”</p>
<p>“Probably? What do you mean, Ramiris?”</p>
<p><em>You see?</em> I thought. Better to let sleeping dogs lie. Being too loose with your speech has a way of painting you into a corner sometimes.</p>
<p>“Well, you know, with all that <em>he’s</em> doing—but, ah, you’re here now, Master, so I’ve got no worries at all!”</p>
<p><em>He?</em></p>
<p>Ramiris’s words were quite disturbing to me.</p>
<p>“What?! W-well, I…I am invincible, of course, but even I might not be fully on my game every single day…”</p>
<p>Veldora seemed to pick up on what this meant. Now he suddenly began making excuses, perhaps realizing he had dug his own grave. It <a id="page-20"></a>was too late for him, though, and this kind of thing always happened to him anyway, so I didn’t bother fretting over it.</p>
<p>Personally, I was more concerned about Vester sitting in the far corner of the hall. I left Veldora and his pals to their own nonsense and asked the rest of my staff what was up.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">Immediately after Rimuru left for the Empire, everyone who remained behind promptly went into emergency mode. The post-celebration excitement that prevailed across the city was gone in a flash, and that was true for Ramiris and her cohorts as well, as they returned to the innermost chambers of the labyrinth.</p>
<p>The Dragon Lords under their control had completed their evolutions, which cheered Ramiris up considerably—but given Rimuru’s emergency deployment, she was still anxious. Ramiris’s aim in life was to make every day as fun as possible, and with the labyrinth, she felt that she had a glorious paradise that’d make her wish easy to fulfill. After spending so long all alone, fending off the solitude with her elemental spirit friends, this realm had become something precious to her, something she never wanted to lose again. In fact, she was afraid of losing it. She thought things would work out like they usually did as long as Rimuru was around, although she still couldn’t shake off a certain premonition.</p>
<p>But that hunch was right. Veldora’s sister Velgrynd wound up attacking and destroying much of the labyrinth Ramiris saw as her pride and joy. The structure was physically indestructible, but when faced with a True Dragon—a personification of unfair, irrational force—very little was impossible.</p>
<p>When Ramiris first caught sight of Velgrynd, she recalled an old memory that she usually made sure to forget. It was a long time ago, not long after she was born, and back then she recalled witnessing Veldora on a rampage, looking very much like the great Veldanava himself. Veldora the Storm Dragon’s key attribute was wind, but he also had control over space and water. He held sway over a tremendous number of magicules, second only to Veldanava’s, and it was fair to call him a living, raging storm.</p>
<p><a id="page-21"></a>He was the strongest on the planet, a natural disaster in himself, but his two sisters were just as unimaginable. Velgrynd, with her heat-driven powers, bore the attribute of flame, making her the worst match possible for Veldora in a fight, and any difference between their magicule counts paled in comparison to the sheer overwhelming presence she projected.</p>
<p>If anything, though, she was still on the easy side. The <em>real</em> threat was Velzard, the leader of the trio. Her attribute was ice, although its essence was driven not by water but by something else. If anything, Velzard was using the abilities she governed to only <em>pretend</em> she was all about ice, then hoodwink the entire population at large.</p>
<p>Ramiris was aware of this truth, something she had heard from Veldanava himself. Or she knew it at one point. But sadly, after reincarnating herself over the years, the memory had completely escaped her mind—not entirely, but regardless, it’d still take a while for Ramiris to dredge it up.</p>
<p>That’s why she was more than happy to be dealing with Velgrynd right now. If this had been Velzard, Veldora never would’ve stood a chance. The way Ramiris remembered it, a single blow from Velzard’s hand was enough to annihilate the Storm Dragon—that, and she recalled those icy-cold eyes of hers, that cool, self-serving confidence that no other outcome could ever be possible.</p>
<p>Thus, Ramiris’s primary concern at the moment was for Veldora. She was flying in circles around the chamber, unable to calm down.</p>
<p>“Will you be all right, Master?”</p>
<p>Her voice was just as strained as her mind. But she posed the question as a sort of “out” for Veldora, a sign that she wouldn’t berate him for fleeing. But Veldora ignored it.</p>
<p>“Calm yourself! Just sit back and watch me act like the hero I am!”</p>
<p>Somehow, Veldora seemed to have lost all hints of anxiety. It was with supreme self-assurance that he strode out of the labyrinth. The sight was nothing short of dazzling to Ramiris. She knew well how he used to act, and seeing him grow up like this was truly endearing to her.</p>
<p class="space-break">After Veldora set off to face Velgrynd, Ramiris looked around, scanning the faces of those remaining in the Control Center. Charys was <a id="page-22"></a>there, explicitly told by Veldora that he couldn’t join this fight. That much was a sad fact—Charys had nothing against a heat-oriented fighter like Velgrynd.</p>
<p>Beretta was calm and collected as usual. He acted like nothing was amiss at all, which helped Ramiris chill a little as well. He was also in command of the Dryas Doll Dryads, the creatures that had been reborn by Rimuru’s hands; there were twenty-four of them now, curating the labyrinth under Beretta’s supervision, and Rimuru had kept evolving them whenever he had a spare moment to stop by, so they had all become excellent managers.</p>
<p>Treyni was also there, as well as her sisters, Traya and Doreth. They were all caring for Ramiris, their faces as calm and unaffected as normal.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there were Vester, Deeno, and some recent additions to the research staff: Shinji Tanimura, Marc Lauren, and Zhen Liuxing, along with their two apprentice assistants, Lucius and Raymond. This quintet answered to Gadora once the labyrinth was in a state of war, but since Gadora wasn’t on the premises, they were assisting Ramiris in the Control Center instead.</p>
<p>All of them were now looking back at Ramiris, none hiding their apprehension. So she tried to sound as cheerful as possible.</p>
<p>“C’mon, guys! I’m not worried one bit. I’m sure my master will win, in fact—and even if he doesn’t, Rimuru will figure something out. It’s a no-brainer. And besides, as long as he doesn’t let his guard down, my master is invincible!”</p>
<p>This was Ramiris’s way of calming her own nerves. She was certain that Veldora and Rimuru would bring the serenity back to her life in short order.</p>
<p>Then, just when everyone in the room had collected themselves a little, things began happening.</p>

<p class="tx1">“Warning! Intruder!”</p>
<p>Alpha, the chief dryad curator, shouted across the chamber. Everyone who heard it immediately shifted gears and went into battle mode.</p>
<p>“Display on the monitor.”</p>
<p><a id="page-23"></a>Beretta’s order was followed by a split-screen display of the scene. Sighting the figure standing there, Ramiris involuntarily shouted out first.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s an angel! He’s been both physically incarnated and transformed, but I have a feeling he’s gonna be trouble.”</p>
<p>It was a strange sight to see—an outfit of pure white and a God-class weapon that let out a dark, lustrous sheen. The long jet-black hair seemed to shine like a source of light, further accentuating the figure’s beauty. Behind its back were three pairs of wings, which only made the figure more conspicuous.</p>
<p>“Estimated energy figures obtained! This…”</p>
<p>Alpha paused.</p>
<p>“What? Tell us.”</p>
<p>Treyni’s urging snapped him out of it.</p>
<p>“This is just an estimate, but the figure on the forefront has more than three million existence points. The five behind him were all measured at between four and seven hundred thousand.”</p>
<p>Alpha’s statement froze the entire Control Center.</p>
<p>One less-advertised role of the labyrinth was to quantify information on the life-forms that lived within it, in order to build a database. The idea was to monitor the battles waged within its walls and use the gathered data for future crisis-management purposes.</p>
<p>That’s what Alpha was referring to by “existence points,” or EP. It was a numerical statistic derived from a life-form’s magicule count and physical ability, plus the energy contained within whatever armor was equipped, although it didn’t attempt to evaluate a target’s actual combat ability. It was impossible to measure a person’s honed skills and techniques, so one’s EP was considered a reference value and little more—but it was still useful for statistical purposes. Used correctly, they expected it to help strengthen the labyrinth’s defenses; it allowed them to estimate the approximate threat level of an enemy by hitting them with an opponent of roughly the same EP value.</p>
<p>This was all still in the trial stage, however, and the program didn’t yet have all the data they needed. Statistical anomalies still ran rampant across the system. For example, there were seasoned fighters like Hakuro, whose existence points were at around 60,000 but could still storm over foes with an EP several times that. An even more notable <a id="page-24"></a>exception was Gobta, whose EP was just under 20,000—the weakest among those ranked an A in skill—but on the field he was stronger than Bovix and Equix, each given an EP of 130,000 or so. Given those cases, most everyone working in the labyrinth assumed that one’s EP ought to be taken as a guide, not the final verdict on someone’s strength.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It should be noted that within the land of Tempest, one’s EP rating was also tied to their rank at the local Free Guild, to wit:</p>
<div class="epigraph">
<table id="T0001">
<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>EP</strong></td>
<td><strong>Guild Rank</strong></td>

<tr>

</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>Ten thousand was an enormous wall for people to pass, but overcoming it brought you into the first class of strength. That earned you a Guild rank of A and a threat level of Hazard. Making it up to 100,000, though—that earned you a Special A rank and the threat level of Calamity. Demon lords had an EP of at least 200,000; based on Rimuru’s hunches, Frey and Clayman (before his pseudo-awakening) would’ve had an EP of around 400,000. That figure was the yardstick for assigning someone the Guild rank of S, along with the threat level of Disaster.</p>
<p>However, an S rank didn’t mean a demon lord by Tempest standards, given how a lot of the nation’s top executives were as powerful as old-style demon lords. The Tempest government wanted to keep things simpler, so they built their own standards beyond this point. That’s where things like the Catastrophe threat level came in, currently applied only to True Dragons and Guy Crimson.</p>
<p>Other “awakened” superpowers were assigned the class of Special <a id="page-25"></a>S. The pseudo-awakened Clayman never stabilized his magicule count before reaching his end, but as Rimuru commented, <em>“I’d say his EP woulda been around seven or eight hundred thousand?”</em> Thus, “Special S” was defined as an EP of 800,000 or higher, and those lucky few with an EP over a million were collectively referred to as the Million Class.</p>
<p>For the sake of reference, an Arch Demon’s EP was always fixed at 140,000, no matter who summoned them. That number was uniformly the same for all of them, as if they had all reached some kind of cosmic upper limit. Even Testarossa and her friends were recorded as having a 140,000 EP when they first came on to the scene, and while there was no way to verify it at this point, Ramiris and her team were certain there was no mistake about it.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“A Million Class member,” said Ramiris, struggling to find the words. “And if so, the first thing that comes to mind is that these are seraphim, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>“A high-level angel,” a nodding Beretta added, “who has transformed into one? Very troubling indeed. And even those following it are S-class. With our floor bosses asleep at the moment, engaging them could pose quite a challenge.”</p>
<p>“B-but we have to do something, don’t we?” Ramiris replied, panicking a bit.</p>
<p>Treyni offered her a smile, trying to assuage her. “Yes, we do, Lady Ramiris. Allow me to set off.”</p>
<p>Traya and Doreth stood up, following her lead.</p>
<p>“As will I, of course.”</p>
<p>“Allow me to join you, my sister!”</p>
<p>But this did little to calm Ramiris’s nerves. In fact, she panicked even more.</p>
<p>“W-wait a minute! I know you’ve all gotten stronger, sure, but there’s no way you beat him in the stats!”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee… That will not be a problem. One’s EP is nothing more than a guide…and now, we will prove just how strong your followers truly are.”</p>
<p>Traya and Doreth nodded their eager agreement. Ramiris really <a id="page-26"></a>wanted to stop them, but nobody had any better ideas. They didn’t, but she truly loved Treyni and her kin, and as their master, pushing them directly into harm’s way like this didn’t seem like an acceptable option at all.</p>
<p>“No, I can’t allow this! Like Rimuru and my master always tell me, we only fight battles we know we can win!”</p>
<p>They would have to put the labyrinth in full operation and buy as much time as they could. In the meantime, Ramiris thought, they’d just have to hope things somehow got better. She knew that was escaping reality, but nothing else came to mind.</p>
<p>But it was Charys who admonished her.</p>
<p>“Lady Ramiris, I’m afraid a stalling approach will be too difficult to pull off. We cannot approach the level of the sleeping floor bosses in a fight, and if we leave things as they stand, we risk seeing the labyrinth’s most vital facilities destroyed. I think the only choice is to intercept them on the surface. I will join them in this endeavor, so if you could grant me your permission…”</p>
<p>With Veldora absent, the strongest person in the Control Center was currently Charys. That must’ve been why he was so determined to do something here.</p>
<p>“Lord Beretta, I entrust Lady Ramiris’s protection to you.”</p>
<p>“Very well. Protected she will remain.”</p>
<p>Beretta didn’t need to be reminded. If the dryads were setting out to battle, he was by default the only one who could keep Ramiris guarded.</p>
<p>Shinji and the others, not wanting to be left behind, also spoke up.</p>
<p>“We’ll do our best, too!”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes indeed. As long as we’re being taken care of here, we need to return the favor.”</p>
<p>“…Yes. We have our Resurrection Bracelets; we can keep fighting through death itself.”</p>
<p>“Yeah… Well, being an imperial soldier, I have no reason to complain if I’m killed. I’d like to prove to everyone here that I’m more useful alive, at least.”</p>
<p>“Right. Otherwise, Lord Gadora’s likely to be enraged.”</p>
<p>So the atmosphere in the Control Center was relaxed, everyone pleasantly chatting as this mind-boggling foe loomed before them. Ramiris took a deep breath, then erupted into a big ol’ smile.</p>
<p><a id="page-27"></a>“Well, if that’s what you all’re saying, then have at it! Gimme everything you got! As long as I’m around, you can die all you want, so don’t go easy, y’hear? And I’ll send my Dragon Lords over when they’re ready, so you better be sure you win for me!”</p>
<p>Everyone nodded their agreement—and then, taking up the roles they were given, they swiftly moved into action.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">The intruder whose presence Ramiris had picked up on was Zarario, the leader of the forces under the mystic lord Feldway’s direct command. He was a former seraphim, but with his two companions, he ruled as one of the Three Mystic Leaders, the trio that controlled the mystics.</p>
<p>Each of them served as an army commander leading a vast force of their own, and normally they’d be nowhere near the front lines. This time, however, Feldway had given him explicit orders. He was to take advantage of Velgrynd’s laying waste to the labyrinth and take out his assigned target at once. Feldway had told him what happened to the imperial troops who had attacked the labyrinth before, and Zarario, reasoning that such a weak force would be nothing but a nuisance, decided that he ought to come to this labyrinth himself.</p>
<p>Five of his generals accompanied him. All of them were high-level angels, classified as cherubim or throni depending on rank, and by becoming mystics, they had gained magicule counts comparable to a demon lord’s. Their physical bodies were much more fragile, but in the labyrinth’s environment, that wasn’t much of a problem—since the natural diffusion of magic force was suppressed down there, they’d all be able to fully leverage their abilities.</p>
<p>So Zarario was casually strolling toward the labyrinth—but, of course, he was interrupted. As soon as he found the stairs and descended underground, he felt the physical space around him shift. He and his entourage paused a moment, not panicking but calmly looking around to see what was going on.</p>
<p>What appeared before their eyes was a closed, empty space, around eight figures in the center.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… Looks like we’re being welcomed. Best be courteous to them—we don’t want to be disrespectful.”</p>
<p><a id="page-28"></a>At Zarario’s words, the generals under his command nodded silently. The two sides approached each other, stopping only when they were almost face-to-face.</p>
<p class="space-break">Treyni was the first to step forward.</p>
<p>“It is nice to meet all of you. My name is Treyni, and on behalf of Lady Ramiris, the master of this labyrinth, I will work with you, along with Charys and my other associates. Now, with that in mind, I don’t remember inviting anyone here, but may I ask who you are and what you want?”</p>
<p>She was smiling with her lips, but not at all with her eyes. She was ready to react to anything that might happen, keeping a constant lookout for her opponent’s moves. Before coming here, she had powered herself up as much as possible; she could summon a wind elemental lord housed within within her and make full use of its powers. Considering she had summoned only the high-level elemental Sylphide for her prolonged battle against Laplace earlier, Treyni was clearly pulling out all the stops from the first move.</p>
<p>The EP of an elemental lord, based on its magicule count, was around a million. For Treyni, whose own EP didn’t exceed 600,000, it was almost too much a weight to bear—but she was within the labyrinth and therefore able to be resurrected. So she was using up her full force for the upcoming fight, not worrying about any long-term effects on her body.</p>
<p>Charys, one step behind her, was just as revved up to fight; even if his opponent had twice as many magicules, that wasn’t going to faze him for a moment. He’d had the almighty Veldora in all his overwhelming glory as a training partner this whole time. He had friends here, people he could trust—even people like Gobta who could beat opponents several times more powerful than themselves. Thus, Charys didn’t doubt their victory for a moment.</p>
<p>The same was true for the Dragon Lords. Rimuru had given them names as a reward, and they had now evolved into loyal servants of Ramiris. Their power gave them EP scores of around 70,000, and further experience could bring them into the Special S level. Fear didn’t register in their minds—they were just itching to test out their powers.</p>
<p><a id="page-29"></a>Traya and Doreth had also completed their spiritual Unification with Sylphide. Traya was assigned to work with the Dragon Lords against their enemy’s entourage, while Doreth was providing support for Treyni and Charys. Berretta’s EP was about 400,000, but his skills far surpassed that—he was a valuable asset in battle, but as Ramiris’s bodyguard, he couldn’t leave her side. Thus, at the present moment, this was the best lineup the labyrinth team could assemble.</p>
<p>If this powerhouse team should be defeated, however… Well, in that case, they’d have to stage a last stand with everyone else on hand, Rigurd and Gobta chief among them. They were busy gathering their forces on the next-highest labyrinth floor for just that purpose, and that’s why they needed as much time as they could earn.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody here was going up intending to lose.</p>
<p>“This is quite a surprise. I had heard that we wouldn’t find much resistance left in the labyrinth, so I certainly wasn’t expecting to see this gauntlet of worthy challengers. How fascinating. I’m quite excited, in fact… Ah, but allow me to introduce myself. My name is Zarario, one of the Three Mystic Leaders entrusted with an army by the mystic lord Feldway. It is a pleasure.”</p>
<p>Zarario bowed gracefully, his movements refined, as if he were a famed stage actor. But there was no emotion at all behind his speech. He was clearly condescending to Treyni and the others; they barely even registered in his mind. It annoyed Treyni to no end, but she wasn’t foolish enough to lose her temper at this point. Bravely trying to keep her composure, she continued with the conversation.</p>
<p>“I see… Zarario of the Three Mystic Leaders? With all due respect, I’m not sure I’ve heard that name before.”</p>
<p>Zarario returned the muted provocation with a smile. “No, I’m sure you haven’t. We are rather well known over in other worlds, but we’ve been…<em>away</em> from this one for a long while. I suppose we must seem like quite an alien presence here.”</p>
<p>“Alien…?”</p>
<p>“Indeed. Not that we intend to let that stop us.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Ah, right, but you asked what we wanted, yes? I’ll gladly inform you, of course. In fact, if you could cooperate with us, I think it would save us all a lot of trouble.”</p>
<p><a id="page-30"></a>“That will depend on what you have in mind.”</p>
<p>“Very well, then. Our objection is to eliminate a boy by the name of Masayuki Honjo. If you will offer him to me instead of keeping him hidden, I will withdraw at once.”</p>
<p>What Zarario offered, his gentle good looks framing his soft, almost feminine voice, was a declaration that he’d kill Masayuki. Nobody was offering their agreement. Masayuki was Rimuru’s friend, as well as an irreplaceable companion for Treyni and the rest.</p>
<p>“Ridiculous. I fear there is no room for negotiation.”</p>
<p>“I see. That’s a pity.”</p>
<p>Zarario smiled, not bothering to hide that he didn’t find it a pity at all. Then, at the next moment, the fight began.</p>

<p class="tx1">Treyni set off first, propelling herself into the air. From above, she sent a swarm of countless unseen blades flying toward Zarario. This was Invisible Blade, a lethal move that couldn’t be dodged—this was not just a bladelike rupture in the air caused by compression but it was also granted the air elemental attribute, making it capable of shearing through dimensions. It was impossible to perceive and could be unleashed with no preliminary casting or other movement, showing just how menacing a force a riled Treyni could be.</p>
<p>But she was just mismatched this time. <em>Far</em> too mismatched. Zarario didn’t take a single step—not because he failed to notice the blades but because he didn’t even need to evade them. Just as the invisible blades seemed ready to slice through him, they disappeared. A distortion in space had manifested, neatly covering the surface of Zarario’s body. There was a skill close to this one recorded in the labyrinth’s database; it was in the family of spatial defensive zones that Zegion was an expert at devising. Nothing could be more absolute in terms of defense; it could nullify all element-driven attacks and even handle ruptures in space.</p>
<p>“Wha…?!”</p>
<p>“The same skill as Lord Zegion’s, huh? Nasty.”</p>
<p>“Hoh? From the way you’re talking, this skill isn’t a novelty to you, then? And you spoke of a Zegion just now? I was told all of this <a id="page-31"></a>nation’s top leaders had been taken out of the picture, but it seems our intelligence was faulty…”</p>
<p>Despite Zarario’s tone, his face was as cool as ever. He clearly wasn’t taking any of them seriously yet; in fact, he appeared to savor this. That’s why Treyni looked so stern. Exchanging glances with Charys, she immediately changed her approach—instead of trying to defeat Zarario by force, she concentrated on stalling for time.</p>
<p>This seemed like a wise move. After all, the five generals Zarario had brought with him were having a noticeably difficult time against the labyrinthine forces. The Dragon Lords had been constantly training for battle, and now they were leaving nothing off the table skill-wise. Besides that, they were fighting on their home turf, which made all the Tempest forces as good as immortal. That let them fight well beyond their physical limits, and in an evenly matched battle, that allowed them to notch some scarily one-sided victories.</p>
<p><em>This could work</em>, Treyni thought. Zarario was a grave threat, but the other enemies would be dispatched soon enough. If they kept up their current momentum and worked as a team, a little space-distorting defense could be broken through in time. Worst-case scenario, they could just wait for Zarario to wear himself out.</p>
<p><em>That’s right. As long as we can keep driving them back, we’ll achieve our objectives for victory here. No need to push ourselves too hard…but why is he acting so unconcerned about all of this…?</em></p>
<p>Treyni thought she should have a distinct advantage. But she couldn’t shake off her uneasiness—all thanks to Zarario, whose attitude was unflappable as ever. Anyone with a decent amount of common sense wouldn’t fail to read the war situation here, and Zarario had to have more than that—he said he was the general of an army. It’d normally be impossible for someone who had demon lord–level behemoths serving him to make such a rudimentary error in judgment.</p>
<p><em>His mission is to eliminate Masayuki the Hero…? No!</em></p>
<p>Thinking about it, if Masayuki was the only target, assassinating him would be easy. Zarario’s sky-high EP had completely distracted them all from that possibility.</p>
<p>(Lady Ramiris! Do you know where Sir Masayuki is located?)</p>
<p>(Huh? Why that out of nowhere? Of course I do.)</p>
<p>Ramiris quickly answered the Thought Communication. She wasn’t <a id="page-32"></a>just leisurely watching this battle. These intruders were a big problem, yes—but more important was evacuating the city residents. Now that Veldora had gone to battle, the urban area they had forcibly transported within the labyrinth was no longer fully safe. If Veldora should be defeated, the city would automatically revert to its original position. Ramiris alone didn’t have enough magic power to keep it in place; there was nothing she could do if it happened.</p>
<p>It was thus necessary to evacuate at least the residents, just in case. Fortunately, there was enough open space on Floor 95 (functioning as Floor 100 at the moment) to deploy a decent-sized army. They couldn’t allow regular citizens into the labyrinth’s research facilities, but the floor overall was more than big enough for all the city’s residents. Once Beretta pointed out that fact to Ramiris, she’d hurriedly sprung into action, and now the evacuation was underway.</p>
<p>(I need you to ensure he is safe immediately!)</p>
<p>(I think you’re worrying too much. Those are the only intruders so far, you know…)</p>
<p>Ramiris, despite her internal griping about how busy she was, answered Treyni’s request. Just as she thought, Masayuki was safe and sound.</p>
<p>(Hmm, yep, he looks all right. He’s in the city now, helping guide the evacuees out of there.)</p>
<p>Just as Ramiris said, Masayuki was playing a major role in the effort, helping to keep the citizens calm. If he wasn’t there, there might’ve been enough mass panic to lethally delay the evacuation. It was times like these that Masayuki’s innate skills really came into their own.</p>
<p>So the situation down there was peaceful, with no signs of battle. If there <em>were</em> any signs, Ramiris (as the chief controller of the labyrinth) would know about it at once. Treyni, hearing all that, finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>(All right. That’s a relief, then…)</p>
<p>Nonetheless, she seemed unconvinced.</p>
<p>(Are you worried?) Ramiris asked her.</p>
<p>(Well, if the enemy tried taking Masayuki’s life, I’m afraid the evacuees could get caught in the crossfire.)</p>
<p>Even Treyni felt this was overthinking matters. Nevertheless, something in the back of her mind was alerting her to consider every possibility just in case.</p>
<p><a id="page-33"></a>(Well, all right! If you’re that insistent on it, Treyni, I’ll have Masayuki’s gang go up to Floor 70!)</p>
<p>That, finally, satisfied Treyni. Floor 70 was currently home to the surviving remnants of the imperial forces. Even if some assassins showed up, those soldiers would boast enough resistance to buy them some time.</p>
<p>(That would certainly put my mind at ease.)</p>
<p>(Right? Yeah!)</p>
<p>So Masayuki was dispatched to Floor 70.</p>

<p class="tx1">Masayuki sighed to himself.</p>
<p><em>People around here treat me with no respect at all…</em></p>
<p>From Rimuru on down, all the big shots just loved acting on the slightest whim that popped into their heads. These weren’t ground-level minions—they really needed to consider their position and act with more caution. Not that all of them were like that, but…</p>
<p>“Don’t you think, like, they should be more worried about <em>my</em> take on things, like how Shuna is?”</p>
<p>Those were Masayuki’s true feelings coming out. If an elegant, beautiful woman like Shuna asked him to do something, Masayuki would have no complaints. That’s why he was so delighted to help with this evacuation…but now Ramiris was interrupting him. <em>“Hey, so I want you up on Floor 70 ASAP!”</em> she forcefully ordered without a moment’s hesitation.</p>
<p>Masayuki was less than excited about this. But despite appearances, Ramiris had a lot of power to work with. She had Veldora’s backing, and she was also one of the people who knew Masayuki’s secret. No matter what she said, there was no way he could defy her.</p>
<p>“Ah, give it up. Lady Ramiris doesn’t mean anything bad by it—they’re just stretched thin is all. Sir Veldora himself went out to fight, too. It’s an emergency no matter how you slice it.”</p>
<p>The young man speaking to Masayuki, walking along with him, wore a snake-shaped earring, a rugged-looking wristwatch, and a skull ring on his finger. His shirt was a sickly looking shade of purple, covered by a spiked leather jacket; this was matched with long, shiny <a id="page-34"></a>black leather pants, accompanied by a skirtlike piece of fabric around the waist. It was punk fashion through and through; clearly this guy wasn’t an honor student.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the type Masayuki usually got along with, but strangely enough, they had hit it off pretty well. That was probably because, much like Masayuki, this man had gone through a lot in life. He called himself Venom, and according to him, he was always being forced by his bosses to deliver the impossible in his work. Masayuki felt a kind of kinship with him, because he saw a lot of himself in the guy—as Venom had rather succinctly put it, <em>“I have no human rights.”</em></p>
<p>Now Masayuki had Venom as his bodyguard, because that’s what Venom’s bosses had ordered him to do. He hadn’t seen Jiwu or Bernie since all that stuff went down—it’d just be too awkward—and he and Jinrai had split up as well. That was at Masayuki’s suggestion; he knew his entire life was one big bluff, so there was no way he could ensure his pal’s safety. Fortunately, Jinrai was open to the idea: “<em>If you need me</em>,” he’d told Masayuki, “<em>just say the word! Until then, I’ll keep my skills sharp working for this nation’s Guild.</em>” So now he was employed by Tempest’s Guild, providing behind-the-scenes support for Masayuki’s exploits. It made the Hero feel a tad lonely, but it still came as a relief. Now that he didn’t have to lie to his own friends, a heavy guilt was lifted from his shoulders.</p>
<p>So Masayuki had been by himself—and then Venom showed up. Venom knew just how weak Masayuki was; he was there to protect him, and despite appearances, he actually lent an ear to what he had to say. Venom had been told to cooperate with Masayuki so his reputation didn’t get tarnished, which was in line with what Rimuru wanted as well, and Masayuki wasn’t shy about taking advantage. Thanks to that, they had quickly built a friendship based on trust.</p>
<p>“Yeah, so I know this is an emergency and all, but why would someone portraying a Hero figure like me try to actively run away from everyone in town, is what I’m asking.”</p>
<p>“But you’re a wimp, man. If the enemy <em>really</em> attacks, you can’t do squat, can you?”</p>
<p>“No, but… Yes, I <em>know</em> that! But that doesn’t make this right, does it? All those anxious gazes upon me… They bite into me, you know?”</p>
<p>They didn’t have to say anything. Masayuki could hear them <a id="page-35"></a>pleading with him, <em>Don’t go, don’t go</em>, anyway. That’s why he was so dissatisfied with Ramiris’s order.</p>
<p>In Venom’s eyes, though, the issue lay elsewhere. Floor 70 was clearly going to be safer than Floor 100. That’s because even if you didn’t count the imperial forces among their war power, the research facilities on Floor 70 had the overcomer vampires waiting in the wings. They were currently taking care of the children, so the way Venom saw it, Masayuki could come under their protection once he got there. To Venom, the mission Diablo gave him was the most important matter at hand—he needed to literally risk his life to ensure Masayuki survived.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, I know how your just being there helps people feel better. But the evacuations are pretty close to complete now, and Floor 100’s well protected, so…”</p>
<p>Practically speaking, if an enemy was powerful enough to make it this far, nothing short of the floor bosses would stop them. Floor 60 was largely undefended—Gadora was absent, and Shinji’s team had pulled out. Floor 70 was thus serving as their first line of defense.</p>
<p>“So you mean I’d be in <em>more</em> danger up there?!”</p>
<p>Venom nodded. “I suppose so. But don’t worry, man. I’m here. And it’s my job to protect you.”</p>
<p>“Mmmm, well, that’s what I’m hoping for, but…”</p>
<p>Masayuki understood the situation he was in. If he was being transferred to the front lines in this situation, it meant some enemy was likely targeting him and him alone. Otherwise there’d be no reason for Ramiris to expose someone as helpless as he was to even more danger. Masayuki had a Resurrection Bracelet, so he’d be quickly resurrected after any death in the labyrinth. It seemed clear Ramiris wanted to use him as bait for the enemy.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re probably right. Plus, I’m sure she didn’t want to get other civilians caught in the fight. They might realize how much of a wimp you are, besides. Following this order is just the right thing to do, y’know?”</p>
<p>“I know that, yeah, but I got <em>my</em> say in this, too…”</p>
<p>Jiwu and Bernie were on Floor 70. The awkwardness of running into them was a problem for Masayuki as well.</p>
<p>“I dunno what they’re up to, but if they were just following orders, try not to hate on ’em too much, okay? Even if they tried to kill you, it’s <a id="page-36"></a>not like they <em>really</em> wanted to, deep down. Humans are all complicated like that; it’s not like monsters. That’s what makes them such great toys for demons.”</p>
<p>Masayuki glared at the grinning Venom. <em>I can’t move on that easily</em>, he thought—but as Venom said, it was hard to read someone’s true feelings, and not even he could find it in himself to fully hate Jiwu and Bernie. Dwelling on it would only hurt him.</p>
<p>So Masayuki finally resigned himself to his fate once they reached Floor 70 and he witnessed the construction site the imperial forces were stationed around. “Well, stop using <em>me</em> as a toy, too,” he shot at his newfound friend, shaking his head to drive away his emotions. Venom smiled, knowing he wasn’t actually angry. Protecting Masayuki was his duty, but Venom took a personal liking to him as well.</p>
<p>They were both nervous pessimists by nature. And Venom couldn’t help but respect the guy. He might seem like a twig in a river, letting the currents take him where they would, but he still kept a fierce sense of self-will. Venom saw himself as a natural-born rebel as well, but something told him he couldn’t hold a candle to Masayuki.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Well, that depends on you— <em>Mm?!</em>”</p>
<p>Just as he was about to jab at him in return, he stepped up to defend Masayuki against the presence that suddenly appeared before them.</p>
<p>“Who the hell are you?”</p>
<p>“Tch! A meddler, huh? And I thought my timing was perfect. I’m not used to this body enough to react quickly, then?”</p>
<p>The figure ignored Venom, giving Masayuki an annoyed look instead. There was something clearly unearthly about him, something Masayuki couldn’t hide his agitation about.</p>
<p>There had been no sign of him at all before that moment, but now the aura he emitted was nothing short of overwhelming. On his back were three pairs of folded wings, only serving to further emphasize his virile, masculine physique. The well-defined muscles were virtually chiseled into his pale skin, exposed for the world to see. But what struck observers the most was his gaze. It housed a sinister, ghastly light, like a vicious carnivore—and a wounded one at that, something no one could ever approach.</p>
<p>“Don’t ignore me!” Venom shouted as he unleashed a high roundhouse <a id="page-38"></a>kick. It was a beautiful, textbook move, and it traveled toward the target’s temple like a magnet.</p>
