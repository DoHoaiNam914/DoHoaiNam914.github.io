<p><em>I really wish people would stop joking with me…</em></p>
<p>That was exactly how he felt. He’d thought he was victorious, and here came this brand-new enemy—and apparently the point behind all this was to make him show off his skill set.</p>
<p><em>I knew it! Rimuru’s so damn treacherous that way. He was bound to try something like this!</em></p>
<p>His mission was clearly a failure. He had failed to score Ramiris, and now his own escape was looking questionable.</p>
<p><em>I mean, when did they get Ramiris out of here anyway? I was in this room the whole time, and I saw her talking to me. Was she long gone by the time she turned into that butterfly?</em></p>
<p>If it wasn’t that, Zegion must’ve gotten Ramiris out of there in a way Deeno couldn’t pick up on.</p>
<p><em>But then…have I been talking to an illusion this entire time?</em></p>
<p>That, too, was a problem. Deeno possessed an ultimate skill and a brilliant talent for hypnosis, and yet he’d fallen for some magic illusion? That was unthinkable…but he couldn’t call it impossible. If Zegion had an ultimate skill geared toward mentally oriented attacks…perhaps he could conjure something that even Deeno would be fooled by.</p>
<p>And he knew just how strong Zegion was. He was a humanoid magic-born, a powerful insectoid type and potential demon-lord seed. Thanks to the favor of the demon lord Rimuru, he had gained near-impossible levels of fighting force. With Veldora as his master, his fighting level might even surpass the Primal Demons.</p>
<p>This made him the undisputed master of the labyrinth. When the Empire invaded this realm, his overwhelming strength had driven them all away, a feat Deeno was around to witness. In his eyes, Zegion was all but unbeatable in hand-to-hand combat…but physical attacks were all he had showed off. He never tried any kind of spirit-based strike, and it seemed to Deeno that he lacked even a unique skill, much less an ultimate.</p>
<p><em>…I mean, his Distortion Field was impressive enough to reach the “ultimate” realm, maybe, but…</em></p>
<p>But that was still a physical ability. To Deeno, more gifted in mentally driven strikes, it felt manageable.</p>
<p><a id="page-91"></a>The only explanation for this was that celebration the other day. Rimuru infused some sort of people into Zegion then, in the name of providing a reward. He was awakening his servants and calling it an “evolution ceremony” or the like. Some of them, like Gabil, really <em>did</em> gain a bunch of power, with others going into an evolutionary sleep. It was all eerily reminiscent of a Harvest Festival, and if Zegion emerged from it with a new skill or two, it certainly made sense.</p>
<p><em>But isn’t this weird? How can those serving Rimuru reach the same levels that he has?! I get it if an awakened demon lord’s underlings reach seed proportions themselves, but if they’re all as powerful as awakened demon lords, that’s just cheating way too much!</em></p>
<p>Deeno, with all the years he had lived, could never have predicted this. Not even Guy could ever pull off something like that.</p>
<p><em>…Well, I could go on and on about him. The moment he made a Primal serve him, I knew he was crazy right then. Nothing’s off the table with him.</em></p>
<p>Internally, Deeno ranted against Rimuru for a few more moments. Those three girls, the most powerful of living demons, probably could’ve stopped him in his tracks. Regardless of what their EP stats were, it didn’t really matter if they were Primals. And Rimuru had recruited them like he was running a bowling team. It was just <em>weird</em>, and he wanted to be involved with him as little as he could.</p>
<p>And now Zegion, standing before him, was every bit a Primal’s equal. Clearly, something strange was up. It wasn’t just that he was Million Class—his sheer aura hummed with endless force. His ability defied all numbers. It was the atmosphere that only someone who obtained ultimate power could exude. It suggested that he, too, gained an ultimate skill, just as Deeno had.</p>
<p><em>This is exactly why I hate working so much…</em></p>
<p>He wailed inside at the bad hand he’d been dealt. Then he sighed, a clear tinge of resignation to it, as he groped around for a potential best solution, but no good ideas came to him that easily. And then time stopped waiting for him.</p>

<p class="tx1">As Deeno spent a short while pondering, the unaffected Zegion strode forward.</p>
<p><a id="page-92"></a>“Did you have any last words?” Zegion asked.</p>
<p>“You were hiding here, watching until I revealed my secrets, huh? Come the hell on, man. That’s dirty!”</p>
<p>Ignoring his own dirty deeds for the moment, Deeno vented his frustrations to start with. It was little more than lashing out, but if it riled his opponent at all, that’d be to his benefit.</p>
<p>“Ha. It’s called war.”</p>
<p>Zegion was, of course, undeterred.</p>
<p>“I know!” Deeno countered, and that was the end of the exchange.</p>
<p>Tension coursed between them. Deeno knew how strong Zegion was—a fact he could call an advantage. But Zegion now knew the full extent of his own skills. A frontal assault was the only option…but close-range combat was Zegion’s specialty, and although it wasn’t confirmed yet, he likely possessed an ultimate skill, too. Deeno, meanwhile, was more about spirit attacks—unless he used his <em>true</em> finisher move, but he wanted to avoid that in the labyrinth.</p>
<p><em>Well, I already blew my cover in a lot of ways, but yeah, that really needs to end here…</em></p>
<p>Besides, Deeno kidded himself, if escape was all that mattered, he was probably still safe on that count.</p>
<p>“Not coming for me?”</p>
<p>Zegion’s words were heavy. The question seemed to bolt him to the floor, but Deeno used his willpower to fight back.</p>
<p>“Ha! Don’t you look down on me. I’m part of the Octagram, you know, and I’ve lived way longer than you. No way am I gonna lose to a little kitten like you!”</p>
<p>He whipped his large blade up high and swung it down toward Zegion.</p>
<p>“Take this, and breathe your last! Fallen Strike!!”</p>
<p>This was no tit-for-tat exchange of blows. He meant to end it here with this massive move, as befitting someone as lazy as Deeno was.</p>
<p>And Fallen Strike certainly had the punch for it. By infusing his sword with his unique skill Sloth, Deeno had created an ever-changing illusory battle style that tricked his opponent and allowed him to control the fight. Now that skill had evolved into Belphegor, its effects multiplied many times over, so his illusory sword style was more polished than ever. He may have hated taking action, but Deeno’s battle sense was undeniable.</p>
<p>Even so…</p>
<p><a id="page-93"></a>Deeno had decided that close-range combat with Zegion was a little too dicey. If his abilities failed to work on him, the illusory sword style would fail on him. Now, he figured, was no time to hold anything back—so he broke out one of his special moves. That was Fallen Strike, one of the few traditional sword moves in his illusory style, and he packed all of his muscle into it.</p>
<p>His intention: to defang his opponent. Now his blade was infused with negative waves of emotion, robbing his foe of the will to live if it so much as scraped his skin. It wasn’t an illusion or hallucination someone could ignore; for the weak-hearted, it was impossible to resist.</p>
<p>Only those with a strong enough mind to obtain an ultimate skill could fight it off, and even then, they wouldn’t emerge unscathed. The slothful will Deeno infused in the strike packed a physically destructive effect inside. Even if you dodged it, it emitted negative waves in all directions, and simply being exposed to them would sap your mental drive…and thus, your ability to battle. He could capitalize on that to strike the final blow off the follow-through, and then it’d be over. The move cornered his foe in so many ways, making it one of the best Deeno could make, a masterpiece he had complete confidence in.</p>
<p>If Deeno wanted to leave this room alive, his best bet was to defeat Zegion without holding back. He liked to hide all his best moves, but if it made life easier for him, he wouldn’t skimp on them, either.</p>
<p><em>Not even Guy would look all that great if he took a direct hit from this. Think you can fare any better?</em></p>
<p>Deeno grinned, all but assured of his opponent’s death. It’d be impossible, he reasoned, for anybody to expect this major strike from someone so demonstrably lazy in life. Now, he thought, singing his own praises in his mind, everything was back on track.</p>
<p>Zegion didn’t move. Not because he couldn’t react in time but because he had no problem dealing with this. Reading the path of Deeno’s blade, he stopped it just before it landed on its target. Fangsmasher, the mighty God-class greatsword, had enough force to crush any type of matter in the world—but even when it was swung down on him, the exoskeleton covering Zegion’s left hand, now converted into crimson steel, easily blocked it.</p>
<p>“Damn fool!” Deeno shouted. “You didn’t even try to dodge my blade! The battle is mine!”</p>
<p><a id="page-94"></a>Now, he thought, acting like such a lazy bum all this time had finally paid off. It wasn’t really an act, to be honest, but he kidded himself into thinking so.</p>
<p>Zegion, as expected, had stopped his high-speed strike. Swords this big lost out in velocity, so that was no surprise. The damage, however, would be untold. Zegion blocked it with one hand, as if swatting something away—it was impressive to see. But now an intense shock wave was coursing through his left arm.</p>
<p><em>Looks like it didn’t crush it outright, but it’ll be useless for a while to come, for sure. I love how he’s just standing there, not even quivering. So much fake bravado!</em></p>
<p>It was almost hateful, how unaffected Zegion looked. But Deeno had won. Zegion’s Distortion Field was an excellent invention, but it could block only physical strikes. Fallen Strike, upgraded to its ultimate level, could penetrate any physical obstacle as it delivered its payload.</p>
<p><em>I put him off guard, made him think it was a sword attack, but actually delivered a lethal spirit strike. My strategy won the day.</em></p>
<p>Yes, Zegion was strong. That, Deeno predicted, was why he was likely to look down on him and try to act as superior as possible. He was best in close range, and this chamber was a perfect arena for that; the way Deeno saw it, there was no way he’d try to evade anything.</p>
<p>“Hmph,” he spat. “I wish you guys would knock this off already. I know that bracelet’s gonna revive you anyway, so I <em>really</em> need to retrieve Ramiris soon…”</p>
<p>He headed for Beretta. But then he stopped. Something felt off. For one thing, Beretta wasn’t even wary of him. After all this battle (plus revealing several of his trump cards), Deeno was running short on magicules. He still wouldn’t lose, but Beretta was acting like he was assured of victory out of nowhere. His face wasn’t visible under the mask, but it still felt creepy somehow.</p>
<p>“You think you can beat me?”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… Don’t be silly. Whether I could or not is irrelevant; I am not your opponent.”</p>
<p>The moment he heard that, Deeno was struck with an intense chill. In a frenzy, he turned toward Zegion—and yes, there was something unnatural about that stationary figure. The fact that he wasn’t <a id="page-95"></a>pulverized by a God-class strike proved that his left arm was God-equivalent. That meant he could have a will strong enough to work as a spiritual life-form. All that deliberating over whether he had an ultimate skill seemed pointless now. The evidence was clearly on the “yes” side.</p>
<p>“No way…!”</p>
<p>“Let me ask you—does your attack have a delayed effect? Because otherwise, did you think a passing breeze like <em>that</em> strike could defeat me?”</p>
<p><em>Goddamn it</em>, Deeno thought. Zegion really <em>did</em> have an ultimate skill. Exactly what kind was unclear, but if it could nullify his spiritual attack, it had to be exceptional.</p>
<p>“You were wondering if I possessed an ultimate skill, weren’t you? If so, you should have pieced several attacks together instead of that meager swipe. You need to realize that your laziness cost you the victory.”</p>
<p><em>Don’t act like you won this</em>, Deeno almost screamed. Instead, Zegion thrust his left fist at him. His fingers opened outward, and from them, five beams of light shot out.</p>
<p>It was his Dimension Ray.</p>
<p>“Owww…”</p>
<p>Leaping away to dodge it, Deeno just barely avoided lethal damage. It came, however, at the cost of his right arm, which was now severed at the elbow.</p>
<p>The pain made him want to cry, but there was no time for it. His instincts were warning him that he truly <em>was</em> in danger if this continued.</p>
<p>“You really <em>did</em> find an ultimate. Didn’t you, you bastard? I didn’t expect you to neutralize Fallen Thanatos as well… Are you telling me spirit attacks don’t work on you?”</p>
<p>Fallen Thanatos was a lethal spiritual attack Deeno had instilled in his Fallen Strike just now. It acted strictly on the minds of its targets, so even if his foe was a Replication or the like, it would still impact the actual person, no matter how far away he was.</p>
<p>It was a sure-kill move, no escape possible, but Zegion was totally undeterred. Deeno could hardly believe it, and he was right to. If he wanted to win—or, really, if he wanted to escape here alive—he needed to solve this mystery. So he asked Zegion, knowing full well an answer was not likely to arrive.</p>
<p><a id="page-96"></a>“I have no duty to inform you why.”</p>
<p>Zegion, naturally, was unmoved. But his bitter voice continued.</p>
<p>“…But you are so pitiful, I will dignify your question with a reply. I am an illusion, a ghost. From the very beginning, you were wrapped around my finger. I have been granted the title of Mist Lord, ruler of the phantom realm, and now you realize that no spirit attacks can faze me!”</p>
<p>It was the strong offering mercy to the weak. Hearing it, Deeno quickly arrived at the truth—and then he was shocked. If his skill had been nullified, it meant his foe’s was stronger. Zegion, he now realized, had evolved into something as good, if not better, than him—the him right <em>now</em>, even.</p>
<p><em>You’ve got to be kidding me! He was this good at close range, but now he’s even better at spirit attacks?! And he’s the ruler of the phantom realm? So he can, like, create independent worlds of his own? Oh man, how much stronger did that bastard get?! No damn way I could beat him with no preparation!</em></p>
<p>Deeno possessed the strongest of sin-based skills, one freshly evolved into an ultimate, but Zegion had shut it completely down. His skill was still unfamiliar, but that was no excuse. Zegion didn’t have an ultimate skill until just recently, either. Deeno was hardly weak, but this time, he had picked the wrong opponent. All too wrong…</p>
<p>The whole idea around attempting to kidnap Ramiris, in fact, was wrong at the core. The moment Zegion completed his evolution, its failure was all but ensured. Realizing this, Deeno turned his face upward—and just then, he was stunned by a person he saw on the screen.</p>
<p><em>Ah, Velgrynd…</em></p>
<p>The beautiful woman was Velgrynd. There was no mistaking that blue hair. She was supposed to be fighting the demon lord Rimuru outside the labyrinth after taking out Veldora, but now she was standing next to Masayuki for some reason. Even more concerning, Cornu was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p><em>No… No, no, no?!</em></p>
<p>He had a bad feeling about this, and those tended not to lie to him. He knew that from experience.</p>
<p><em>Dude, wait a second. Th-this is too much information to handle at once. I can’t keep up with it. So, like, Velgrynd was supposed to be under Feldway’s <a id="page-97"></a>thrall, but was that all a lie? Or did she escape it somehow? Either way, I guess she did Cornu in, huh? That… Wait, wait, this is going way beyond a failed mission now, isn’t it?!</em></p>
<p>Deeno ran Hasten Thought as hard as he could, trying to understand the situation. Soon, though, he concluded that it’d be impossible to keep this operation going, no matter how hard he tried. He might’ve been ready to turn tail and flee a while ago, but now, he’d lost all will to go on. In his mind, he had done well to survive this far.</p>
<p>“Say your prayers. You have touched the nether reaches of sin, and now you will die and struggle against the weight of your own! Dimension Storm!!”</p>
<p>Zegion had held rule over this space from the start. And that meant only one thing. No matter what Deeno did, he could never leave.</p>
<p>If he had made full use of the abilities he still kept under wraps, perhaps he might’ve found hope somewhere. But the chances of that were too comical to even bother trying, so Deeno felt no qualms about giving up instead. In fact, if there was any chance at all…</p>
<p>A storm of dazzling colors engulfed Deeno, whisking him away into a realm where nothing existed nor would exist. It was a supernatural storm of highly energized particles, and Deeno could do nothing against it as he was erased from the world, leaving not a trace of his body—or that’s what should have happened.</p>
<p>“Huh. Your prayers paid off, then? You’ve got impressive luck, at least,” Zegion muttered to himself.</p>
<p>The soft sound of something, somewhere, breaking could be heard, and he could feel Deeno’s existence being regenerated. Zegion could accurately see this, his voice calm. All of it was within his predictions.</p>

<p class="tx1">Deeno woke up outside the labyrinth.</p>
<p>“Phew! I won the bet, huh?”</p>
<p>He breathed a sigh of relief. His equipment was all there, completely undamaged.</p>
<p>“This must be, like, Ramiris letting me go out of kindness, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Deeno looked at the broken bracelet in his hands. It was a Resurrection Bracelet, a cheap one he’d purchased at the labyrinth’s shop long <a id="page-98"></a>ago. He had never made use of a save point, so his location was reset to the surface after he died. He kept it on as an escape route, figuring something like this was entirely possible.</p>
<p>“Well, she never gave me an unlimited-use bracelet, so she must’ve been pretty suspicious of me from the start. She coulda canceled <em>this</em> one on me, too, though. She sure went easy on me.”</p>
<p>He wistfully reflected on it. Here he was, secretly carrying an insurance item created by a girl he was sent to kidnap. It took someone like Deeno to justify an act so unprincipled in his mind. The bracelet was a cut-price, one-use type, something Ramiris produced in mass quantities. He had staked his life on it, and apparently the heavens were on his side.</p>
<p><em>Fallen or not, I’m still an angel, I guess.</em></p>
<p>Deeno let his mind wander a bit as he looked around. He wanted to find his companions (who were presumably fighting Geld right now) and get the hell out of there. He also sent a Thought Communication to Zarario to report on his failure. His angelic partners had set up an escape route so he wouldn’t be locked in the labyrinth, so none of them was likely to leave until Zarario got out. But with things falling apart like this, sticking around was a bad idea.</p>
<p><em>Still, though, that dude was way too strong!</em></p>
<p>It sucked so bad. Even recalling Zegion made him want to whine to himself. Feldway was gonna be seriously angry, but still, he was lucky to be alive.</p>
<p><em>Like, this might be the first time any of Feldway’s plans didn’t work out. I guess Cornu screwed up again, but… Well, I dunno where he is. We really should never have opposed Rimuru…</em></p>
<p>He had never been too eager about his role in this. Now Deeno wondered why he ever accepted it in the first place. Thinking about the future just depressed him.</p>
<p>Really, if Zegion had become that much of a monster, a conventional assault on the labyrinth like this was hopeless. He, along with all the other top-level people in Rimuru’s government, was a total monster. Deeno couldn’t say exactly what had happened to Rimuru and his team yet, but he was sure it was nothing he’d be glad to hear of.</p>
<p><em>This is why I didn’t want in on this!!</em></p>
<p>Deeno just wanted a tranquil life in the labyrinth—and now look at <a id="page-99"></a>what had happened. Perhaps it’s what he deserved for what he did, but it was still depressing.</p>
<p><em>I dunno what’s going on in Feldway’s mind, but I doubt he’ll give up. Not that this is ever gonna be possible…</em></p>
<p>If he had to guess, the best chance they’d ever get had come just a moment ago. That was wholly gone now, and Deeno knew it wouldn’t come back.</p>
<p>Plus, there was one more problem.</p>
<p><em>Ah, man, and now that I’ve made myself an enemy, there’s no way I can go back…</em></p>
<p>To someone as lazy-minded as Deeno, life in the labyrinth was about as comfortable and easygoing as it got. It might have been “work,” but helping Vester was fun. Gabil got along with him, too, occasionally doing favors for him and so on. Whenever the research team made a new discovery, it gladdened him as well. These were engaging days he had spent with Vester and the gang—and in time, he saw them as friends.</p>
<p>That, and something else Deeno almost forgot. He only came here because Guy ordered him to. He was functioning as a spy for him, reporting back on goings-on inside the labyrinth. Deeno didn’t think Guy expected much from him, really, but that just soured his mood even further.</p>
<p><em>He can be such a pain when he’s mad…</em></p>
<p>He truly was. But now fretting over all this seemed pointless, too. So Deeno headed over to his companions instead.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">By the time he reached them, the battle was at a stalemate. Geld the Barrier Lord and Garasha were locked in combat, and amazingly, they were equals in sheer muscle. Deeno could hardly believe what he saw.</p>
<p><em>If he’s equal to Gara, that makes him stronger than me, huh? And if he’s like that right after his evolution, that’s just… Ugh.</em></p>
<p>Geld was bloodied. Exactly who the blood belonged to was unclear, because he had no obvious open wounds. Injuries dealt with magical damage couldn’t be healed with a potion, and Garasha was clearly throwing around enough magic to destroy him. If Geld was unhurt by all of that, either he had crazy defense or superhuman healing skills.</p>
<p><a id="page-100"></a>As Deeno thought about this, Garasha swung her longsword. It slashed through Geld’s scale shield and cleaved into his arm. Geld didn’t respond. Throwing away his broken shield, he took a new one out from his Stomach and returned to his fighting stance. And there Deeno could see it—there wasn’t even a scar on Geld’s arm any longer.</p>
<p><em>Ahhh, it’s Ultraspeed Regeneration. And it’s advanced enough to even heal Garasha’s attacks…?</em></p>
<p>Now he had an answer. But Deeno wasn’t too happy about it.</p>
<p>“Ugh! Why are you so stubborn? None of my attacks is even fazing you! Are you crazy or something?”</p>
<p>“Mm? Am I? I’m not sure myself. Perhaps I should give more praise to your attacks?”</p>
<p>“Oh, sarcasm, huh? Gah! I have to kill you in one stroke or you’ll just heal instantly. I oughtta be praising <em>you</em> for how damn tough you are!”</p>
<p>Such was the exchange as Geld and Garasha flew back into battle, gouging into each other’s openings without caring how much it damaged them. Geld’s Meat Cleaver was deflected back by Garasha’s circle shield, generating an intense flurry of sparks and a shock wave that traveled along the ground.</p>
<p>Deeno was too dazed to use his chance to speak up. Geld always existed behind the scenes as this revered figure. He did nothing flashy in the war against the Empire, and Deeno didn’t see him as much of a threat. That was a serious mistake.</p>
<p><em>Now I’m sure of it! Everyone in this damn country is just totally insane!</em></p>
<p>He forced himself to accept this as fact, a truth finally dawning on him, even as a fearsome aerial battle erupted above him.</p>
<p>“Ughhh! Stop irritating me with all that flying around!”</p>
<p>“That’s what I wanna say. You got a lot of nerve, flying with no wings!”</p>
<p>“Heh… A simple matter if you have control over gravity. But I’m getting bored with this game of tag. Can we put an end to it?”</p>
<p>“Again, that’s what I wanna say!”</p>
<p>The bewitching Kumara was taking on Pico, who looked like a young child by comparison. They actually made a good-looking couple, but their battle was pretty intense. Pico’s Black Thunder, launched so often that it seemed to cover the ground beneath them, had blackened the <a id="page-101"></a>surrounding area—but somehow, it never quite reached Kumara. It made sense. Raiko, the Thunder Tiger and one of the tail beasts that Kumara kept as a pet, was born to handle lightning, making defense a simple matter.</p>
<p>Then Kumara went on the move, as if declaring it her turn. Using eight of her tails in an elegant, flowing pattern, she unleashed Nine-Tail Slash, only to have it blocked by Pico’s lance.</p>
<p>A shrill <em>clang</em> shot across the battlefield. They were an even match for each other, and once again, Deeno had to revise his opinion of Kumara’s fighting skill upward.</p>
<p><em>She’s one of the Twelve Lordly Guardians, isn’t she? Man. Better not mess with any of them.</em></p>
<p>He had to admit it. There wasn’t any need to point out this or that member—they were <em>all</em> threats. That was the safest way to think about it.</p>
<p>As former seraphim, Pico and Garasha were up there with awakened demon lords. They had been away from battle for a while, so their capabilities couldn’t be compared that simply, but they clearly weren’t pushovers. With Tempest’s leaders out of the picture, Deeno figured he and these two women were enough to take over the labyrinth—and yet Feldway was ever so careful, deploying two Mystic Leaders and even joining the fray himself. Victory was completely assured, but look what they had here now. The reality of it all made him feel dizzy.</p>
<p>Pico and Garasha seemed to be gradually losing their cool, perhaps because their battle skills were so rusty. But whatever level they were at now, they used to be top-level seraphim. If two out of the shining Seven Primordial Angels were struggling this much, their pride must’ve been in tatters. Deeno wasn’t helping much, but he ignored that for now.</p>
<p>“Hey! Guys! Retreat! We gotta retreat!”</p>
<p>The two of them reacted angrily to Deeno’s shouting.</p>
<p>“But we’re just getting to the good part! Stop talking nonsense when I’m about to get serious with this!”</p>
<p>“Shut up! This entire operation fell apart the moment <em>you</em> joined the melee!”</p>
<p>Pico and Garasha’s role was supposed to be rear support. There was a large blank in their battle experience, so they were playing it safe this <a id="page-102"></a>time. If they had been dragged into a fight, it proved the enemy was more powerful than expected. A tactical victory here meant nothing strategically for the war.</p>
<p>“…Wait, is the mission off?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Yeah, it is. I wouldn’t have fled the labyrinth if it wasn’t!”</p>
<p>“What? But didn’t Fay come up with our plans? A perfectionist as careful as him misjudged the enemy, you’re saying?”</p>
<p>“Guess so.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid. How could we have failed this if we had both Zarario and Cornu on the scene?”</p>
<p>“Because we lost. I sent word to Zarario to pull out, but I’m pretty sure Cornu is dead. We didn’t achieve any of our objectives, but there’s no point fighting this out any longer!”</p>
<p>“Are you serious…?”</p>
<p>“This is really blowing my mind…”</p>
<p>Pico and Garasha were speechless. Geld and Kumara couldn’t have been prouder.</p>
<p>“Oh?” Garasha looked at Deeno. “So does that mean <em>you</em> lost, too?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Look, can you stop asking that over and over again? Get the picture! Can’t you be thoughtful enough to pretend not to notice?”</p>
<p>Deeno was as detached from his problems as usual. Garasha was stunned—not by the news but by how nonchalant he was about all this. Regardless, there was no reason to doubt him. Their minds were calm, and they both realized that retreat was the only acceptable way.</p>
<p>“Eesh! This doesn’t mean you won, got it?!”</p>
<p>“I am aware. Even during our battle, you were funneling some of your powers toward maintaining the labyrinth, weren’t you? Next time, I want to take you on at your full force.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh… Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Now you’re speaking my language. I like that. In that case, see you!”</p>
<p>Recognizing each other’s strength, Garasha and Geld made a friendly parting of ways. Pico and Kumara, on the other hand…</p>
<p>“Your name was Pico? You’re lucky to escape alive today.”</p>
<p>“What? C’mon, I wasn’t even trying that hard. <em>You’re</em> the one who oughtta thank their lucky stars!”</p>
<p>They glared at each other, then huffily turned away.</p>
<p>It was two opposites attitude-wise, but either way, it heralded the <a id="page-103"></a>end of battle. With that, Deeno and his allies managed to escape in one piece.</p>

<p class="tx1">Zarario was always coolheaded. His job on this mission was to serve as a diversion, and he carried it out with perfection.</p>
<p>The troops he brought along with him were fighting on the same level as the resisting forces in the labyrinth—literally. But, surprisingly enough, they would need to reconsider their enemies. That was the conclusion Zarario made as he sized up the battlefield.</p>
<p>Most impressive of all were the two people in front of him, Charys and Treyni. Those were the names they gave, and Zarario felt it was worth his time to memorize them. Even so, he reasoned that it still wasn’t worth his time to exercise his full powers against them.</p>
<p><em>I was told only the most insignificant of resistance remained for us, but that appears not to be the case. I thought my counterattack wiped out their forces in the labyrinth, but that powerhouse Zegion was still in there? Hopefully Cornu and Deeno wrapped up their missions before he awoke.</em></p>
<p>It was a cause for concern, but Feldway’s plans never went awry. That’s what Zarario trusted in as he enjoyed this battle.</p>
<p>“Lord Veldora is going to laugh at us for being toyed with by these half-engaged foes.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t worry about that. Veldora’s lost to Velgrynd and fallen into our hands.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a funny joke.”</p>
<p>“It’s not meant to be. You saw it, too, didn’t you? They’re a little panicked.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The magic-born Charys boasted superb strength. He was a rare talent, even given all the many dimensions Zarario had seen and destroyed. Treyni was impressive, too—a magic-born infused with an elemental lord—but she couldn’t beat out Charys. Her gifts lay in high-intensity magic, but none of it worked on Zarario, so she wasn’t a problem. Charys, too, could fire rays of heated light by nimbly controlling and compressing heat energy, but Zarario’s Distortion Field could neutralize it all.</p>
<p><a id="page-104"></a>No, the thing he had to watch out for was Charys’s calm and precise decision-making. Unlike Treyni, he seemed to size up Zarario in this battle, proceeding carefully and testing out how every move of his worked. Zarario’s experience told him that a foe like this couldn’t be trifled with.</p>
<p>But it was just about over now. Once Charys panicked a bit, he lost his careful style. The battle was about to get a lot less enjoyable, and Zarario thought it time to wrap things up.</p>
<p>“I hate to say it, but let’s bring matters to an end, shall we? You are both quite heroic warriors and extremely strong to boot, but sadly, you do not pose a challenge to me.”</p>
<p>The difference was apparent. Zarario had a much larger energy store. But the deciding factor was how they matched up. Angels held an advantage over spirits, and Charys and Treyni, whose powers were based in the elements, had no decisive measure against a seraphim (even a fallen one) like Zarario.</p>
<p>“I hate to say it, but Doreth appears close to her limit. I cannot keep my elemental lord for longer than a handful of seconds. Sir Charys, do you have any strategies left?”</p>
<p>“No, sadly. But Sir Rimuru and Sir Veldora taught me nothing if not the core strategy of never giving up. So don’t worry.”</p>
<p>Despite it being a hopeless situation they had no way of clawing out of, Charys grinned, as if the battle had just begun. Treyni smiled back.</p>
<p>“In that case, let me join you. We can’t allow these insolent intruders to do as they please in Lady Ramiris’s labyrinth!”</p>
<p>They were heavily damaged but still ready to fight. Their hearts showed no sign of breaking—which made Zarario roll his eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh, come on. I don’t think you’re foolish enough not to see the writing on the wall, but are you planning to pathetically cling to life until the very end? Because if you think you can resurrect yourselves regardless, you are very much mistaken.”</p>
<p>By Zarario’s calculation, Deeno would have ferried Ramiris out of the labyrinth right around now. Any immortality the labyrinth granted you worked only because Ramiris was inside it. To be exact, her leaving the labyrinth wasn’t enough to turn that off, but if she did so and lost consciousness, all her memories would instantly be reset. Thus, the moment Deeno carried out his job, Ramiris’s servants would <a id="page-105"></a>lose their immortality. Zarario knew that, and that’s why he went easy, piling damage on Charys and Treyni instead of killing them outright.</p>
<p>“In recognition of your valor in battle, I could grant you a proud, painless death if you like?”</p>
<p>That was his way, as one of the strongest of warriors, of offering mercy. But Charys and Treyni were obviously uninterested.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… Think you’ve already won, fool?”</p>
<p>“Indeed. You never know what could happen in a battle. As long as we don’t give up on victory, we will never lose. Don’t you know that?”</p>
<p>That sore-loser stance was enough to rile Zarario—not enough to make him lose his calm, but he didn’t appreciate this sass.</p>
<p>“How annoying. I was trying to grant you mercy.”</p>
<p>“Mercy? Ah, so many people lose their fight after trying to act so undisturbed! Do you know what we call talk like that? We call it a death flag.”</p>
<p>Charys recalled the “things never to say list” he’d discussed with Veldora once. There were a few absolute no-nos, but the worst of all was “trying to act cool just before you secure the win.” If you’re out to kill, you have to take action, not get distracted. Otherwise, you’re simply giving your opponent time to strike back.</p>
<p>“Oh, stop it. Are you expecting a miracle to—?”</p>
<p>“They <em>do</em> happen. Sir Rimuru’s engineered quite a few of them in his time, and his troops are so used to seeing them, they often imitate them for themselves. And look what we have here…!”</p>
<p>In the labyrinth, merely buying time in a battle often held little strategic significance. The same was true for this one…</p>
<p>“Exactly. And if you wish to strike at Lady Ramiris, friend and servant to my god, let it be known that Adalmann the Gehenna Lord will take you on!”</p>
<p>…but instead, all that stalling allowed for the birth of another warrior.</p>
<p class="space-break"><em>What does throwing one more body into the fray achieve?</em></p>
<p>Zarario was far more concerned by Deeno’s delays reporting back to him.</p>
<p><em>He’s late. I know he’s lazy by default, but whenever he procrastinates like this, it only creates more work for me…</em></p>
<p><a id="page-106"></a>That, combined with things not going his way in this battle, irked him more. And now this knightlike man was standing in front of him.</p>
<p>“I hate to fight in a large group against a single opponent, but I am no longer a righteous paladin. Deeds matter to me more than chivalry, and I hope you’ll forgive me for that.”</p>
<p>This was Alberto speaking. He bore a suit of God-class armor gifted to him by Rimuru—and after the more metaphysical gifts he’d received thanks to Adalmann’s awakening, he had evolved into a Gehenna Paladin. Now, as the rightful owner of the shining armor he wore, Alberto pointed his sword at Zarario.</p>
<p>“There’s another one…?” Zarario said.</p>
<p>He could tell that the aura Alberto emitted was a fearsome sight to behold. His movements were the mark of a seasoned swordsman, and the God-class blade in his hand contained the potential to seriously wound Zarario. One look, and it was clear he shouldn’t be ignored.</p>
<p>“I’m here, too.”</p>
<p>This voice belonged to Venti, the Dragon Lord of the Underworld, who had awoken from her evolutionary slumber, reborn as a Gehenna Dragon. She offered Zarario an elegant bow, a trick she must have learned from somewhere. Zarario rewarded it with a blank stare. Now he realized just what sort of fix he was in.</p>
<p>Even against this lineup, if it was a yes/no question, then yes, he could win. But victory alone wouldn’t be meaningful. Unless Deeno took Ramiris out of the picture, Zarario wouldn’t even <em>have</em> a victory.</p>
<p><em>If I go all out here, I’ll simply reveal my hand and have nothing to show for it. But if I don’t, I’ll be in trouble against this crew…</em></p>
<p>Against Charys and Treyni alone, Zarario could go easy and still hold his own. But if three titans on an awakened demon lord’s level joined in, not even he liked his chances. But he still needed to serve as a diversion, or Feldway’s entire strategy would fall to pieces. Zarario enjoyed a perfect record for carrying out his missions. He refused to allow that to happen.</p>
<p><em>So be it. I’m going to kill them all anyway. Let’s show them what I’ve got.</em></p>
<p>But just as Zarario steeled his resolve:</p>
<p>“Ah, yes… Allow me to relate something that I think you’ll find interesting. The area I normally guard is on Floor 70, but why do you think I’ve been ignoring the intruders in there?”</p>
