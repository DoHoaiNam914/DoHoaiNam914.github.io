<p><a id="page-279"></a>Guy looked pretty exasperated about it all, but he knew exactly what Ludora was thinking. In fact, he actually enjoyed the verbal arguments he shared with him. That’s why he allowed Ludora to try whatever he wanted, and he also agreed with Ludora’s “victory at all costs” approach.</p>
<p>He had accepted Ludora as an equal long ago. Simply having someone who could fight evenly with him delighted Guy. Besides, just like Ludora said, Guy was growing stronger the more he fought. When you get an ultimate skill, that’s not the end of the road—only when you master it does it truly shine. Guy learned that while battling Ludora.</p>
<p>Right now, he was matching Ludora’s style, fighting only with a sword, but even then, he was starting to overwhelm his opponent. If he added skills and magic to the mix, Guy was bound to win. But he never did that. Somewhere along the line, he started hoping for a tie instead of an end to their competition. That’s why he welcomed Ludora’s dirty tricks…but it was still just a matter of time.</p>
<p>So Guy asked the question.</p>
<p>“Hey… The first time you fought me, how come you didn’t strike a lethal blow on me? If you seriously tried to kill me instead of naming me and stuff, you had a chance, you know.”</p>
<p>That was the one question Guy just couldn’t figure out. He was a proud man, and under normal circumstances, he’d admit to no chance of being defeated. A spiritual life-form admitting that was as good as a loss. That’s why Guy had avoided thinking about it all this time. He didn’t believe he was being shown pity, and he didn’t want to believe that. If that <em>was</em> the answer, he was afraid he’d kill Ludora in a rage.</p>
<p>Much like Guy had the skill Lucifer, Ludora had one of his own named Michael. If Ludora had broken that out from the start instead of saving it, there was no telling how the fight would’ve gone. Guy would certainly have been injured, at least, and maybe—just maybe—he’d have been defeated.</p>
<p>“Oh, that?” Ludora smiled at the serious question. “You’re so stupid, aren’t you? If I killed you, it wouldn’t <em>mean</em> anything! I need to make you admit to my greatness, renounce your evil ways, and join me.”</p>
<p>“Huhhh?”</p>
<p>Guy couldn’t comprehend this.</p>
<p><a id="page-280"></a>“Heh-heh! Someday, you know, I’m gonna take over the world. That was the promise I made Veldanava the Star-King Dragon, my friend and master.”</p>
<p>Ludora was apprenticing with Veldanava; Guy knew that much. The True Dragon himself said so, and he didn’t doubt it at all. But Guy never imagined Ludora had aspirations of world conquest.</p>
<p>“So, you know, the job Veldanava asked of me was to prevent idiots like <em>you</em> from trying to conquer the world, okay?”</p>
<p>“I know. That’s why Veldanava told me to make you accept me.”</p>
<p><em>Dammit, Veldanava</em>, Guy thought. <em>You pushed him on me because he annoyed you too much, didn’t you?!</em></p>
<p>There was the answer. Guy could hear Veldanava in his mind, asking him to teach Ludora about reality. Ludora bragged about how he’d make Guy answer to him, but he only came here because Veldanava wanted him out of his hair.</p>
<p>But it was already too late. Guy was in the dragon’s trap. And since he knew he liked Ludora, he was now forced to see him through to the end. If he <em>didn’t</em> like him, he would’ve killed him from the start, but no point bringing <em>that</em> up again.</p>
<p><em>Great</em>, Guy thought wistfully. <em>What an idiot he is.</em></p>
<p>“Like, seriously,” Ludora said, “I couldn’t fully control Michael at full power when I first approached you. Even now, I can only harness it for about half a minute.”</p>
<p>It was a surprising confession. Guy didn’t hide his shock.</p>
<p>“Oh? Come on. There’s no way that’s true.”</p>
<p>“No, it is. The ability’s something I borrowed from Veldanava, so…”</p>
<p>Ludora shrugged as he continued. Guy listened to him speak, and as he did, he felt two things—one, none of this mattered to him, and two, Ludora truly <em>was</em> a powerful person. An ability from Veldanava had the power to defeat someone like Guy, after all. But as he heard Ludora continue, Guy realized he had the wrong idea about him.</p>
<p>“This is a secret, you know, but I’ll tell you and only you about it. The skill I earned by myself is called Uriel. Like, all the companions of mine who swear to me to follow my ideals and conquer the world and so on—all their emotions get pooled together and become this incredible ultimate power.”</p>
<p>He said he’d earned it himself, but apparently, Veldanava lent a <a id="page-281"></a>hand as well. Still, it was impressive. Uriel was the manifestation of Ludora’s own heart, and even among angel-type skills, it was on the highest level of potency.</p>
<p>“So I’m kind of trading that one in for Michael, but that one’s a big handful as well. Uriel was really straightforward, you know? The ‘slay’ and ‘protect’ abilities that come with it couldn’t be easier to handle. But Michael has this ability called ‘rule’ that I just can’t wrap my head around.”</p>
<p>The ability let him borrow any skill possessed by those he ruled over and take control of that person—truly befitting a leader ruling his people. But right now, when he was ruling nobody, it didn’t pose that much of a threat. He couldn’t use his ultimate skill on Guy; instead, he had to rely on his own tested strength.</p>
<p>“Wow,” Guy said. “That’s pretty neat.”</p>
<p>The more people he ruled over, the more abilities he’d have access to—and then Ludora would get stronger and stronger.</p>
<p><em>Eesh. I thought I was gonna grow more and more powerful until I finally beat him for good…but now we can have fun for a long time to come!</em></p>
<p>The fun times would continue. Realizing that energized Guy. But Ludora continued.</p>
<p>“But look, I’m not really interested in ruling over anyone. I’m a man, you know? And I want to fight people using my own strength. I’m just not really in a position to do that and stuff…”</p>
<p>“You’re not?”</p>
<p>“No. I guess you’re friends with Veldanava, too, so you got a right to know.”</p>
<p>Guy grew nervous. With his long life span, he hadn’t given it much thought—but he hadn’t seen Veldanava lately, come to think of it.</p>
<p>“Did something happen to him?”</p>
<p>“Well…<em>normally</em>, I’d be celebrating it, but…”</p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>“He got married to my sister Lushia. Married or…like, Lushia has his child at the moment. They’re gonna be a genuine family.”</p>
<p>“His child? A True Dragon’s child?!”</p>
<p>That <em>was</em> a surprise. But a dragon eccentric enough to throw away its omnipotent perfection out of boredom might just decide to do <em>that</em>, too. It made sense to Guy.</p>
<p><a id="page-282"></a>“I guess these things happen, huh?” he said.</p>
<p>“Yeah. And like I said, normally I’d be happy for them. But that’s where the problems begin.”</p>
<p>The revelation Ludora had for him after that was beyond surprising. It was firmly disquieting news. It made Guy stand up and say, “Really?” staring Ludora in the eye.</p>
<p>It seemed that Veldanava was little different from a human being at this point. He had told Ludora, with a slight chuckle, that he was now bound by a “life span,” something he never had before. It was a heavy truth to accept, one hard for Ludora to keep to himself, so that was why he told Guy.</p>
<p>“I guess that’s in character for him, yeah, but what’s he trying to do…?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. That’s why I’m all worked up about this. But I think it’s clear that I’m not gonna be able to hang out here and fight with you all day for long.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…”</p>
<p>They looked at each other and sighed.</p>

<p class="tx1">“Stop, stop! I like you, all right? I have no interest in killing you, and I don’t want to fight for real any longer. But I need to continue being a demon lord to keep the world from being destroyed. That was my promise to him.”</p>
<p>Guy really did like Ludora. Anyone who was friends with Veldanava was friends with him, too. He could never seriously try to kill him, and there wasn’t much he could do about that. But he had to carry out his role as demon lord. That was the role Veldanava had asked him to carry out. As an Arbitrator, he couldn’t afford to place his thumb on the scales the world rested on.</p>
<p>So Guy looked him in the eye as he said that. Ludora looked right back at him.</p>
<p>“All right. Wanna play a different game, then?”</p>
<p>“A different game?”</p>
<p>Ludora nodded. He wasn’t acting all bashful like usual, face deadly serious.</p>
<p><a id="page-283"></a>“Yeah. We’ll stop directly fighting each other. Instead, we’ll just use pawns and fight for control of the world that way.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>“Honestly, I don’t want to use Michael very much, but I don’t have any choice. Veldanava gave me this skill to support my dream of conquering the world. I’m going to keep gaining followers, and as I do, I’m gonna keep getting stronger.”</p>
<p>“I’ll bet.”</p>
<p>Guy nodded. He knew that was correct.</p>
<p>“And I don’t want to kill you, either. Remember what I said? I wanted to make you accept me. I… You know, I believe that humankind can unite as one. Veldanava is all about diversity, but that doesn’t mean we have to keep fighting each other, does it? If two people with differing opinions can respect and interact with each other, then great. And if you can’t accept someone else’s outlook, just keep your distance from them. War keeps breaking out because these different races, these different nations keep getting weapons they shouldn’t have, but if they were all part of the same nation, we could just talk everything out instead, right?”</p>
<p>“You think so? Because as far as I know, humans are way too foolish for that.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I know. But I became friends with <em>you</em>, didn’t I? Demon lords and Heroes are supposed to be mortal enemies, and even they can get along. If we humans are all part of the same race, it’s <em>got</em> to be much easier than that!”</p>
<p>Ludora argued that no Arbitrator was necessary at all. But Guy couldn’t agree with that.</p>
<p>“That’s pretty wishful thinking. Humans are greedy little creatures—which isn’t an ‘evil’ thing per se. You <em>need</em> greed in order to explore all the grand opportunities before you. But if those desires come into conflict with each other, that naturally leads to infighting. Dumb animals know how to deal with each other a lot better, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>If animals who became monsters through magic were kept constantly well-fed, they stopped killing other creatures. They weren’t all crafty that way. They just lived day by day, seeking as much pleasure as they could. But not humans. They were always thinking one step ahead, getting nervous, trying to build their fortunes so they could <a id="page-284"></a>hold out in any situation. That’s what their instincts told them to do, and that’s why the world Ludora wanted was a fairy tale.</p>
<p>Guiding people through words alone was the most difficult thing in the world. Even getting your will across to other people in words without being misunderstood was a gigantic challenge… Guy knew that, and that’s why he believed Ludora’s dream would never come true.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, I know that. Veldanava laughed it off as idealistic…but I’m convincing people, and I’m earning their support. Like, <em>‘The chances of it working are all but zero, but go ahead, try doing what you want.’</em> And between you and me, Michael has this ability called Armageddon that summons this army of angels that destroys everything in its path. <em>That’s</em> what I can use to rescue humanity. I’ll destroy all the world’s military might, all its civilization, and I’ll suppress everyone’s hyped-up desires. And as I do, I’ll unify the world. We can do it! We can build an ideal world together!”</p>
<p>Ludora was asking for Guy’s help now. He wanted him to stop killing humans all the time and make this feeble possibility grow as much as he could.</p>
<p>“Ha! Massacre isn’t my hobby or anything, you know. If I don’t like someone, I just rub them out, is all. Whether they’re good or bad, it doesn’t matter to me. If I like you, you live. If I don’t, I kill you. That’s all.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m telling you to stop doing!”</p>
<p>“Pfft! I’m not patient enough for all the world’s evil people to realize they were wrong from the start. People say, like, <em>‘Hate the crime, not the criminal,’</em> but are you kidding me? Crime <em>needs</em> punishment. And it’s up to the criminal to be responsible for that!”</p>
<p>“I know. You’re right! I think so, too! But I want to give them a chance to see the light.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sure! Don’t worry about that, then. I’ll send the souls of the damned to the underworld and give them all the torment they need.”</p>
<p>“Not like <em>that</em>!”</p>
<p>Ludora fell silent, gathered himself, and bared his soul to Guy once more.</p>
<p>“Look, I don’t want to be king so I can act all high and mighty. I want to bring smiles to everyone’s faces. If people have safe places to live and friends they can talk with, that’ll reduce the number of <a id="page-285"></a>criminals, won’t it? I want to get rid of poverty and inequality. I wanna make a world where everyone can smile as they live. That’s what I want! And I know there are some idiots out there you just can’t do anything with, but I’ll try to keep the casualties as low as I can.”</p>
<p>He was revealing his ideals to Guy, never imagining that someday in the far future, one of his enemies would say similar things to him.</p>
<p>Guy responded with a pained shake of his head. “No wonder Veldanava laughs at you. I didn’t know you were <em>that</em> much of a kid. But…well, all right. Tell me more about this game you’re thinking of.”</p>
<p>“So you’ll do it?!”</p>
<p>“I was getting bored anyway. That game could be more fun for me.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Guy was persuaded. He wasn’t denying Ludora’s ideals; he just wanted to see this to its conclusion. With a friend this stubborn, there was no getting through to them with words alone. Guy was exactly that type, and here Ludora was, trying to do just that with him. It was a contradiction from the start, doomed to fail—and then Ludora would open his eyes.</p>
<p>If he actually pulled it off… Well, it’d mean less work for Guy regardless. The way he saw it, he’d benefit either way. There was no real merit to any of it. But if Ludora would give up on this reckless idea for him, that was enough for Guy.</p>
<p>“So my ambition’s just a game to you?” Ludora asked, laughing. Then he carefully went over the rules of the game he proposed. They were pretty simple: The players wouldn’t touch each other but instead let their underlings do the fighting. Guy and Ludora wouldn’t engage in direct confrontation. If all Guy’s friends fell, Ludora won, and Guy had to serve him. But until that happened, Guy could do whatever he wanted, and he was free to keep his promise with Veldanava and serve as Arbitrator as well.</p>
<p>Guy had almost no restrictions, but Ludora still felt he had a decent advantage. The original role of a Hero is to prevent a demon lord, the principal threat and culler of humanity, from going on a rampage. Guy was a calm, careful thinker, but his power was almost too much. One move from him, and the damage would be staggering. Ludora had stuck with him to prevent that, but that alone wouldn’t make his dream a reality. If he wanted to begin his quest to take over the world, he needed to keep Guy from acting against him.</p>
<p><a id="page-286"></a>But Guy could read this well enough.</p>
<p>“All right. I promise I won’t touch you, then. I’ll just gather up some demon lords to take my place and have <em>them</em> directly punish humanity for me.”</p>
<p>“And I’ll stop them from doing that. And then I’ll unite the world before you start building a demon lord agency on me!”</p>
<p>“It’s gonna be tough, you know. It’s kind of an ideal, after all. One even that softhearted Veldanava gave up on.”</p>
<p>Veldanava might’ve been a romantic, but he was also a perfectionist. Ideals were fine and all, but he had a colder side to him that immediately cut away things that had no chance of happening. Thanks to him throwing away omnipotence for the sake of experiencing genuine change, the ideal society he envisioned was no longer possible to implement. But to Veldanava, that was the right decision to make. A world that moved strictly on his own will didn’t seem remotely interesting to him.</p>
<p>Ludora understood all too well how the dragon’s mind worked. That’s why he shouted it out now.</p>
<p>“But even so! I want to put his mind at ease. He’s got a limited life span now. He hasn’t got any more power than a normal human being. He was so happy about the idea of dying together with Lushia…but he really <em>was</em> worried about where the world is going! And he’s so preoccupied about the future his child will see…”</p>
<p>“Mm…”</p>
<p>“So I need to ease his worries, you know? I’ll make this a world where anyone can live happily so he won’t have any anxieties left when he expires. Then the world he made will mature in the most wonderful way. It’ll be an amazing, perfectly harmonious world—that’s what I wanna reward him with!”</p>
<p>Ludora had sworn to Veldanava that he would establish a single, unifying nation. He wanted him to make his sister Lushia happy, and to do that, he swore to eliminate all unhappiness from the world.</p>
<p>“We’re all part of this human world, too. I want us to decide how it works. You guys with your infinite lives will be the arbitrators who get to see how it all works out until the end.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…?”</p>
<p>Guy didn’t have any response to Ludora. He had concluded in his <a id="page-287"></a>mind that it was impossible. But he could understand Ludora’s feelings, and it made him hesitate to deny his words.</p>
<p><em>Why is he such an idiot? You’ll just wind up being the one shouldering all of that alone…</em></p>
<p>Guy hated how his mind was so needlessly sensitive to emotion like that. He was arrogant but kind to those he liked. But now that was keeping him from stopping Ludora’s incredibly reckless endeavor. This foolish man, this friend he needed to love—and Guy had no words for him.</p>
<p><em>I’m sure you’re gonna fail at it, man.</em></p>
<p>His mind coldly calculated the results. The chances of success were too ridiculously low to even express as a probability. But Ludora, this man Guy saw as his best friend, would never give up on it. A Hero needed an unbending heart. And Ludora—carrying all the pain alone, aiming to build an ideal world—was a true Hero.</p>
<p>Guy couldn’t help but think that maybe he could actually do it. Ludora had that something that made you think so, and that was the tiny possibility Guy placed his bead on.</p>
<p>But the result of it was…</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Guy and Ludora’s game had seen a long cycle of tragedy ever since its beginning.</p>
<p>The first misfortune came soon after the birth of Milim, Veldanava and Lushia’s child. A terrorist attack occurred while Ludora was out on a campaign, the world of a rival warring nation, and the dastardly act took the lives of Lushia and Veldanava.</p>
<p>At that moment, Ludora’s dream audibly collapsed.</p>
<p><em>“I…I just wanted to relieve Veldanava’s worries. I wanted him to accept us…”</em></p>
<p>He shut off his mind. All his wailings would no longer reach him. And all that remained were his rudderless ideals.</p>
<p><em>“You’re gonna keep going?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yeah. The only thing I have left is my game with you. And the only goal I have left is to make you accept me.”</em></p>
<p><em>“…All right. I’ll take you on.”</em></p>
<p><a id="page-288"></a>So the game continued.</p>
<p class="space-break">The next misfortune befell Veldanava’s child, Milim.</p>
<p>She grew up never knowing her parents’ faces or even knowing she was related to Ludora. The only family she had was the pet that guarded her, and it was killed by a rival nation’s scheme.</p>
<p>Milim wailed over it in a blind rage. Guy devoted everything he could to soothing her. If he didn’t stop her, she could destroy several nations before she was done.</p>
<p><em>“So do you still want to continue? If I had taken action sooner, none of this would’ve happened to Milim.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It is my fault. But even so, if we stop here, all my sacrifices will have been for nothing. I have a duty as emperor not to throw in the towel.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I really don’t think you do, but all right. I’ll keep it going until you’re satisfied.”</em></p>
<p>If they stopped here, Ludora seemed ready to crumble to pieces. So Guy put off the conclusion until later. It was all he could do. An unhappy future was guaranteed for them, he thought, but nothing was set in stone yet.</p>
<p>And so the game went on.</p>
<p class="space-break">The hardships kept transpiring, the ugliness of the human world thrust into their faces. Ludora kept serving as a Saint because of the ideals sought by his heart and the tenacity in his mind. But even that had its limits.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, Ludora’s mind began to get infected, robbing it of his initial ideals. Perhaps it was the fate of all who lost sight of their goals, but now he was willing to take any measure to defeat Guy.</p>
<p>He was cold and cruel. Beating Guy was all that mattered, and in the end, it cost him more bloodshed than ever before.</p>
<p>It had turned out exactly as Guy thought.</p>
<p class="space-break">Then, finally, the day arrived. Guy bet on the last possibility available under the rules. The final judgment would be made by Rimuru, the most unpredictable pawn on his side and the one with the most hope to him.</p>
<p><a id="page-289"></a>Honestly, he wanted to make the move himself. But Guy stuck to the rules to the very end. And thanks to that:</p>
<p><em>Not even that bastard Rimuru could do it…?</em></p>
<p>Guy lamented the fact. Not because he hated him or was frustrated over the result. He just missed the man he called his friend.</p>
<p>“…I <em>told</em> you, didn’t I, you dumbass? It was up to us. Demons. People whose emotions would never waver like that…”</p>
<p>As he muttered that to himself, Guy failed to notice the sensation running down his cheek. He simply sat there, praying for Ludora’s final peace.</p>
<p class="space-break">So the game between Guy and Ludora, played over several thousand years, came to a close.</p>
<p>Guy, flashing his usual bold smile, was adrift in sadness. A pair of blue-diamond eyes coldly looked at him, a twisted smile on her face. Even after the game ended, the embers of conflict were still smoldering. And soon they would form the signal for the Temma War, a war involving angels and demons that would dominate the entire world.</p>
