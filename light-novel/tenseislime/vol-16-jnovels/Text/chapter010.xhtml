<p>“Ahhh, His Majesty’s a shrewd man indeed!”</p>
<p>“Not to be vulgar, but yes, I agree. Looking at the two of them, I can feel a certain love that none could interfere with…and bonds that none could break!”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee… Lady Velgrynd looks like a young girl in love, doesn’t she? Hee-hee-hee! So the Empire’s guardian dragon was smitten with His Majesty, was she?”</p>
<p>“Indeed! Truly, good tidings await the Empire in its future!”</p>
<p>Not one member of the audience harbored negative thoughts about Masayuki. In fact, none of them suspected he wasn’t Ludora himself. He wanted to shout to them all about how wrong they were, but his lips were still occupied at the moment.</p>
<p><em>But I’ve never even had a girlfriend…much less been married…</em></p>
<p>He had to laugh at the absurdity of the world. But then salvation came—in the form of Cornu, his enemy.</p>
<p>“Velgrynd! Enough of this nonsense! Why?! You’re supposed to be under the thrall of Sir Michael! Why are you getting in my way?!”</p>
<p>In Cornu’s mind, Velgrynd was a useful pawn, one fully captured and belonging to his side. Her interference right now was making him explode into an irritated rage.</p>
<p>“My, how boorish of you. You’d have to be an idiotic man to get in our way.”</p>
<p>Velgrynd, finally removing herself from Masayuki, gave Cornu a dissatisfied frown. Her gaze was bracing, but it didn’t stop him.</p>
<p>“Silence! Stop playing around and help me out! Take that man you’re embracing and choke the life out of him!”</p>
<p>It was the most taboo thing he could have said. And Cornu did not know how much wrath it inspired in Velgrynd.</p>
<p>“You’re saying you want me to kill him?”</p>
<p>All sound vanished from the battlefield. Only Cornu continued to shout, failing to realize what was going on.</p>
<p>“Am I hearing an echo, Velgrynd? I don’t care how strong you are; <em>I’m</em> your commander here. All you have to do is follow my orders!”</p>
<p><a id="page-79"></a>And Cornu never realized what was happening, right up to the very end. He just didn’t have the mental capacity to realize Velgrynd wasn’t who she used to be.</p>
<p>“No, <em>you</em> die.”</p>
<p>It was a merciless strike. The reborn Velgrynd was incomparably stronger than before, her magic now refined to a hilt. It precisely, accurately turned Cornu into a pile of ashes. Without a chance to counterattack or even get another word in, he was no more. And even more astounding, the attack worked its way across dimensions—a trick brought about by Dimensional Combo, part of her newly found ability Trans-Dimensional Leap. Cornu’s “real” body, in the other world he now called home, disappeared before it could even detect any danger.</p>
<p>“I let it slide last time, too. Such a fool. I had almost forgotten the grudge I had against Feldway. I should never have let myself do that.”</p>
<p>She spat out the words, then turned toward Sariel.</p>
<p>“Oh, uh, her name is really Chronoa,” Masayuki chimed in. “She saved my life a second ago—”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I won’t do anything; I don’t need to. Michael’s influence made the ultimate skill Sariel take root within her psyche, but she’s resisting it all by herself. That’s why she’s motionless like that. But if you’re still worried, you can have Rimuru look at her afterward. I’m sure he’ll have just the right remedy for it. Not that it’ll be necessary, I don’t think…”</p>
<p>Velgrynd turned away from Sariel, the occupier of Chronoa’s mind. Realizing she wasn’t wary of Chronoa at all, Masayuki finally relaxed.</p>

<p class="tx1">So the battle came to a close. Many of its combatants were just as relieved as Masayuki, while others were so anxious that they could barely walk straight. Now everyone here knew what Velgrynd really was.</p>
<p>It was Bernie, standing next to Masayuki, who drummed up the courage to act first. He was the closest to Velgrynd, and now he flew out and kneeled before her, almost on all fours.</p>
<p>“Marshal, I am Bernie, member of the Single Digits and ranked number seven! I only hope that you are glad to see me, my—”</p>
<p><a id="page-80"></a>“Enough. Thank you. What do you want to say to me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord! I disobeyed the orders of my captain and refused to end the life of Masayuki, the young man here. I understand this is punishable by death, but before the execution begins, I beg you to listen to what I have to say.”</p>
<p>The scene fell quiet again. It was another bombshell for the crowds of soldiers watching. The Marshal, the chief commander of the imperial military, was Velgrynd herself. This threw a lot of the crowd for a loop, but far more of them were quickly convinced it was true.</p>
<p>Now, as they grasped the concept, reality set in with them. They were all on the losing side of the war, and that meant Velgrynd would see them as worthy of execution, a fate it was pointless to struggle against. Faced with the power of a dragon who could destroy this entire labyrinth, all they could do was wait for their fates to unfold. They instinctively formed lines, nervously awaiting their judgment, as the conversation continued.</p>
<p>“Right. What is it?”</p>
<p>“All of us before you remain just as loyal to the Empire as we always have. No matter what the emperor decides, we are ready, willing, and able to carry it out to the letter. It is with that in mind that I beseech you, my Marshal, to allow this army to return home! You are free to pin the blame for this on myself and the officers; none of us would breathe a word of dissent against that. But—”</p>
<p>“All right, all right.”</p>
<p>Bernie was crestfallen, his most earnest begging cut off midway. There was no avoiding fate. Tears flowed as he realized just how powerless he was.</p>
<p>Velgrynd rewarded that with a little snicker.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry. Did I give you the wrong idea? Maybe you’re all not the brightest lights out there, but you did work hard for us. I appreciate that. Thank you for protecting my beloved Ludora.”</p>
<p>All the soldiers immediately took a knee, lowering their heads.</p>
<p>“S-so then…?!”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t thinking about <em>doing</em> anything to any of you. Only Ludora truly matters to me, but I know Ludora thinks the world of you all, so I’ll grant you my protection. I always have, and I always will.”</p>
<p>It was like a gospel from heaven. Cheers erupted across the crowd; <a id="page-81"></a>some broke down in sobs, Caligulio and Minitz among them. They believed in, and were moved by, everything Velgrynd told them.</p>
<p>“Glory to the Empire! Glory to His Majesty the emperor!!”</p>
<p>The excitement was palpable, the noise deafening. Masayuki wondered what had gotten into these people.</p>
<p><em>By the looks of things, this throng thinks that I’m Emperor Ludora. Like, come on, Bernie, tell them! If the truth comes out, it’s me who’s gonna pay for it, you know. She even kissed me… I’m so gonna be killed, aren’t I?</em></p>
<p>His name wasn’t even Ludora, but nobody on hand doubted that it wasn’t. He wondered if his sanity was beginning to slip on him. That kiss was a sheer joy, but honestly speaking, Masayuki didn’t want to get caught up in any of this.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? You don’t look too happy. If there’s something on your mind, by all means, tell me.”</p>
<p>The desolate Masayuki was a bit shaken when Velgrynd directly addressed him.</p>
<p>“Oh? Um, no, there’s nothing on my mind…”</p>
<p>He had trouble assembling the words. The awkward display clouded Velgrynd’s face. “Could it be,” she gingerly asked, “that you don’t remember me?”</p>
<p>This felt like a test to Masayuki. But what was the right answer? Get it wrong, and he was in huge trouble. <em>Gimme a break</em>, he said to himself as his mind raced. If this was a yes/no question, then yes, he remembered her. She was definitely the beautiful woman who became the last thing he ever saw in his original world. But did he know her name?</p>
<p><em>That guy called her Velgrynd. Isn’t that the name of Veldora’s sister? Crazy-strong and everything? And the “guardian of the Empire” and stuff, too…</em></p>
<p>This internal struggle was paying off. More and more facts came into his head, and based on how the imperial soldiers had reacted, his supposition was likely correct. So he placed his bet.</p>
<p>“You’re…Velgrynd, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Velgrynd’s face erupted into a broad smile.</p>
<p>“Yes… Yes! You <em>do</em> remember, Ludora!”</p>
<p>Even now, Masayuki’s luck didn’t abandon him. Simply being called by her name elated Velgrynd. And that wasn’t all.</p>
<p>“Ah, now I realize why you had that concerned look. I was so <a id="page-82"></a>overjoyed to see you that I forgot, but your name right now is Masayuki, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“…!!”</p>
<p>Things got better and better for him. Any concern that Velgrynd had the wrong guy was now firmly in the past.</p>
<p><em>Wait, whaaaaat? This girl knows that I’m Masayuki Honjo?!</em></p>
<p>Sheer relief. The kind of relief he hadn’t felt since the day he was born. He was so relaxed, he almost lost control of his bladder right there. Then he tensed up again before things went hairy on him.</p>
<p>“That’s…that’s right. I’m not Ludora right now; I’m Masayuki. And, you know, I think I’m a little confused about all of this and stuff, ha-ha-ha…”</p>
<p>As he chuckled, he kept a careful eye on Velgrynd’s reaction. But she wasn’t the only problem.</p>
<p><em>Based on how this has transpired, I’m totally sure the crowd here thinks I’m Ludora. If I say I’m someone else up here, it’s just gonna confuse them, won’t it? I can’t have people accuse me of posing as the emperor… I gotta tell them I’m not the guy!</em></p>
<p>He wasn’t sure if it was something he’d go to jail for, but either way, Masayuki wanted to set the record straight. So he decided to come clean—but Velgrynd wasn’t having it.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s not a problem. The Empire’s worthless. It’s simply a possession of Ludora’s—kind of a hobby of his. He just kept it safe because he needed it for his competition against Guy. If you don’t think you want it, I could raze every square inch of it for you?”</p>
<p>Truly, it was the words of a god, an existence beyond human perception. The imperial soldiers turned pale. All eyes were on Masayuki.</p>
<p><em>No! Stop! Don’t! Quit acting like it’s my fault!</em></p>
<p>Feeling the heavy burden of this responsibility—and the eyes burning holes in his skull—he spoke up.</p>
<p>“No, I <em>do</em> cherish the Empire! Like, even Rimuru wants to be friends with it in the future and stuff. Once this war is over, you know, we could sign a treaty and be friendly and so on, right?”</p>
<p>At the very least, he pleaded, he didn’t want the Eastern Empire to experience a border-to-border nuclear winter. The soldiers looked up to him like he was a god. If Velgrynd said she could do it, she <em>would</em>, and probably with a casual flick of the wrist, too. If Masayuki didn’t <a id="page-83"></a>protest, the Empire was doomed for sure. Everyone knew that, and now everyone deeply appreciated Masayuki.</p>
<p>“Oh? Well, if that’s how you feel, I’ll keep helping with it, then,” Velgrynd replied with a smile.</p>
<p>The soldiers heaved a collective sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Caligulio spoke for the crowd. “There is, if you don’t mind, just one matter I would like clarified for us…”</p>
<p>His face was pained. Clearly, he didn’t want to say what came next.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Velgrynd asked, her voice indicating that she wanted this over with already.</p>
<p>“M-my lord, I wanted to inquire about Sir Ludora, our current emperor. What will, er, happen to him?”</p>
<p>A spark of recognition crossed her face.</p>
<p>“Ah, right. I guess none of you can visually see the essence of a person’s soul. Ludora, right now, is nothing but a shell. The soul of the true Ludora has gathered here…inside my beloved Masayuki.”</p>
<p>“Erm, me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you. You may not recall it, but you absolutely were Ludora. That’s why I love you. I love you, and I’ll do my best to make you love me as well.”</p>
<p>“Um, okay?”</p>
<p>Would a beautiful woman saying this fail to rouse the spirits of any man? Of course not! And Masayuki was no exception. But just because she was crazy for him now didn’t mean that it’d last forever. He swore to himself that he’d work harder than ever, if only to ensure his luck held out. Exactly <em>what</em> he’d have to do, he’d work out later.</p>
<p>It was with this newfound resolve that Masayuki quickly had to face another problem.</p>
<p>“Well, if <em>Sir</em> Masayuki is our true emperor, it’s up to us to offer our support to his claim, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Indeed. But it’ll be tricky. In terms of bloodlines, he’s a completely different person. Claiming he’s an illegitimate child will be unlikely to work. I’m not sure it’s something we can fully sweep under the rug.”</p>
<p>“Hold on…?”</p>
<p>“Does it matter, though? You can handle the issue with the military, Sir Caligulio, and I can smooth things over with the nobility. I’m <a id="page-84"></a>certainly not about to accept any dissent on this issue, after all! We can’t afford to waste time on this, either. If we fail, the whole Empire will collapse.”</p>
<p>Caligulio immediately threw in his support, Bernie brought up a potential issue, and Minitz offered a solution. All three leaders were ready to devote their full powers to this—and so Masayuki, through no fault of his own, saw himself inching closer and closer to the throne…</p>
<p>“Well, Masayuki, you’ve got a big job now, I’d say.”</p>
<p><em>Um… Do I have the right to refuse?</em></p>
<p><em>…Probably not.</em></p>
<p>He gave up. It was, after all, the opening to yet another new phase of his hapless life.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">Deeno was finally ready to get serious. Having this much trouble against such an eminently beatable opponent annoyed him greatly, but that was coming to a rapid end.</p>
<p>“Think you have the time to look away?”</p>
<p>Beretta’s sharp fist brushed past his cheek.</p>
<p>“Acting so distracted around us… I truly am offended, you know.”</p>
<p>Apito’s Osiris Rapiers rained down. Deeno doggedly avoided them. One hit was sure to hurt.</p>
<p><em>I kind of assumed that I way outclassed these guys, but maybe that was just my ego talking? It’s two-on-one, but still, I didn’t expect to struggle this badly.</em></p>
<p>Deeno was losing confidence. Maybe all that lazing around had weakened him? The silly thought showed that his heart still wasn’t really in this, perhaps, but he didn’t care.</p>
<p>All her training with Hinata gave Apito incredible intuition, something dangerously close to clairvoyance. Deeno was clearly the superior fighter, but even he couldn’t let his guard down around her.</p>
<p>Beretta was now serving as a tank, with Apito attacking from the rear, although Beretta put up some offense as well. Their twin barrage had what it took to reach Deeno. Even worse was Beretta’s magic. Very little magic worked on Deeno, but Beretta’s mainly involved support spells that boosted his own specs. Deeno could shoot down <a id="page-85"></a>magic attacks that weakened him, but if the spells boosted Beretta’s and Apito’s speed, strength, or endurance, he had no way to intervene. He could try interrupting the spellcasting process, but Beretta was a magically gifted demon who could fire off spells before Deeno could react. Even worse, the sleep function of Sloth wasn’t working on Beretta.</p>
<p>That’s why he was having so much trouble in this fight. But at long last, everything within him was fully built up. It was time to strike back.</p>
<p>“Shut up! Quit acting so superior even though it takes two of you to bully me like this! I’m only putting up with you because I’m so patient, okay? You oughtta be thankful! Here, eat this and take a nap for me!”</p>
<p>By the time he finished speaking, Fallen Hypno was already underway. As underhanded as Deeno was, this was about as unsportsmanlike as you could get.</p>
<p>“Phew… Finally over.”</p>
<p>Watching Apito collapse, Deeno was assured of his victory. Just in case, though, he shot a look at Beretta—and hurriedly dodged his advancing fist.</p>
<p>“Whoa! Did you resist my sleep?!”</p>
<p>“Of course. Falling for it once was enough of a blunder. I could hardly let myself fall asleep again.”</p>
<p>Beretta could come up with countermeasures because he was a demon, a creature with built-in resistance to status effects. With his unique skill Reverser, he could rework sleepiness to its natural opposite.</p>
<p>“No way…”</p>
<p>“Now, I know it doesn’t make Apito look very good, but let’s have her die and get revived for us.”</p>
<p>Beretta stood boldly in front of Deeno. Seeing him find a guaranteed way to victory and stick to it so doggedly almost impressed the demon lord more than it exasperated him.</p>
<p><em>I can’t believe he’s kept it so even against someone like me. It’s not that I’m underperforming—it’s that Beretta and Apito really are that good. Guess it means I’m gonna have to use that now…</em></p>
<p>Deeno had the perfect way to end this. He preferred not to resort to it, since it brought up some annoying memories, but now was no time for complaints.</p>
<p><a id="page-86"></a>“All right. I admit it. You’re good. In fact, you should be proud that you made me take this seriously.”</p>
<p>The moment he shouted it, he unlocked the ability stored within him. The ultimate power granted to him by Veldanava—the ultimate skill Astarte, Lord of High Heaven.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Confirmed. Using the Creation ability of the ultimate skill Astarte to evolve the unique skill Sloth… Successful.</em></p>
<p>Deeno’s Sloth skill had the unique trait of building up its force the less its owner physically moved around. It could hold a store of energy for later use, and that’s what Deeno now used to evolve Sloth into the new ultimate skill Belphegor, Lord of Sloth.</p>
<p>That was his last option—Evolution, a subset of the ultimate skill Astarte. With Astarte in hand, he could evolve his skills (but not anyone else’s) to have whatever effect he desired. That wasn’t all there was to it, of course, but either way, Deeno wanted to keep Astarte hidden as much as he could. There were eyes everywhere within the labyrinth, with all kinds of data being constantly recorded. As a Monitor himself, he had a natural inclination not to fully reveal himself.</p>
<p>Besides:</p>
<p><em>I know Rimuru. He’s crafty, constantly working on a vast scale with deep insight. When he killed off Clayman, he even presented that screen with his evidence on it. If he sees my power, I’m sure he’ll try to take measures against it…</em></p>
<p>The demon lord Rimuru was underestimated at one’s peril. There was no such thing as being too careful, a credo that had baked itself deep into Deeno’s bones.</p>
<p>So Deeno created Belphegor, a power he didn’t mind showing around. It was aimed straight for Beretta.</p>
<p>“Go to sleep! Fallen Catastrophe!!”</p>
<p>The laws of nature were rewritten, its positive elements being reversed and turned negative. The temptation they created lured everything, living and dead, into ceasing all activity and going into stasis. But it wasn’t a forced effect; it was up to the targets to take the lure and walk down the path to destruction themselves. That made it a type of hypnosis, albeit one that worked on a whole other dimension—there was no waking up <a id="page-87"></a>from a Belphegor-driven sleep, for it destroyed both your spirit and your physical body. Of course, while the destination of this lure was “doom,” Deeno could turn the intensity down and put the target into a more traditional hypnotic state.</p>
<p>It was a really versatile skill that way, and it didn’t use sound to transmit itself, so it couldn’t be blocked by a barrier of any sort. It was impervious to many defenses, one of its strongest points. In short, Belphegor held rule over all intelligent, feeling things.</p>

<p class="tx1">Deeno felt a little proud of himself. This was truly a fearsome, ultimate sort of evolution—a perfect symbol of sloth, one of the seven deadly sins.</p>
<p>He attempted to systematically destroy Beretta, preventing him from making any moves for a while. Destruction was his aim with this invocation, but the results were even more powerful than expected. Beretta had disappeared into a cloud of dust, so it’d undoubtedly be a while before he could resurrect himself. The Bracelet went missing along with him, but that didn’t bother Deeno—Ramiris could probably make up for that. Besides, if he let up at all, he might have failed to complete his duty.</p>
<p>So he didn’t feel much responsibility for Beretta’s fate.</p>
<p><em>Don’t hate me for that, Beretta. But…man, even Beretta’s maybe just mid-tier compared to the guys working directly under Rimuru, huh?</em></p>
<p>Deeno had a right to complain, perhaps. Someone as tricky as Beretta was on a decidedly lower echelon, not even possessing an ultimate skill. He wasn’t even a demon lord, in fact—just an underling. The thought made Deeno shiver a bit. What if one of the top-tier guys was still alive? Would he be able to win against whoever it was?</p>
<p>His troubled eyes turned toward Ramiris, making sure she was still fast asleep. Then he touched her.</p>
<p class="space-break">…Or he thought he did.</p>
<p class="space-break">Then Ramiris turned into a swarm of light, taking the form of a butterfly and fluttering its way around Deeno, almost like it was snickering at him.</p>
<p><a id="page-88"></a><em>…Whoa, whoa, was that just a mirage?!</em></p>
<p>He couldn’t believe it, and he didn’t want to, either. But there was no explaining this otherwise. This battle really <em>was</em> being monitored.</p>
<p><em>I’m glad I thought enough ahead to be careful, but still…</em></p>
<p>Even so, he had revealed one of his most powerful moves to the enemy. And what’s more, his next opponent was bound to be even worse—</p>
<p class="space-break">The sound of lumbering footsteps echoed across the chamber.</p>
<p class="space-break">The beautiful butterfly of light flew toward the composed figure walking in, touching his arm. Then it became a smudge of light once more…and transformed again. Now it was the innocently sleeping Ramiris, looking blissfully unaware of anything. She was atop the forearm of this figure, and Beretta, who had revived in the meantime, respectfully took possession of her.</p>
<p>“Sir Beretta,” the figure quietly said, “please watch Lady Ramiris for me.”</p>
<p>“By all means. Do you need any backup?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. I can handle this myself.”</p>
<p>Ramiris had perfect coverage from the start. In the bottommost part of the safest place she could be, a certain person had laid several layers of traps, ordering the team to fight the advancing enemy in small bursts so their abilities could be laid bare. Most of all, however, this labyrinth had the world’s strongest guardian inside. Before Veldora departed, he left Ramiris’s protection to the man he saw as his top apprentice. Only Ramiris was unaware of all this.</p>
<p class="space-break">And now this figure went on the move.</p>
<p>This man standing before Deeno was Zegion, the Mist Lord and the undisputed champion of this labyrinth.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Zegion had entered a cocoon in order to strengthen his abilities, but he’d remained conscious the whole time. Answering Veldora’s call, he had a firm grasp of everything going on within the labyrinth, using his <a id="page-90"></a>overwhelming Absolute Defense to guarantee Ramiris’s safety. And now Deeno realized it.</p>
