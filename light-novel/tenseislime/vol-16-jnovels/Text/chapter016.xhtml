<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter016">THE INTERVIEWS</a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page-115"></a>“So yeah, I was in a real dilly of a pickle for a second there!”</p>
<p>I had just finished hearing the report from Ramiris’s team. Sounded like things got way hairier than I expected.</p>
<p>“Is Chloe all right, then?”</p>
<p>“No problems there,” Shuna said. “The moment she reverted to her child form, she regained consciousness. We’ve placed her in the medical center for observation just in case.”</p>
<p>That was a relief. I had been told first thing that we had no casualties, but I couldn’t really breathe easy until I saw things for myself. She was probably sleeping, so I decided I’d stop in to visit her the next day.</p>
<p>Still… What an enemy we had to deal with. That diversion posing as an invasion, luring us into lightening the guard around Ramiris—and Deeno picked <em>that</em> moment to turn traitor. He was more powerful than Beretta, and not even Beretta and Apito together could stop him. Apparently he was <em>this</em> close to scoring Ramiris, but Zegion popping in just in time had saved the day.</p>
<p>One false move and it would’ve been a monumental disaster. The thought of what would’ve happened if Zegion <em>hadn’t</em> woken up then made me shudder. I couldn’t thank him enough for being on time.</p>
<p>I have to say, though, it was a surprise to see that Velgrynd came back. I’d been told she was working with Masayuki and the Empire’s top commanders to discuss their future direction. I’d need to meet and talk with her later, and no doubt she’d want to collect her thoughts <a id="page-116"></a>before then as well. But if Velgrynd stepped up to protect Masayuki, I guess that pretty much proved it now, huh? It made sense to me, but it also just added to the pile of questions I had.</p>
<p>But we could tackle that stuff later. For now, I was going down my list of people due to brief me.</p>
<p>“Well, Ramiris, I’m glad you’re okay, at least!”</p>
<p>“Oh, you don’t need to tell <em>me</em> twice. And, ya know, it’s not like Deeno tried anything funny with me at all, but if I got trundled out of the labyrinth, I woulda been in a heap of trouble. Right? I mean, if I <em>really</em> tried at it, I could kick that kid’s butt six ways to Sunday, but still!”</p>
<p>Good to see this ordeal didn’t shake her at all. She was clearly angry about it, but now that she was safe, she was back to issuing idle threats like usual. In fact, she had still been peacefully sleeping when I got back, mumbling along the lines of, <em>“Mmmm, damn you, Deeno, I’m gonna execute all forty-eight of my sure-kill moves on you…,”</em> and so on. She always aggrandized her strength in her dreams, and that was apparently just as true when the target of her ire was safely far away from her.</p>
<p>“Yes, Deeno should be grateful that Lady Ramiris didn’t break out her forty-eight death strikes!”</p>
<p>Treyni, looking after her, wasted no time propping up her ego.</p>
<p>“Right? Right? I know!”</p>
<p>Ramiris eagerly nodded back. This was exactly why she got carried away all the time, you see. I asked Treyni in my mind to cut it out a little.</p>
<p>“My sincerest apologies, Sir Rimuru. I was negligent in my directorial duties. I never imagined Deeno would turn against us…”</p>
<p>Vester, meanwhile, was hanging his head low. He had shown up here ahead of everyone else in order to say sorry to me, in fact. He always had a strong sense of duty that way, and this event had shaken him pretty hard. So I smiled back, trying to soothe him.</p>
<p>“Nah, nah, quit worrying about it so much! We all had our doubts about Deeno from the start, so…”</p>
<p>Ramiris, Treyni, even Beretta—they all eagerly agreed with this.</p>
<p>“He’s a demon lord, you know. I didn’t trust him from the start!”</p>
<p><a id="page-117"></a>“No. And I did not expect him to try anything this bold, but I always made sure he was kept on careful watch in case he tried something.”</p>
<p>“And he <em>was</em> more dedicated to his work than any of us expected. That surprised me more than anything.”</p>
<p>They were trashing him pretty badly. I kinda wanted them to trust him a little more, but that was all shot now. Deeno only came here because Guy told him to, besides, and he didn’t even try hiding the fact that he was a spy. No wonder we always had our eyes on him.</p>
<p>But the way I saw it…</p>
<p>“There’s no need to dwell on it, Vester. I don’t think Deeno did all that out of malice against us.”</p>
<p>That was my honest take. I’d expected him to pull something like this the whole time, yes, but in some ways, it felt like he’d all but asked us to keep a constant watch on his behavior. Maybe he thought it’d come to this eventually—I couldn’t help but suspect that.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, he could’ve picked a less awkward way of dealing with us,” said Ramiris. “I would’ve been happy to talk with him about it…”</p>
<p>“Right? If we were all getting along that well, don’t you want to give him another chance? Deeno might’ve had his own obligations to deal with, too,” I offered.</p>
<p>My conjecture seemed to convince Vester.</p>
<p>“Indeed. Well, if you want to continue trusting Deeno, I will as well. I’ve made mistakes in my career, but thanks to you and King Gazel, I’ve returned to the right path. Nothing is more reassuring than having an ally on your side.”</p>
<p>Vester relaxed his expression a bit. He seemed to be over whatever was bothering him, and I was glad for that.</p>
<p>Besides, I really did want to believe in Deeno—and I had another good reason for that, although I planned to keep it a secret until I had more confirmation. There was a distinct possibility Deeno possessed an angel-type ultimate skill. The reports said he’d evolved an ultimate skill from a unique one during battle, which sounded a little too convenient to me, but if it was true, it meant he could conjure skills out of nowhere like that.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>I firmly agree. Evolution mid-battle like that is normally unheard of.</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-118"></a>Ciel, my heartfelt friend and partner, was on my side here. I relied on it more than anyone else.</p>
<p>I had given a name to Raphael in the heat of the moment while I was fending off Velgrynd, and the result was Ciel, this new manus core of intelligence. This was far more than just some simple thinking engine. Much like Chronoa, it performed its calculations independently from its master, kind of like I had a second mind operating in my body. It was clearly sentient, and now it was far more humanlike in its reactions.</p>
<p>That, I suppose, was why I felt so assured after Ciel backed me up just now. It had made plenty of mistakes as well, but no reason to bring that up now. Besides, if it had remained in its unevolved Raphael form, I would’ve been in serious trouble, right? And looking back, it hadn’t been operating too well when I was faced off against Ludora (or Michael, I guess?), apparently because of Ultimate Dominion’s effects.</p>
<p class="space-break">…</p>
<p class="space-break">That habit of falling silent whenever the conversation wasn’t going its way was as strong as ever.</p>
<p>Basically, what I’m saying is that I likely would’ve lost if it hadn’t become Ciel for me. Looking back now, it made me shudder how close to the brink I had been for a moment.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>This strikes me as pointless theorizing at this juncture.</em></p>
<p><em>Wow, it’s more of a sore loser than I am.</em> Force the conversation into a conclusion and leave it at that—a page from my book. I know we both march to the beat of our own drums, but still.</p>
<p>Anyway, it seemed clear to me that Deeno was hiding some kind of special power I’d like to know about.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>It is likely he was trying to disguise it. However, given his unnatural behavior, I am certain he possesses certain other abilities as well.</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-119"></a>Mm-hmm. If Ciel says so, it’s likely true.</p>
<p>Deeno was probably being controlled by Ultimate Dominion, what with having an angelic-type ultimate skill and all. He and I weren’t connected by a soul corridor, so I couldn’t just go and remove it from him that very moment, but I might be able to do it if we ever faced off against each other. That being said, there was still a chance Deeno had betrayed us out of his own free will, so I couldn’t be too optimistic. Either way, though, I wasn’t going to write him off as a hated enemy just yet.</p>
<p class="space-break">It would’ve been nice if the topic ended at this point, but Vester wasn’t the only person down in the dumps.</p>
<p>“I sincerely apologize, Sir Rimuru, for exposing Lady Ramiris to danger…”</p>
<p>Now it was Beretta taking a knee and bowing his head before me.</p>
<p>“Whoa there, Beretta!” Ramiris yelled. “You did a real good job for me!”</p>
<p>I think Ramiris was right. Beretta did an excellent job against Deeno, an opponent who far outclassed him. No mistakes were made at all—in fact, I wanted to thank him for buying us so much time. I was concerned that Beretta would blame himself for any setback he’d faced in battle, and it looked like I was right. He and Vester are good reminders that there’s such a thing as being <em>too</em> dedicated.</p>
<p>“No, no, you successfully stalled for time like you were trained to do. You did a great job for me!”</p>
<p>“But Lady Ramiris granted me the post of Dungeon Master, the keystone to all our defenses. You, as well, directed me to keep Lady Ramiris guarded. And now look what happened…”</p>
<p>Beretta was still arguing vehemently against himself. I’m sure he was frustrated about this, but Beretta had done all the right things down there. He’d sized up Deeno, decided whether he could beat him, and then carried out his assigned role. If he had made the wrong call and tried charging into a fight he could never win, Ramiris would be well away from Tempest by now, and I wouldn’t want to imagine the resulting carnage.</p>
<p>“So look, Beretta, you need to be more proud of yourself.”</p>
<p>I think my praise was getting through to him. He seemed calmer <a id="page-120"></a>finally. And why not? The enemy’s strategy had failed miserably in the end, and that meant Beretta and his cohorts had put up a brilliant performance.</p>
<p>“If you say so…”</p>
<p>Beretta was calmer but apparently still unconvinced.</p>
<p>“Still worked up about it? All right. Let’s talk about this more later, okay? Come visit me in my chamber.”</p>
<p>“…! Y-yes, my lord! Thank you!”</p>
<p>If Ramiris was safe, then all was well—but Beretta refused to accept that. He got preoccupied with things way too much. Regardless, we’d have time to dig deeper into this later, so I moved on for the time being.</p>

<p class="tx1">Ramiris and Vester were done with their briefings, so I turned toward Geld and Adalmann.</p>
<p>“Great job protecting the city, Geld! You have my sincere thanks.”</p>
<p>“I hardly deserve the praise, sir. I love this city, and I’m not about to let all our hard work be torn to pieces that easily. All my companions feel the same way, and I promise we’ll improve ourselves so you never have to be worried about us!”</p>
<p>“I’m glad to hear that, but don’t push too hard, okay?”</p>
<p>Even now, I felt like Geld was overworking himself. If he went further overboard with it, he’d make everyone look like they were slacking off by comparison. It must put all his underlings on edge, I imagine. Their boss deserves some rest when he needs it.</p>
<p>After I reinforced this with Geld, he moved on to his report. It seemed our enemy was closely involved with Deeno; Geld had dealt with two of them, both women, named Pico and Garasha. As Ramiris also confirmed with me, they were part of the Seven Primordial Angels, serving the dragon Veldanava directly. Before then, they were seraphim, the loftiest and most powerful echelon of angels, tasked with preserving stability in the world. Deeno once belonged to this group as well, apparently, but we were running on the assumption that the foes who appeared on Floors 50 and 70 were a different force from these Primordials.</p>
<p><a id="page-121"></a>“I’m pretty sure the Primordial Angels govern over this other world, monitoring this powerful, unstoppable monster they banished there, y’know? But the way Deeno was talking, there are three of them left here as well.”</p>
<p>Those three, I imagine, were Pico, Garasha, and Deeno—former seraphim who became “fallen” and now lived on the surface world. They kept watch over things, but we didn’t even know if they were ordered to or just did it because they wanted to. All we could do was use the pieces of information we had to guess at their motivations.</p>
<p>“They were fairly powerful. If I hadn’t evolved, I doubt I could’ve fended them off.”</p>
<p>If that’s how Geld put it, they must’ve been pretty damn fierce. Pico was handled by Kumara, but that battle got pretty heated, too, they said. But given how the enemy was also meddling with the labyrinth at the same time as this fight, we could assume they weren’t putting their full force into the battle.</p>
<p>“Hmm… Sounds like trouble.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p><em>I’d prefer not to antagonize them, but it’s too late for that. Let’s bet on the assumption that Deeno’s being controlled and work out our strategy from there.</em></p>
<p>Now for the other force we’d run into.</p>
<p>“So what about Zarario, then?”</p>
<p>I listened to Adalmann explain.</p>
<p>“He was a fearsome foe indeed. Sir Charys and Lady Treyni were handling him until I showed up, but they said they were all but helpless against him.”</p>
<p>This dude was even scarier, it turned out. I looked into the labyrinth’s archives to check out the battle, but he was clearly a different type of creature from the fallen. He called himself part of the Three Mystic Leaders, too, a servant of the Mystic Lord—and that meant Feldway, that haughty Mystic Lord, was once the leader of the Seven Primordial Angels.</p>
<p>The three Primordials who joined him in the other world were now working with him as the Three Mystic Leaders, I suppose. While they were gone, though, Veldanava disappeared on them, so they had no way to return here. Then, somewhere along the line, they transformed from angel to mystic.</p>
<p><a id="page-122"></a>Now it made sense. They must be lending a hand to this effort for reasons apart from Deeno and his friends—maybe a friendly favor or whatever. That was my wishful thinking, at least.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>I agree with you.</em></p>
<p>Well, that was reassuring. If Ciel thought so, too, it had to be the case.</p>
<p>“Either way, the Three Mystic Leaders and their crew are definitely enemies to us. I want all of you to keep that in mind and stay alert!”</p>
<p>With that warning, I related everything I knew to my audience, mostly regarding Michael and the Mystic Lord Feldway. The exact nature of Michael’s abilities was a key issue for us, so I revealed it all without hiding anything.</p>
<p>“W-wait! So…so you think Deeno is…?! That’s why you said we should trust in him, Rimuru?”</p>
<p>So Ramiris finally noticed. I wasn’t going to bring that up until I was surer about it, but this worked.</p>
<p>“Hopefully it’s not premature to say that, but there <em>is</em> a possibility he’s being manipulated, yes. If that turns out to be the case, Ramiris, let’s forgive him, okay?”</p>
<p>“Sure, all right. I hope you’re correct!”</p>
<p>Ramiris gave me a cheerful smile. She seemed in brighter spirits than before, so I suppose taking this approach was the best thing for us. Now I’d just have to hope I was right about Deeno.</p>

<p class="tx1">So as we exchanged this information with one another, the party went into full swing. Rigurd was crying his eyes out, joyous as he was that we were all safe. Rigur extracted enough funding from Mjöllmile to ensure we had plenty of food to go with all our drinking—and Mjöllmile was an eager participant himself, showing off some parlor tricks for the guests. It’s always nice to know I have such well-adjusted people working for me.</p>
<p>With all the major briefings over, we were a bit more relaxed now. Relaxed and having some serious fun.</p>
<p><a id="page-123"></a>“I don’t know who these Three Mystic Leaders are, but let me at them, and they’ll be eating dirt in no time!”</p>
<p><em>Great to hear, Benimaru.</em> And really, I could barely recognize him compared to before he set off to battle. Wonder what’d happened to him?</p>
<p>“Gwah-ha-ha-ha-ha! And with me on your side, our next war is guaranteed to end in victory for us!”</p>
<p>Gabil was boasting away as well…and much like Benimaru, his boast was backed by a sudden, unexplained boost in his strength.</p>
<p>“Woooo! So cool, Sir Gabil!”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>“You’re an even greater man than ever. I’ll follow you my whole life!”</p>
<p>His forces were as jubilant over him as always.</p>
<p>“My brother, <em>please</em> don’t get carried away. You nearly got yourself killed this time, didn’t you?! And all of you realize that heaping all this praise on him is exactly <em>why</em> he gets so full of himself, don’t you?!”</p>
<p>Soka wasn’t as appreciative of this, but I hoped she’d let it slide for today. Gabil <em>did</em> do a lot to worry her, though, so I wasn’t gonna step in and stop her. That wasn’t just me running away from trouble, either; I want to make that very clear.</p>
<p>A bigger concern was the dude next to me domineering over the entire crowd.</p>
<p>“Kwah-ha-ha-ha! I understand you got your rear end beaten, Charys! I keep <em>telling</em> you that you need more training!”</p>
<p>“I have no defense, my lord.”</p>
<p>“Kwah-ha-ha-ha! No, you’d <em>better</em> not make excuses! Be brave enough of a man to admit your defeat!”</p>
<p><em>He already did, dude.</em> And didn’t Veldora lose to Velgrynd, too? Was he in any position to laugh in people’s faces about their losses?</p>
<p>“Didn’t <em>you</em> lose, too?”</p>
<p>“Huhhh?! Wha…? What are you talking about, Rimuru?! I—I didn’t lose at all. I was just a little out of shape!”</p>
<p><em>And</em> he was making excuses about it, too. For all his lecturing Charys, he was barely one to talk, either.</p>
<p>“B-but, my master, you know… He couldn’t help it! The enemy interfered with him in, like, the most cowardly way ever! It doesn’t count at all!”</p>
<p><a id="page-124"></a>“Y-yes, indeed. Well said there, Ramiris! No, my winning record remains unblemished!”</p>
<p>They haven’t forgotten that Velgrynd is right there, have they?</p>
<p>It was such ugly excuse-making, I thought about bringing it up. I wouldn’t have needed to worry so much if Veldora didn’t lose, but we all knew how <em>that</em> turned out…</p>
<p>“Charys, I know Veldora can be a pain, but I hope you won’t abandon him, okay?”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! Don’t worry about that. Sir Veldora is my master now, and I intend to improve myself so I can earn more of his favor.”</p>
<p>So serious-minded. Kind of reminds me of Geld, in fact. That sure went to waste serving someone like Veldora…but still, I was really glad Charys had decided to serve Veldora for me.</p>
<p>The party continued on, and with it came a wealth of fine drinks. I was worried we were letting our hair down too much, but I was the only one—my officers, after all, had no problem neutralizing alcohol in their bodies. That made me wonder what the point of drinking was at all, then…but as they put it, they could still enjoy the feeling of inebriation and the way it loosened their tongues. I was the same way, so I decided not to go too deeply down this rabbit hole.</p>
<p>“All right, Sir Rimuru, allow me to fill you up!”</p>
<p>“Hold on, Diablo! It was my turn next!”</p>
<p>Diablo and Shion were bickering with each other behind me. I really had a lot of trouble figuring out whether they loved or hated each other. They squabbled over the weirdest of things…</p>
<p>“Now, now, quit fighting over pointless matters and have something to drink yourselves, won’t you?”</p>
<p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh… I’d be happy to.”</p>
<p>“You can’t trick me! I fall asleep when I drink, so I’m going to worry about attending to Sir Rimuru first today!”</p>
<p>Diablo was a wine person, it looked like. I can’t speak intelligently about how wine tastes, but yeah, that suited his personality well. As for Shion, well, it wasn’t that booze put her to sleep so much as it made her blackout drunk—getting tangled up with other people, causing a scene, you name it. Shuna had to keep a sharp eye on her, and the fact that she remembered none of it afterward made it harder to deal <a id="page-125"></a>with. I’d usually offer her grape juice at times like these, but if she was abstaining today, that was fine.</p>
<p>Actually, looking closer at the two of them, hadn’t <em>they</em> gotten stronger, too? In fact, all my top officers had grown in one way or the other, actually. Not just awakened—it was like something else happened to them…</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Please stop being suspicious of me.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, sorry.</em></p>
<p>But… Yeah. Not even Ciel could help people with their evolutions.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>I just provided a bit of a helping hand.</em></p>
<p><em>Wait, you</em> did<em>?!</em></p>
<p>I really wanted to dive into this, but we were in the middle of a party. If Ciel could do that now, it’d still be able to tomorrow, so let’s just enjoy this moment for all we can. So, procrastinating on all my problems until the next day, I immersed myself in the feast.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">All my officers took the next day off.</p>
<p>I felt bad for working Rigurd and the administrative staff, but I asked them to check on the condition of our city’s infrastructure and relay to our citizens what was going on. The city was back on the surface now, but we needed to see if things like the water and sewer system were damaged at all. Once our safety checks were complete, we’d allow evacuees to return to their homes. We had just wrapped up a major war, so I wanted our administration to get the rest it needed, but we also had to consider everyone else’s lives as well.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, working in government really <em>is</em> like being a slave to the people, isn’t it? You have enough problems crop up in normal times, but whenever an emergency comes up, time off is the first thing to go on you. Things had gotten easier now that Testarossa and her pals were pitching in with governing, but we still needed to work on finding more personnel.</p>
<p><a id="page-126"></a>Me? I’m an amateur, of course, so my job’s more about reading through our documents and stamping my seal of approval on things. If something seemed like too much for us, I either rejected it or sent it back down to the relevant department for further consideration, that kind of thing. It only worked, really, because I had Ciel handle all the detailed explanations for me. If it was only me, this structure would’ve collapsed long ago.</p>
<p>So while it was the day after a big party, I still had a lot of stuff to check and approve. Rigurd and his team were busy scurrying around the city, so this way, at least I wouldn’t feel guilty about being lazy.</p>
<p>But first…</p>
<p>Before I got to work, I decided to see how Chloe was doing. The moment I stepped into her room in our medical quarters, our eyes met.</p>
<p>“Mr. Tempest…um, I mean, Rimuru!”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee! You don’t have to try so hard to talk like a grown-up. To me, you’re the same Chloe you always are.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on! I know I look like a kid, but I’m every bit as grown up as you are. In fact, Rimuru, I’m even older than you.”</p>
<p>I get that, but…I dunno, exteriors <em>do</em> count for a lot. When a total stranger sees me, they apparently think I’m a cute little girl, after all…which was becoming a big hang-up for me. Careless words can really sink ships—that’s important to remember.</p>
<p>So I told Chloe how happy I was to see her safe, although she was blushing and pouting at me. She reacted by hiding her face in a pillow.</p>
<p>“Ugh! That’s so unfair, Rimuru!”</p>
<p><em>Um? How should I be interpreting this…?</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Unclear. It is too difficult a question to answer.</em></p>
<p>If Ciel didn’t know, I certainly didn’t have a chance, either. So I just said, “Now, now, now,” to try to assuage Chloe.</p>
<p class="space-break">After waiting a while for her to calm down, I asked for her story—what had happened in the battle and what had resulted from it.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m perfectly fine, but I can’t talk to Chronoa anymore. The <a id="page-127"></a>ultimate skill Sariel almost went out of control, so she’s suppressing it for me.”</p>
<p>So Michael’s rule was influencing her after all. Trying to take over something <em>this</em> precious was all but picking a fight with me. I’d seen Michael as an enemy before, but I didn’t think I needed to show any mercy at this point.</p>
<p>“How do you feel now?”</p>
<p>“Hmm… I dunno. I can’t fully handle Yog-Sothoth, and Chronoa isn’t around to talk to, so I don’t really know what’s going on.”</p>
<p>Things sounded more serious than at first glance. I hadn’t been relying on Chloe’s battle skills from the beginning, but I guess I kidded myself into believing she could defend herself well enough. I rued that thought now, but the way things stood, Chloe’s safety took first priority.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>As I am now, I have the right to interact with data particles, so I can influence Chronoa as a manas. If I go into Chloe’s spiritual space and invoke Ability Adjust, I could likely remove Michael’s influence.</em></p>
<p class="space-break">Oh? So Ciel could act upon her.</p>
<p>“Chloe, I think I can improve things for you if I act upon your skill a little…”</p>
<p>“You can’t do that, Rimuru. Back then, right at the end, Chronoa told me she couldn’t exist independently if I relied on you any longer. Like, <em>‘If I want to stand hand in hand with that man, I have to get out of this situation by my own power,’</em> and stuff. And I agree with her, too, so I can’t have you help me, Mr. Tempest.”</p>
<p>Chloe stared me in the eye as she spoke. Her own eyes were sharpened upon me, despite her childish exterior, and I could imagine the beauty they’d have when she was an adult woman. It was more than enough to leave an impression on me. Not that I’m into kids or anything. It’s just that Chloe was so incredibly— Ah, better stop there. I was gonna be following in the footsteps of a certain blond-haired demon lord before long, and that’d be a big downgrade in my book, so I turned my mind elsewhere.</p>
<p><a id="page-128"></a>“All right. But if anything comes up, tell me, all right? I’ll always be happy to talk things over with you.”</p>
<p>I patted Chloe on the head. She smiled appreciatively at me and gave a slight nod.</p>

<p class="tx1">The moment I was back from my visit, Vester asked to speak with me on an urgent issue.</p>
<p>“What’s up?”</p>
<p>“Thank you for taking the time to see me. I know you must be exhausted by now…but I’ve received word from King Gazel.”</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Vester propped his glasses back up on his nose. “As you likely surmise, he’s demanding an explanation for all this.”</p>
<p>Great. We staged a gigantic war in the backyard, then unceremoniously left without even bothering to clean up. No wonder he was mad at me. We didn’t confine this whole deal to my territory, after all. We got the Dwarven Kingdom mixed up in it…</p>
<p>“Yeah, um, did he sound angry?”</p>
<p>“I’d surmise he wasn’t elated about it, no.”</p>
<p>Vester wiped the sweat from his brow. I’ll <em>bet</em> he was nervous. He had been partying it up with me over beer last night, after all, so this was kind of his fault, too. I was sure that with all the stuff we’d dealt with, he simply didn’t have the time to deal with Dwargon matters, and it’d be mean to press him on that. But I was also sure Vester felt irresponsible for not letting me know sooner. I was the most at fault, but…</p>
<p>“Can you send a reply saying I’ll explain matters at a later date?”</p>
<p>“I think we’ll need to add an acceptable excuse, sir.”</p>
<p>That’s Vester for you. Sharp as a tack about this stuff. I love how much I can rely on him.</p>
<p>Either way, we needed to organize a lot of things before we could give him or anyone else a coherent explanation. The first thing was to work out a schedule for this meeting. For now, I was leaving King Gazel in Vester’s capable hands; once we had everything worked out, then I’d discuss matters with the king.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Now I was on my lunch break. Banishing all troublesome issues from my mind, I focused on enjoying my favorite meal of fried <em>karaage</em> chicken and <em>yakisoba</em> noodles in sauce.</p>
<p>Then the thought occurred to me. <em>What kind of stuff has Ciel been up to behind my back?</em> Ciel had mentioned last night that it <em>“provided a bit of a helping hand,”</em> and I thought I needed to work out exactly how much of a hand it was and what exactly it involved. Ciel’s <em>“bit of”</em> help could often be far, far more than a bit, after all.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Mm, being treated with such suspicion is quite upsetting to me.</em></p>
<p>So began Ciel’s testimony. Just as I thought, it had been up to all kinds of nonsense.</p>
<p>The first thing it did was upgrade my skills without permission. That was based on the ultimate skill Shub-Niggurath, Lord of Abundance, and I did receive a report about all that…after the fact. When Velgrynd’s Ability Adjust wrapped itself up, her skill Raguel, Lord of Relief was integrated with the remains of Uriel, Lord of Vows, the essence of both being inherited by Shub-Niggurath. Ciel had gone over all that with me, but I was too focused on Velgrynd to pay any attention.</p>
<p>So I went back over the documentation we had and listened to Ciel explain Shub-Niggurath for me again. It was, in a real way, the crystallized result of the bonds I shared with the monsters who served me.</p>
<div class="top-1">
<p class="ul-list">Create Skill: craft new skills using information taken with Food Chain or Analysis.</p>
<p class="ul-list">Copy Skill: create a copy of an acquired skill.</p>
<p class="ul-list">Grant Skill: give a copied skill to a qualified target as a gift. (It can also be revoked later.)</p>
<p class="ul-list">Save Skill: digitize an acquired skill and instantly re-create it.</p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">That was the gist of it.</p>
<p>My “soul” had a limited capacity, so I could only memorize so many skills at one time, it seemed. That’s why some of my skills were more <a id="page-130"></a>attached to my physical body than to my soul, but that type could express themselves only weakly. In my case, I had four ultimate skills at once, so I was sure my capacity was pretty close to maxed out.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>No, you have actually attained five, not four.</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Oh, right.</em> I had taken in and analyzed Velgrynd, so she’d be the same sort of living thing as Veldora was, and that earned me the new ability Velgrynd, Lord of the Flame.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was probably <em>way</em> over capacity, then. I guess Ciel transferred Uriel over to Velgrynd because I was filled up.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Yes, exactly! I had no other choice but to optimize your skills as much as I could!!</em></p>
<p class="space-break">This was astoundingly fishy. Was Ciel—actually, I saw this trend back in the Great Sage era, even—treating skill collection as a hobby? My space was full right now, but I didn’t want to drop anything. <em>Was that why you forced this evolution?</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>…Allow me to continue my explanation.</em></p>
<p class="space-break">It changed the subject! Not only did turning into Ciel make it feel much more human—now it was acting even more like a reckless freak, it seemed. But…no. <em>It’s all right. It’s okay, isn’t it?</em> Please <em>be okay</em>, I prayed to myself as I resolved to trust in Ciel.</p>
<p>Anyway, as Ciel put it, all the many skills taking up needless space in my soul had been dismantled, digitized, and streamlined for peak efficiency—and Shub-Niggurath had been crafted to oversee this process. With this ability, I could now influence all monsters connected to me via soul corridor—to be exact, I could grant them abilities. I think it goes without saying how insane a power this was.</p>
<p>Now Ciel was using Shub-Niggurath to <em>“help a bit”</em> with Benimaru and the others. It was hard for me to complain about this, given that we stood a much higher chance of losing if this didn’t happen. In fact…I decided to thank Ciel.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em><a id="page-131"></a>Not at all. I simply acted upon the wishes of my master.</em></p>
<p>We had talked a lot, but Ciel really did help me out. <em>Keep up the good work</em>, I said, thanking it one more time.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">With that in mind, I now had a better picture of what had happened to everyone.</p>
<p>Considering we had enemies like Michael and the Mystic Lord at hand, we needed to build up our powers—but I couldn’t dole out my strongest abilities as gifts to just anyone. Too much power in the wrong hands can destroy a person, after all, and I trusted Ciel in the choices it made. It was addicted to tinkering with people on extreme levels, I knew, but I didn’t think it’d try any truly impossible enhancements on anyone.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like Ciel gifted anyone with skills they couldn’t fully use, but I still wanted to confirm that. But as I thought about that, Ciel mentioned something out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>By the way, my master, we had talked earlier about running Ability Adjust on you. Would you like me to execute that?</em></p>
<p>I had totally forgotten. And I could tell Ciel was practically dancing around, incredibly eager to push the button. Guess it had come up with even more incredible improvements after much fumbling around.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, it talked about integrating the ultimate skill Veldora, Lord of the Storm with Uriel to create the new ultimate skill Hastur, Lord of Starwind. But Ciel had given Uriel to Velgrynd in the meantime, so I suppose this “Ability Adjust” would turn out different now. Knowing Ciel, it certainly wouldn’t be a downgrade.</p>
<p>On that topic, I had heard nothing about it, and Ciel didn’t mention anything, but I was willing to bet it had fully analyzed Raguel for me by now, right?</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em><a id="page-132"></a>Of course.</em></p>
<p><em>Thought so.</em></p>
<p>So I basically had six ultimate skills, then? That, and my evolved officers were providing me with power via Food Chain. No wonder Ciel needed Shub-Niggurath to manage all this stuff. Integrating and combining skills certainly seemed like the right thing to do—no point juggling a bunch of skills and not being able to fully exercise them.</p>
<p>It looked to me like it’d try to integrate Velgrynd, Lord of the Flame with Belzebuth, Lord of Gluttony to create something new. I was also wondering what happened to Raphael, Lord of Wisdom, now that Ciel had decoupled itself from it. If Ciel said it could optimize this extensive collection of skills I’d amassed, I had no reason to say no. We weren’t at war right then anyway; I didn’t see the problem.</p>
<p><em>Okay, let’s go through with it— Ah!</em></p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>Acknowledged! Executing with haste!!</em></p>
<p>I was just about to say, <em>Wait</em>, but it was already too late.</p>
<p>Looking back, I’d committed a lot of mistakes in life. I’d regret them, but then I’d go commit more, never considering the consequences…and here I went again, huh? Why did I give out permission so carelessly like that? I never even checked exactly what kind of fearsome modifications Ciel would perform on me. I never should’ve given it carte blanche like that…but Ciel already had all its preparations in place, and it pressed the figurative Ability Adjust button instead of letting me hem and haw over it.</p>
<p><em>It’s too late to stop it now</em>, Ciel bragged, whistling a tune as it went.</p>
<p>I think I’m safe in saying that Ciel expected all this—the way I’d casually give permission, then immediately try to walk it back in a panic. It had accepted my request with dizzying speed, and now it was happily at work on it, like a dog with a biscuit on its snout who’d been waiting an eternity for the “go” signal…</p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-133"></a>So, without offering another reply, Ciel was immersed in its work. I was all but resigned to my fate. I mean, I was sure it’d pull some kind of crazy-ass new results for me, but…</p>
<p>…well, if Ciel was busy, I wasn’t gonna get anywhere with my government paperwork. Best to turn the page for now and concentrate on my other duties.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">While Ciel was beavering away, I wanted to engage my top-ranking officers in personal, one-on-one discussions. I sent Shion and Diablo out of my room for privacy reasons, and so I was alone for a little while.</p>
<p>Shion needed to check on her own troops, so she left without complaint, but Diablo was a brat about it, talking about the need for a guard and whatnot. Finally, I told him, “You know, depending on how these conferences turn out, I might relieve you of your secretary duties. Wouldn’t Testarossa be much more qualified anyway? She’s strong <em>and</em> beautiful, and any secretary/bodyguard of <em>mine</em> needs to be strong—you see what I mean?” That seemed to get the point across to him, and he left my office in a hurry.</p>
<p>Heh-heh-heh… I had no intention of that at all, but he was <em>so</em> susceptible to this kind of talk. I was sure he was desperately staging practice combat with Testarossa and the other evolved demons right now. I doubted he would lose, but it could be a pretty good fight, actually. Losing would be a good lesson for him anyway—he needed to feel in danger <em>some</em> of the time.</p>
<p>Now I was going to use this moment to interview my officials. I called Shuna and had her work out the schedule. That evening, I would have them visit this office in order, starting with those freest of obligations.</p>
<p class="space-break">First up was Beretta. I’d promised we’d have more time to talk later, so I invited him in first. With interviews like these, the first and last ones up tended to be the most nervous, but apparently in Tempest, <a id="page-134"></a>people saw being picked first as the greatest of honors. I didn’t really understand that, but that’s apparently how it worked, and Beretta was in a really chipper mood over it.</p>
<p>“So about your concerns—you really have nothing to answer to about being defeated this time. Like, it’s not even a defeat. You prevented the enemy from achieving their objectives, and I’d call that a victory.”</p>
<p>A <em>great</em> victory, really, seeing how nobody died. I tried to drive that point into Beretta, but he was still unpersuaded.</p>
<p>“I understand that, my lord, but a loss is a loss. To those of us in the black tribe, any loss is a hard pill to swallow.”</p>
<p>So he recognized we won, but he himself felt like a loser? He was <em>so</em> serious about this. So was Charys. If it were me, I’d be telling everyone I knew about how I sealed the victory. Maybe it’s quibbling, but if <em>I’m</em> convinced I won, then I did. Even a moral victory is fine by me.</p>
<p>The “black tribe,” by the way, was a family tree in the demon race. I learned this only recently, but it turned out Beretta was a member, with Diablo (back when he was simply known as Noir) at the top. They <em>did</em> resemble each other in areas, especially in what sore losers they were. It made sense.</p>
<p>Thus, I could certainly appreciate Beretta’s frustration over this…but he really couldn’t help how this turned out. I “awakened” my troops as an award for victory in this war, but the recipients had to be both demon-lord seeds and connected to me via soul corridor. And Beretta wasn’t—</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>He satisfies these conditions.</em></p>
<p><em>Whoa! You scared me!</em></p>
<p>Ciel was busy with its own work, but I guess it was lending an ear to our conversation. So maybe it could help with my paperwork, then—</p>
<p class="space-break1s"><em>I happen to have enough souls gathered here to awaken just one person. What is your decision?</em></p>
<p><em>…Are you dodging my questions again? Maybe I shouldn’t have evolved</em> that <em>ability of Ciel’s…</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><em><a id="page-135"></a>Negative. No fact like that has been detected.</em></p>
<p><em>No, Ciel, stop acting like you’ve suddenly been downgraded back to Raphael.</em></p>
<p>But in <em>that</em> case…</p>
<p>It looked like we’d gained some more souls in our fight against the imperial force. Using those, I could make all of Beretta’s dreams come true. He worked real hard, after all, and I gave him no reward for it. I mean, he <em>was</em> technically serving Ramiris, not me, but I still saw him as a cherished friend. Protecting Ramiris was a tremendous job, and I wanted to keep counting on him for it. How about I show him how much I care—and ease one of his concerns while I’m at it?</p>
<p>“Well, I can understand if you’re despondent about your lack of power. Let me give you further powers, then!”</p>
<p>I stood up, mustered the most demon-lordliest pose I could, and extended a hand toward Beretta.</p>
<p>“Remember, all I can do is offer you assistance. What happens next is up to you.”</p>
<p>So I used my 100,000-souls trick on Beretta and carried out the evolution ceremony. Since I was the one who named him, he no longer could evolve by himself, and maybe this was necessary to karmically make up for that.</p>
<p>“Wha—?! You wouldn’t…!!”</p>
<p>“Beretta, you are likely to evolve now. May Ramiris continue to enjoy your protection!”</p>
<p>He was pretty surprised, but the evolution completed without a hitch—and much like the rest of Diablo’s tribe, he wasn’t put to sleep by it.</p>
<p>As for how this evolution turned out…</p>
