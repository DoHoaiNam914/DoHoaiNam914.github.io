      <p class="noindent"><a id="page-79"></a>“What’s bothering you today, Leon?”</p>

      <p>The question was lodged by Elmesia El-Ru Thalion, Heavenly Emperor of the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion. It was pointed, of course, at the demon lord Leon Cromwell. He had made a stop at Thalion before returning home after the Walpurgis Council.</p>

      <p>“Guy is going to be visiting my lands. I’m afraid I can’t stay for very long in here, so let’s skip the pleasantries and get straight to business.”</p>

      <p>“You always were impatient like that, hmm? But if <em>these</em> are the circumstances, I can hardly blame you.”</p>

      <p>Leon coming over to Thalion and meeting with Elmesia without an appointment was, in itself, a sign of just how much preferential treatment he was receiving. He was also forcing the topic without even considering Elmesia’s feelings about it. An observer unaware of their relationship would find it to be an absolutely unbelievable sight.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>That relationship dated back before Leon became a demon lord—even before he was a Hero. He was wandering the world in search of Chloe, and one day his travels brought him to Thalion. There he <a id="page-80"></a>came across Elmesia’s mother, Sylvia El-Ru, a woman with all the time in the world.</p>

      <p>She was a high elf, one of the “true” elves, and a famed genius known for her core theories in the field of sorcerous science. But she had another face as well—that of the best pupil of Twilight Valentine, vampire and demigod.</p>

      <p>Sylvia was a strong woman. If she had been there to help, maybe her husband—Elmesia’s father—wouldn’t have had to die. But it was not to be, because Elmesia herself had been in Sylvia’s womb at that moment.</p>

      <p>In time, Sylvia became Leon’s instructor, imparting all the swordsmanship and magic she knew. It was only natural that it would help Leon grow immensely. Thanks to that, Leon became acquainted with Elmesia as well. He had gained access allowed only to family and close friends, and that was why he had been granted an audience with Elmesia now.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>With Elmesia’s blessing, Leon began to speak.</p>

      <p>“You’ve deployed at least some intelligence operatives, haven’t you?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, of <em>course</em>.”</p>

      <p>Elmesia wasn’t shy about admitting it.</p>

      <p>“Then you know the demon lord Rimuru has won against the Eastern Empire?”</p>

      <p>“We’re aware of everything up to the Primals’ actions. We spoke briefly after their victory party.”</p>

      <p>“What about the fighting after that?”</p>

      <p>“…What was his name? Yuuki? I heard they were fighting in tandem with an informant within the Empire, but unfortunately, our information source was cut off right at the worst possible moment…”</p>

      <p>Leon nodded in understanding. Then he revealed what he knew, hoping to gauge Elmesia’s reaction.</p>

      <p>“Well, quite a few things happened at once, it seems. Velgrynd <a id="page-81"></a>made her appearance, Veldora had his mind taken over… It turned into a very dangerous situation. But Rimuru still managed to push all that aside and emerge victorious.”</p>

      <p>“Huh? He did?”</p>

      <p>“So you really don’t know, then? Let me give you a brief summary.”</p>

      <p>This he did, as succinctly as possible. He also went over their discussions at the Walpurgis Council, leaving almost nothing hidden. He knew he could never put one over on Elmesia, so he decided to just be honest and request her help.</p>

      <p>“I see… Well, if <em>that’s</em> how it worked out, I can see why he declined to go into detail with me.”</p>

      <p>She sounded convinced. When Rimuru told her “Hey, we won,” she had no idea it meant <em>that</em> much. They “won” against Velgrynd herself… It shocked Elmesia into silence. She’d always thought of him as a rather strong figure, but never did she imagine that he would grow into this kind of monster.</p>

      <p><em>Looks like he grew beyond my own mother long ago. No wonder he’s out there taming Primals.</em></p>

      <p>So he released both Velgrynd and Veldora from their thrall for a huge comeback victory. Michael and the other enemy leaders escaped his grasp, but as she saw things, it was safe to call this a huge victory for him.</p>

      <p>“I do want to ask, Leon—you’re not trying to deceive me with lies, are you?”</p>

      <p>“I have no reason to be dishonest with you. I heard it from Rimuru himself, though, so I cannot say if it’s the absolute truth.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm… You must trust that demon lord quite a bit more than I thought.”</p>

      <p>“What do you think of that story? About how Emperor Ludora’s been taken over by his own skill and is now calling himself Michael?”</p>

      <p>“Well…if you’re lying about that, I wish you’d give me a more believable tale…”</p>

      <p>“I know exactly what you mean. It’s so preposterous, I’m willing to believe just about anything at this point.”</p>

      <p>Such was Leon’s evaluation. It made Elmesia grin.</p>

      <p><a id="page-82"></a>“As suspicious of everyone as you are? That’s hard to believe.”</p>

      <p>“It’s not a joke. Rimuru can stoop pretty low sometimes, but he’s not the kind of man to brazenly lie to others. In fact, he’s quite the opposite—”</p>

      <p>“He tries to make people underestimate him, is what I assume you’re about to say? If so, I agree.”</p>

      <p><em>It’s so very much like that slime to do that</em>, Elmesia thought. All these Primals he’d tamed, and still he pretended that was no big deal. And it was the exact same with this war, too. Nonetheless, knowing that slime, she was sure Rimuru had gotten involved in something huge, so she planned to sit with him and ask what happened once things settled down.</p>

      <p><em>Sounds like a real mess he’s gotten into. Something I know he can’t talk about over our “cell phone” devices, but maybe I should have asked for more details.</em></p>

      <p>Elmesia’s expression didn’t change, but she could still feel regret. He’d said, “We won,” and that was enough to fully relieve her. That was a mistake.</p>

      <p>“Still, if Veldora remains friendly and Velgrynd is now on their side, that’s excellent news, is it not?”</p>

      <p>Leon nodded. “From what I heard, it’s a miracle any of them survived that. I, at least, would have no chance of defeating Velgrynd in battle.”</p>

      <p>If he fought Guy, then maybe there’d be one chance in a thousand. But against the Parallel Existence skill Rimuru described to him, Leon had no way to win. And that, he was sure, was why Rimuru had no reason to lie to him about winning against that skill.</p>

      <p>“I’m certain of that, yes. I wouldn’t, either. There’s no reason to beat yourself up about it.”</p>

      <p>“I wasn’t doing that.”</p>

      <p>“Really?”</p>

      <p>“Yes.”</p>

      <p>Leon wanted to get back on topic. Elmesia loved teasing her conversation partners whenever she had a chance. Seeing the writing on the wall, he opted to get right to the most important matters at hand.</p>

      <p><a id="page-83"></a>“So, given everything I’ve told you, I have a request. I’d like to get in contact with my master.”</p>

      <p>“My mother, hmm…?”</p>

      <p>Elmesia understood what he was asking. Given his possession of the ultimate skill Metatron, he could never escape the control of Michael in a confrontation. He needed to do something about that before his ownership of that skill became known.</p>

      <p>However, Elmesia alone didn’t have the knowledge needed to help him. Given how serious things were, she saw the need to tap into the greatest wisdom available in Thalion.</p>

      <p>But Sylvia was…a free thinker. That, and the greatest fighting asset Thalion had. She was also gifted in stealth; if Sylvia hid somewhere, finding her would be far from simple. One could deploy all thirteen leaders of Thalion’s Magus corps, and it would still be a coin flip whether they found her. Any attempt at a magical call would be blocked, so there was no way to contact her. She <em>did</em> pay regular visits, though, and she’d be open to talking then…but outside of those occasions, contacting her was difficult.</p>

      <p>These “regular visits” occurred about once a year. There was a reason for that, and Elmesia didn’t mind this frequency at all. Besides, it was rare for Thalion to encounter a problem so thorny that it couldn’t be solved without resorting to Sylvia. There were certain other secret methods they could tap into—methods available in case things were <em>really</em> getting out of hand…</p>

      <p>“Not likely?”</p>

      <p>Elmesia sighed at Leon’s direct question. As Sylvia’s pupil, Leon was something of a darling little brother to Elmesia. Bluntly refusing this request made her hesitate a little.</p>

      <p>“I’ll do my best…but you may need to wait upward of half a year, at worst.”</p>

      <p>“…All right. If you could, then.” Leon stood up.</p>

      <p>“Leaving already?”</p>

      <p>“My business is done.”</p>

      <p>Elmesia chuckled. She wished he could relax a little more, but this was just like Leon. So awkward throughout his whole life.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Once Leon left, Elmesia began to fulfill her promise. She ordered a royal guard to initiate emergency contact with Sylvia.</p>

      <p>It so happened that Elmesia and Sylvia looked exactly alike, and they would occasionally swap roles so Elmesia could take some time away from her imperial duties—a secret shared only between the two of them.</p>

      <p>“Oooh, I <em>know</em> she’ll resent me for this…”</p>

      <p>Interrupting Sylvia’s free time was likely to enrage her. Elmesia knew that, but there was just no avoiding it now. She was ready to hold out, no matter how much her mother complained about it…but she still didn’t think she was making the wrong choice. This was a crisis like none she had seen before. From what she was told, they were even sending the demon lord Guy to serve as Leon’s bodyguard. Guy, abandoning his domain of permafrost? That alone indicated just how bad things had become.</p>

      <p>“All this time I’ve lived, and I’ve never seen anything as dire as this…”</p>

      <p>Mulling over this put a melancholic frown on Elmesia’s face. The whole thing depressed her.</p>
