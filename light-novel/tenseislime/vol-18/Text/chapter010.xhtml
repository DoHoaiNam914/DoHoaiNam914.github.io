      <h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="toc.xhtml#toc-chapter010">BRIEF NORMALCY</a></h1>

      <p class="noindent"><a id="page-87"></a>Five months had passed since the Walpurgis Council.</p>

      <p>A lot of stuff happened in the meantime, but really, it couldn’t have been more peaceful. Michael showed no signs of activity. We couldn’t keep track of Feldway and his mystic force, which was a concern, but I chose to remain optimistic. We were being given all the time in the world to shore up our defenses.</p>

      <p>And actually, I had another reason to take it easy. It turns out that we managed to get back into contact with Deeno in the meantime. How? Via the curse that Zegion had placed on him during their fight. This curse spell formed a sort of connection between them, as Ciel explained it to me, so I asked whether we could use it to converse.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>It would be simple.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">Ciel’s casual assurance made me stop in my tracks. If conversing with Deeno was on the table, then that was a huge boon. So I promptly reached out to admonish him a bit.</p>

      <p>With Deeno, at least, I almost preferred for him to side with our enemies. He was performing miscellaneous duties over at Ramiris’s workshop, but even as our ally, he mostly just seemed to be lazing around and eating well on my dime. I couldn’t shake that image of <a id="page-88"></a>him… So, really, him staying in the enemy camp as he leaked out info to us was far more useful to me.</p>

      <p>As I think I’ve said before, a useless ally is far more fearsome a thing than a talented enemy. That described Deeno to a tee, and in fact, he was contributing to our cause simply by sticking with our opponents.</p>

      <p>Now, as for how our conversation turned out:</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>(Yo-ho-ho! How’s life, Deeno?)</p>

      <p>I could sense Deeno panicking the moment I said that. Which—yeah, speaking right into someone’s brain outta nowhere would surprise anybody.</p>

      <p>(R…Rimuru?)</p>

      <p>(Wow, way to recognize me. Yeah, it’s me, okay? Your old pal.)</p>

      <p>I didn’t mean to sound like a mafioso or anything, but I <em>did</em> want to lay the pressure on. He had to understand that I held the dominant position here.</p>

      <p>(Um… So what do you need? Because I’m pretty busy right now—)</p>

      <p>He sounded beyond reluctant. I smiled to myself. <em>You can’t run from me now</em>, I thought as I sent my words straight into his mind.</p>

      <p>(Oh, you know, it’s nothing too complicated. So I’m led to understand that you tried to pick a fight with us?)</p>

      <p>(W-well, uh, not a fight, exactly… I mean, nothing that elaborate or whatever…)</p>

      <p>(I’m not too interested in hearing excuses, thank you. I think what matters more right now is whether you’re talking in good faith with me or not.)</p>

      <p>(Good faith…?)</p>

      <p>(Because it sounds like you not only led a bunch of invaders into Ramiris’s labyrinth, but also went on your own little violent rampage, too. And you even planned to kidnap Ramiris, didn’t you?)</p>

      <p>I grinned as I painted Deeno into a corner.</p>

      <p>(W-well, about that… It was kind of, you know, there were these orders I was forced to follow—)</p>

      <p><a id="page-89"></a>(I think I just told you that I don’t want to hear excuses, didn’t I?)</p>

      <p>(Y-yes…sorry…)</p>

      <p>I wasn’t too sure who the bad guy was in this conversation any longer, but so what? I’m a demon lord. So’s Deeno, actually; it’s not like this was bothering my conscience at all. Thank heavens for that.</p>

      <p>So Deeno, perhaps realizing he was in a no-win situation, wasn’t giving me much to work with. Seizing this chance, I made him an offer.</p>

      <p>(Now, normally your behavior would never be forgivable, but I’m willing to look the other way this time. But I’ll only do it if I see that you regret what you’ve done.)</p>

      <p>(Really?! Oh, I regret it a lot. But I kinda have my own obligations, too, and that’s why all of this happened. I think you know what I mean, don’t you?)</p>

      <p>(Oh, sure, loud and clear. You were just being controlled by Michael.)</p>

      <p>(…What?)</p>

      <p>No awareness of it, just like I thought. But it didn’t seem to me that Deeno was too loyal to Michael at all. He was always self-serving that way, and that actually helped me a lot.</p>

      <p>(W-wait. Seriously?! I’m being controlled?)</p>

      <p>(Yeah. Totally. I don’t think you willfully did any of that, even.)</p>

      <p>So I told him all about Michael’s skill set.</p>

      <p>(…Anyway, yeah, it looks very much to me like you have at least one angelic skill, but am I wrong?)</p>

      <p>(Oh, no way… Yeah, I got one. An ultimate. Astarte, Lord of High Heaven.)</p>

      <p>So Deeno’s got Astarte? I don’t know what it does, but it sure <em>sounds</em> angelic to me.</p>

      <p>(Right, that one. And that’s why Michael’s able to control you—while you remain totally oblivious.)</p>

      <p>Judging by Deeno’s reaction, it might’ve been a good idea to keep him in the dark about all this. It looked like Michael didn’t have complete control over him—clearly, he wasn’t under some oath of fealty or anything—so he cracked pretty quickly. Knowing his personality, I had a feeling that I could seal the deal on this fairly easily.</p>

      <p><a id="page-90"></a>(So what should I do? Because even hearing that, I don’t feel any anger or whatever toward Michael. I don’t feel like double-crossing him, and I don’t feel like rejoining your side, either. And I didn’t notice until you made me aware of it, but this does feel kinda weird, yeah.)</p>

      <p>He had told me his ability, and I made him aware of the truth. I’d say this contact’s been a big success so far. But let’s see about going in even deeper.</p>

      <p>(Well, I have a theory. If you had a demonic-type ability, one that could resist an angelic one, maybe they’d cancel each other out and then you’d be free of this. There are a couple of other remedies I could try out, but there’s an element of luck to them all, so I wouldn’t recommend them.)</p>

      <p>This “cancel out” theory had its basis in Chloe’s experiences. Chloe avoided having her mind taken over thanks to possessing the manas known as Chronoa. Apparently she was no longer in contact with Chronoa at the moment, but I was willing to bet she was fighting hard to remove the override circuit on the Sariel skill. I wished I could help her, but with this, I trusted that she and Chronoa would figure out a way.</p>

      <p>So as for the “luck” approach… Well, that was a lie. Not that I didn’t trust Deeno, but he <em>was</em> still under mind control. I wasn’t dumb enough to reveal my entire hand from the get-go. The way I saw it, if I used Predation on Deeno, Ciel would probably figure out the rest for me. Just like it would with Leon, actually. But, again, that felt kinda gross to me, so I wanted to save that for when all else failed. As a result, I told Deeno that there was a <em>chance</em> I had a working solution, and I just left it at that for now.</p>

      <p>(…Okay. Well, I don’t want to be under his control forever, so I’ll see if I can’t do something about it on my end, too.)</p>

      <p>(Whoa, whoa, don’t push it. Michael’s side is in a state of total war with us demon lords, remember. So I don’t want you to do anything, okay? Just lay low and don’t do anything to make them suspect you.)</p>

      <p>I could ask a spy of mine to bring info from Deeno, but I still couldn’t fully trust it. I wasn’t sure that Zegion’s curse forced him <a id="page-91"></a>to tell me the truth—and even if it did, what if Michael made him tattle on me? I couldn’t tell if Zegion’s force was beating Michael’s rule or not, so for now, relying on potentially suspect data would be way too dangerous.</p>

      <p>But hang on! Leaving Deeno dangling like this would be such a waste, wouldn’t it? Besides, why do <em>we</em> have to be the only ones doing all the heavy lifting around here?</p>

      <p>(That’s all you want from me?)</p>

      <p>Being told not to do anything was clearly right up Deeno’s alley. He’s such a dupe that way. Not like I’d be <em>that</em> kind to him.</p>

      <p>(Well, I’d feel terribly sorry, asking you to betray Michael as well.)</p>

      <p>I tried to sound nice to him, but really, I couldn’t wait to put him to work.</p>

      <p>(Oh, um, I’m not planning to, but if you want me to throw some info your way, that’s cool!)</p>

      <p>Whoa. He’s fine with that? He really <em>can’t</em> be trusted, can he? Right down to the core…but, well, that’s fine. If we can make him work for us without making him feel like he’s betraying anyone, that’s perfect.</p>

      <p>(No, that’s all right. Just don’t do anything, okay?)</p>

      <p>(For real? After all that talk about “good faith” a minute ago?)</p>

      <p>I was really liking the direction I was guiding this talk. I knew how much of a contrarian he was, and I wanted to use that to make him volunteer to do stuff for me. That wound up being exactly the right approach.</p>

      <p>(Well, if you don’t participate in any fighting, for example, that’s the same thing as scratching you off Michael’s arsenal.)</p>

      <p>(Oh, right, yeah!)</p>

      <p>It annoyed me how readily accepting of this he was, but that’s Deeno for you. Let’s run with it.</p>

      <p>(Okay. If you say so, then. If I see anything useful, I’ll let you know.)</p>

      <p>(Sure. Much appreciated.)</p>

      <p>Good, good. He’ll be a dedicated spy for me without even realizing it.</p>

      <p>(I’ll dedicate myself to observing stuff around here, so let me know if anything comes up. Is that good?)</p>

      <p><a id="page-92"></a>(Oh, actually, do you know what Michael’s up to right now? If he’s making any moves soon, do you know when?)</p>

      <p>With Deeno now fully on my side, I decided to ask what I wanted. I could tell if he was lying to me, so as long as he didn’t tell anyone else about this, I could get some pretty reliable intel from him.</p>

      <p>(Well, he’s sleeping now, it looks like. You know, he got Velgrynd’s power, and then he took Velzard’s right after that. The strain was too much for him, I guess, so he’s pretty much dormant.)</p>

      <p>Whoa. Pretty big piece of intel to kick off with. And here I thought he’d weaken Velzard a little before acting. Why the big hurry, huh? …But, ah, she <em>did</em> fight Guy, so maybe that weakened her enough. Then again, I don’t think Velzard or Guy were fighting for <em>real</em>, so maybe her energy was too much for Michael anyway.</p>

      <p>But he’s got her “draconic factors” now, huh? That could potentially trigger some kind of transformation in him, so we better watch out for that. And if so, that begs another question.</p>

      <p>(How did Velzard turn out?)</p>

      <p>(She’s recuperating right now, too. I think she’ll be back to normal in a few more days.)</p>

      <p>Aha…</p>

      <p>I think this means we shouldn’t expect an immediate attack—but, <em>man</em>, True Dragons sure heal up fast. They do, but I’d like to assume we won’t see any serious attempt at an invasion until Michael, their commander, is back in action.</p>

      <p>(All right. Thank you.)</p>

      <p>(Oh, that much is no problem at all.)</p>

      <p>There was a lot more I wanted to ask—the enemy’s numbers, for example—but let’s end it there. Keeping Deeno cheerful about these data leaks was the best way to retain him as a source.</p>

      <p>(Sure. I’ll be in contact again later.)</p>

      <p>(Right… Oh, I just remembered. If you could tell Ramiris I said sorry to her, I’d really appreciate it.)</p>

      <p>That request came just before I cut off our chat. Nuh-uh.</p>

      <p>(What? Apologize to her yourself. She’s pretty worked up about it, you know. She said she’s got forty-eight different lethal attack moves she wants to test out on you.)</p>

      <p><a id="page-93"></a>(Dude, there’s no way she’s got forty-eight of them! Like, her dropkick’s about the only move she has!)</p>

      <p>(Hey, that’s what she told me. None of my business, all right? Anyway, now you know.)</p>

      <p>I thought I could sense Deeno smiling.</p>

      <p>(Heh-heh… Got it. Talk to you later, then.)</p>

      <p>(Yep. See you.)</p>

      <p>With that acknowledgment, I shut off the link.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>So, yeah, that’s how things went. I think it turned out really well. I had also shared this conversation with my fellow demon lords, carefully omitting the part about Deeno being my mole.</p>

      <p>Thanks to what he told me, I was now quite a bit more relaxed about things. There was a chance everything he said was a trap—I couldn’t deny that—but it’d take someone like Ciel to engineer something like that so perfectly. Being <em>too</em> wary would fray my nerves, which wouldn’t be fun. It also played into the enemy’s hands, so I ultimately decided that it was better to act natural. The same thing I thought when I heard the angels were attacking, actually.</p>

      <p>I’m the type of person who, if something can be done tomorrow, I do it tomorrow. Whenever I got assigned summer homework, I was all gung ho about it the first few days, promptly abandoned it, and then wrote out the whole thing the last day before school started again. What if I couldn’t finish it in time? Well, I’d just go to school, tell the teacher “I forgot,” and get yelled at. If the teacher said to bring it in tomorrow, I’d complete it if I could, and if not, I’d break out the “I lost it” excuse the next day. I mean, I tried my best if I wanted to finish it ASAP, but it’s important to admit when something’s too tough to handle.</p>

      <p>What? I should make more of a consistent effort? Well, you see, I don’t have the focus for that.</p>

      <p>So there’s my philosophy—as long as you’re prepared to get yelled at, things have a way of working themselves out. In other words, <a id="page-94"></a>take responsibility for your own behavior, I suppose. But now I’m way offtrack.</p>

      <p>I had Deeno call in each morning to report on whether Michael was awake yet. I don’t think even Michael could’ve foreseen every possibility. He has access to the skills of anyone under his thrall, but I doubt he could read their thoughts. If <em>that</em> were possible, he’d have to process mounds and mounds of information all the time, and it’d become way too hard to sift through it all for useful stuff. And why would Michael bother with that if people under his control couldn’t lie to him anyway?</p>

      <p>My basis for this reasoning was all Ciel. Ciel itself stated that it was impossible to read every single thought in someone’s mind, even those you’re connected to via soul corridor. You might be able to detect some in your surface psyche, but anything being pondered over deep inside your mind couldn’t be accessed. If you asked the subject a question, you <em>might</em> be able to see the answer in their mind—and I think I was familiar with that already. I felt like people were reading my thoughts a lot, actually, something I was trying to be more careful about.</p>

      <p>Anyway, that’s why I placed more than my usual trust in Deeno’s statements.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="tx1">So during these five months that Michael lay dormant, I was working out our preparations for the final battle.</p>

      <p>The other demon lords and I built up a system of cooperation, me working closely with all their home bases to ensure we could handle any emergencies quickly. It was mostly me doing the work, though. Forging a treaty that stated we’d come to each other’s aid if possible was really significant, but having to coordinate everything myself was a huge pain. I think the proceedings from our last Walpurgis showed just how hard it was to debate matters with such a selfish group of demon lords.</p>

      <p>First, as promised, we were building permanent transport circles in the domains of each demon lord. After the council, I asked <a id="page-95"></a>Mizeri to take me to the relevant domains; there I recorded the necessary coordinates to make it possible to transport in and out easily.</p>

      <p>All the others gave their permission for this, of course. Guy’s Icefayr Castle was the site of the recent council, so I already had those coordinates squared away. I had also been to Lune before, the holy capital of Luminus’s Holy Empire of Lubelius, and Milim’s as-yet-unnamed domain was also extremely familiar territory to me. Thus, I had to visit only <em>two</em> domains to scope out their coordinates: the Golden Land of El Dorado and the Holy Void of Damargania.</p>

      <p>Daggrull’s domain really <em>did</em> look like the barren remains of a holy land. I’d have loved to tour around in-depth when I had the time, but work came first. I hurried right back to Tempest, where I got ready to send off Ultima and the others.</p>

      <p>One thing I learned from our conversations was that Milim and Daggrull were <em>not</em> capable of transport-based travel. Ramiris, too, of course.</p>

      <p>“Well, you know, I’m not good with anything like that…,” Daggrull admitted.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, me neither!” said Milim. “Why sit around calculating all these complex coordinates when I could just fly right over, huh?”</p>

      <p>Both valid excuses, I guess. And, yes, with teleport magic, you could only go to previously recorded locations. The skill Spatial Transport gave you a lot more freedom, but it still wouldn’t work unless you had the coordinates for both your starting point and your destination, or at least a real accurate idea of them. You needed a firm grasp of the start and endpoint’s relative positions to each other, so you could calculate the correct angle and distance for the jump. It might seem easy, but there’s a time lag as well, and overall it’s actually a pretty tricky skill to use.</p>

      <p>Milim’s got a natural instinct for this kind of thing, so she didn’t see why she had to do a bunch of math. She’s actually very gifted at these calculations, but I guess she saw them as a pain to do. And Daggrull, well, he’s more brawn than brains…and Ramiris needs no explanation.</p>

      <p>These transport circles were Guy’s request, but they might prove <a id="page-96"></a>pretty valuable going forward. Leon and Luminus could use their magic and skills for transporting themselves, but seeing as how they didn’t object to building these circles in their domains, I guess they saw their usefulness as well. Anyone can use these, after all, including humans without much in the way of magic. In fact, one could use the magicules in the air to transport nearly fifty humans in one go, and that’d make it a lot easier for them to travel to any nations between the circles.</p>

      <p>It’d be neat to build an even bigger infrastructure later on, but efficiency would be a problem. Transporting living creatures, as I knew by now, required a very large amount of magicules. If you waited around for the magicules in the air to get replenished, I calculated that a circle would only be capable of one transport per week. Demon lords like us could supplant this with our own magicules, but for humans, that’d require a hell of a lot of work.</p>

      <p>Still, the potential was there. Use these to transport goods and freight, and it’d be a revolution in logistics. In fact, it threatened to make the magitrains we were developing obsolete before we even completed a rail network. Clearly, there were a lot of issues to be addressed, and I needed to compartmentalize for the time being. Taking advantage of this tech was a topic for another time.</p>

      <p>…So we were constructing these transport circles, but the ones in the demon lords’ domains were all done now. How did it work out?</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>The first one we finished was in Tempest, of course. I placed it in an isolated chamber of the labyrinth, for safety’s sake. That way, enemies couldn’t make use of it.</p>

      <p>Our next circle was put up in Damargania. I traveled there with Ultima in tow, and we had it whipped up in a jiffy. Normally I would’ve delegated the job to someone else, but given the situation, we couldn’t afford to waste any time.</p>

      <p>Plus, Damargania was in kind of a unique location. It was home to a vast, ancient city, one ruined by the definitive battle between <a id="page-97"></a>Guy and Milim long ago…but the repercussions from that tragedy were still there today. There were several reasons why this area was called the Barren Lands, or the Deadly Desert. The sandstorms that constantly blew around the region corroded everything they touched, and they also effectively isolated Damargania from the outside world.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Chances are that when Guy and Milim’s clashes of force were about to cause cataclysmic destruction, their powers were forcibly sent to another dimension to keep the fallout as light as possible. However, this force has not fully disappeared, but is still leaking out from local dimensional rifts. That is likely the cause of this sorry state of affairs.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">Such was Ciel’s analysis. It was long, long ago, but still affecting the land now? Freaky.</p>

      <p>Anyway, this was the kind of dangerous land Daggrull ruled over. And within Damargania was a gigantic edifice, Skyspire Tower, that honestly did seem to pierce the heavens themselves. Around it was the so-called Holy Void, a safe zone that had managed to avoid the worst of the destruction. A barrier had been erected over it since ancient times, and the outside was just as dangerous as the eternally frozen lands Guy called home. Weaker creatures would be killed by the sandstorms that stabbed at you like knives, and even stronger ones couldn’t last long in this landscape without paying the ultimate price.</p>

      <p>That applied to Daggrull and his race of giants, too. Their higher-level warriors were one thing, but the weaker giants, to say nothing of the women and children, were far too vulnerable to dream of venturing outside the safe Holy Void. If that was true for giants, then for humans, the place was nothing but a death zone.</p>

      <p>And so, instead of sending out someone like Vester’s team, I did all the work personally. Of course, it mostly involved installing the magic circle itself. It was a saucer of pure magisteel, around three or four feet high and twenty or so in diameter, with the necessary magical incantations constructed by Ciel and carved on top. <a id="page-98"></a>I placed it where Daggrull specified, and that was it, really. The little details would be the job of the demons who came along with Ultima.</p>

      <p>“You’re working under orders from Sir Rimuru! Don’t you <em>dare</em> embarrass me as you complete this job!”</p>

      <p>That, I suppose, was Ultima’s way of encouraging her demons. Or threatening them, most likely, but given the demons’ talent for magic, I didn’t worry much about entrusting the rest to them.</p>

      <p>I was about to leave…</p>

      <p>“Are you sure about this, Rimuru?”</p>

      <p>…only to have a concerned-looking Daggrull stop me.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, it won’t be a problem. Veyron’s here with Ultima, and if they run into any trouble, we can call Zonda back here, too. The test was successful, so letting them handle the final adjustments won’t be an issue at all.”</p>

      <p>It <em>shouldn’t</em> be an issue. Ultima and her team may not act that way, but they <em>are</em> great demons, bearing the kind of wisdom I couldn’t hold a candle to. Nothing weighed on my mind at all as I wrapped up my work.</p>

      <p>“No, I mean, what if these demons start to get violent and—?”</p>

      <p>“Well, I’m on my way! Thanks again!”</p>

      <p>Daggrull was about to say something, but let’s just gloss over that. Changing personnel at this point would be too much more annoying work, so I fled as soon as I could.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">After Damargania came Lubelius. I put the magic circle in the spot Luminus specified, and the rest would be handled by the overcomers here—along with Gobkyuu, my foreman. With him overseeing things, I was sure they’d construct a splendid building to serve as the transport facility—and the overcomers would have no problem computing all the destination data and other details.</p>

      <p>“I think we’ll be able to work all this out. We’ll stay in contact with Tempest and Damargania as well, until we bring this up to a serviceable level!”</p>

      <p>They seemed ready for the job, so that was the end of mine. But I had one more bit of business. Shion, Adalmann, and their respective <a id="page-99"></a>personal forces were due to report to Luminus. They would all be traveling at once, but the question was where we’d house them.</p>

      <p>“No need to worry about that. We have free rooms in my temple, so they can sleep there.”</p>

      <p>“Much appreciated. Shion, Adalmann, make sure you’re good guests for these people.”</p>

      <p>“Absolutely, Sir Rimuru! I promise I will carry out our mission and not place shame upon you as your secretary!”</p>

      <p>I’m so anxious about this. Really, if the enemy attacks here, I’ll almost want her to do nothing and just contact me.</p>

      <p>“A pity there won’t be any kitchen to cook in, however. They say you’ll become rusty if you skip so much as a single day…”</p>

      <p>Who’s “they”? And isn’t that more about playing piano, or some other kind of really delicate talent? And speaking of which, with Shion as talented a violin player as she is, doesn’t she need to keep practicing <em>that</em> instead?</p>

      <p>“Hey, don’t you need to practice your music at all? I know how dedicated you are to battle training, but I’ve never seen you playing the violin outside of that concert.”</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee-hee! Don’t you worry about that. With consistent training from day to day, playing an instrument is quite simple. But with cooking, you need to make all these precise judgments at every step…”</p>

      <p>Crazy. She was thinking about it in a completely wrong way. I kept myself from rolling my eyes, as I mentally demanded she apologize to every would-be musician in the world.</p>

      <p>That being said, no matter how much Shion screwed up those “precise judgments” in the kitchen, you’d at least be assured that it’d taste good these days. You ran the risk of overdosing on salt or sugar with her stuff, though, so she was right that judgment was key. Either way, though, her appraisal of cooking and music was completely backward.</p>

      <p>“Your name is Shion, right?” Luminus said as I brooded. “When it comes to battle training, I know that Hinata is relatively free. In fact, I could even spar with you if you’d like. And as for cooking… Well, I’m sure I can procure a spare kitchen and fill the pantry for you, so feel free to do whatever you like.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-100"></a>I was stunned. Luminus truly knew no fear…and meanwhile, I was shaking. It was such a surprise to me that I was almost too late to stop her.</p>

      <p>“L-Luminus, allowing Shion to cook is kind of a—”</p>

      <p>“Oh, I don’t mind. In times like these, the diversions you enjoy become more important than ever. I was quite passionate about cooking myself, once upon a time… Hee-hee-hee. In fact, it could be fun to test a thing or two out together.”</p>

      <p>“My, what a wonderful idea! But don’t expect to outclass me over a hot oven, Lady Luminus!”</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee… Hinata is quite a good cook, too, you know. I’ll invite her to join us.”</p>

      <p>You gotta be kidding me. This was a full-blown crisis. And Hinata’s joining in, too? It’s beyond <em>my</em> help now, lemme tell you. Let’s just hope a higher power can guide them all to safety.</p>

      <p>“W-well, Adalmann, have fun with them!”</p>

      <p>“What?!”</p>

      <p>Despite how pious and devoted he was, Adalmann must’ve felt a premonition disturbing enough that not even <em>he</em> could approve of this. But the die had already been cast.</p>

      <p>“So yeah, lemme know if anything comes up,” I said as I fled at full speed.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Stop number three was Milim’s domain—the former Eurazania, a place I knew well. But instead of the holy mountain that towered high within its boundaries, I was looking up at a gigantic building, still under construction. I had transported myself to the remains of the capital, waiting for our guide; Geld had already left ahead of us, so I was with Gabil, Carrera, and Esprit at the moment.</p>

      <p>Gabil had come with Kakushin, Sukero, and Yashichi, his favorite brownnosing yes-men, along with Gazatt, a captain in Team Hiryu. I don’t know who Gabil thought of as his main second-in-command, but these four certainly stood out of the dragonewt crowd, at least.</p>

      <p><a id="page-101"></a>Despite the dangerous battle everyone knew was ahead, Team Hiryu was in a remarkably joyful mood. Apparently this was because their training sessions with Ultima were on hold until further notice. Those sessions were so grueling, I heard, that many of the students had died multiple times during them—and since they were held inside the labyrinth, they wailed at me, not even death earned them a break. Guess the labyrinth could be unfair that way. This wasn’t training that’d make you figuratively say, “Oh, man, that almost killed me” afterward—here, death was a given.</p>

      <p>The strength boost that resulted was pretty conspicuous to me, though. Merely evolving and retaining more magicules didn’t make you truly stronger. Only through the effective use of that newfound strength could you be called a first-rate warrior. But still, guys, you can’t go <em>too</em> far. I sure don’t wanna go through training like that, so I resolved to tell Ultima to try being a little more sensible about this.</p>

      <p>So, all told, there were a bit over a hundred people in our party, and we had been waiting for around ten minutes. Milim told me via Thought Communication that she’d be here today, but maybe she forgot?</p>

      <p>“She’s late, isn’t she?”</p>

      <p>“Now, now, Lady Carrera, we’ve only just arrived. Let us be calm, like a visiting tourist should, as we patiently wait for her!”</p>

      <p>“You’re so forgiving, Sir Gabil.”</p>

      <p>“I think it’s more that Lady Carrera is too quick-tempered.”</p>

      <p>“Did you say something, Esprit?”</p>

      <p>“No, nothing.”</p>

      <p>It may have only been ten minutes, but I could understand why Carrera was peeved. Still, that’s only because I used to live in Japan, where my life was scheduled down to the individual minute. In this world, that made you seem needlessly impatient. People had the <em>concept</em> of time, of course, and there were clocks and stuff, but the kind of accurate wristwatches I had in my previous life just weren’t found in the markets. You’d see rather bulky pocket watches at times, but those were typically carried only by nobles or rich merchants. As a result, if you agreed to meet someone in the “early <a id="page-102"></a>afternoon” or something similarly vague, the normal custom was to send a messenger ahead of you. Milim had neglected to do that, which was on her—but maybe she just had the time (or day) wrong, so it’d be immature to get all livid about it.</p>

      <p>Still, that would do nothing to assuage Carrera, so I needed to step up.</p>

      <p>“Hey, no big hurry, you know? I’ll check with Milim right now.”</p>

      <p>I sent a Thought Communication her way.</p>

      <p>(Uh, Milim? We’re here, but we didn’t see anyone waiting for us.)</p>

      <p>(Mm?! R-Rimuru? I’m busy with homework right now, but I did tell Middray about you guys! M-maybe he was mistaken about the meeting time? I’ll give him a stern reminder, so don’t get angry at him!)</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>Now it made sense. She must’ve been so busy with the homework Frey gave her that she forgot to relay my message.</p>

      <p>(All right. No need to hurry, though.)</p>

      <p>(O-okay! I’ll talk to you later!)</p>

      <p>Sure. These things happen sometimes.</p>

      <p>I tried keeping Carrera calm as we waited…but then something unexpected occurred. A group of people ran up to us, their leader saying the strangest things.</p>

      <p>“Ah, you must be the demon lord Rimuru! So much more gallant than I’ve heard… Truly, a figure of fine dignity. I, Jagie, am ever admiring of you!”</p>

      <p>Jagie then gave a respectful bow of the head…to Gabil, not me.</p>

      <p>He looked like a fellow dragonewt, but unlike Gabil, his form was straight-up human, with two horns on his head. He was on the small side, but stout, and every move he made was brimming with energy. The five magic-born accompanying him came from a variety of species, but otherwise weren’t too noteworthy to me.</p>

      <p>For some reason, Jagie had what looked like fresh wounds here and there on his body. I was curious about that, but he acted like he was in fine health, so it couldn’t be too serious. What struck me more was what he said to us. It left me dumbfounded, but Gabil seemed the most surprised of all.</p>

      <p>“Oh, no, no, no, I am merely Rimu—”</p>

      <p><a id="page-103"></a>“Ah, such an august sight! No, there is no need to introduce yourself to a low-level officer such as myself! For there isn’t a soul anywhere in the demon lord Sir Rimuru’s domain who would not be well aware of his name by now!”</p>

      <p>Gabil tried to correct this case of mistaken identity, but he was brutally cut off. What’s the point of knowing someone’s name if you don’t know their face? A lot of magic-born knew both by now, but I suppose the low-level officers were a bit slower on the uptake. I’m guessing that Jagie mistook Gabil for me because of the aura he was emitting, maybe? I had mine perfectly held back, so I looked like a regular human on the outside. Carrera and Esprit were the same, looking neither like demons nor like magic-born, even. We have a lot of human visitors to Tempest these days, so we’ve gotten into the habit of keeping our aura in check.</p>

      <p>We couldn’t let this continue, though. Being treated like this for the first time in a while was actually kind of fun, but Carrera and Esprit had next to no patience for it.</p>

      <p>“Hold on. That guy’s name is Gabi—”</p>

      <p>“And who are <em>you</em> people? His maidens-in-waiting, perhaps? You may have military uniforms on, but if you butt into a conversation between two grown-ups like us, people are going to think you lack education, you know.”</p>

      <p>Oh great, he just cut off Esprit. It was pretty clear who was lacking in education here.</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! What a funny gentleman.”</p>

      <p>Carrera smiled. But behind those words, I could already see a vein throbbing in her temple. She was <em>really</em> trying to be patient, but give her around three seconds, and she would probably explode. Not the time for laughter.</p>

      <p>But Esprit acted before I could.</p>

      <p>“Hey, um, I’d like you to listen to us already, please.”</p>

      <p>With those forceful words, she reached out to Jagie. Not hard enough to call a punch, really, but it had some strength behind it. The type of light blow a weaker magic-born might get knocked unconscious by, unable to react in time.</p>

      <p>Esprit really didn’t have to do that, but Jagie <em>was</em> at fault—mistaking <a id="page-104"></a>Gabil for me, then refusing to listen to reason. I didn’t think violence was the best answer, but if something wasn’t done, Carrera really was going to go on a rampage. Esprit took action because she saw that coming, so I just let it slide this time. If Jagie calmed down and listened to us, it’d be the end of the whole problem.</p>

      <p>But another surprise was waiting. Jagie reacted to Esprit.</p>

      <p>“…Huh?’</p>

      <p>“Hyah!”</p>

      <p>The exchange occurred in an instant. Esprit’s left-side backhand blow was stopped by his right hand; Jagie twisted her wrist lightly. It cost Esprit her balance, and Jagie attempted a sweep with his right foot in the process. Avoiding that kick-like sweep—or maybe anticipating it—Esprit leaped up, twisting in the air as she unleashed a right-side kick at Jagie’s head. Jagie dodged it, leaning his upper body back, but Esprit’s attack wasn’t finished yet. Using the fist in Jagie’s grasp as a fulcrum, she swung her right leg back like a pendulum, completing another kick with her left.</p>

      <p>Now two different kicks were headed toward Jagie’s head at once. It was an acrobatic move—I think I saw it in a fighting manga once, but for anyone who hadn’t seen something like that before, it must’ve been hard to counter. Despite that, Jagie let go of Esprit’s fist and somersaulted back, completely avoiding the combo strike. They were even again, and I was sure they’d drop the kid gloves before too long.</p>

      <p>“Hoh! What a fascinating woman you are,” Jagie said, cracking his neck a couple of times. “Going easy against someone like me? That uniform isn’t just for show.”</p>

      <p>“You’re not too bad, either. Wanna see what I can <em>really</em> do? I bet it could be fun.”</p>

      <p>Esprit cracked her knuckles, a fetching smile on her face. Carrera didn’t move. I didn’t need to see her joyous smile to know that, as her boss, she had no intention of stopping her.</p>

      <p>Gabil, sadly, just can’t be relied on at times like these. I think he’s got a lot of trauma when it comes to the three demonesses, all thanks to Ultima. It was Esprit here, of course, but he still looked unsure whether to speak up.</p>

      <p><a id="page-105"></a>He stole a glance at me. Great. Guess I’m the only voice of reason here. But fine. I’ll dive in. First off, we need to take the man responsible for this to task.</p>

      <p>“Okay, okay, that’s enough. Jagie, right? We’ll never get anywhere dealing with you, so you think you could call your superior over?”</p>

      <p>I stood up straight, trying to sound like a big shot. It was my attempt to act all cool, and maybe I’d give it an eight out of ten? I waited for Jagie’s response as I sang my own praises, but:</p>

      <p>“Huh? What are <em>you</em> doing? Don’t interrupt a real <em>man’s</em> battle!”</p>

      <p>What was he talking about? It instantly set me off. But the next moment:</p>

      <p>“You! Stop being rude to Sir Rimuru.”</p>

      <p>Carrera’s kick shot forth like a lightning bolt.</p>

      <p>“Yes, even <em>my</em> patience has its limits!”</p>

      <p>Jagie was thrown into the air, only to be tossed downward by Gabil’s spear.</p>

      <p>“Oh, they got ahead of me.”</p>

      <p>Esprit had nothing left to do. And as for me:</p>

      <p>“And <em>you</em> guys… Nothing took place here just now, all right?”</p>

      <p>I was busy laying a little pressure on the magic-born dragging Jagie away. Gotta hide the evidence, you know.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">It turned out that we didn’t need to bully Jagie like that after all. It soon became blatantly obvious that Milim’s side was entirely to blame.</p>

      <p>“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Well? Clearly it’s not my fault now, right?”</p>

      <p>“Maybe not. I thought you had forgotten to relay the message, but…well, I never dreamed that you guys held an impromptu tournament to decide who’d come to greet us…”</p>

      <p>The winner of that contest was Jagie, but the real culprit here was Middray, the organizer.</p>

      <p>“Why did you even <em>do</em> that…?” I asked Milim.</p>

      <p>“Hey, my guys are always lookin’ for a fight, but Middray’s crew sure don’t mess around, either!”</p>

      <p><a id="page-106"></a>Frey had both hands covering her face, while Carillon was practically rolling around on the floor laughing.</p>

      <p>“But Jagie’s that strong a fighter, huh?” he asked.</p>

      <p>“Yeah,” I said, “he sure is. Maybe fifty-fifty with Phobio?”</p>

      <p>I was being honest, too. By magicule count alone he was a little behind, but going toe-to-toe with Esprit like that was an impressive bit of action. He might’ve also had the transformation skills of Gabil, and if so, I’d rate him even higher than that. Of course, Phobio had the Animalize skill, too, so it wouldn’t close the gap with <em>him</em> any…and if they fought for <em>real</em>, I’m sure Phobio would seal the win.</p>

      <p>Still, Jagie was definitely a top talent. There really <em>were</em> a bunch of strong dudes in the Dragon Faithful, Middray included. They didn’t rely purely on strength, they knew how to adapt their talents for the situation… All great assets in battle. Too bad they’re all a bunch of muscle-bound clods. That was the cruel reality of it.</p>

      <p>“I could not begin to apologize to you. This is all the result of my careless management.”</p>

      <p>Middray bowed his head low. Given the influence I imagined he held over Jagie, I wouldn’t hesitate to lay most of the blame on him.</p>

      <p>“And…Lady Carrera? I, Sir Gabil, and everyone else here look forward to your assistance in our domain.”</p>

      <p>Good thing Frey’s around to help. Carillon may be a mighty king, but he became that in no small part because he loves bashing heads in battle. He was close to Middray like that, never abandoning the credo that if you’re defeated, it’s your fault for being too weak. In this case, well, I guess we’re lucky that we happened to be the stronger side. If we weren’t, I doubt our talks would’ve gone this well.</p>

      <p>“All right, Carrera. Wanna test each other out a little?”</p>

      <p><em>See? There goes Carillon again.</em></p>

      <p>“Hoh! That’s the spirit! Tell me how easy you want me to go first.”</p>

      <p><em>Carrera’s</em> that <em>ready to join them?!</em></p>

      <p>“Whoa, whoa…”</p>

      <p>“It’s all right, my lord. Sir Carillon has completed his evolution, has he not? It’s only natural that he’d want to see how much stronger he’s become.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-107"></a>“Look, um, that might be true, but we’re not in the labyrinth, okay? If you go too far with each other, you might wind up dying. It’s too dangerous.”</p>

      <p>Gabil and Frey nodded at this…but only them. Everyone else looked unconvinced, Milim in particular.</p>

      <p>“Aw, you’re no fun!” She pouted.</p>

      <p>“Don’t say that!” Frey hollered.</p>

      <p>But, practically speaking, I really couldn’t allow that. <em>Definitely</em> not near a large construction site, for one; we’d have to go somewhere that wouldn’t be affected by the fighting. And staging something like this in <em>these</em> times was all but asking the enemy to come along and attack us.</p>

      <p>Still, Carillon was proving surprisingly stubborn. “Yeah, I know full well how dangerous it could be. But I meant what I said a moment ago. I really <em>do</em> want to know how strong I’ve become before we have to start fighting for keeps. Aren’t you the same, Frey?”</p>

      <p><em>Yeah, well…I guess I have Ciel to help me with that, so…</em></p>

      <p>Even back when it first upgraded itself to Raphael, it still gave me clear answers to everything I asked. I didn’t need to “test my skill” against someone to have at least a basic grasp of their strength. In Carillon and Frey’s case, they had to grope around in battle, scoping themselves out as they tested their abilities, so fighting someone <em>really</em> strong was probably the quickest way for them.</p>

      <p>“I won’t deny that, no,” Frey replied. “But self-evaluation is a problem we constantly have to deal with, isn’t it?”</p>

      <p>“Maybe, but the enemy ain’t gonna wait for us. We got a duty to get strong fast and protect the citizens relying on us. And I think that means we gotta put up with a little rough stuff sometimes. But whaddaya think?”</p>

      <p>“Um…”</p>

      <p>Frey was debated into a corner. Bringing up her duty as a ruler was hard to refute. If this were just a “test your strength” carnival game, she’d immediately turn it down, but if there was a good reason to do this, it was worth debating.</p>

      <p>“Rimuru,” Milim said, “I think I agree with Carillon, too. I’ve been training them myself, but I think that has its limits.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-108"></a>“Agreed. I hate to say it, but awakening like this made me realize how far away I really am from Milim, despite getting stronger. It’s the same thing with you, too, Rimuru. No matter how much I struggle, I’ll never make up the difference. So—”</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee! So you think you could catch up with <em>me</em> instead? You must think very little of me indeed…but you’re right that I’m likely a fairer match than Lady Milim.”</p>

      <p><em>I see…</em></p>

      <p>You know, I highly doubt Carrera and I are that different, in our current forms. But if Carillon feels otherwise, it just shows that he’s become a better judge of the essence of things. Guy had high praise for him as well, and clearly he’s making full use of the power he awakened. I think he’ll be a major asset in the war to come.</p>

      <p>And now, of course, I had Milim asking me. Maybe playing along is the right thing to do?</p>

      <p>“All right. Carrera, you stay here and keep the area defended. I’ll be back with Carillon and Frey later.”</p>

      <p>“Huh? But I was going to fight—”</p>

      <p>“I know just the right person for this in the labyrinth!”</p>

      <p>“Very well. As you wish, my lord.”</p>

      <p>I hated to disappoint her like this, but I couldn’t sweet-talk everybody here. Carrera would just go too far. Ramiris was bound to give me a headache with her complaining. If I wanted Carillon to take on somebody, it’d be much smarter to find a more common-sense candidate.</p>

      <p>Yes, Carillon could be paired with Benimaru. Him or Zegion. And I think someone like Kumara would work with Frey. But we’ll work out the details back home. I’ll be contacted if anything comes up, so we can transport everyone back as needed.</p>

      <p>“Sorry to make you put up with my selfish request.”</p>

      <p>“Nah, it’s fine, Carillon. I sided with you, so I wanna help you, is all. You okay with that, too, Frey?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, of course. I appreciate it, in fact. There’s no reason to turn you down.”</p>

      <p>So it’s settled. We would leave Gabil and Carrera with Milim, and I’d return home with Carillon and Frey. The people under <a id="page-109"></a>them could join in, too, if they wanted. They wouldn’t be at an awakened-level, so I don’t think they’d wreck the local environment too much…probably. I’ll give them a ton of healing potions, too, so it’s up to them whether they want to take this opportunity. It’s exactly how Benimaru and everyone else got stronger, after all, so I had no concerns.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Returning from Milim’s domain, I left them with Benimaru and threw them all in the labyrinth.</p>

      <p>Now it was finally time for me to visit Leon’s domain. Diablo was already there, but I saved Leon for last, so I’m sure they were waiting for my arrival—something that was on my mind as I prepared for the trip. I knew where the Golden Land of El Dorado was, since Mizeri showed me the way before. Transport would thus take an instant.</p>

      <p>“I’ll be your bodyguard,” Soei said—and with him around, my mind was at ease.</p>

      <p>“Do not forget about me, my master!”</p>

      <p>Ranga, popping his head out from my shadow, was pleading his own case. Aww, what a good boy! I gave him a nod and a couple of appreciative pets. He’s with me at all times, but he can be so cute when he does that stuff.</p>

      <p>Something about this trip made me pretty reluctant to go, but I was already in contact with them. It’s always best to take care of the annoying work first, so I slowly lifted myself up.</p>

      <p>“Well, shall we?” I muttered. Then, with Shuna, Rigurd, and the rest seeing me off, I activated the transport.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Leon’s domain was a small continent in itself. Small, yes, but “continent” was the only word for it. Maybe a tad bigger than Australia? It featured a remarkably vast plain, the towns in it laid out in neat grid patterns.</p>

      <p>Before Leon and his forces moved in, there was a lot more natural beauty—forests, plains, rivers, mountain ranges. All of this was <a id="page-110"></a>magically rearranged by force, optimized to maximize output, and these were the results. That’s what the Golden Land of El Dorado was—a kind of man-made metropolis, created with an eye toward maximizing its harmony with nature.</p>

      <p>“Whoa. This is amazing…”</p>

      <p>Arlos the Silver Knight, who greeted me when I arrived, smiled at my muttered observation. “Ha-ha-ha! It’s an honor to hear that. I’m sure it would delight Sir Leon as well.”</p>

      <p>The last time I met Arlos, he had the visor all the way down on his helm. This time, his face was exposed. He was so beautiful, you could almost mistake him for a woman, although not as much as Leon. His attractive silver hair flowed down his back, but between the thickness of his neck and the size of his Adam’s apple, he was pretty clearly male.</p>

      <p>He was also Leon’s second-in-command and the head of his domain’s Magic Knights. The strongest among that crew was reportedly Claude the Black Knight and another man I’ve met before, but Arlos was no pushover, either. He could shoot magic in rapid-fire fashion with no casting time, pulling off transport magic as naturally as snapping his fingers. We had teleported to a spot outside the main city—in other words, beyond its defensive barrier—but he then teleported all of us to the main gate in the blink of an eye.</p>

      <p>I don’t <em>think</em> he was human in species, but he looked like one in appearance…and as I thought it over, he revealed that he was part of the demonoid race. They were long-lived and well-versed in magic, but still human at the root, apparently. They were born via a mutation that put them into the ranks of magic-born, and he said only a very few of them existed.</p>

      <p><em>Hmm. I wonder if people like Mjurran or Razen would be among them?</em></p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>They could certainly be defined in the same manner, yes.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">I thought so. But then, magic-born came in all shapes and sizes, so trying to strictly classify them almost wasn’t worth it. Personally, <a id="page-111"></a>I didn’t see the issue with calling any human who got magic-bornified a demonoid.</p>

      <p>Regardless, my eyes were now turned toward the city beyond the main gate. It was more wondrous than I expected—these beautiful buildings, shining like gold as they lined the streets.</p>

      <p>They did an excellent job building them, and everything about the city was engineered to very precise standards. In simple terms, the whole metropolis was shaped like a six-pointed star, which by itself created a magical effect over the whole of it—and the wonders continued from there. The streets were built in spirals, gradually going uphill from their entrances, and they connected to a chalk-colored castle that loomed threateningly in the middle, its spiral towers dwarfing everything else. The castle itself wasn’t that big, but since the whole town was built more outward than upward, it looked comparatively gigantic.</p>

      <p>If you were to view it from above, you could tell that the entire city formed a large, powerful, layered magic circle. To those without this kind of overhead perspective, that magic circle would never be noticed—and even with it, you had to pay attention. That’s how ingenious, and how exquisite, this design was. I’ve been following a lot of my own passions when developing my city, but I didn’t think to incorporate a magic circle into the design.</p>

      <p>What a great idea! For the first time in a while, I felt so frustrated about not coming up with it first. As an ex-member of the construction industry, seeing such a minutely designed city did a lot to prod my sense of pride. I know I had a wonderful city going back home, but I wasn’t in a position to place functionality first with everything like this. Ramiris’s labyrinth solved all my defense problems, but that was the result of several strokes of good luck at once. But here’s a design that harnesses the citizens’ magic power to keep their defense running—and they actually made it work.</p>

      <p>“So this entire city produces the same effect as a large, powerful magic circle, huh? Amazing, is all I can say.”</p>

      <p>I kind of felt like I’d been outfoxed, so I had to be honest in my praise.</p>

      <p>“Oh, you could tell?” Arlos said with a smile.</p>

      <p><a id="page-112"></a>“Does it have the effect of Search Enemy and Counterattack, maybe? It’s so much huger in scope than regular magic, I’m sure it does an incredible job.”</p>

      <p>Having a single magic circle evoke two different effects required a very careful arrangement by itself. Here, they made it work with something the size of a city, “drawing” the needed incantations with buildings to cast tactical-level magic that ran day and night. I couldn’t even fathom how amazing it was. Anyone who snuck in without permission would be spotted at once, and any magic attack from the outside would bounce right off the barrier. Even a legion magic crafted for attacking cities would fizzle out, I bet.</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! Well spotted. You could tell that much at a single glance? There’s no point hiding it from you, of course, so I’ll say that yes, you’re correct. This city generates its own foolproof magical defense.”</p>

      <p>Arlos sounded proud of it, too, going on and on saying stuff like, “Having this barrier in place protects us from even the most insidious of demons, the kind that’d fire nuclear magic at us”—but I didn’t ask him any in-depth questions, because I figured it’d make me look bad. His brag reminded me of a certain blond, high school teen–like demon I knew, but I’m sure that was just a coincidence. So, putting my theoretical weapons together, I attempted to butter Arlos up.</p>

      <p>“I’m sure it took so much time and money to obtain even one of those effects, right? But you’ve perfectly nailed two of them, all while calculating how to further develop this city and its features.”</p>

      <p>“Precisely. It was a terribly difficult ordeal, but we succeeded, thanks to our trust in Sir Leon.”</p>

      <p>“Well, count me impressed. Tackling something like that’d be a godsend if it actually worked, but you really <em>did</em> it, you know?”</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! Thank you very much. I didn’t expect you to be so complimentary. It was Sir Leon who first conceived this city, so I’m sure he would love to hear that.”</p>

      <p>Oh, no way. Leon designed all this?! He really <em>is</em> a genius, huh? Here I thought he was this silent, creepy demon lord with a weird obsession for Chloe, but maybe I needed to see him in a new light. <a id="page-113"></a>This cityscape really <em>was</em> beautiful, a reality I had to accept—the excitement was winning over the frustration in my mind. Soei was observing the city as well, looking just as impressed…and I don’t think he’s that gifted in magic, but he was eagerly pricking up his ears, greedily searching for anything potentially useful.</p>

      <p>“It’d be hard to invade from the air as well, I suppose. The only way in would be from underground…”</p>

      <p>Oops. I was wrong. He was thinking of ways to attack this city, huh? Which, yeah, I guess that’s important. We’re friends for now, but we might wind up being enemies sometime later.</p>

      <p>Either way, this fusion of magic and urban planning was absolutely astounding. I’d love to implement parts of this in my own nation, but this wasn’t anything I could readily copy. Our capital city of Rimuru was in pretty much a “complete” state, so to speak, and I wasn’t gonna bulldoze it and start over.</p>

      <p>Something to think about for the future, then. If I have the chance to build more cities, maybe that’s when we can try that idea out. Now I’ve got something fun to look forward to when I return home. Maybe it’d be a huge boondoggle, but I’d love to try designing my own magical city sometime.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Walking past the main gate’s entryway, we proceeded up a spiraling glass hallway. The city was just as pretty on the inside. A waterfall was robustly flowing off a man-made cliff in the distance, running down the canals spread across the cityscape and providing the most charming views from any angle.</p>

      <p>We pressed on for about ten minutes, me taking in the views as I walked, and then we reached a knight-guarded area where normal citizens were forbidden.</p>

      <p>“Beyond this door is a magic circle connected to the front of the palace.”</p>

      <p>Arlos guided us in, and after we leaped through the circle, we found none other than the demon lord Leon Cromwell, leader of El Dorado, on the other side. He was dressed a lot more casually than <a id="page-114"></a>I expected—jeans and a white shirt—but it looked fine on him. He’s the kind of heartthrob who’d look good in anything, I guess. Arms crossed as he leaned against a column, he almost looked like a living piece of art.</p>

      <p>But once he opened his mouth, the effect was shattered.</p>

      <p>“Feh. No Chloe, huh?”</p>

      <p>His mind really was stuffed with nothing but visions of her, huh? It annoyed me a little. Guess he really <em>is</em> a silent, creepy demon lord, what with that unhealthy fixation on Chloe. That was the “true” him, I was convinced, and there was no point trying to shake him of that.</p>

      <p>Besides, something seemed off with Leon. I thought Arlos was a pretty boy, but his good looks paled compared to Leon’s. He was just as vexingly handsome as always, but he seemed pretty downtrodden at the moment.</p>

      <p>“Of course not. But what’s up with you? You look pretty worn out.”</p>

      <p>“…Don’t even start with me. <em>You’re</em> the one who sent over the cause of it.”</p>

      <p>Ah!</p>

      <p>That was all I needed to know, yeah. He must be annoying him to no end.</p>

      <p>“Did Diablo do…something?”</p>

      <p>“…Kind of.”</p>

      <p>For just a moment there, we were staring at each other like a Wild West standoff. Leon seemed ready to say something else, but bottled up the words and just nodded at me. It felt so heavy—the oppressive weight of the air around us.</p>

      <p>He guided us into his castle, still silent. We were taken to a glorious, well-decorated chamber, all done up in gold, silver, and jewels—but the furnishings were still tasteful, not gaudy at all. The wallpaper was all the same shade of white, providing a canvas for all the jewels to reflect the chandelier’s light on.</p>

      <p>Nothing was tacky about it, just like Clayman’s stronghold; his sense for good taste was clear as sunlight. Call it luxury without being overpowering. The chalky-white exterior didn’t look flashy or anything, and the insides, too, were beautiful, elegant, and refined. Even a common-born man like me could relax in here without <a id="page-116"></a>feeling all nervous. The air between Leon and me was heavy, but this decor was already calming my nerves.</p>
