      <p>Or so I thought, but the hallway outside was getting awfully noisy. I might’ve been relaxed, but I could still feel a headache coming on. And my guesses were right.</p>

      <p>“Ah, Sir Rimuru! I’ve been waiting for you.”</p>

      <p>It was Diablo. He reverently greeted me, then took me to a reception room like it was his right to. Aren’t we in Leon’s domain? Why is he acting like he owns the place? I had a lot of questions.</p>

      <p>Guy came along soon after Diablo. “Way to keep me in suspense, Rimuru,” he said as he sat across from me. “Why the hell did you save <em>here</em> for last?”</p>

      <p>“Well, because <em>you</em> were here, Guy. Having someone as strong as <em>you</em> around, y’know, maybe I didn’t need to show up at all!”</p>

      <p>Those were my true feelings, disguised as a joke. But it made Guy’s temples throb. Uh-oh. I know when I’ve crossed a line, so I changed the subject before his head exploded.</p>

      <p>“Hey, calm down! You and Diablo are here, after all, so I knew you could handle any enemies that showed up. Luminus’s domain I wasn’t so sure about, and I don’t really know how strong Daggrull is in the first place. It’s only natural I went to them first.”</p>

      <p>“Well, <em>Milim</em> is as about as strong as me, you know…”</p>

      <p>True. Milim was a powerhouse. I understood what Guy wanted to say, but I had a reason for what I did.</p>

      <p>“Yes, and Milim’s already been assigned the construction work in her domain. ‘Trust comes first’—that’s my motto, and that’s why her work needs to take priority.”</p>

      <p>I sneered at him. Milim was a valued friend of mine, despite it all, someone who’d helped me out a lot. It’s on me to repay that favor, and in terms of who I care about more, her or Guy… Well, it’s not even close. She can be a real pain to me sometimes, but I’m sure the opposite’s true, too.</p>

      <p>“Pfft. Fine. How were the other demon lords looking?”</p>

      <p>One thing I like about Guy is that he’s able to take his losses and move on really fast. Despite his annoyance at being put off until the end, he still knew what the right call was, which relieved me.</p>

      <p><a id="page-117"></a>“Well, we’ve built transport magic circles in each of the domains now. They still need to be fine-tuned, but even now, we can activate them all in case of emergency.”</p>

      <p>I opened up my Stomach a little to reveal one of the magisteel saucers I had put in place. They were so big, I didn’t want to whip out the whole thing in there.</p>

      <p>“Just give me the coordinates you want, and I’ll install one over here, too.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm. All right. I’ll guide you to the spot later.”</p>

      <p>Now Leon was sticking his head into the conversation. Which, okay, he owns this castle and all, so he has the right to. He puts up such a big attitude, and I can’t help but be fooled sometimes.</p>

      <p>“I’m glad that we have an emergency system in place when we need it. So all that remains is to wait for the enemy to attack us?”</p>

      <p>“More or less. I’m planning to handle some more postwar cleanup in the Eastern Empire in the meantime. That, and strengthen our ties with the Western Nations.”</p>

      <p>“Even though we can hardly expect any human army to play a factor in this war?”</p>

      <p>“Sure. Like disaster drills, for example. I wanna do my best to help them evacuate, so we don’t go wiping out civilizations with this war.”</p>

      <p>I was pretty certain the residents of Rimuru, capital of Tempest, would survive just fine. Any other nation, though… Well, it was hard to estimate what the damage would be. So I was in the middle of setting up a network of shelters to evacuate to, via our REG enterprise. Mjöllmile was putting a lot of effort into that. I felt like I was piling too much work on his desk, so once things chilled out a bit, I planned to give him a nice little reward.</p>

      <p>By the way, I was once fairly sure that Michael required the citizens of the empire, and their faith in him, in order for his skills to work. Better to assume that wasn’t an absolute must, though. I kind of suggested to him that I wouldn’t be afraid to kill off all his citizens, so I’m sure Michael is taking measures against that…something you could say I induced him to do. But either way, we can’t be sure until battle begins.</p>

      <p>“Hmm… Sounds like you’re a busy demon lord, too.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-118"></a>Guy looked exasperated with me. But I <em>was</em> busy. I’d gone through a lot of trouble to establish links with human society, and keeping those links safe was top priority for our nation. Having Michael’s force break them down would be like stomping all over that work, and I wasn’t about to put up with that.</p>

      <p>Leon seemed just as astonished.</p>

      <p>“So focused not just on your own nation, but others as well… You’re even more of a pushover than I thought. Do you think you can grow an infinite number of arms to handle all this work?”</p>

      <p>Mm, he has a point. I don’t think I’m omnipotent or anything…but I’m also sick of losing stuff because I fail to act.</p>

      <p>“I just don’t wanna have any regrets later, y’know? I wanna do everything that I can, and if it doesn’t work out, at least I’ll know when to give up.”</p>

      <p>Of course, if it came to that, I probably wouldn’t give up anyway. And I’d have tons of regrets, too. But I was striving so hard because I wanted to avoid that. Until a grim future was truly unavoidable, I wanted to puff my chest out and live as proudly as possible. There’s no way I could fool myself into doing anything else.</p>

      <p>“Heh. Well, <em>I’m</em> full of nothing but regret. Perhaps that’s why that girl chose you over me.”</p>

      <p>Chloe again? Something about the tone of Leon’s voice indicated I shouldn’t be ignoring this. I know he’s done some pretty crazy things in his past—maybe this is his warning to be careful, lest I turn out like him. For now, though, I decided to laugh off his concern.</p>

      <p>“Well, unlike you, I’m not into little girls—er, sorry, cute little-sister types. I’m a normal person who knows when he’s being a bother to others, so no worries about any of that.”</p>

      <p>“Do you want to die?”</p>

      <p>Out of nowhere, the situation got explosive. Our debate continued until an exasperated Guy finally stepped in.</p>

      <p class="tx1">“You know, I thought you coming over would improve things a little. <em>Boy</em>, was I wrong.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-119"></a>Guy seemed oddly tired as he griped at me. I don’t know what he was expecting, really.</p>

      <p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh… Perhaps now would be a good time to settle the score for good? And luckily, Mizeri has gotten used to building Damage-Reducing Barriers as of late…”</p>

      <p>Is Diablo asking me to duke it out with Leon?</p>

      <p>“Look, we’re both demon lords, okay? We can’t be that reckless,” I said.</p>

      <p>“No need to worry, Sir Rimuru. I would gladly take him on. You wouldn’t need to lift a finger.”</p>

      <p>Diablo narrowed his eyes at Leon, like a predator stalking its prey. He might’ve actually been serious about this. I really couldn’t guess who would win, and I’d be lying if I claimed not to be interested. But, in many ways, giving my okay would be out of the question.</p>

      <p>“I’m saying that the damage would be enormous! I told you that your job was to <em>protect</em> Leon, didn’t I? And you want to fight him instead? Why are we even <em>here</em>, then, huh?”</p>

      <p>Diablo slumped down, looking disappointed as I lectured him. He didn’t appear too regretful, but he seemed willing to drop this subject. I’ll take it.</p>

      <p>“Chew him out some more for me, Rimuru. He just never learns his lesson! He was trying to antagonize me just yesterday, the bastard. I went easy on him, but we <em>still</em> destroyed a training arena.”</p>

      <p>Don’t whine at <em>me</em> about that. I can’t really say who’s at fault unless I know what caused this argument. And besides…</p>

      <p>“Wait. You and Diablo fought each other?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. I’ve been bored lately, so we had a little exercise.”</p>

      <p>Ridiculous. So Diablo fought Guy, and the way Diablo put it, it was painful beyond description. Good thing this happened yesterday, at least, not today.</p>

      <p>I looked over at Leon. He sighed, looking beyond displeased.</p>

      <p>“It began when that maid over there tried picking a fight with Diablo, I think. She got annihilated by him, but she made all these excuses and fled the scene…”</p>

      <p>His eyes were pointed at Raine.</p>

      <p><a id="page-120"></a>“Surely you’re joking. I didn’t make a single excuse, and for that matter, I <em>didn’t lose</em>!”</p>

      <p>So she’s not denying the “picking a fight with him” part. Great.</p>

      <p>“There is no value to your subjective opinions.”</p>

      <p>Leon had no interest in Raine’s shameless defense. Then Diablo picked up the baton.</p>

      <p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh… I don’t like bullying the weak, so I allowed her to flee from me.”</p>

      <p>“Huh? I said I’d take you on for <em>real</em> next time, didn’t I? I was going easy on you. Did you get the wrong idea about that?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, I’m sorry, did you forget how you roped Mizeri in and made it a two-on-one bout? You truly <em>do</em> need to be taught some discipline next time, don’t you?”</p>

      <p>Diablo remained calm, treating Raine like a child as they trolled each other. I was worried it’d lead to blows soon, but strangely, it didn’t.</p>

      <p>“Well, in an even <em>more</em> annoying development, these two freaks forged an armistice at some point.”</p>

      <p>I couldn’t believe what Guy just said. As he put it, these verbal arguments occurred on a daily basis, and he preferred them to actual bouts without question.</p>

      <p>“After all, they’ve been fighting every day for the past two weeks, you see? But somewhere along the line, I guess they started to hit it off.”</p>

      <p>If Leon was backing Guy up, it had to be true. And if so, I could see that the balance of power around here was teetering in a direction I didn’t want it to go.</p>

      <p>“I would <em>not</em> say that at all,” a quizzical Raine said. “What kind of evidence do you have for this nonsense?”</p>

      <p>“What, you thought no one would find out?” Leon asked, as composed as ever. “During yesterday’s battle, you were shouting, ‘Don’t give me that wimpy junk, Diablo! Put more of your heart into it!’”</p>

      <p>“Raine,” Guy’s heavy voice chimed in, “we know how you really feel. And why are you cheering on Diablo instead of me, huh…?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, not at all! I would never use such vulgar language in the first place, Sir Guy, and I am now and forever your faithful servant. I’m sure Sir Leon is making a mistake.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-121"></a>She certainly was bold about this. As serious as she usually acted, I never picked up on it, but did she have a bad case of “youngest child syndrome” or what? The type of woman who never reflects on her own actions and assumes things should always go her way. Kids who get doted on by their older siblings can turn out that way pretty often.</p>

      <p>But after hearing all this, it was blatantly clear who was in the right.</p>

      <p>“Diablo, why are you all chummy with her now?”</p>

      <p>Might as well throw that question his way. I figured he probably wouldn’t lie to me.</p>

      <p>He smiled back at me. “It is all thanks to your own glory, Sir Rimuru. I was regaling Raine with stories of your great wisdom and depth of thinking, and before we knew it, she had fully converted to my side!”</p>

      <p><em>Whoa! Scary! So we’re talkin’ about brainwashing, then?</em> I wanted to ask, but stopped myself.</p>

      <p>“Sh-she did?”</p>

      <p>“I <em>am</em> a fan of yours, Sir Rimuru. So, in exchange for Diablo telling me more stories about you, I agreed to offer him a little help.” Raine accentuated this with a curtsy.</p>

      <p>Wow. That self-serving, huh? Just like Diablo. No wonder they got along.</p>

      <p>“Uh, yeah…”</p>

      <p>What else could I say? I turned toward Guy, unsure how to proceed. He shook his head back, his way of saying “it’s too late.”</p>

      <p>“Sorry my employees are all so dimwitted.”</p>

      <p>“No, no, Diablo’s clearly just as much of a pain. They’re both at fault here.”</p>

      <p>Guy must have it just as rough. Now I felt even more of an affinity for him than before. But then Mizeri, who usually stood there blankly, spoke up.</p>

      <p>“…What? Wait, are you treating <em>me</em> as a dimwit as well for everything Raine constantly does…?”</p>

      <p>Hmm. Sounds like the truth has dawned on her. I won’t say it out loud, but I think that’s correct, yeah. But an outsider like me <a id="page-122"></a>butting in wouldn’t achieve much of anything, so I pretended not to hear her pleading.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">So, after some more chitchat, we were led to a hidden enclave behind the palace’s throne room and audience chamber. There, I installed our transport magic circle. It weighed several dozen tons, so once it was in place, moving it again would take a lot of work.</p>

      <p>Speaking of work, mine was done here, and I took my leave soon after. I could tell Leon desperately wanted me to take Diablo and Raine away, but that would surely damage our war footing. Even if it didn’t, no way was I gonna take ’em back. Leon would just have to be patient.</p>

      <p>Then, right as I departed:</p>

      <p>“And <em>please</em>…take <em>care</em> of Chloe for me.”</p>

      <p>Leon emphasized his words.</p>

      <p>“Sure thing.” I nodded back.</p>

      <p>He didn’t need to say it, but my affirmation must’ve been convincing enough, because he let me go pretty readily. I expected him to be pushier about all that, so it was kind of unexpected, not that I’d tell him.</p>

      <p>In normal circumstances, he’s really a pretty cool guy. That, and he revealed a very surprising truth to me. Leon and I actually share the same hobby. No, not his thing for underage girls—it turns out Leon’s dream was to be an architect. No wonder he had so much aesthetic sense, huh? He let me in on that factoid as I praised his city and palace in our conversation, and I could certainly believe it. He’s got a great head for it, and I told him as much.</p>

      <p>He’s a smug bastard, yes, but deep down, he’s really a nice guy. That was my new estimation of the demon lord Leon. So, after forging a much improved relationship, I completed my successful journey to El Dorado.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">Even after returning from Leon’s domain, I kept making foreign visits. I had no idea when the enemy might attack, so I was on a mission to strengthen our links with other nations as much as <a id="page-123"></a>possible. I had that emergency transport network in place with the other demon lords, and obviously I wanted to install some of those circles in our allied nations as well.</p>

      <p>The first stop was the Dwarven Kingdom. Carrera’s demon servant Agera was currently deployed over there, and I was told he was busy training with Gazel, their king. Seeing how that turned out could be useful as well.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">So I transported myself to the massive gate protecting Dwargon. A long line snaked out from it, as usual, packed with merchants and adventurers. I gave it a sideways glance as I headed for the nobility-only corridor and spoke to the guard.</p>

      <p>Without any further wait, I was guided to the royal palace. I felt like such a huge, powerful figure, getting this kind of treatment, which perhaps shows how unnoble I still am. I knew I was in way over my head when it came to this stuff, so I was careful not to openly sneer at anyone in public, at least.</p>

      <p>Gazel was there to greet me.</p>

      <p>“I’ve been expecting you, Rimuru.”</p>

      <p>And Agera was with him, of course, offering an exaggerated bow.</p>

      <p>“It pleases me immensely to see you in good health, my lord.”</p>

      <p>It was like he just walked out of a historical samurai drama—and he pulled it off, too. And also, much to my surprise, it turns out Agera was the reincarnation of Hakuro’s grandfather. I was pretty shocked when Carrera told me, but—taking an impartial look at him—all his mannerisms were exactly the same. I had wanted to speak with him, as I recalled, but never quite found the opportunity. Maybe we could find some time afterward to sit and chat.</p>

      <p>I thought over all of this as I returned his greeting. “Great to see you again, King Gazel. Glad you’re well. And you too, Agera.”</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! You’re still far too formal with me, you know. Like I always tell you, just ‘Gazel’ is perfectly fine!”</p>

      <p>“Yeahhh, I meant to do that, but seeing you in your palace like this gets me nervous. Kinda reminds me of the trial I had here. I know it’s petty…”</p>

      <p>I couldn’t shake that non-nobility thinking fully, but I think it’s <a id="page-124"></a>endearing, sort of. I dunno… It’d be weird if I <em>didn’t</em> get all nervous around authority figures.</p>

      <p>Vaughn and Dolph watched us, not all that interested. Soei was the same way. It was Agera who finally butted in.</p>

      <p>“In my humble opinion, my lord, I would wish for you to act just as you please, although Lady Carrera would no doubt upbraid me for it. You are both the leaders of allied nations. Simply be your normal, dignified selves! No need to artificially distance yourself from King Gazel.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I know that, but…”</p>

      <p>Of course I understood what he meant, but I was a humble salaryman until a few years ago. Unless I’m angry, or focused, or involved in something so huge that I can’t think about anything else, I can’t help but revert back to my normal self.</p>

      <p>“It’s fine, Rimuru! I understand how you feel, besides. I, for one, find myself fretting under the gaze of the Heavenly Emperor Elmesia when I see her.”</p>

      <p>“Wow, even <em>you</em> have someone like that, King Gazel?”</p>

      <p>“<em>However!</em> You speak completely casually with the Heavenly Emperor, do you not? Someone I have <em>untold</em> trouble with! And I just don’t understand how you do it!”</p>

      <p>Fair point. And I really had no way to counter that. Gazel wants me to be just as casual with him, and I promised that I’d try my best at it. It’s just, you know, I can’t help but respect people I think I can truly rely on. It’s something embedded deep in my personality, so it’s not the easiest thing to fix.</p>

      <p>“But I <em>can</em> act the way I’m supposed to sometimes, depending on the time and situation. It’s not <em>that</em> big of a problem, is it?”</p>

      <p>“It is, you fool. It is precisely those sorts of situations where your natural habits come out on you. You need to evaluate how you speak and act on a regular basis, so you won’t trip up in the most important of times.”</p>

      <p>Another good lesson from him. He did tend to lecture me a lot, which only encouraged a return to my normal attitude even more. Sometimes Elmesia says the same things to me, but <em>she</em> can turn <a id="page-125"></a>it on and off like a switch. Maybe she adjusts her own approach so Mollie and I can talk with her more easily…or maybe I’m just overthinking it. Anyway, Gazel’s advice was something to address in the future. I wanted to make sure I didn’t forget it.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Now we were in a less stuffy reception room, drinks in hand, as we discussed recent events. This was my main objective here—comparing notes and seeing where we stood.</p>

      <p>“Could this great war be avoided, do you think?” Gazel asked me.</p>

      <p>“I am reluctant to say it, but it seems doubtful to me. The other demon lords and I are working on a transport network of magic circles, in order to ease travel between our domains in an emergency.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm… It’s just one crisis after the other, isn’t it? To be honest with you, I thought all was lost when Lady Velgrynd was captured. Now that she’s back on our side, I don’t think this… Michael, was it? I don’t see him as anyone to be <em>that</em> perturbed about.”</p>

      <p>Well, not to toot my own horn, but Tempest’s forces now outclassed the Empire’s at its peak. We also had the other demon lords, along with Velgrynd and Veldora, so I suppose Gazel couldn’t see any possible way we’d lose. But that was wishful thinking.</p>

      <p>“No, I mean, that’s how strong this foe is. In terms of its power alone, not even the Empire compares to its size.”</p>

      <p>“I understand that. I’m not underestimating this foe at all. The opposite, actually.”</p>

      <p>“The opposite?”</p>

      <p>“Indeed. I’m half-resigned to our fate by now. All the struggling in the world won’t help <em>us</em> at all, this time.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, right…”</p>

      <p>I suppose he was right. If Velzard targeted Dwargon, not even a nation this powerful could win. That one individual was just too strong—I could see why he was so ready to throw in the towel.</p>

      <p>“Of course, we won’t go down that easily. I’m ready to retaliate, in the worst case.”</p>

      <p>He sounded ready for it, all but howling for blood. His resolve for that, at least, was the real thing. The way that he refused to flee in <a id="page-126"></a>the face of Velgrynd shows he was willing to fight a hopeless battle if need be. I was glad to see that.</p>

      <p>“Well,” I said, “if you know you can’t win, there are still necessary measures to take, aren’t there?”</p>

      <p>The quality of our foes, not the quantity, was scary. And Velzard being among them was the worst thing of all. It basically rendered Veldora worthless; when it came to people who could decently take on Velzard, Guy and Velgrynd were about it. Me? I’d run. I wanted to avoid that fight at all costs.</p>

      <p>“Well, if we’re talking two True Dragons locked in battle, that’s a natural disaster right there. An honest-to-goodness battle between gods.”</p>

      <p>“It’ll sure feel that way, yeah. But we can’t escape it, either.”</p>

      <p>“Have you figured out a way to win?”</p>

      <p>“Nope! But I’m taking every measure I can to improve our chances.”</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh-heh… Oh, look at you.”</p>

      <p>Gazel nodded as he chuckled. To be frank, I really had no idea until we tried, but if it looked hopeless, we needed to secure a means of escape. I was trying to act all cool, but without a full analysis of the enemy’s force, there was no point debating over whether we could win or not. All we <em>could</em> do was figure out what to do if our prospects started to dim.</p>

      <p>“So I want your help.”</p>

      <p>“Very well. Just say the word. I’ll lend you what help I can.”</p>

      <p>Gazel readily agreed to my request. At once, I asked him to install a transport magic circle in his kingdom. There was already one for personal use here in Dwargon, but cargo transport was another urgent need.</p>

      <p>“I’m impressed you refined so much magisteel to such a level of purity.”</p>

      <p>“I cheated a little with my skills,” I admitted. “Normally, I’d want to wait until we had the right engineers trained for the job, but the enemy won’t wait that long.”</p>

      <p>“…I assumed as much. We’ll handle the details for you.”</p>

      <p>“Thank you,” I said with a nod—and with that, I had the magic circle installed in Gazel’s designated spot at once.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><a id="page-127"></a>With my main goal complete, we settled down to chitchat.</p>

      <p>“So how’s the training going?”</p>

      <p>“Well, I have to hand it to Agera—grandfather to Master Hakuro the Sword Ogre, and founder of the Crestwater style. I certainly have a long way to go with my own sword, as I learned rather quickly!”</p>

      <p>“There is no need for such modesty, King Gazel,” Agera said. “You have already earned the hidden art Five-Bloom Stab, and you are aiming for even loftier heights, are you not?”</p>

      <p>In the Crestwater style, anything on the level of Five-Bloom Stab or higher was called a hidden art. These included Pomegranate – Six-Bloom Slash, a high-speed blunt slash not meant to kill, and Willow – Seven-Bloom Sweep, a sword move that softly parried the enemy’s attack. There were others—slashes, stabs—and the most hidden art of all was the Multilayered Blossom Flash. It was meant to stay within the Crestwater family, but apparently Agera was intent on teaching it to Gazel.</p>

      <p>“Hakuro told me that his grandfather showed him the Multilayered Blossom Flash once.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I did. This was before my reincarnation, so my memory is hazy, but I vaguely recall demonstrating it to him once. If he could recreate it and show it to me, I said, he would truly be a genius. And not to boast of my own grandson, but I am no longer the Byakuya Araki that I was at the time. I offer nothing but praise to the leaders of the monster nation.”</p>

      <p>Agera looked a tad ashamed, but also fiercely proud.</p>

      <p>“Oh, certainly. Hakuro’s my own master as well. I don’t mind you praising him at all. In fact, I’m glad for it.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, indeed. Your teachings, Sir Agera, have been firmly passed on through Sir Hakuro. Destiny can be quite a mysterious thing sometimes, can it not?”</p>

      <p>Gazel agreed with me, warmly smiling. Agera, seeing this, nodded back, filled with emotion.</p>

      <p>“So, Rimuru, do you mind if I pick your brain about something?”</p>

      <p>“If I know the answer, sure.”</p>

      <p>“Good. I know I asked about this before, but I have a question <a id="page-128"></a>about ultimate skills. Do you think, if I continued to polish my sword skills, I could ever defeat someone bearing such a skill?”</p>

      <p>Huh. Way to cut right to the point. The answer was yes, it’s possible, but only in the right circumstances. It’d be a real tough shot, but there was a nonzero chance.</p>

      <p>“According to what I’ve been taught, an ultimate skill can be counteracted only by another ultimate skill. It’s best to assume that a unique skill won’t cut it.”</p>

      <p>“I see…”</p>

      <p>“But if the conditions work out just right, I think you <em>might</em> be able to work it out.”</p>

      <p>“Oh? And those conditions are?”</p>

      <p>“For example, there was Yuuki Kagurazaka’s Anti-Skill—a super-unique one that suppressed my skills. <em>Very</em> dangerous. That, and I’ve seen Diablo dominate ultimate skill users via his magic alone.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm…”</p>

      <p>“I think one thing that matters a lot is your willpower. A spiritual life-form lives off nothing but its own willpower, and it looks like they can hold their own against ultimates even if they don’t have one. It’s a theory, but it’s pretty likely to be correct.”</p>

      <p>I remained noncommittal, but Ciel was of the same opinion, so I was fairly certain of it. Which meant the key to it all was…</p>

      <p>“So I’d need to raise the power of my will until it’s at the level of a spiritual life-form’s? Something beyond the path of the sword…?”</p>

      <p>“Well, I think there’s a much quicker way.”</p>

      <p>“What?!”</p>

      <p>“It looks like if a God-class weapon accepts you as its master, that makes you something on the level of a spiritual life-form.”</p>

      <p>That was the answer. There was also the cheat method of granting someone else the right skills, but absolute power corrupts absolutely, and all that. Or was it greed? Maybe I’m drifting away from the original saying, but I think I’m getting the point across. You can’t fully access powers that are far beyond your capability. That’s why I didn’t grant all my skills to everyone in my force. I certainly won’t do that for Gazel, either; he’d need to earn them himself. Of course, I can’t grant skills to anyone whose soul I’m not connected <a id="page-129"></a>to in the first place. I helped Raine and Mizeri awaken, yes, but that’s a different story.</p>

      <p>For <em>this</em> situation, obtaining a God-class weapon was the optimal solution, I think. But you didn’t get to be a God-class weapon by being easy to obtain. I had Hinata’s Holy Spirit Armor analyzed well enough that I was working to mass-produce it, but no matter how hard we tried, the results would <em>maybe</em> be Legend-class at best. Wearing it would grant you powers on the level of a Saint, but that wouldn’t be enough to fend off an ultimate skill.</p>

      <p>“…God-class, eh?”</p>

      <p>Gazel looked at his sword. It was a famed one, well used. Probably Legend-class, and on the high end of that, too. But there were untold numbers of nicks and scratches on its blade.</p>

      <p>“You see before you the results of me clashing blades with Kondo. It was a tremendous fortune that it didn’t simply break…but this sword’s usable life has come to an end.”</p>

      <p>True enough. This must’ve been a Dwargon treasure, passed down across generations of rulers. In this sorry state, it’d be little more than a museum piece.</p>

      <p>Or maybe…</p>

      <p>“Hey, how about I ask Kurobe for his help? He might be able to revive this sword for you.”</p>

      <p>“What? Are you serious?!”</p>

      <p>“I can’t make any guarantees, but Kurobe <em>did</em> give Gabil’s spear a new lease on life.”</p>

      <p>Repairing it with the crimson steel I provided allowed Kurobe to craft Gabil’s Vortex Spear, a reborn weapon just a step away from God-class. If he kept using it in battle, we believed it’d evolve to the God level in time. And I <em>did</em> have some spare crimson steel left…</p>

      <p>“I don’t think that sword’s fully dead yet, either. You never know—”</p>

      <p>“Please. I won’t fault him if he fails. <em>Please</em> ask Sir Kurobe for me!”</p>

      <p>I’d be doing him a <em>huge</em> favor, but as his fellow training partner, I wouldn’t be stingy. As much help as he provided me, I owed him one anyway. So I took the blade from Gazel’s hands.</p>

      <p><a id="page-130"></a>“Aside from this sword,” I asked, “do you know where else you might be able to obtain a God-class weapon?”</p>

      <p>“Do you think I do? Maybe you’re too lacking in common sense to know it, but even a Legend-class weapon is a national treasure. Even for <em>major</em> nations, too. Maybe the Empire’s one thing, but you won’t find those bumping around just anywhere.”</p>

      <p>He didn’t have to be <em>that</em> sarcastic with me. I assumed the same thing.</p>

      <p>“Yes, my own investigations have led me to the same result. I pored through every possible route in the Western Nations underworld, but I discovered no more than a few Legend-class examples.”</p>

      <p>Soei’s experience was backing up Gazel’s sass. I guess Kurobe’s our final hope, then. (Soei’s own twin blades, by the way, were another one of Kurobe’s overhaul projects. Not God-class, sadly, but at Soei’s skill level, that’s no big problem. They’ve both got room to grow, you could say.)</p>

      <p>“Well, no point asking for the impossible. But back to our conversation—you said that becoming a spiritual life-form would let you withstand ultimate skills?”</p>

      <p>“Again, I can’t speak in absolutes. It’ll vary depending on how long you’ve lived, of course. For example, a newborn Arch Demon wouldn’t survive at all. But with a strong enough will and the magicule energy to support it, it sure looks like you could hold out against an ultimate, yeah.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm. Your answers are too murky to comprehend too well…”</p>

      <p>Really? I don’t think so…I hope. But if he feels otherwise, let’s try simplifying it for him.</p>

      <p>“Basically, you gotta <em>want</em> to win!”</p>

      <p>I didn’t want to resort to a “gotta have the right attitude” explanation, like I was a soccer coach or something. In addition to being trite, it was probably incorrect a lot of the time. But when it came to ultimate skills, it really <em>was</em> difficult to explain it any other way. Besides, we live in a world where the slash of a sword can literally rip a hole in the atmosphere, so maybe sword skills and magic are pretty much alike after a certain point. Build up your willpower, and you could even bend the laws of the world.</p>

      <p><a id="page-131"></a>That, at least, makes things easy to understand and act upon. So let’s go with it.</p>

      <p>Gazel, hearing me out, now fell silent, a grave look on his face. I glanced at Agera; he looked just as thoughtful.</p>

      <p>“Sir Rimuru is correct,” Soei said. “As the recipient of an ultimate gift, I am not one to talk, but if you instill enough will in your blade, you could kill any opponent. That is how it feels to me, at least.”</p>

      <p>Agera nodded. “Indeed. To me, it feels as if I am sublimating all my will into my blade. My very will to kill my foe. I am driven to believe that my entire body is the blade, that there is nothing I would fail to slice through. That I could even slash through things with no corporeal form.”</p>

      <p>Oh, right, Agera’s skill was Blade Transform, wasn’t it? Comparing existence points alone, Agera’s transformed sword wouldn’t be quite God-class…but its cutting edge gave Agera the winning advantage. A God-class weapon is said to have a will of its own, but not even it could outclass the will of the right person.</p>

      <p>Then Ranga popped out from my shadow to join the conversation.</p>

      <p>“It works slightly differently with me. When I was asleep in my master’s shadow, I felt like I suddenly heard a strange, unfamiliar voice… And then Hastur, Lord of Starwind, flashed before my eyes. But I believe it took form like that because of my constant wish to help my master!”</p>

      <p>He accentuated his point with a few self-content pants. I guess he’s gotten proficient enough that he could take only half his body out of the shadow now, leaving his hindquarters hidden—but he was probably wagging his tail at full speed.</p>

      <p>So cute. I used to be a cat person, but I’m <em>really</em> leaning toward dogs lately, and I’m sure Ranga is a lot of the reason for that.</p>

      <p>Regardless, Soei, Agera, and Ranga provided a few key examples for my point.</p>

      <p>“It’s all about will, then…?”</p>

      <p>“Indeed. There is no need for impatience, either. If the enemy should strike at us while I am present, I will lend you my powers. Do not be afraid to ask for them.”</p>
