      <p><a id="page-313"></a>The moment he stopped talking, he reared back and kicked the nearly dead Yuuki into the air. With his newfound and destructive force, Footman’s single strike had the power to instantly knock Yuuki out.</p>

      <p>“Gahhh!”</p>

      <p>“Sir Yuuki—”</p>

      <p>Kagali and Teare rushed over to help him, while Laplace put himself in front of Footman.</p>

      <p>“Who are you, huh?”</p>

      <p>“Who am I, you ask? What kind of lowly garbage <em>are</em> you, if you don’t even know the sorcerous dynast when you see him?”</p>

      <p>This wasn’t Footman at all. It was the king who perished from this world long ago—the emperor Jahil.</p>

      <p>“Sorcerous… Wait, are you Jahil?”</p>

      <p>Sylvia kept a broad watch, analyzing the situation while keeping her focus on Leon. She was listening in on this, of course, and the term <em>sorcerous dynast</em> rang a bell.</p>

      <p>“Hohhh… And you must be Sylvia, then? Well, you’re right. I am the great Jahil!”</p>

      <p>The entire chamber tensed up. The blood drained from Kagali’s face as Sylvia resentfully scowled. Kagali was his daughter, of course, but Sylvia knew Jahil as well, both having been high disciples of Twilight. They both disliked each other enough to part company and never speak to each other again, though they still appreciated each other’s skills enough to be on a constant lookout.</p>

      <p>Both of them knew how evil Jahil was, and both understood that his resurrection would be the worst of all catastrophes. And that’s exactly what Feldway’s trump card was.</p>

      <p>Jahil had been found in his lands after Milim laid waste to them, a mere soul wandering around without a body. He couldn’t have escaped his ultimate fate if he stayed that way, but instead he was brought into custody and put in a long, long sleep. While Lieutenant Kondo was busy controlling the demon lord Clayman, Feldway was planting Jahil’s soul inside Footman. A clown like this, with his weak sense of self and even weaker intelligence, could easily be taken over by Jahil’s sheer power.</p>

      <p><a id="page-314"></a>Such were Feldway’s thoughts, and he was right. Jahil had gradually eroded his way through Footman’s soul. At first, he could do little more than pass information on to Feldway, but now that Footman’s body had a seraphim implanted in it, the balance of power was reversed and Jahil seized full control.</p>

      <p>After that, all that remained was to awaken at Feldway’s signal. He was hoping to save that moment when it’d be the most effective, and the way he saw it, that time was now.</p>

      <p>“Jahil, it’s time to use the powers I’ve given you to their fullest…and kill all of them.”</p>

      <p>These tools laid before Feldway were useless, and so they needed to be destroyed.</p>

      <p>Jahil, together with his granted seraphim, had been lent Raguel, Lord of Relief, the skill Michael recovered from Velgrynd. He had secretly made it his own, making it into the ultimate enchantment Agni, Lord of Blazes.</p>

      <p>“Har-har-har-har! I’ve waited ages for this day. At long last, I will be able to use my powers to the fullest!”</p>

      <p>Jahil let out an evil laugh.</p>

      <p>All of a sudden, Footman’s enormous body was engulfed in flames, turning him into a flame overlord that destroyed everything it touched. Jahil could manipulate these flames at will, and now his vast powers were unleashed.</p>

      <p>Footman’s Angry Jester mask shattered, melting on the ground. The face behind it was horrifying, distorted, perhaps reflecting the nature of the person inside.</p>

      <p>“Footman’s mine! Give him back!”</p>

      <p>Kagali was screaming. But her pained wailing only gladdened Jahil.</p>

      <p>“Har-har-har-har! You were always the softest of the soft. I wish I could beat a little sense into you, but oh, what a shame! Sir Feldway has just ordered me to kill you all. Forgive me, my idiot son!”</p>

      <p>With zero remorse at all, Jahil threw a fireball at Kagali. It may not have been as powerful as what Velgrynd could conjure, but it was still intense. Taking that heat undefended would instantly vaporize her.</p>

      <p>“Don’t ignore <em>me</em>, dammit!”</p>

      <p>Laplace attempted to fire a bolt of magic to deflect the ball of <a id="page-315"></a>flame, but it just wasn’t up to the task. It was swallowed up by the fireball, completely ineffective—and then it swelled up to engulf Kagali, then Teare, then Yuuki.</p>

      <p>But after the flames died down, a figure was standing there.</p>

      <p>“Nice try.”</p>

      <p>It was Yuuki. Despite his mortal wound, he had managed to stand up and quell the flame with Anti-Skill.</p>

      <p>“…Hoh? My flames don’t work on you? Hmm. I don’t think it’s a matter of overpowering you, no. That’s trouble. You’re trouble, I must admit.”</p>

      <p>Jahil suddenly had the curious eyes of a scientist conducting an experiment. His mouth twisted in curious glee, like he had just discovered a new toy.</p>

      <p>“You okay, Boss?” Laplace asked.</p>

      <p>“As if,” said Yuuki. “I wanna lie down in bed as soon as I can. But I don’t think this enemy’s gonna let me go, and that’s a problem.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah… So now what?”</p>

      <p>“The important thing is that—”</p>

      <p><em>The important thing is that we all survive.</em> Yuuki understood that, but he couldn’t think of any way to accomplish it. Based on his observations, Jahil had at least ten times the power of Laplace, and easily five times his own.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>To provide an omniscient narrator’s point of view, Laplace’s existence points were just over a million. That was incomparably more powerful than a demon lord seed, but it’d put him way at the bottom of awakened demon lords. It was the experience he accrued over many years, making the most of his skills, that made him such a handful in battle.</p>

      <p>Next was Yuuki, still a Saint but already high enough in the hierarchy that he could attain full divinity before long. His EP was around two million, but he possessed both the all-powerful Mammon, Lord of Greed, and the cheat-level ability-canceler Anti-Skill, giving him fighting ability numerical stats couldn’t measure.</p>

      <p><a id="page-316"></a>Teare’s EP was 2.4 million, which outclassed Yuuki’s. She had few sentient desires of her own, but one key possession of hers was the unique skill Born Optimist. It tripled all her physical abilities under certain conditions but was still largely unproven and probably worked only against foes ranked lower than her. She didn’t have the battle skill of someone like Laplace, either, making her the weakest out of the four.</p>

      <p>Finally, the member of this quartet with the highest EP was Kagali. It was just under three million, putting her decently above the others; her Ruin Scepter gave her a bonus as well, bringing it past four million. Sadly, though, Kagali’s role was support—she wasn’t particularly good at either close- or long-range battle. It wasn’t like her gifts were going to waste, but one couldn’t expect the world of her in a fight.</p>

      <p>Jahil, meanwhile, had an EP of fourteen million. This was Jahil’s power added on to the already-powerful Footman’s. Even worse, not only did he fight with magic—he also had a taste for close-range melee combat, mainly so he could torture his weaker challengers for fun. A rampage from him could easily knock out all his adversaries. For those adversaries, it was the worst possible situation to face.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>Yuuki may have been a genius, but not even he could come up with a way through this. It frustrated him.</p>

      <p>He wondered if he should’ve waited a little while before revealing he was sane and free of anyone’s control…but quickly dismissed the idea. It was a potential move to make, yes, but the moment he picked to get Kagali back was probably the best chance he’d ever get. It’s just that Feldway was one step ahead of them. He carefully prepared for everything, predicting every outcome and working out countermeasures, and that’s what he walked in here with. Having all those hidden tricks up his sleeve certainly gave him a big advantage.</p>

      <p>Yuuki had to admit it—he lost this one. He had been with Footman all this time, but never once did he think this ally of his could <a id="page-317"></a>contain such an evil presence. It wasn’t his fault for failing to spot it; really, kudos must go out to Feldway for being <em>that</em> prepared in advance.</p>

      <p><em>It’s always like this, isn’t it? This world is so unfair to me…</em></p>

      <p>He regretted it turning out like this, but still, Yuuki just found this world so absurd sometimes.</p>

      <p>For all he knew, maybe Teare had been rigged with something similar, too. It made him wary of her, but again, he reconsidered quickly. Doing something like that was really pointless—if Teare had any trap like that, there was no reason to keep it locked up at this point.</p>

      <p>Suddenly he recalled that slime, the most absurd thing of all about this place.</p>

      <p><em>Rimuru, huh? I’m sure</em> he’d <em>never give up right now, huh? I came over to this world first, but here he is, showing up later and just doing whatever the hell he wants. And it all turns out so much more amazing than every single thing I work my ass off to produce. It just drives me crazy.</em></p>

      <p>He may have thought that, but it didn’t displease him much. In fact, he could almost feel the laughter rising from his heart.</p>

      <p>“What’re you laughing about, Boss?” Laplace asked.</p>

      <p>“Oh, um, just remembering something funny. Y’know, like, I think <em>you’re</em> a real dangerous opponent to have, but I just remembered someone I’m even <em>more</em> scared of. It’d take someone like him to brush off all my traps and act like it was no great shakes, y’know?”</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha! Ya mean Rimuru, huh? Yeah, he’s <em>way</em> off the charts in pretty much every single way.”</p>

      <p>“Right? I hate having to depend on other people, but I’m not against taking advantage of him, either. And he’s gonna be riding on in to help us real soon, so there’s really only one thing to do.”</p>

      <p>Yuuki gave Laplace a wry smile.</p>

      <p>“Yeah? Yeah, you’re right.”</p>

      <p>Laplace smiled back.</p>

      <p>“We have to buy time,” Kagali said, standing up. “That was our only option from the start, though. Kind of late deciding that, aren’t you?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-318"></a>“Right!” Teare shouted. “Let’s get going on this!”</p>

      <p>Yuuki, Laplace, Kagali, and Teare lined up, facing up against Jahil in Footman’s body.</p>

      <p>“We’re gonna get him for you, Footman.”</p>

      <p>With Laplace’s spirited vow as a cue, the intense battle began.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Sylvia kept her eyes peeled, observing Yuuki and the others as she fought Leon. They were four against one, a good numerical advantage, but Jahil had the actual upper hand.</p>

      <p>Yuuki was half-dead; the hole in his chest was closed up, but that must have taken a lot out of him. It was lucky for him that Anti-Skill was an integral part of his body. It let him block Jahil’s fireball and just barely keep this battle to the death going.</p>

      <p>With Yuuki as the keystone of their defense, Laplace and Teare were taking a hit-and-run approach, with Kagali focused on support. That made it possible for them to keep it even with much more powerful opponents.</p>

      <p><em>Yuuki was his name, right? If he falls, it’s going to end fast…</em></p>

      <p>It would, and not just in the sense that they’d have no defender. Yuuki’s cheerful orders were setting the entire mood for the party. When he hears him speak, Laplace pushes himself beyond his limits. Teare, on the other hand, mostly just went with the flow, going from strong to weak depending on how things were looking. Kagali, keeping tabs on the whole party, knew the situation they were in, but…</p>

      <p><em>But even so, you need to have an effective move if you want to do anything.</em></p>

      <p>And they had nothing. Their strength was being slowly drained away, and the whole fight was over how long they could stall until their defeat. They were buying time—the only correct answer they could reach.</p>

      <p>“Ugh… He’s just impossibly strong,” Yuuki groaned. “My Anti-Skill can ignore any defensive barriers and stuff, but he’s got so much pure durability, we can’t even deal him any damage…”</p>

      <p><a id="page-319"></a>“Yeah, he’s way too far above us,” Laplace agreed. “If I had to guess, I don’t see any dang way we can damage him.”</p>

      <p>Nothing would penetrate Jahil. They knew that, and now all of them were feeling a sense of despair. But they kept it going, for just one reason: They believed that Rimuru and his team would be coming soon.</p>

      <p><em>Rimuru’s just as amazing as El said, isn’t he? He’s not even here, and he’s still providing so much hope.</em></p>

      <p>Sylvia wasn’t one for prayer, but she still earnestly hoped he arrived in time.</p>

      <p>“Why’re you looking over to the side, Master?” Leon asked her. “Isn’t that a little rude of you?”</p>

      <p>“Maybe you’re right… But when two people with the same kind of abilities fight each other, whoever gets impatient first loses!”</p>

      <p>She fluttered in the air, dodging Leon’s continual high-speed slashes. Their skills were from the same lineage, and they even fought with the same sword style. She knew exactly what he would do.</p>

      <p>The same was also true for Leon, but Michael’s mind dominance had given him orders to defeat his enemy. One side could bide their time and stretch out this battle forever; the other was tasked with winning. The difference in styles was obvious, and it was affecting the course of the battle. That, and there was another factor at play—Leon’s unconscious mind. Subconsciously, Leon was still struggling to regain his free will. That might be just a minor influence on him for now, but it was definitely slowing his body down.</p>

      <p>So the battle between them both was proceeding at a very stable pace, with Sylvia enjoying an advantage.</p>

      <p><em>But then</em>, Sylvia thought, <em>why isn’t Feldway moving at all? If he joined in, even I’d be in a little bit of trouble, you know.</em></p>

      <p>It’d also wreck the balance Yuuki’s party had going, dooming them. So why wasn’t he doing anything?</p>

      <p>Sylvia looked toward Feldway, hoping to find out. Observing him, she began to construct a theory.</p>

      <p><em>He doesn’t seem the least bit concerned. Leon and Jahil are probably sacrificial pawns to him. He just wants to record some data on us, so he can finish us off for good next time.</em></p>

      <p><a id="page-320"></a>It wasn’t a very welcome answer. Sylvia was getting fed up with him.</p>

      <p>Feldway was being almost ridiculously cautious. Normally, he must think defeating his enemies here would make the outcome far more certain. But he wasn’t aiming to do that, because he must value his own safety first. And based on that, it seemed certain that Leon and Jahil still weren’t the end of Feldway’s secret tricks.</p>

      <p>He was the type of man to act based on his observations—and this time, his observations no doubt told him the enemy could be annihilated with the forces he <em>didn’t</em> bring this time. He was avoiding any bold moves, lest the enemy have some sort of hidden card to play as well. It was caution to the point of cowardice, almost, but that was the essence of Feldway.</p>

      <p>At any rate, Feldway’s lack of activity played into their goal of stalling for time. Sylvia gained a little confidence from the thought—and then it happened.</p>

      <p>“Oh, right, I just remembered,” Jahil said. “That Anti-Skill is a trait the Dragon Princess’s pet once possessed, isn’t it? Something that could cancel out skills and magic. Quite a pain, it was, but there was an easy way to deal with it. Just drop the magic, drop the skills, and come in with pure <em>power</em>, and it won’t cancel out anything!”</p>

      <p>Jahil was evil, but he was also a first-rate researcher. As a disciple of Twilight, he had a proven track record in this, thanks to his keen observational skills. That’s how he came upon the right answer.</p>

      <p>Anti-Skill was passed on to the Chaos Dragon, the sad, final form of Milim’s pet, but it was crushed by Milim and successfully sealed away. Jahil didn’t know it, but Milim had already proven his theory for him. It was time for a change of tactics—straight-up violence.</p>

      <p>So he used his own body as a projectile, striking like mad at Yuuki.</p>

      <p>“Har-har-har-har! So pathetically weak!”</p>

      <p>He roared at Yuuki as he landed blow upon blow on him.</p>

      <p>From there on, the battle grew much more one-sided. Yuuki could just barely tap into enough martial arts to fend him off, but the difference in power was far too much to overcome. Laplace and Teare were just as roughly handled—and it wasn’t long before the three of them were on the floor.</p>

      <p><a id="page-321"></a>“Jahilllll!!”</p>

      <p>Kagali activated a spell in a fit of anger, but it was blocked by the aura surrounding Jahil’s body. Then his fist slammed into her stomach, the pure difference in power cruelly deciding the battle.</p>

      <p>“Har-har-har-har! Do you see how foolish it was to challenge me now? So, Sir Feldway, can I do away with them?”</p>

      <p>The final moment of confirmation was here. Jahil probably intended to kill them from the start, but he wanted to defer to his boss first.</p>

      <p>“Do as you like,” Feldway simply replied.</p>

      <p>Jahil let out a wicked laugh. “Kazalim, my misfortunate son—you were a good experiment for us. It is a pity, but rest assured that I’ll soon have a wonderful new toy to replace the likes of you!”</p>

      <p>He began to pool his power into his outstretched hands. A swirling eddy of fighting spirit condensed itself over them, transforming into enough energy to distort the very fabric of time. The air around it creaked, then burned. This was not magic, not a skill, but pure destructive power. It was more than enough to destroy Yuuki…and even damage Jahil himself.</p>

      <p>Sylvia, watching from the side, went pale with horror. With all this power concentrated on a single point, it’d create a destructive blast that would go beyond even nuclear magic. Anyone on the other end would wind up being obliterated without a single piece left behind.</p>

      <p>She put up a defensive barrier, sensing the danger. Leon must have reached the same conclusion, stopping his attack and stepping in to protect Feldway.</p>

      <p>Yuuki attempted to use Mammon, Lord of Greed, to solidify his defense, but already he seemed nearly out of energy. The barrier put up by Kagali’s unique skill Schemer was their last resort. Melchizedek, Lord of Dominion, might’ve been taken from her by Yuuki, but she <em>had</em> possessed an ultimate at one point. While Schemer was merely a unique skill, it had grown to the point that it could perform as well as an ultimate.</p>

      <p>But it wasn’t enough. Kagali alone couldn’t overcome this dominating difference in power.</p>

      <p><a id="page-322"></a><em>That won’t work at all. She just can’t hold out…</em></p>

      <p>Sylvia could see the writing on the wall.</p>

      <p>Jahil’s attack involved two different stages. The pure destructive energy he summoned would be wrapped into a strike from Agni, Lord of Blazes. Once he shot a fireball to vaporize Kagali’s barrier, he had his main attack waiting for her right afterward. It was all made possible by the colossal amount of magicules Jahil possessed. He was a walking wall of energy that was hard to even conceive of, his magicule count several times that of Sylvia. It was far too late for someone like Sylvia to join in and try defending this thing.</p>

      <p><em>Could anyone else stop this?</em></p>

      <p>She looked at the four people there, frozen in place. Kagali was exhausting herself to no avail. Yuuki was already out. What about the other two? Teare had no ultimate skill, so a defensive barrier from her would be a drop in the bucket. All hope was thus placed on Laplace.</p>

      <p>So Sylvia looked his way—and was startled by what she saw.</p>

      <p><em>Huh? That face… No. It couldn’t be him—</em></p>

      <p>Underneath Laplace’s broken mask, it was there. She thought she had forgotten it long ago, but one look, and all the memories came rolling back. She couldn’t help but scream:</p>

      <p>“Run, Thalion!!”</p>

      <p>But that advice came far too late.</p>

      <p>“So! Farewell, then. Time to pulverize your soul and wipe you off the face of this planet!”</p>

      <p>Jahil’s words signaled the end. And true to his words, it caused intense destruction. With a flash, then an explosion, Leon’s castle was blown away. The massive fireball raged, spreading heat and flames across the land before flickering into nothingness.</p>
