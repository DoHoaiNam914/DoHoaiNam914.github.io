      <p><a id="page-171"></a>“Ah, Mr. Gabbana, this man is—”</p>

      <p>“Don’t worry about it. I’ll take care of this.”</p>

      <p>“No, sir, I mean—”</p>

      <p>“There’re a lot of liars, y’know? People who’ll say anything to meet with Sir Mjöllmile. A bunch of fools are trying to crash our party tonight, too. It’s tough being famous, you see. He doesn’t really understand that, though, which is why talented staff like myself need to be here. Tough luck for you, huh? If <em>I</em> wasn’t around, you might’ve actually been successful, too.”</p>

      <p>“Oh… Yeah, I guess…?”</p>

      <p>I wasn’t sure how else to respond. The receptionist seemed to know my name, but this Gabbana gentleman didn’t seem aware of me at all. Maybe he was, but he failed to match the name with the face. It’s not like he normally handled front-desk duty, either, by the looks of things. I couldn’t help but think that he was just trying to look good around this beautiful receptionist so he could make a move or two on her.</p>

      <p>“I will teach this man a lesson, Sir Rimuru.”</p>

      <p>Soei, quietly seething next to me, focused his eyes on Gabbana.</p>

      <p>“Wait, wait, wait! Mollie’s working hard to train his staff, okay? We have to expect a misunderstanding or two!”</p>

      <p>We need to be nice here, you know? I’m sure Mjöllmile really <em>is</em> busy, but it’s a shame he couldn’t be personally here to greet me. I wasn’t a big fan of Gabbana’s attitude, but if people are dropping in without an appointment in search of jobs or whatever, it’d be natural to treat people like me this way.</p>

      <p>As I tried to assuage Soei, the receptionist raised her voice.</p>

      <p>“Mr. Gabbana! This one is the real thing! I’m sure of it! He looks exactly like the portrait on the wall in Sir Mjöllmile’s office!”</p>

      <p>Oh, he had a portrait? I noticed one inconspicuously hanging in his house when I visited, but he’s still got that one, huh? And hanging it in public, too. Strange guy…but, yeah. Shizu, who gave me my looks, was a real beauty, after all. I understand if he’s smitten, but I’m basically a grade-school version of her…but come to think of it, I’ve been growing, haven’t I? I was now a little bit under five-foot-three, which I suppose is average for a girl in high school. I <a id="page-172"></a>didn’t have a chest or anything, but maybe I’d look pretty good in a portrait. I’m too fidgety to sit for one, though, so I’d need to have Ciel conjure something up in my place. Not that I have any interest in being a model anyway.</p>

      <p>As my mind kept wandering down this trivial side path, I heard Gabbana’s surprised voice.</p>

      <p>“Wh-what? This little brat—um, this child is Sir Rimuru himself?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I’m positive.”</p>

      <p>“But that’s just crazy! He’s a demon lord! Why would the lord of such a huge domain be traveling around with a single bodyguard? It’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard!”</p>

      <p>Hmm. He has a good point. I really need to follow more of the formalities when I’m traveling around—Shuna said as much when I headed to Dwargon. Here, I skipped most of them due to lack of time, but I knew how anxious that made her. Maybe I better shape up in the future to avoid things like this.</p>

      <p>“It might be, sir, but it’s the truth!”</p>

      <p>“I mean, would a demon lord just prance in here and say, ‘Hey, is Mollie around?’ Of course he wouldn’t. Right?”</p>

      <p>Gabbana sounded like he was pleading for his life, tears in his eyes. If he admitted he was wrong, after all, it’d mean he tried to kick a demon lord out of the building. I’m sure he had a vested interest in denying everything. The “gentleman” mask was off, and now I was seeing the real him.</p>

      <p><em>Hmm… I feel kinda like a bad guy.</em></p>

      <p>“Hey, um, I’m sorry. I’m not out to sic my dogs on you or anything—”</p>

      <p>“You have a covert agent here you could sic on him.”</p>

      <p>“Enough, Soei! But this isn’t your fault, Gabbana, so I’ll put it behind me. Could you just pass me on to Mollie, please?”</p>

      <p>My proposal made Gabbana’s face light up. “A-are you sure?”</p>

      <p>“We’ll all be a lot happier that way, won’t we?”</p>

      <p>Tears began to flow from his eyes. I’m not sure what kind of scenario he was picturing, but he beamed at me, saying stuff like “Thank you very much! I’ll never forget this favor!” and so on. I felt a little weird about it, given how I was trying to conceal my own mistakes anyway.</p>

      <p class="tx1">As Gabbana emoted his appreciation, the receptionist called in Mjöllmile. She and Gabbana saw me off, heads bowed, as me and Mjöllmile moved to his office. It was situated in a large room on the top floor, offering a great view and plenty of sunlight. I took in the sights as I sat down on a luxurious sofa, taking a drink of the juice provided.</p>

      <p>“Is anything the matter, Sir Rimuru?” Mjöllmile asked.</p>

      <p>“Nope. Nothing.”</p>

      <p>“Well, great, then. I was just worried that bozo Gabbana did something rude to you…”</p>

      <p>“No, no, it’s perfectly fine!”</p>

      <p>After reassuring Mjöllmile, I casually changed the subject.</p>

      <p>“But Mollie, I see that you have a portrait of me in this office? What’s up with that?”</p>

      <p>I asked the question calmly, my eyes focused on a certain point on the wall.</p>

      <p>“Ah…?! W-well, yes, about that…”</p>

      <p>“It would seem he obtained this on the black market,” Soei said. “However, both its origin and the identity of the artist are unknown.”</p>

      <p>“Oh?”</p>

      <p>“There were pieces depicting you in slime form as well, Sir Rimuru, so I believe it is someone who knows you well…but even with our intelligence network, I have been unable to pin them down. A shrewd character, to be sure.”</p>

      <p><em>Whoa, wait a second. “Shrewd” isn’t the half of it. Am I in trouble?</em></p>

      <p>“So not even <em>your</em> investigations went anywhere, Soei?”</p>

      <p>“Unfortunately not.”</p>

      <p>“No way…”</p>

      <p>“As we are in a state of war, I assigned a low priority to this investigation. I therefore could not assign many personnel to the case, which is the likely culprit.”</p>

      <p><em>Oh. That kind of reason? But I feel kind of violated, being a model for a portrait by someone I don’t even know.</em></p>

      <p>“Well,” Mjöllmile said, “journalists around the world have seen <a id="page-174"></a>you in person now, Sir Rimuru. I’m sure at least some of them have artistic talents. There’s nothing that strange about it, is there?”</p>

      <p>“You think…?”</p>

      <p>If even Soei’s team was failing, that was cause for concern. But no point brooding over it.</p>

      <p>“Okay, well, I’m confiscating this.”</p>

      <p>“Very well— Wait, <em>what</em>?!”</p>

      <p>I attempted to persuade the shocked Mjöllmile, although I had already decided on this in my mind.</p>

      <p>“Why do you have to do something like hang a picture of me in public? I hereby forbid you from doing that!”</p>

      <p>“C-come on! This is tyranny! I don’t think even the great tyrants of history would order something like that!”</p>

      <p>“You don’t have to exaggerate! Why are you resisting it so much? I’ll pay you for the portrait, okay? So let me just take this…”</p>

      <p>I took the artwork off the wall. I mean, whoever painted this had beautified me so much that it hardly even resembled me any longer. To be frank, it looked way more like Shizu than me. That beauty, that fleeting feeling… An excellent representation of her.</p>

      <p>“I was so excited about hanging this here, too…”</p>

      <p>Soei patted the wailing Mjöllmile on the shoulder. “Heh… Give it up. Have this instead.”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>“Is—is that…?”</p>

      <p>The moment the surprised Mjöllmile and I saw the artwork in Soei’s hand, we both raised an eyebrow in confusion. It depicted a slime.</p>

      <p>“Hmm…”</p>

      <p>“Well, isn’t that nice, Mollie? Hopefully this’ll be enough inspiration for you.”</p>

      <p>“No, no, I’m not sure this works, you could say…”</p>

      <p><em>I’m sure it doesn’t. I don’t think seeing a picture of a slime would make for a very motivational poster.</em></p>

      <p>“But why do <em>you</em> have something like that, Soei?”</p>

      <p>“These were pieces we seized in the midst of our investigations. A few other examples have appeared in the market as well, and we’ve retrieved all of them.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-175"></a>“All just of me as a slime?”</p>

      <p>“……Yes.”</p>

      <p>What was that pause for?</p>

      <p>“…Well…one of them was taken from me by Diablo…”</p>

      <p><em>What? That bastard!</em></p>

      <p>“I resisted him with everything I could, but he overpowered me. I’m deeply sorry.”</p>

      <p>“Ah. Well, that’s all right. I’ll be sure to retrieve it from Diablo, then. That, and I’ll tell him to stop getting in your hair.”</p>

      <p>Diablo can be such a pain. He glorifies me way too much—and I know that my looks are derived from Shizu’s, so it’s not like I claim I’m ugly or something. But this is all the more reason why I can’t allow him to own portraits of me painted by God knows who.</p>

      <p>Soei smiled briskly, relieved by my promise. Mjöllmile muttered something like “What, so Sir Soei gets to keep <em>his</em> art?” But he should really stop worrying about that kind of thing.</p>

      <p>“Well, why not?” I asked. “At least Soei attracts <em>normal</em> women. You can bet they’ll be safe with him!”</p>

      <p>Mjöllmile gave me a funny look and nodded. The subject was closed for now, but I’d need to <em>thoroughly</em> look into where this stuff came from.</p>

      <p class="tx1">There wasn’t much time left before evening, so we got down to business.</p>

      <p>“I’m glad to see things have gone well so far, but what about our future plans?”</p>

      <p>“Ah, that’s the question, isn’t it? I’d like to receive an update from you, too.”</p>

      <p>“Well, should I begin, then?”</p>

      <p>“No, um, you see, we’ve received loads of questions about your plans from all kinds of people. For tonight, I’d like you to enjoy the party, and then tomorrow we’ll hold a conference to go through them all.”</p>

      <p>“Ah, well done, Mollie! No stone’s left unturned with you!”</p>

      <p>“Wah-ha-ha! But of course!”</p>

      <p><a id="page-176"></a>I feel like I’ve been repeating myself a lot lately, which I’m getting sick of, but we’ll get a whole lot more done at once this way. Kudos to Mjöllmile.</p>

      <p>So I had him report to me on his current dealings. All our plans were experiencing smooth sailing. We had gradually been consuming a number of underground criminal organizations, and by now, almost nobody openly defied REG any longer.</p>

      <p>“That’s wonderful. It’s scary how well that’s going.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, it truly is! Sir Veryard is one of the most talented people I’ve ever met. He’s using methods I never would have conceived of in a million years to expand our power. Honestly, he’s even better at this than I am.”</p>

      <p>“Well, don’t feel bad about that, Mollie. He got the best of <em>me</em> once, as I recall. I can’t blame you for thinking you lose out to him.”</p>

      <p>“I hate to admit it, but he’s just a monster, let me tell you! It’s like he reads people’s minds and manipulates them into doing whatever works out best for him. He might even be more qualified to direct the FNTA than me, you know?”</p>

      <p><em>Well, who knows? He’s clearly a talent, yes, but whether he’s CEO material is another story.</em></p>

      <p>“No, I don’t think so.”</p>

      <p>“…?”</p>

      <p>“And I’m not just saying that ’cause we’re friends, Mollie. It’s a boss’s mission to reward the people under them for getting the job done. If a boss is <em>too</em> talented, they won’t be able to accurately judge other people’s achievements.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm… I think I understand what you’re getting at, Sir Rimuru, but…”</p>

      <p>Mjöllmile looked less than convinced, so I kept on talking. I could have just laughed this off, but better to address anxieties like this while they’re still small.</p>

      <p>“Well, everybody’s different, right? So of course they’re all gonna have different talents. And any boss is asked to assign their workers the tasks they’re best suited for. But if you’re <em>too</em> good at your work, you tend to just do it all yourself instead of relying on anyone else.”</p>

      <p>“Right…”</p>

      <p><a id="page-177"></a>“So if someone like that’s at the top of the hierarchy, there’s a pretty good chance they’ll start thinking, like, ‘I’m the best; I’m always correct.’”</p>

      <p><em>Autocratic</em> is the word for it. They’re talented, yeah, but many of them think in strict, polarized ways. If your staff gets the job done, that’s a baseline; if they don’t, they’re worthless. Even if the failure’s caused by having impossible quantities of work placed upon them, if the boss thinks he’s right, he could pin all of the blame on the staff. And if that boss is the president of the company, that’s the worst of all. People might be too afraid of being fired to point it out—and even if they aren’t, no one might be listening anyway.</p>

      <p>Along those lines, I felt safe with Mjöllmile. He can be pretty autocratic at times, but he’s kind and broad-minded enough to see his staff’s failures as his own.</p>

      <p>Veryard, meanwhile, is the kind of boss who immediately lays off anyone he deems incompetent. Well, maybe that’s going too far. I wouldn’t call him coldhearted, but he’s the type who looks at nothing but numbers and gives the cold shoulder to personnel he deems redundant. Management like that can contribute to the growth of a firm, but that’s not the kind of firm I’m aiming for. I want the people in <em>my</em> organization to feel joy from helping others out.</p>

      <p>The Four Nations Trade Alliance, as set up by us, didn’t need to hurry growth. I didn’t care if it took its time—I just want a firm where people trust in each other. Rapid growth can result in people dropping out, and if Veryard were director, that’s probably what would happen, wouldn’t it?</p>

      <p>I explained all this carefully to Mjöllmile.</p>

      <p>“…I see. That’s how you think, Sir Rimuru?”</p>

      <p>“Well, it may all be baseless anxieties, of course. I’m not trying to say Veryard’s a bad person, either. I just think he’s so talented that he puts efficiency ahead of everything else.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm, yes, I can’t deny that. So my job’s to manage things so it’s easier for everybody to work under Sir Veryard, then?”</p>

      <p>“Exactly. Glad we’re on the same page there. The top person in a company shouldn’t really be much more than decoration…but they can’t be an empty shell, either. If we can all shoulder some of it until <a id="page-178"></a>everyone’s okay with their load—well, <em>that’s</em> when things start to come together!”</p>

      <p>This wasn’t an absolute, of course. Everything’s case by case in this business. But here, at least, I was certain that Mjöllmile was the best man to have on top. Besides, given that he’s also the finance minister of Tempest, it’s best that he doesn’t try <em>too</em> hard as the FNTA director. Just keep an eye on things and send work over to those with the best talent for it. Besides, I think Veryard’s more suited for working <em>under</em> someone, not the other way around.</p>

      <p>So Mjöllmile had my seal of approval as director, but the man himself treated this with a jovial laugh.</p>

      <p>“Wah-ha-ha! Ah, Sir Rimuru, you are <em>such</em> a modest leader!”</p>

      <p><em>…?</em></p>

      <p><em>Oh.</em></p>

      <p>“No, you idiot, I was talking about <em>you</em>, not me!”</p>

      <p>He kept on laughing in my face.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">Once Mjöllmile was done briefing me, it was almost time for the party.</p>

      <p>“We’ve invited nobility from many nations today, Sir Rimuru, so I’m sure you’ll receive quite a bit of attention. It’ll be such a large-scale event, I’m not sure we’ll have much time to rest, but are you okay with that?”</p>

      <p>Hmm…</p>

      <p>“Well…hopefully it won’t just be me sitting there intimidating people.”</p>

      <p>That was obviously a bad idea. But I didn’t want to deal with a bunch of annoying hangers-on, either. I suppose I could solve this by just not attending, but everyone from Gazel and Yohm to King Doram of Blumund was on the invite list. If Mjöllmile is director of the FNTA, then I’m sort of like the firm’s top benefactor. I can’t just duck out because I don’t want to be there.</p>

      <p>“I could shoo them away, if you like.”</p>

      <p>Soei looked deadly serious. If I let him “shoo them away,” my instincts told me there’d be a bloodbath.</p>

      <p><a id="page-179"></a>“N-no, uh, I’ll be okay. I’ll just use my consummate communication skills to fend them off.”</p>

      <p>“Ah… Understood. I will keep a prudent distance in my bodyguard duties, then.”</p>

      <p>“Great. Thank you.”</p>

      <p>Cool. That’s a relief. There’d be nothing but A-listers at this event, so violence was out of the question. It’d still be that way even if they weren’t A-listers, but if we triggered an international incident, it’d wind up involving a hell of a lot more people than me.</p>

      <p>“I am here, too, my master. Fear not!”</p>

      <p>Ranga poked his face out from my shadow to express himself.</p>

      <p>“Perfect. I’m counting on you!”</p>

      <p>Cute little guy. His antics drained all the nervousness from me as I began striding toward the party venue.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">The ninth floor—one below us—was wide open for the most part, designed to hold large meetings, activities that required many employees, and other such things. Right now, it was decorated for the party, complete with a few tables set up for buffet service. The eighth floor, by the way, was the employee dining hall, letting staffers look at the scenery while they enjoyed their meals. Coffee and tea were available at all times from there, so the staff could use it for business meetings and informal chats as well.</p>

      <p>All the food served at this party was, of course, prepared by the cooks plugging away in the kitchen. There was an assortment of pickles, soups, cured ham, premium steak, meatballs, roast beef slices, a selection of pasta, <em>takoyaki</em>, <em>yakisoba</em>, <em>okonomiyaki</em>, curry, meatloaf… Hang on. They didn’t go as far as ramen, at least, but something about this menu didn’t seem too appropriate for a business party.</p>

      <p>“Hey, uh, Mollie?”</p>

      <p>“What is it?”</p>

      <p>“Isn’t the choice of food a little odd?”</p>

      <p>“You think so? It’s all the most popular items from Tempest’s dining halls.”</p>

      <p>“Um, yeah, I know that, but… Huh?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-180"></a>Well, let’s just take a deep breath. Maybe the buffet menu could’ve used more of a red-carpet touch, but there’s no need to be bound by convention at all either, right? If we’re here to try giving this world a breath of fresh air, maybe this menu was the right way to go.</p>

      <p>“You know, the food we had on offer at the Founder’s Festival was pretty off the beaten path as well. If anything, I think some of our guests were expecting something like this.”</p>

      <p>“Oh yeah? Well, I guess we’re good, then.”</p>

      <p>“Indeed. And if we’re not, it’s not like anyone’s about to complain!”</p>

      <p>Hmm… I really like how Mollie can keep such a casual “what happens, happens” attitude with this. As I reflected on it, I realized that I was overthinking it anyway.</p>

      <p>I took another look around, wondering if there was anything else to bring up. Then my eyes settled on the man who had built this whole venue. It was Veryard.</p>

      <p>“Well, well, Your Majesty! Oh, but in my current position, I suppose you’d allow me to just call you Sir Rimuru?”</p>

      <p>He greeted me with a friendly, beaming smile, and I couldn’t help but nod back at him. Not that it’s a problem or anything, but Veryard’s smile brought up some bad memories in me, so I couldn’t help but keep my guard up around him. Now I really <em>couldn’t</em> laugh at Mjöllmile, huh?</p>

      <p>Still, it’s pretty darn extraordinary that the kingdom of Blumund would be so ready and willing to change the entire makeup of the nation like that. It would’ve been unthinkable back in my old life—even if absolute monarchies still existed on Earth, the idea of accomplishing that without any bloodshed was just a fantasy.</p>

      <p>But here’s King Doram, doing just that. Better not mess with <em>him</em>, I guess. Using his own kingdom as his chips… Talk about a true gambler. I frankly don’t have the cajones for that, so he gets nothing but respect from me. And Veryard, being his former right-hand man, wasn’t anyone to look down on, either.</p>

      <p>“Well, everything looks thoroughly taken care of around here, Sir Veryard. Having you in command is a tremendous relief. Keep supporting Mjöllmile for me, okay?”</p>

      <p>“But of course. And please, go ahead and call me just Veryard. <a id="page-181"></a>My father, the head of our family, might be a marquis, but he is planning to abandon the title without me inheriting it.”</p>

      <p>“Really? Whoa.”</p>

      <p>I mean, yeah, Blumund’s moves would shake the nobility a lot in the future, but that only really applied to the lower classes of nobility. I’m not so sure about earls, but if you’re a marquis or higher—the senior class—I think you’d be safe no matter how things work out.</p>

      <p>“Yes, well, the time will come soon when we’re called ‘peers,’ not nobles, and then we’ll likely lose our powers before long. I was the one who drafted that plan and presented it to King Doram, after all.”</p>

      <p><em>It was you?!</em></p>

      <p>I think I deserved praise for not saying that out loud.</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! Well, those are the times we live in. The nobles may be the big movers and shakers of government for now, but once the people get up to speed on politics, you know they’re not going to be happy with the status quo. It’s important to gradually cede authority to them, so things won’t get too hostile once that happens.”</p>

      <p>“Well, I’m sure, yes, but you can’t just ask a bunch of guys who’ve never been near politics before to run a nation.”</p>

      <p>Veryard smiled at my concern. “No. And that’s why I want to become a commoner now. That way, I’ll be in a position to accept the powers that’re due to come to us.”</p>

      <p>Oh. <em>That</em> kind of thing? I wouldn’t call it “cheating,” but he was certainly fixing the match quite a bit. But, yeah, it sounded reasonable to me. I do think that strategy would keep the nobility’s dissatisfaction to a minimum. But—man—how much foresight does this guy <em>have</em>, anyway? Because from what I’ve seen, he’d be up there with anyone I’ve met, supernatural or not. It’s so amazing, I’d feel bad for leaving the “sir” off his name.</p>

      <p>Mjöllmile shook his head, exasperated. He had a look of “I told you so, didn’t I?” in his eyes, and I nodded my firm agreement with that.</p>

      <p class="tx1"><a id="page-182"></a>So the party began without a hitch. Mjöllmile, as director, gave the first speech, with King Doram adding a few words and proposing a toast.</p>

      <p>Then things got informal real fast. Informal, but not crass—that was important. There were royals here, after all, so that goes without saying. Of course, there are always some people who don’t quite get the message, so as soon as we entered the party’s “chatter” phase, I had a crowd forming around me.</p>

      <p>Guys, guys, guys… I know I’ve got brilliant communication skills, but even I have my limits! One or two people are fine, but when I’m surrounded by a dozen or so, that’s trouble.</p>

      <p>“Your Majesty! Please, you need to hear my story!”</p>

      <p>“My homeland would like to send a diplomat to Tempest!”</p>

      <p>“We would like to open trade with you! And we also have roads we would like to improve…”</p>

      <p>“Ugh! All you little small-fry nations, get out of my way! I, er, my nation is close to yours, and—”</p>

      <p>“Why are <em>you</em> acting so above us? What kind of diplomat doesn’t even know how to stand in line?!”</p>

      <p>“I am the crown prince, I’ll have you know. If you want to talk about lines, I think <em>my</em> position enables me to go first.”</p>

      <p>“Like you’ve got any authority outside of your borders!”</p>

      <p>“Should I interpret that to mean you are openly hostile to my homeland?”</p>

      <p>So, yeah, it was pretty raucous. A lot of it was stuff I had no reply to but “Who gives a crap,” and I was worried a fight might break out soon. All a big headache, really. I couldn’t just ignore them all, but it was a huge hassle to deal with. Way beyond what I imagined anyway.</p>

      <p>I suppose this is just how important my position has become—but tonight, at least, I think I let my guard down. It’s not like people swarm Gazel like this. Even Yohm presents himself as a stately figure—or not. That’s more Mjurran smiling and keeping guard over him, isn’t it? I envy him. Still, Yohm’s something of a sharp-eyed warrior, so maybe that’s one reason why a snooty noble wouldn’t want to get close to him.</p>

      <p><a id="page-183"></a>Ahh, this must be why El from Thalion never shows up, right? Because it’s always a huge uproar whenever she does. She told me she has people go through formal procedures and wait their turn to see her; nobody without an appointment gets allowed in. I think I’ll try something like that next time.</p>

      <p>Still, I had to do something about this situation. As I pondered over how to approach this, an unexpected person offered a helping hand.</p>

      <p>“People, people, can we all relax a little, please?”</p>

      <p>It was Gabbana, the guy I ran into out front, talking to the crowd in his low, husky voice.</p>

      <p>“His Majesty the demon lord Rimuru is head of the powerful Jura-Tempest Federation and our nation’s greatest supporter. I understand your earnest wishes, but please refrain from badgering him this evening!”</p>

      <p>The point he was not-so-discreetly making was that tonight’s a celebration of a new beginning, so let’s discuss business some other time. He might’ve been crying in front of me earlier, but Gabbana’s a beacon of hope now. And he got a good reaction, too.</p>

      <p>“Ah, Mr. Gabbana! I heard you’ve become an executive in the Alliance. It’s great to see you in good spirits…”</p>

      <p>“Y-yes, my apologies for being in such a rush. It’s a great fortune for me just to say hello to you tonight, so I’ll leave you be for now…”</p>

      <p>“My pardons as well. I’ll look forward to seeing you at a later date, once I file a more formal request.”</p>

      <p>And those were the lucky ones. Most of the crowd quickly made good their escape instead of trying to say anything to me. I wouldn’t exactly call that praiseworthy behavior, but I wasn’t going to yell at people about trivial things.</p>

      <p>I only had so much time in the first place, so Rigurd was in charge of who got to meet with me. I only extended the honor to a carefully selected few, and even now, I’m still in the process of sifting through all the requests. In the future, I’ll follow Elmesia’s example and be a bit more stringent. The fewer troublesome people in my life, the better. That, of course, meant that I may never see some of the people at this party again. For tonight, at least, I’m not going to mind a little crass behavior thrown in my direction.</p>

      <p><a id="page-184"></a>I gotta say, though, I’m seeing Gabbana in a much better light now. He was standing a distance away, keeping an eye out for me, and thanks to him, I got to sit back and enjoy this party a little more.</p>

      <p class="tx1">So, now that I had a little more freedom of movement, I looked around at the other guests. I met with Gazel and Yohm in advance, so no need to go out of my way to say hi. They’d be at tomorrow’s conference, too, and if they had anything important to tell me, they could do it there. For tonight, all I had to do was hang out and act regal, so I was hoping to find someone interesting and get into some fun chitchat.</p>

      <p>I looked around to see if anyone suitable was nearby…and there she was! A tremendous beauty, the kind who’d make anyone turn their head. Who is it? It’s Hinata, of course!</p>

      <p>Hinata was wearing a dress with a wide-open back, jet-black like a moonless night, and studded with jewels that looked like stars. But the dress wasn’t all that noteworthy compared to her own sexiness. She kept her hair short, and between that and the dress, all her skin from the back of her neck down to her waist was on full display. She had tied a ribbon around her neck, but even this only accentuated her appeal.</p>

      <p>Her pale skin was dazzling against the dark hue of her dress. Just <em>too</em> dazzling, really! It was called a backless dress, apparently, and I don’t know who invented it, but it’s a truly wonderful design. Better save that to a file in my brain. Or, actually, maybe I could have Ciel record this as a video for me—</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>There is no such function.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">No, there <em>is</em>, isn’t there? I mean, you played back that high-res video of all the stuff in the labyrinth for me.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>As we are not inside the labyrinth, no recorded footage is accessible.</em></span></p>
