      <p>By comparison, Raine hadn’t given out much intel. Casually name-dropping Rimuru like that was ill-advised, but she hadn’t been told not to, so what’s the problem? There wasn’t any, at least in Raine’s mind. If Rimuru heard about it, he’d probably whip himself for not explicitly forbidding it before yelling at her.</p>

      <p>Regardless, in exchange for revealing that Rimuru helped them evolve, Raine had obtained some pretty vital intelligence. After that, though, the meeting turned into a bitch-fest, everyone talking about their difficulties and complaining about their bosses.</p>

      <p>All four of them, by the way, had a magic-powered fire going inside this igloo, making things feel very pleasant. Raine also had some sweet potatoes with her, which she placed on skewers and roasted over the fire, so there was a light, pleasant aroma in the air. She’d even brought some sweet sake.</p>

      <p>“This is perfect for cold weather,” said Raine.</p>

      <p>“You brought <em>that</em>, too…?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, don’t frown at her, Mizeri. You shouldn’t be such a stick in the mud like that. <em>I</em> think it’s just fine, you know.”</p>

      <p>“You say that, Garasha, but I’m sure you just want a swig of that, don’t you? I do, too, so I won’t stop you…”</p>

      <p>“Exactly, Mizeri. When the fighting’s over, we will all make up over drinks. That’s how these things <em>should</em> go!”</p>

      <p>The fighting never began in the first place, but nobody besides Mizeri was going to mention that right now. It was three to one, though, leaving her with no choice but to give up. So this epic battle was transformed into a nice little winter retreat for the four of them—and as the rest of the fighting continued to rage outside the igloo, they continued trading their takes in hushed tones.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Leon sat on his throne. His days of peace were over.</p>

      <p>With a loud splintering sound, the grand door leading to this <a id="page-285"></a>audience chamber caved in. Amid the carnage, the intruder appeared, walking in majestically.</p>

      <p>“Hohhhh-hoh-hoh-hoh! Hello there, everybody! My name is Footman the Angry Jester, member of the Moderate Jesters. Glad to make your acquaintance!”</p>

      <p>Between his rotund body and angry clown mask, he was a bizarre sight to see. But Leon was familiar with this jovial-sounding clown. He had done business with him before; they were bound by a contract that, by now, was nothing but an embarrassing memory. And while this clown seemed rather powerful at the time, it was nothing compared to now.</p>

      <p>Leon sensed a strange, eerie force from him. But what did he want? If he was here to capture him, it’d surely be too reckless to barge in alone.</p>

      <p><em>So the enemy’s outmuscled us, in the end? But I don’t understand. What’s this man thinking? If he could help the rest of our allies, perhaps we could turn the tables on this war, but…</em></p>

      <p>Leon stood up.</p>

      <p>“So you’ve come here all alone?” bellowed Arlos. “Don’t tell me you expect to come out alive?”</p>

      <p>Claude, meanwhile, stood motionless with one hand on his sword, ready to protect Leon at any moment.</p>

      <p>Leon pondered the situation. <em>Footman</em>, he thought, <em>must have had some other objective. That, or—</em></p>

      <p>But just then, a woman came through the broken door and entered the audience chamber.</p>

      <p>“Ah, <em>there</em> you are, demon lord Leon. Hee-hee-hee-hee! Do you remember me?”</p>

      <p>It was a beautiful, graceful woman speaking, a chuckle on her lips. She was in a navy blue business suit, making her look like the quintessential secretary. Her skin was smooth and pale, her blond hair tied in a chignon around her well-balanced face. Her blue eyes had a mysterious glow to them, and she had them pointed directly at Leon.</p>

      <p>“Then again, I suppose this is the first time some of you have seen me since my…change in appearance. My name is Kagali, and I am <a id="page-286"></a>president of the Moderate Jesters. I <em>do</em> have a grudge against you for killing me, so I thought fit to take you on by myself.”</p>

      <p>Kagali was being almost too theatrical as she gave this introduction.</p>

      <p>Two clowns followed her into the room. The one with the crying mask was Teare, carrying a massive scythe on her back.</p>

      <p>“I’m Teare,” she said with a laugh, “the Teardrop Jester on the team. I hate being sad, and I’m gonna eliminate any enemy of Lady Kagali’s on the double!”</p>

      <p>To prove her point, she dexterously spun her scythe in the air in a dance-like move. Then she gave the stage over to Laplace, another clown, with an asymmetrical mask and a demeanor that made it seem like he was constantly making fun of you.</p>

      <p>“And I’m Laplace the Wonder Jester, vice president of the Moderate Jesters. We’re havin’ some lovely weather outside, ain’t we? …Oh, but that doesn’t matter right now, huh?! I was told to sprint all the way here, and <em>boy</em>, are my legs tired. And look at all the commotion around here, too! I <em>really</em> wish I could just go home…”</p>

      <p>Laplace’s introduction was really more of a rant, which certainly fit his personality. But once the clowns were done, the last member appeared, a young man wearing a black imperial uniform and an intrepid smile. It was Yuuki Kagurazaka, still under Michael’s full control.</p>

      <p>“Hey. Guess I’m going up last, huh? My name’s Yuuki. And you’re the demon lord Leon, right? I feel like I might’ve met you before, but my memory’s going on me a little, so I can’t be too sure. Sorry.”</p>

      <p>Michael’s rule over people worked on set levels. There were two types of domination: one where the subject still had free will and one where certain restrictions were put in place. When he dominated someone via their angelic skills, there was no threat of being betrayed, so Michael gave them a lot of leeway in their behavior. Yuuki, on the other hand, was ruled via Regalia Dominion, which meant considerable checks on what he could do. In a way, this was Michael recognizing what Yuuki was capable of. If he saw him as someone less capable, he would’ve allowed free thought like what Kagali and the others enjoyed.</p>

      <p>Regardless, this had the effect of making Yuuki appear suddenly absent-minded. Once he finished introducing himself, he leaned <a id="page-288"></a>against the destroyed doorframe, seemingly uninterested in Leon and his attendants.</p>
