      <p class="space-break1"><a id="page-186"></a>You gotta be kidding me. I <em>know</em> you can do this! Like, you save the video from my battles against monsters, don’t you? So I can study them later? Just do something like that here, is all I’m asking—</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Negative. No justification found.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">Hey, why’s it talking like a robot all of a sudden? God dammit! I hate a partner who goes all unreliable right at the most critical moment.</p>

      <p>Left with no other choice, I devoted every slime cell in my body to the task as I smiled and spoke up.</p>

      <p>“Wow, Hinata. You look beautiful tonight. That dress suits you so well!”</p>

      <p>Hinata was having a sip of wine, but she put the glass on the table and turned back toward me. Then, gazing dubiously at me, she spoke.</p>

      <p>“Huh? So you’ve learned how to flatter people now, eh?”</p>

      <p>“No, no, I mean it! I’m not good at any kind of flattery!”</p>

      <p>That was half true. I was no good at giving compliments I didn’t actually mean. Hinata snickered a bit instead of taking me to task for it—but I couldn’t end the conversation here, so I plowed onward.</p>

      <p>“But it’s really bold, too, y’know? Not to be rude, but I didn’t think you’d be so aggressive with your evening wear—”</p>

      <p>She glared at me. I swallowed the rest of my words. <em>Oh, crap, I feel like my stock is plummeting with her.</em></p>

      <p>“If you’re aware that it’s rude, it would’ve been the right move <em>not</em> to say it, wouldn’t it?”</p>

      <p>“Sorry! You’re absolutely right!”</p>

      <p>Enough antagonizing her. An apology was the only way out.</p>

      <p>Hinata was reproachfully staring at me. I was panicking under her gaze. Then I smelled the aroma of wine. Hinata, breathing out a sigh, looked impossibly sexy to me. I mean, she looked great from the back, but the front view was definitely nosebleed-worthy. Her dress went all the way up to her neck, but it was sleeveless, so there <a id="page-187"></a>was nothing hiding her pale shoulders. And the most important part of all was the sides, down from the—</p>

      <p>“What are you looking at? I’ll kill you.”</p>

      <p>“Sorry.”</p>

      <p>Bad move. I forgot I was in human form as I stared at her. No wonder she spotted it. Good thing this body of mine doesn’t get nosebleeds.</p>

      <p>“Luminus wouldn’t shut up about having me wear this,” she said.</p>

      <p>Dang! Nice one, Luminus! I’d love to send an “attaboy” out to her right now. I can picture her looking all smug about it, but either way, I have a ton of respect for her.</p>

      <p>I still tried to keep it cool as I did cartwheels for Luminus in my mind.</p>

      <p>“Hmm… Really? Well, I don’t think she made a bad choice. I mean, seriously, you look beautiful tonight.”</p>

      <p>I tried to appear as self-assured as possible. I meant every word of it, so I wasn’t afraid of Hinata glaring back at me…</p>

      <p>…Okay, that’s a lie. Actually, I was all kinds of freaking out.</p>

      <p>“Here we go again…”</p>

      <p>But before Hinata could continue, I covered her lips with my own—or rather, it’d be perfect if I could <em>actually</em> do something like that, but a single misstep and it’d be a lot more than just sexual harassment. I’d be a sexual <em>offender</em>, more like, and besides, I was way too timid to have that kind of courage.</p>

      <p>So I went with words instead. “No, really!” I said, trying to sound serious. Then I noticed Hinata’s cheeks turning red.</p>

      <p><em>This may work!</em></p>

      <p>Look at this! I’m doing better than ever before with—</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>I believe she is just inebriated.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">…Huh?</p>

      <p>I turned my attention toward the wine Hinata was drinking.</p>

      <p>“Oh… Hey, doesn’t this one have a high alcohol content?”</p>

      <p>“Is it? I’m enjoying it a lot.”</p>

      <p>Hinata may not have much of a tolerance, huh? I sincerely doubt that, but if that’s what Ciel says… I was too focused on her looks <a id="page-188"></a>tonight, but now I was curious about that sort of thing, too. So I held up three fingers.</p>

      <p>“Hey, how many am I holding up?”</p>

      <p>“Are you making fun of me?”</p>

      <p>“No, no, no, nothing like that…”</p>

      <p>Hinata sighed heavily as I hurriedly denied it.</p>

      <p>“Look, you realize that I’m a Saint, don’t you? I’ve had the chance to travel with Chloe, and Luminus taught me a lot after I came back, too. I could easily detoxify this alcohol if I wanted!”</p>

      <p>Ciel tricked me! But if that was Hinata’s claim, it made sense.</p>

      <p>After that… Well, let’s just say that I had a lot of trouble getting back on her good side. I never <em>did</em> get to ask why her cheeks turned red right then.</p>

      <p class="tx1">The day after the party, our conference began after a lunch break. The attendee rundown went a bit like this.</p>

      <p>First, we had the four kings and one queen supporting the FNTA—me, Gazel, Yohm and Mjurran, and King Doram. All of us in this group had already reached a consensus, so we were only here to put our stamp of approval on things. Next up was Mjöllmile, who was nominated to direct the FNTA by all four of us (minus Mjurran), and Hinata, representing the Western Holy Church. The chairman of the Council of the West was making a personal appearance as well. His name was Leicester, if I recall correctly, and he still had that long, bushy, Santa-like beard.</p>

      <p>Beyond that, there were around thirty more Council members in the conference room, all carefully selected to represent all the assorted Western Nations. Veryard was also present as secretary, and Cien was serving as moderator.</p>

      <p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he began, “I’d like to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for taking time out of your busy schedules to gather here. We will begin this conference by explaining the crisis that will likely be occurring in the near future.”</p>

      <p>Today’s main goal was to go over the stuff Mjöllmile asked me <a id="page-189"></a>about yesterday—who this enemy was, exactly; what it was aiming for; the potential fallout of the ensuing war; and how we’d deal with it. We carefully screened the people joining this meeting to keep any fear from growing into outright panic. Kicking and screaming wasn’t going to change this reality; instead, we needed to be mindful about the best possible course of action available to us. As leaders, we couldn’t be timid about that, as difficult as it can be.</p>

      <p>So that’s why I wanted to lay everything out on the table first. I had given this spiel quite a few times before, so I appreciated Mjöllmile’s arranging all of this.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, Cien completed his overview of the situation.</p>

      <p>“…So you’re saying the demon lord Rimuru won the war against the Empire,” said Chairman Leicester, “but now there’s this new enemy, Michael?”</p>

      <p>This muttered question ignited the other councilors.</p>

      <p>“And this Michael is leading the angelic race, too?”</p>

      <p>“A Temma War, is it? I never thought that five-hundred-year calamity would happen in my lifetime…”</p>

      <p>Hearing their reaction, I raised my hand to speak up. We’d better address a misunderstanding or two sooner than later.</p>

      <p>“Umm, like Cien said, the goal of the enemy is to resurrect Veldanava. We can only speculate on how they plan to do that, and we have no evidence favoring one scenario or the other. Most importantly, we do not have a timeframe for this, either. We believe they will make their move soon, but Michael is from a very long-lived species. It could be tomorrow, it could be a few years, or it could even be a few decades.”</p>

      <p>That’s the most troublesome part of it. We’re clueless on the timing. If there’s any movement, Deeno would tell us in his daily morning report, and then we’d contact Obela via Milim to confirm the accuracy of his intel.</p>

      <p>But so far, Michael hadn’t stirred at all. It was ominous, but there was nothing we could do about it, so we put that behind us for now. We had to keep on the alert for this enemy who could attack at any time, but until then, we were obligated to continue with our regular activities.</p>

      <p><a id="page-190"></a>Japan was pretty much the same way, I guess. A subduction-zone earthquake was 60 percent likely to strike the country within ten years, and that likelihood went up to 99 percent in thirty years, but that didn’t stop us from living our lives. We just made sure we were prepared in advance, so we wouldn’t be helpless when something happened. Beyond that, it was just a matter of cherishing our daily lives. Honestly, I was a lot more afraid of sudden volcanic eruptions than earthquakes, since there’s pretty much no way to prepare for those. They say that if Mount Aso, the largest active volcano in Japan, were to have a full-on caldera eruption, it’d cause untold damage. They call it a “super volcano,” after all, and apparently there’d be no escape no matter where in Japan you were. Maybe parts of Hokkaido up north would be unscathed, but either way, it’d be the end of the country.</p>

      <p>That’s all a hypothetical, of course, but what if the government released a statement saying this was <em>guaranteed</em> to happen within the next year? I mean, I doubt it’d really happen, but even if I trusted it and wanted to flee somewhere, there wouldn’t be any escape. No country is gonna be willing to accept a hundred million or so refugees from Japan, and I doubt we’d arrange some elaborate system where we’re all divided up among a bunch of other nations. Of course, if that prediction was 100 percent accurate, I’m sure the government will do what it can to help…but that depends on who’s in power. Maybe they wouldn’t accept it at all, and in the end, we’d have to rely on our own social connections to make our escape.</p>

      <p>Me, I guess I always feel in my mind somewhere that if it happens, it happens. Better to live each day in the pursuit of happiness, rather than cower in fear every day. It’s not like anywhere we escape to is guaranteed to be safe, either. They call them “natural disasters” because there’s no point thinking about them all the time. There’s an expression that goes along the lines of “the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry,” but I think that as a human being, you gotta just do the best you can with what you have.</p>

      <p>“…So we’ll ensure that we are ready for Michael’s attack at any time, but we also want people to keep enjoying their daily lives. That was why I wanted to reveal this truth only to the world’s <a id="page-191"></a>leadership. I hope this is understood as we ask you to join us in this preparation effort.”</p>

      <p>Everyone was silent as I made my conclusion. There was audible groaning. But after half a minute or so of this, Hinata finally spoke up.</p>

      <p>“As the representative of the Western Holy Church, we promise you our full support.”</p>

      <p>“I see,” Leicester said. “That makes sense to me. So the projects being hastily developed and promoted in the Western Nations were in preparation for this?”</p>

      <p>Cien nodded. “That is correct. It is all in accordance with Sir Rimuru’s will.”</p>

      <p>We were building tracks to run magitrains on, as well as station buildings to serve them. These were now being expanded and redesigned for use as shelters for the local residents. They could serve as gyms or auditoriums or other things in regular times. I was going to ask our audience here to hold evacuation drills for these facilities once they were done, but before I could say anything, Leicester spoke up.</p>

      <p>“It certainly makes sense to me that advance preparation is very important. I, personally, do not have the authority to intervene in other countries’ policies, but I can at least offer these evacuation drills as a proposal. Along those lines, I would be glad to offer my cooperation.”</p>

      <p>“Indeed. I may only be a councilor, but I am a marquis in my homeland. I will offer my advice to the king and get our training program underway.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, it’s a perfectly valid idea. Allow me to join you in this!”</p>

      <p>The councilors appeared to be on our side. This was going quicker than I expected, actually. We <em>did</em> pick this group carefully, after all, and none of them were foolish enough to grumble about this. Or, really, Mjöllmile said he kept the audience for this meeting small to prevent disorder like that. When it comes to decisions as monumental as these, a larger group would never reach a consensus, so the plan was to persuade a small group of power brokers first so they could win over the other councilors back home for us.</p>

      <p>That plan seemed to be going well, but it remains to be seen how the whole Council of the West will vote on the matter.</p>

      <p><a id="page-192"></a>“Hoh-hoh-hoh! Lord Rimuru seems to be concerned about the Council’s ultimate decision, but I would advise him to rest assured about that. Nobody, after all, would ever dare stand up to Lady Testarossa.”</p>

      <p>Um?</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! You are certainly correct. I have my political interests, yes, but I value my life quite a bit more. If this matter could threaten the very existence of our country… Well, if it’s something as simple as evacuation drills, a single word from an authority like Lady Testarossa will bring everyone on the same page.”</p>

      <p>“Indeed. It’s hardly something I am willing to openly fight against just to make my own opinion known.”</p>

      <p>“It’ll pass unanimously, I’m sure. It benefits all of us equally.”</p>

      <p>The councilors’ reaction was quite a bit different from what Mjöllmile and I expected. Now I wasn’t so sure I needed to be cautious and explain the whole situation to them.</p>

      <p>“Hmm, it’d seem I had a certain lack of awareness about this,” an impressed Veryard said. “I have never met this Testarossa before. She sounds like a very remarkable figure.”</p>

      <p>The councilors all looked at him warmly… Or was that envy in their eyes?</p>

      <p>“Gentlemen,” Cien said with a harrumph, “don’t you think you’re being a tad too careless? I will remind you that I am a faithful servant of Lady Testarossa, and I will be obliged to report to her about this meeting, lest anyone forget.”</p>

      <p>The panic this generated among the councilors was nothing short of hilarious.</p>

      <p>“No! You’ve got me wrong, I promise you!”</p>

      <p>“I did not mean any disrespect, no! I was merely praising her leadership…”</p>

      <p>“I was stating the truth—er, um, <em>ahem</em>, glory to Lady Testarossa!!”</p>

      <p>I’m not sure what that last guy was trying to say, but I could sense the emotion and desperation in his voice. I didn’t expect Testarossa to be so dreaded like this. What a surprise.</p>

      <p>“Cien,” I said as he smiled to himself, “try not to bully everyone too much, please.”</p>

      <p>And I’m sure this simple exchange taught Veryard just how mean <a id="page-193"></a>Testarossa could be. “Hmm… I was thinking I should meet with this woman,” he said, “but I’m sure she is busy, so perhaps another time. So does that mean our meeting is over for today?”</p>

      <p>I could almost see him backing away from the minefield. His danger detection skills were something I could learn from, actually. Once more, I was reminded of how talented Veryard was.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">So the meeting was at a natural ending point, but I recalled that I had one more thing to say.</p>

      <p>“Oh, right! So Testarossa sent me a message that Masayuki, the new emperor over in the east, wanted to build a peaceful relationship with the west. He’s sent a request to join the Council of the West, but what do you think?”</p>

      <p>I had received this Thought Communication just before I came here. I was pretty casual with the moves, but most of the attendees froze, startled.</p>

      <p>“““…What?”””</p>

      <p>All of them turned toward me, their eyes shrunk to little dots. The only unsurprised people in the hall were Gazel, Yohm, Mjöllmile, and Cien, all of whom I gave advance word to. I hadn’t even told King Doram yet, so he was just as astonished as Veryard. I almost never see Veryard look shocked, so I got a bit of secret enjoyment out of that. Still, it seems my statement was more of a bombshell than I expected.</p>

      <p>“I heard nothing about this!”</p>

      <p>“Well, no, I just told you, so…”</p>

      <p>“Were you aware, King Gazel?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I had received word about it, but I don’t know any details…and I <em>certainly</em> didn’t know that talks had proceeded <em>this</em> far.”</p>

      <p>Wait, I thought Gazel knew all that stuff…?</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>No, we had discussions along the lines of “Wouldn’t it be nice if this happened?” but we had not gone over any dates or other specifics.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1"><a id="page-194"></a>Oh. Yeah, maybe not. I know the timing was a little tough, but I really should’ve contacted him via our cell phones to say something. I figured I’d clue him in today since we had this meeting and all, but I didn’t quite make it to him beforehand, so this was the first notice for a lot of people.</p>

      <p>“Did you not know either, Yohm?”</p>

      <p>“Not a bit, no.”</p>

      <p>“So why weren’t you surprised at all?”</p>

      <p>“Well, if I let every little thing the boss did surprise me, I’d have died of a heart attack long ago.”</p>

      <p>I didn’t much appreciate being openly dissed like this. Mjurran, listening from Yohm’s side, had a hand on her forehead—but she was staying quiet, which I’ll take to mean she agreed with him. These stares from everyone started to feel excruciating.</p>

      <p>“This is just stunning. Why do you always have to break this incredibly important news as if it were nothing?”</p>

      <p>Hinata’s gaze stung particularly hard.</p>

      <p>“W-well, I deeply apologize, madam, but…um…”</p>

      <p>I don’t know why I was calling her “madam” all of a sudden. Must be the nerves. But is this really my fault? Like, I was so preoccupied with this war against Michael that I kind of assumed that the Eastern Empire would generally cooperate with us. Tempest is providing all kinds of support to them, too, so we can all be on the same page here. Wasn’t it kind of a given that it’d work out like this? I didn’t expect so much surprise.</p>

      <p>“Because you don’t seem too remorseful about it.”</p>

      <p><em>Oof…</em></p>

      <p>“W-wait a minute, Hinata! You know that Tempest and the Empire were at war, right? And we won, so now we’re exercising our rights and building a peaceful relationship with them. And now that <em>that’s</em> underway, it’s a given they’ll want to reconcile with the West, too, isn’t it?”</p>

      <p>I was laying on the excuses as thick as I could. But Hinata never stopped glaring at me. Which—well, I’m not in the wrong or anything, but not telling anyone might’ve been a bad mistake. It’s not <a id="page-195"></a>like I had no way to communicate with them all, and being busy wasn’t much of an excuse. Maybe this was my fault as well. I was about to say sorry, but then Veryard nodded deeply and lent a hand.</p>

      <p>“You’re absolutely right. This is not Sir Rimuru’s fault…but rather ours, for failing to ask him to take such measures.”</p>

      <p>Wow. You really get me, Veryard! What a smart guy. I couldn’t ask for a more reliable ally here.</p>

      <p>He and Hinata glared at each other. The latter broke first.</p>

      <p>“Well, yes, I suppose. Think about it a little, and it’s clear Rimuru would’ve done what he thought was best. But…”</p>

      <p>“But?”</p>

      <p>“But as someone living in the West, it’s pretty hard to believe that the Empire, our enemy since prehistoric times, would take a step like this. We had so many preconceptions about our relationship with them that, well, we never saw this coming.”</p>

      <p>She sounded frustrated about it. And I get it, for sure. This great power, hostile against you for so long, suddenly asking for a peace deal. It’s something anyone should be skeptical about at first, but the fact that I, the winner of our war, was giving the news was proving to be quite persuasive. If all we’re trying to do is build a cooperative relationship, that wouldn’t be any major risk to take. And what would be more foolish than humans squabbling with each other when a war threatening their survival could break out?</p>

      <p>“Lord Rimuru, if I could ask you…”</p>

      <p>“Yes?”</p>

      <p>I turned toward Leicester, the chairman.</p>

      <p>“I’d like to know where these potential talks with the Empire might be taking place. Also, you called the emperor ‘Masayuki’ just now, but are you referring to Lightspeed Masayuki?”</p>

      <p>The concept clearly excited him. The second question caused more of a stir than the first, making me realize that I perhaps didn’t explain myself well enough.</p>

      <p>“Umm, well, the meeting will be held in the kingdom of Englesia. They would like to hold it quite soon if possible, so they might be able to attend the next regular Council meeting. And to answer your second question—yes, Chairman, you are correct. Masayuki, <a id="page-196"></a>the Hero and also my personal friend, was recently crowned Emperor.”</p>

      <p>The moment I said it, the conference hall erupted in applause.</p>

      <p>“Brilliant! I’d expect nothing less of Sir Masayuki!”</p>

      <p>“Such wonderful news! Now we’re sure to have averted a war!”</p>

      <p>“I have no idea how such a thing happened…but with Sir Masayuki, anything truly <em>is</em> possible!”</p>

      <p>“Exactly! Even that evil Empire was no threat to the Hero!!”</p>

      <p>So, yeah, pretty big deal.</p>

      <p>“I had heard reports that a new Emperor was crowned, but I had no idea it was <em>the</em> Sir Masayuki…”</p>

      <p>Chairman Leicester was almost in tears as he spoke. To be honest, I didn’t expect this reaction. Now I was wondering if I had done something bad to Masayuki, actually. I mean, this unassuming teen coming to grips with his abilities and ultimately overthrowing the malicious Empire… Don’t tell me they’ll make a sci-fi movie trilogy about <em>him</em> next? I mean, in what universe can a single person take down an entire country? The fact that these people believe all that really happened shows just how much faith they must have in Masayuki. But what can I do? It’s all true, so…</p>

      <p>“Well…yeah. I don’t know all the details myself, so you’ll have to ask him when you get the chance.”</p>

      <p>I tried to keep it casual as I threw all responsibility over to Masayuki, whether he knew it or not.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">So, in addition to sharing plans for implementing the evacuation drills we proposed, we decided that the new Emperor would be invited to sit in the next Council of the West session.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">…And, yeah, that’s what’s been happening the past five months. Maybe some minor mishaps here and there, but overall, the prep work’s been going pretty steadily.</p>

      <p>The next Council meeting will be held in Englesia in two weeks, and Masayuki had already built a pretty good consensus with the <a id="page-197"></a>top councilors. The Empire’s admission into the Western Nations was already all but set in stone, and I felt safe entrusting Testarossa with the details.</p>

      <p>On the surface, at least, all of humankind was now united under a single mission. The demon lords were all fully prepared. All we could do now is hope that the enemy force wasn’t stronger than we expected…</p>

      <p>But as I thought over this, I received a sudden contact from Deeno.</p>

      <p>(Uh, hey, it’s Deeno. Can you hear me?)</p>

      <p>(Of course I can. Any moves?)</p>
