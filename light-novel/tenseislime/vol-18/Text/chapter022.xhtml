      <p class="noindent"><a id="page-201"></a>Back when Kagali was dragged away from the battlefield by Feldway several months ago, she lost consciousness at the same time Lieutenant Kondo breathed his last in the fight—the result of his rule over her being snapped. But when she came to, she found herself in a world she had no knowledge of.</p>

      <p><em>What’s going on…?</em></p>

      <p>She attempted to grasp the situation. Then she found a familiar face near her.</p>

      <p>“Deeno…”</p>

      <p>“Yo! Looks like you’re up, huh, Kazalim? Guess that guy Kondo is dead, then.”</p>

      <p>“Y-you noticed I was… Oh. I’m sure the boss told you.”</p>

      <p>Deeno using the name she abandoned surprised Kagali, but as her eyes focused more, she discovered Yuuki, lazily sitting on a chair and looking like he wasn’t even there. He, much like Kagali, had been placed under the rule of someone. And when Kagali realized this, she instantly determined that it wouldn’t be strange at all if Yuuki revealed her identity to the world.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, kind of. I dunno exactly what happened to you, but honestly, I like how you look now a lot better.”</p>

      <p>Kagali looked nothing at all like the demon lord Kazalim, and Deeno wasn’t afraid to say it out loud.</p>

      <p><a id="page-202"></a><em>As detached as ever… I can never read him.</em></p>

      <p>She began to relax a bit. To be honest, she didn’t have nearly enough fighting force at the moment. She’d merit an over-A rank, yes, but in the eyes of <em>true</em> monsters, she was just a face in the crowd. Deeno’s powers were unknown, but she knew she didn’t stand a chance. So Kagali pursued her best option at the moment—intelligence gathering.</p>

      <p>“So where am I?”</p>

      <p>Deeno scowled. “You know it’s not your own world, right? This is kind of a special place. It’s right next to every world out there, but it’s isolated from them, too. The origin point. We call it the Celestial Palace.”</p>

      <p>It wasn’t a familiar name. But a few keywords stood out to her.</p>

      <p><em>The origin point…? Not the place where Veldanava the Star-King Dragon was born…?!</em></p>

      <p>The origin point—the place that existed even before all the worlds were created. A folktale, recorded only within mythology. It was claimed to exist, but nobody had ever seen it before.</p>

      <p>“How…?”</p>

      <p>“You need a key to go through the gate leading to here, but I didn’t know what that key was, either. But now that I’ve been taken here, I know how it works. Can’t tell you, but…”</p>

      <p>That annoyed Kagali. But then she recalled that Deeno hated to do anything he deemed unnecessary. If he wasn’t going to tell her, then Kagali could do nothing to make him.</p>

      <p>It was time to ask something else.</p>

      <p>“Well, I won’t force you, so if you can just tell me what you’re able to…”</p>

      <p>“…Ugh, what a pain.”</p>

      <p>“We’ve known each other a long time now. You could do at least that much for me.”</p>

      <p>“Tsk. Not that <em>I</em> get anything out of it.”</p>

      <p>“I seem to remember doing a lot of work for you…”</p>

      <p>Before Kagali could finish, Deeno had straightened up. “What do you wanna ask me? And when you do, you’ll forget about the past for me, won’t you?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-203"></a>“Yes, of course I will.”</p>

      <p>Kagali smiled. Deeno was the same as ever. That was a relief, despite how confusing everything else was at the moment.</p>

      <p>“So our boss—I mean Yuuki Kagurazaka there—why is he still being mind-controlled by someone? You said earlier that Kondo was dead, but… Wait! You don’t mean…”</p>

      <p>“…You really <em>are</em> quick on the uptake, aren’t you? I think you got it right, so I’ll say it. You were being controlled by Kondo, but Yuuki over there was being controlled by the guy who lent that skill to Kondo.”</p>

      <p>“I knew it…”</p>

      <p>She didn’t want to believe it—the fact that someone out there could actually lend the power of mind control to other people. But Deeno wasn’t a liar that way. If he didn’t want to admit to something, he’d just keep his mouth shut. And that made it seem all the more truthful.</p>

      <p>Yuuki was being controlled. Despite having this one-of-a-kind super-body that canceled out all skills, there was something that could break through that. It was nothing short of terrifying. Kagali wanted to restore Yuuki to normal so she could get out of here, but she had no idea how. And if that’s how it was…</p>

      <p>“Where are my beautiful children?”</p>

      <p>“You mean the guys standing behind you?”</p>

      <p>Kagali quickly turned around. She hadn’t detected anyone there before, and she couldn’t have, for that matter.</p>

      <p><em>Oh. So they’ve gone into killing mode. Following only my orders, no one else’s…</em></p>

      <p>She chided herself for being in such a panic, despite her intentions otherwise. She canceled the order, bringing Teare and Footman back to normal. There were also around nine unfamiliar-looking walking dead standing in line with them, but Kagali gave them no notice.</p>

      <p>But she did have some vague memories of back when her mind was being controlled. She recalled using the forbidden curse Dead Birthday as commanded, so these walking dead must’ve been created at that time. But she felt no personal attachment to them. She never intended to create them, after all.</p>

      <p><a id="page-204"></a>“Oh! Hey, President! You’re okay, huh? I was real worried!”</p>

      <p>“Hohhh-hoh-hoh-hoh! I firmly agree with Teare, President. Did the boss save us?”</p>

      <p>“No, he didn’t. And there’s no point hiding it, so I’ll just say that we’re…in a terrible situation.”</p>

      <p>She told the two of them what was going on. Deeno had fallen asleep, not minding being ignored at all.</p>

      <p>“Wow… Guess we didn’t live up to expectations, huh?”</p>

      <p>“Of course you did, Teare. Even the boss had his mind controlled. I’m sure there was nothing we could’ve done to resist it.”</p>

      <p>“So now what’ll we do?” Footman asked. “Are we just gonna go along with it?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah,” added Teare, “can’t we just escape? I don’t see any guards.”</p>

      <p>“That’s the problem,” Kagali darkly responded. “I’d like to escape, of course, but I guess we’re in this Celestial Palace on another world. Magic won’t get us out.”</p>

      <p>Kagali had already tried out the elemental magic Warp Portal long ago. If it showed any sign of working, she was ready to leave, taking Teare, Footman, and Yuuki with her. But since she had no idea of her current coordinates, she had no way to activate the spell.</p>

      <p><em>Luckily, the thrall on me was broken…but whoever did it knew that regaining my senses wouldn’t let me do anything…</em></p>

      <p>It was agonizing but it was the truth. Nobody was guarding them, no—but that’s only because nobody thought Kagali and his companions could escape.</p>

      <p>“Deeno?”</p>

      <p>“H-hey. What’s up? I was trying to enjoy a nap here. Got another question?”</p>

      <p>“I doubt you’ll answer this one, but is there any way to get out of this place?”</p>

      <p>“You think there is?”</p>

      <p>“…No.”</p>

      <p>“Right? I always appreciated how sharp you were like that. So, yeah, better stop wasting your time and start behaving yourself, y’know?”</p>

      <p>She saw that coming. But now Kagali was truly stuck.</p>

      <p><a id="page-205"></a>The Celestial Palace was a very small, very flat world. It existed within a single sphere: the lower half earth and the top half the sky. It was perfectly level and around forty square miles in size, its climate mild with no seasonal fluctuation, and in the middle of it was a beautiful white castle. But that was everything. No flowers withered on it, no fruit rotted on the branch, no water was tainted, and the earth was never parched. The fields of flowers were always in full bloom, and what trees there were always bore the tastiest, sweetest-smelling fruit. It felt like time had stopped there, such was the complete lack of change.</p>

      <p>Kagali and the rest were held in a small, square structure set up for them in the middle of a garden. The whole of the castle was visible from there, and if they turned around, they could see a huge gate on the edge of the world. There was never any sign of anyone leaving the castle, but as long as the gates remained closed, there seemed to be no way out from here.</p>

      <p>So Kagali, undeterred by Deeno’s reply, calmly thought about what to do. But then someone came out from the castle to bother her.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="tx1">He was a man with a stout, muscular physique and a face that seemed to know no fear. His entire body seemed to course with pure spirit, hinting at the exceptional strength he had.</p>

      <p>“We can’t have you here, Sir Deeno. Someone of <em>your</em> stature shouldn’t be so familiar with these people.”</p>

      <p>The man looked down on Kagali, seeing no reason not to. <em>Who is this guy?</em> thought an annoyed Kagali, but for now she put up with this treatment. She was always cautious that way.</p>

      <p>“You were…Gnohm, right? Looks like you successfully installed yourself in that body, huh?”</p>

      <p>“That I did! This man Vega’s body was the perfect catalyst for me. He regenerates quickly, and at this rate, I think everyone will succeed in their incarnations, Sir Dhalis included.”</p>

      <p>“Great,” murmured a disinterested Deeno. Kagali, following none of this, silently listened on. Vega—or Vega the Power, as he <a id="page-206"></a>was called—was one of the three leaders of Cerberus. This had to be him, she thought. Her faint memories included a couple of scenes of him joining her on the way here.</p>

      <p><em>Vega…a “catalyst”? Was he a vessel for one of these guys to take physical form in? It’s possible, yes. This man has inherited the blood of a magical inquisitor, one of the greatest results of Rozzo’s research. He’s a freak of nature bearing both human and monster traits. And as long as he’s kept fed, he can recover from any injury, no matter how brutal.</em></p>

      <p>If his arms were cut off, they’d simply grow back. In fact, their experiments proved that even if only the head remained, the rest of the body could still regenerate itself. But the horrors only began there: Any part that was chopped off the main body would attempt to regenerate into a mindless monster. That was why Yuuki had given Vega strict orders to bring his limbs back if any got sliced off.</p>

      <p>This Gnohm person must have taken advantage of this unique trait of Vega’s to obtain an empty, soulless body of his.</p>

      <p><em>But why does he need a body in the first place? Who is he anyway? A demon, if he needs to procure a physical form like this? No… From this divine presence, he must be an angel. In which case, this would be a far more powerful vessel than any human or monster…</em></p>

      <p>Kagali’s thoughts raced. She had lost the majority of her fighting power, but her brain was alive and well.</p>

      <p>Already, she had a rough conclusion. This man Gnohm was an angel—or some similar spiritual life-form—and he was brought into physical existence to invade other worlds. Vega was being used as a catalyst in order to create physical bodies for these angels. He was alive, chances are, but not in any position to act.</p>

      <p>And she was correct on all this—except that Gnohm was actually a mystic. By fusing his body with Vega’s cells, he had performed a magicule-fueled transformation of their temporary bodies, strengthening them immensely. That allowed Gnohm and his ilk to take in the component matter, triggering a complete physical incarnation.</p>

      <p>This component matter was proteins and carbohydrates recovered from the ground. To put it in less scientific terms, all they had to do was eat to build their physical bodies. It was different from the <a id="page-207"></a>“walking dead” method, but it was more convenient for mystics like Gnohm, as they were only demi-spiritual life-forms.</p>

      <p>Gnohm, by the way, was one of the mystics working directly under Zarario. He was stationed back at home while his kin attacked Ramiris’s labyrinth, so he was there when Feldway returned with Vega and the others, allowing him to attain this body. Zarario’s team came back a bit later on, just in time to meet up with Deeno and the others. Gnohm was the first to complete his incarnation, as he was the test case for others to follow; that was why he was still alone for the time being.</p>

      <p>Once a thronus, he was now a “general”-rank mystic, placing him on the lower end of the upper classes. With his incarnation, he now had access to more power than a demon lord seed. And from his perspective, Kagali—not much different from a human—was nothing more than a pile of trash. That’s why he had no qualms about acting superior to her.</p>

      <p>“Kagali, you should know that you are nothing more than a tool for increasing our strength,” said Gnohm. “Kondo was a somewhat useful tool to us, and perhaps you’ve regained your free will after his death, but don’t let that fool you. Sir Deeno over there is on a far higher level than any of you!”</p>

      <p>“Whoa, whoa, that’s enough.”</p>

      <p>“No, Sir Deeno! You are one of the great Seven Primordial Angels, are you not? Talking so casually with these lowly people… You are offering far too much mercy to them!”</p>

      <p>“I told you, Kazalim and I are old acquaintances.”</p>

      <p>“My name’s Kagali now. Could you call me that going forward?”</p>

      <p>“…Normally I’d say, ‘No way, that’s a pain in the ass,’ but Kagali <em>is</em> shorter. Let’s go with that.”</p>

      <p>Kagali was now a beautiful woman, not at all like before. The name seemed to match as well, so Deeno didn’t put up much resistance.</p>

      <p>There they were, ignoring Gnohm while having a friendly conversation. It annoyed Gnohm greatly. His master was a former cherub given the name Dhalis, a noble figure gifted in combat who served as Zarario’s second-in-command. Not even Dhalis, however, could compete against the supreme beings known as the Primordial Angels.</p>

      <p><a id="page-208"></a>Much like Gnohm and the rest, his name was not acquired just recently. As apostles created and named by Veldanava himself, they had served as great seraphim, attacking and destroying the evil demons of the world since their creation. From Gnohm’s point of view, they were as good as gods.</p>

      <p>Kagali’s attitude was therefore unacceptable. <em>Deeno might have allowed it, but letting this behavior go unchecked would affect Zarario’s status as well</em>, Gnohm thought. It was time to force the issue.</p>

      <p>“I told you to stop getting carried away!!”</p>

      <p>Kagali, sitting on a chair, was hit with a bolt of heavenly light—a high-speed mass of spiritual energy. Deeno didn’t move. He didn’t need to.</p>

      <p>“Hohhhh-hoh-hoh-hoh! Are we done talking now? You know, the only one being rude right now is you!”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, he’s right! Let’s do it, Footman!”</p>

      <p>So Kagali’s valued friends, her ever-faithful clowns, stood up against Gnohm with all their might.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">The battle was as fierce as it was one-sided. Gnohm was a war-tested mystic under Zarario’s command, with experience in multiple battles against the insectors. He had only just obtained physical form, but he felt perfectly comfortable with it—in fact, it felt like an upgrade in fighting ability for him. His existence points exceeded one million, and his magicule count was expanding even now, filling in his empty body.</p>

      <p>He couldn’t have been in better shape, and here he was pitted against Footman, someone better in combat than the Clayman of old. He wasn’t gifted with intelligence, but his sheer power was unmatched, earning him an EP of 1.3 million. Now that all restrictions were removed from his behavior, he was demonstrating force nobody could’ve imagined back during his fight against Geld.</p>

      <p>“Boooom!” Footman shouted as he punched Gnohm.</p>

      <p>“Gahhh?!”</p>

      <p>Gnohm was sent flying, his face caved in.</p>

      <p><a id="page-209"></a>“Hoh-hoh-hoh! Let’s keep it going!”</p>

      <p>He was no longer a threat to Footman, who kept punching, and punching, and punching. He grabbed him by the legs, swinging him around and throwing him into the air—then followed him upward, using the rebound to build his momentum as he plunged like a cannonball into Gnohm’s back.</p>

      <p>“Grrph…”</p>

      <p>Then he grabbed Gnohm, slamming him into the ground. The force, enlarged by Footman’s pressure on his back, was enough to shatter the earth underneath. Footman wasn’t smart, but he had a brilliant sense for fighting. With the cells from Vega’s body in him, Gnohm would be able to regenerate just fine, no matter how battered and shredded he became. Footman instinctively realized the pointlessness of a normal approach, so he instead opted for a style designed to build up damage and rob him of his stamina.</p>

      <p>Gnohm, meanwhile, was puzzled. This Footman was far stronger than he imagined. <em>Y-you’re kidding me! How can I, a general in the mystic force, be so inferior to this complete unknown?!</em></p>

      <p>Acquiring a body had greatly enhanced his fighting ability…and he was still being dominated. It was bewildering.</p>

      <p>“What…what <em>are</em> you…?!”</p>

      <p>“Me? I’m Footman. Footman the Angry Jester, part of the Moderate Jesters. Good to meet you!”</p>

      <p>He gave Gnohm a condescending bow. He was totally relaxed, rankling his opponent. Then Teare came in with the follow-up.</p>

      <p>“Hey, I’ll give my name, too! I’m Teare. Teare the Teardrop Jester, from the Moderate Jesters! And once Footman is done, you better play with me, too!”</p>

      <p>Her voice was cutesy and lilting, but it couldn’t hide her evil intentions. She wasn’t as strong as Footman, but she was still a menace. Her EP was over a million, and her unique skill was one nefarious finisher. For now, she wouldn’t make any moves—but if Footman was defeated, that was when she’d head into the fray. She watched on, waiting eagerly for that moment.</p>

      <p>Footman’s onslaught began anew. Punching, kicking, slamming, he continued to torment Gnohm, like a cat chasing a mouse. <a id="page-210"></a>Gnohm was growing panicked; Footman and Teare laughed jovially; and Kagali, watching all this, calmly analyzed the situation.</p>

      <p><em>This is awful. At this rate, we have no future here. Even if we win this battle, this Gnohm guy is still just an underling. I know Teare’s here for me, but I don’t think there’s much we can do.</em></p>

      <p>Kagali took a glance at Yuuki.</p>

      <p><em>And I doubt Teare could win against someone that Sir Yuuki couldn’t…</em></p>

      <p>Angels and demons can’t be physically destroyed in the first place. If they had the right skill, it’d be a different story—but even if they killed Gnohm here, he’d be revived soon enough. The moment Vega’s cells were incorporated in his body, it became all but physically impossible for him to die. And if he was likely to come back good as new anyway, this whole battle seemed pointless.</p>

      <p>Defeat, in the end, was guaranteed. Kagali, knowing this, began to feel like a fool.</p>

      <p>“Stop it, Footman. That’s enough playing.”</p>

      <p>“Hoh? Are you sure, President?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. We can’t escape from here regardless. Maybe we can if we could destroy that big gate, but I just don’t see a way.”</p>

      <p>If Deeno could be believed, this Celestial Palace was a closed world. Some sort of key was required to pass through the gate, and Kagali had no way of acquiring it. They were at a dead end.</p>

      <p>Gnohm laughed loudly. “Ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! That’s right—and if you understand that, it saves us all a lot of time. All you gotta do is work as hard as you can for us—all right, you tool? Do that, and I’ll treat you as well as any capable servant deserves.”</p>

      <p>Footman had stopped moving, and Gnohm knew what that meant. Failing to defeat this adversary was beyond unexpected, but Kagali, his master, was an intelligent woman. As long as Kagali was under their control, Footman and Teare were just puppets, no threat to Gnohm’s authority at all.</p>

      <p>Thinking that helped Gnohm regain his composure. But the next moment, he was frightened by the overwhelming presence of death that wrapped around him.</p>

      <p>“It pains me to see this state of affairs, Gnohm. It was a mistake to ever grant you a name.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-211"></a>At some point, the large gate had opened, revealing three figures. One of them was an outstanding beauty, with long, jet-black hair that seemed to be studded with stars from the night sky. It was Zarario, head of the Three Mystic Leaders.</p>

      <p>He had returned home, keeping his presence hidden as he watched Gnohm speak and fight. The sheer ineptitude he showed was a staggering disappointment.</p>

      <p>Pico and Garasha, his companions, began to walk toward Deeno.</p>

      <p>“Hey, guys. Wrapped up your work?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. We come in, tired from a long day’s work, and you guys are fighting?”</p>

      <p>“Hey, what’s going on?”</p>

      <p>“It’s just like what you see,” Deeno said in a hushed voice, shrugging. Sensing he was in no mood to explain matters, Pico and Garasha turned their attention to Gnohm.</p>

      <p>“S-Sir Zarario?!”</p>

      <p>“Keep my name out of your mouth.”</p>

      <p>“N-no! Please, wait, this is all a misunderstanding—”</p>

      <p>“You are mistaken. Everything I say is justice. It is right. There is no such thing as a misunderstanding.”</p>

      <p>“B-but…”</p>

      <p>Agreeing with him would be admitting his mistake. Denying it would be an act of open hostility toward Zarario. Gnohm was instantly in the greatest crisis of his life, and he couldn’t think of a way out.</p>

      <p>“Compared to you—no, it’d be rude to even do that. She may be one of Feldway’s pickups, but even <em>she</em> is far more useful to me.”</p>

      <p>Zarario’s words were plain, without a hint of emotional wavering. Gnohm still sensed something ominous in them. “Please, wait!” he shouted frantically…but it was too late. Zarario was a noble man, and he had no time for fools.</p>

      <p>“You have committed the crime of misjudging your own worth. In light of the many years you’ve served me, I will forgive you—but only by erasing your personality.”</p>

      <p>So came the cruel verdict.</p>

      <p><em>Erase his personality?!</em></p>
