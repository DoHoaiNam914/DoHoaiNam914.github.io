      <p class="tx1">They moved the conversation into a temporary reception room. After another greeting, Obela gave Milim a detailed account of current happenings.</p>

      <p>Hearing that Velgrynd the Flame Dragon, her aunt, had fallen into the hands of Feldway made Milim want to fly off to assist Rimuru that very moment…but Obela warned against it, stating that any attempt at this point would come far too late.</p>

      <p>“What are you talking about? At this rate, my top pal Rimuru’s gonna be—”</p>

      <p>“I am telling you: It is too late now.”</p>

      <p>Obela’s response had Milim livid. “Then why didn’t you come to me sooner?!”</p>

      <p>“I’m afraid I have no excuse, Lady Milim.”</p>

      <p>Obela bowed her head at the fuming Milim, too polite to explain away her behavior. She was a servant of the Mystic Lord Feldway, and right now she was under orders to defend his Mystic Palace. Going off to meet with Milim was a serious dereliction of duty, and she could have said as much—but no, Obela was simply ashamed of herself for failing to live up to Milim’s expectations. Seeing that, Milim was forced to calm herself down.</p>

      <p>“All right. Perhaps that was asking too much. I appreciate you telling me, at least.”</p>

      <p>“It is a great relief to hear those words from you,” Obela said, bowing her head in reverence. There was no sign that she was lying. Milim had a knack for reading the subtle signs people gave out, and looking at Obela, she decided she was acting out of pure sincerity.</p>

      <p>“Rimuru may not look it, but he’s a pretty cautious guy,” Milim told her. “I firmly believe he can make it through anything that comes his way, no matter what. That’s how much I trust him.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

      <p>“So if you claim not to be my enemy, you’d better <em>not</em> lay a hand on him.”</p>

      <p>“I…would like to offer you my promise on that front, but I’m afraid I am not in a position to act in public. For now, I believe it <a id="page-7"></a>best to act only when I have Feldway’s trust in the matter…but what do you say to that?”</p>

      <p>If Feldway ordered Obela to do something, she intended to obey. But as she was not-so-subtly hinting, she was leaving the option of severing ties with Feldway on the table. The stars in her eyes shone around her night-sky hair.</p>

      <p>“Hmm. You don’t seem to be lying,” Milim said.</p>

      <p>“It is all the truth, I assure you, based on my own feelings.”</p>

      <p>“Let me ask you, then: What are your goals?”</p>

      <p>“Feldway,” Obela replied without a moment of wavering, “seems intent on trying to revive Lord Veldanava, but I feel this behavior is both arrogant and quite out of line. Your divine father, after all, will surely revive himself at some point without anyone else’s assistance. If this resurrection is not so easily forthcoming, there must be a reason for it, and someone like me is hardly in a position to guess at the will of such divinity…”</p>

      <p>In summation, instead of trying to resurrect Veldanava, Obela believed that Milim, his own daughter, should be their right and exalted master.</p>

      <p>“So you’ll be my ally?”</p>

      <p>“Someone as infinitely small as I would never dream of having such conceited thoughts. I have nothing I wish to take from you; merely being of service would be an indescribable joy to me. Please, give me your direction.”</p>

      <p>It was all up to Milim. That was what Obela truly wanted. And Milim understood that, but something about Obela’s sheer resolve bothered her.</p>

      <p>“All right. You’re not afraid to betray Feldway, then?”</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee! I think there is a difference in perspectives at play here. If anything, one could say that it is Feldway who’s defying the will of Lord Veldanava.”</p>

      <p>There was not the slightest sign of indecision in Obela’s voice, proving once again that she meant every word.</p>

      <p>“I believe that Lord Veldanava’s will is more interested in the happiness of you, his daughter. I am firm in that belief, and thus I have no pity for those who may attempt to obstruct you.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-8"></a>This was about much more than “betraying” anyone. Obela thought that Feldway’s behavior would cause harm to Milim, and whether she worked for him or not, she was nothing but an enemy to him. But Obela was smart, too. She wasn’t acting entirely on her own decisions—she was ready to leave all of that to Milim, and she was taking great pains to ensure none of what she did got in Milim’s way. That was why she was taking such a great risk just to meet with her. If Milim didn’t want her to do anything, she wouldn’t; if she gave her the order, though, Obela would strike hard against anybody out there. Such was the will of the former Mystic Leader, and Milim wasn’t blind to it.</p>

      <p>“Very well. In that case, I’ll add you to my team. Any objections, Middray?”</p>

      <p>“Of course not, Lady Milim. I would never have anything to object about.”</p>

      <p>“Good! Obela, from this day on, you’re on <em>my</em> side. They’re not here right now, but once the war is over, I’ll introduce you to Carillon and Frey!”</p>

      <p>“Thank you.”</p>

      <p>“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Now I’ve got my <em>own</em> Big Four, counting Middray as the leader. Can’t wait to brag about this to Rimuru!”</p>

      <p>Milim laughed heartily to herself. She had always been secretly jealous of Rimuru’s Big Four, and now she could call her own underlings something similar. If Frey were here, she’d almost certainly stop this nonsense in its tracks, but—fortunately for Milim—only Middray was around at the moment.</p>

      <p>“I’m the <em>leader</em>? Well, I suppose I am, yes. You won’t find anyone out there who knows as much about you as me, Lady Milim!” he said.</p>

      <p>Milim already meant everything to Middray, but now that she gave him the title of Big Four leader, he wouldn’t dream of objecting to it. In fact, he gleefully agreed to the idea. Now there was a rival Big Four in town.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Despite being named part of the Big Four, Obela accepted the news without any major agitation. Milim’s words, as far as Obela was <a id="page-9"></a>concerned, were the will of God, and thus she made Milim her first priority at all times. But this also led to a thorny problem.</p>

      <p>“So, with that in mind, the question becomes what we’ll <em>do</em> with Obela,” Milim said to Middray. “This is exactly the kinda time when I’d want to talk things over with Rimuru…”</p>

      <p>“Mm, indeed, a tough issue. Should we leave her here, or have her retain her position and serve as a spy for us?”</p>

      <p>Both had their pluses and minuses. They really needed to devote serious thought to it, taking in feedback from Carillon and Frey—and Rimuru, too, if it was possible.</p>

      <p>“But what do <em>you</em> want to do, Obela?”</p>

      <p>Middray, never exactly intellectual in nature, wasn’t suited for this kind of discussion. Milim knew that well, so she just asked Obela directly instead of going through him.</p>

      <p>“Personally,” Obela replied in her clear voice, “I wish to return to the Mystic Palace one more time. I have not manifested my true body here right now, so remaining here would require moving my physical form over, which would be a challenge. Also…”</p>

      <p>Obela’s job was to take care of the cryptids in their own world—or, really, her biggest task was keeping tabs on Ivalage, the World-Destroyer Dragon. Cornu was heading their invasion efforts into other dimensions, and Zarario was involved with handling the insectors. With a pact now in place between the Mystic Lord Feldway and the Insect Lord Zeranus, Zarario had a lot more freedom of movement—but any type of communication with Ivalage was a difficult task, which meant Obela’s main physical body was somewhat bound in place by her duties.</p>

      <p>“The Insect Lord and the World-Destroyer Dragon? Wow! They sound strong!”</p>

      <p>“They are. Zeranus I cannot comment on, but Ivalage is quite a menace. Call it a living desire to destroy all worlds. Attempting to live alongside it is impossible. It had been allowed to keep existing by Lord Veldanava, but only if it is ‘sealed away’ in the world it is in now. Any attempt to release it must be stopped at once.”</p>

      <p>If Obela stayed here with Milim, she wouldn’t be able to keep as close an eye on Ivalage. Her hope was to watch over Ivalage to the end, so it wouldn’t have any impact on Feldway’s plans.</p>

      <p><a id="page-10"></a>“I see,” said Milim. “I guess you better keep watching it, then.”</p>

      <p>“As you wish.”</p>

      <p>“But now this talk is making me wonder just what Feldway wants to <em>do</em> with Ivalage, y’know?”</p>

      <p>“I was wondering the same thing,” said Middray. The question was understandable. Neither of them knew of Feldway’s plans. So Obela decided to divulge everything she knew.</p>

      <p>“Feldway, you see, was given the duty to monitor Ivalage from Lord Veldanava himself. However, he intends to abandon that duty and prioritize Lord Veldanava’s resurrection instead. He has built an Underworld Gate to that effect and is currently trying to expand it to the needed size. Once complete, he plans to send all the mystics and insectors over to this ‘key world’ in order to stage an invasion.”</p>

      <p>“Expanding an Underworld Gate? That’s gonna be a long time coming.”</p>

      <p>“Indeed.”</p>

      <p>“But what’s he gonna do after that? If he doesn’t close that gate after opening it, won’t it release Ivalage as well?”</p>

      <p>“That is certainly a possibility, and I have informed Feldway of it. But he was not at all concerned. Honestly, I have no idea what he is thinking.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm?”</p>

      <p>“Feldway, I fear, has gone insane. All he cares about is reviving Lord Veldanava. I’m almost convinced he doesn’t care if he destroys the entire world in the process.”</p>

      <p>Feldway hated this world, the one that took Veldanava from him. He intended to create a brand-new one, filled solely with his handpicked inhabitants—and if Ivalage was capable of destroying worlds, well, that worked for him.</p>

      <p>“Great. So when that happens, it’s <em>us</em> who’s gonna have to deal with it, huh?”</p>

      <p>“What a tremendous hassle! Zeranus sounds like enough trouble alone, too. Why can’t they just stay sealed away over in that other world?”</p>

      <p>Milim and Middray scowled at each other. She had a standing invite to go hang out with Rimuru and his friends, but that got delayed due <a id="page-11"></a>to the war. As if that wasn’t distressing enough, now there was <em>this</em> problem. Milim was getting more miffed by the millisecond.</p>

      <p>“At this rate, the only solution is to go up to Feldway and kick his butt.”</p>

      <p>So came Milim’s overly simplistic solution.</p>

      <p>“Quite true, Lady Milim. And as the head of your Big Four, I am ready to receive your orders and dispatch Feldway at once!”</p>

      <p>Milim meant everything to Middray. He enthusiastically agreed with her, not bothering to think anything over first.</p>

      <p>“Great! Glad I can rely on you, Middray. I’ll join you as supreme commander, too. We need to crush this Feldway guy’s ambitions, and soon!”</p>

      <p>“Yes, my lady! I’m so excited, my muscles are tingling already! You will have a remarkable sight once I’m on the battlefield!”</p>

      <p>Without Frey around, there was nobody to stop the pair from going off the rails. But Obela still saw fit to speak up.</p>

      <p>“One moment, please. I have been sharing information with Feldway and his team since the start of this operation, but from what I know, the emperor Ludora had taken Lady Velgrynd’s draconic factors and made them his own. However, at the last minute, the demon lord Rimuru intervened. A final confrontation is still in the cards for later.”</p>

      <p>She stated this strictly to calm Milim.</p>

      <p>“So Rimuru’s all right, then?”</p>

      <p>“He is. The operation is currently at a standstill, and Feldway has reportedly retreated back to his home base.”</p>

      <p>“Mm… So taking action now would be too hasty.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah… I hate to say it, Middray, but you’re right.”</p>

      <p>Middray and Milim settled back down, their momentum gone. They now had a comfortable amount of time before Feldway tackled his next plan. Instead of flying into action immediately, it was best to wait so they could fight alongside Rimuru’s forces. What mattered most of all right now was exchanging information, and Milim was sensible enough to see that.</p>

      <p>“So, Obela, I want you to look into Feldway’s movements until you receive further orders from me.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-12"></a>“As you wish, my lady.”</p>

      <p>“Use magical calls to contact me, all right?”</p>

      <p>“Very well.”</p>

      <p>Milim and Obela agreed to a wavelength only they would be able to communicate over. Crossing dimensions required a vast amount of magical force, but that was no problem for someone at their level.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Once all the related business was taken care of, the meeting came to its natural end.</p>

      <p>“In that case, I will take my leave for now.”</p>

      <p>With a final goodbye, Obela set off. And as Milim and Middray considered the potential chaos to come, they could already feel a headache making itself known.</p>
