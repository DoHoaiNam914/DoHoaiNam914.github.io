      <p><a id="page-18"></a>“I am deeply sorry,” a distressed Raine said. “I’m making so many careless mistakes…”</p>

      <p>“Nah, nah, it’s not your fault, Lady Raine,” I replied, trying to assuage her. “We were all kind of in a hurry on the way here.”</p>

      <p>“Well, I’d <em>hope</em> you were in a hurry, Rimuru. I’m the one who called you over, after all. And didn’t I tell you before that just ‘Raine’ is fine?”</p>

      <p>Oops again. I forgot.</p>

      <p>“Sir Guy is right, Sir Rimuru. My name alone will suffice.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, exactly. I feel we are on friendlier terms that way.”</p>

      <p>Guess Mizeri understood my philosophy pretty well. I refer to people in polite terms for one of two reasons—to acknowledge their superiority, or to try to keep my distance. If I drop the titles with someone I’m not close to or am wary of, it just seems rude to me. Maybe I just don’t want to be hated, either, or act hostile for no reason. On the other hand, I drop all the formalities once I’m on friendly terms with someone. Sometimes I still keep it a little formal with people like Haruna or Treyni—it’s not something I can really explain, but either way, they’re exceptions to the rule.</p>

      <p>But regardless of what was on my mind, I was snapped out of it by two surprising voices.</p>

      <p>“<em>You</em> stopped calling me ‘lady’ quite a long time ago, didn’t you, Rimuru?”</p>

      <p>“He sure did. We all know that’s how shameless you are, so there’s no need to keep up appearances now.”</p>

      <p>It was Luminus and Leon. They had a good point—enough to convince me, anyway.</p>

      <p>“All right. I’ll keep up that gesture then…with every intention of kindness, of course.”</p>

      <p>No point quibbling over it.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Mizeri and Raine were already gone, setting off to guide Milim and Daggrull over. Meanwhile, I kicked back and relaxed. There <a id="page-19"></a>were snacks on the tables, so I reached out for some to pass the time. After a little while:</p>

      <p>“What’s the meaning of this, Guy?! I’m busy with all sorts of things right now, you know. You can call for me all you want, but at least give me some advance warning! Frey called it a ‘huge breach of manners,’ too!”</p>

      <p>Milim arrived, as full of spunk as usual. Loud as usual, too, but that was just her being her.</p>

      <p>“Is that true, Frey?”</p>

      <p>“Well, yes…Sir Guy…”</p>

      <p>“Frey, I was just telling Rimuru that there’s no need for honorifics here. That includes you, Carillon, and all of you there, too. Everyone present has earned that much.”</p>

      <p>Huh. Wasn’t expecting that from Guy…but he had me convinced. Only the strongest of the strong were in this room. In terms of magicule stats, Leon’s attendants didn’t quite make the grade, but they probably had talents of their own. Frey, for that matter, had awakened to a true demon lord, putting her safely in the Million Class. Exactly <em>how</em> strong she was remained unknown, but nobody was about to look at her as a mere servant.</p>

      <p>“Well, thank you.” Frey nodded, seemingly aware of this as she looked around the room. “I will do just that, then.”</p>

      <p>“I was never good at that stuff anyway,” Carillon said to Guy with a dignified air, “so I appreciate the thought. So, Guy…what made you call us all over here?”</p>

      <p>He, too, was part of the Million Class alongside Frey. He’d always had the air of royalty for as long as I’d known him, so nobody was going to rap him for being arrogant. Besides, he waved at me when we made eye contact earlier.</p>

      <p>But Guy snickered at Carillon. “Hold your horses. Daggrull will be coming shortly, so we’ll save it for then. This is quite a surprise, though… Carillon I expected, but <em>you’ve</em> awakened, too, Frey?”</p>

      <p>Yeah, of course he’d notice. I only found out after we received the report, but now that I was seeing her in the flesh, her newfound strength made her seem like a wholly different person.</p>

      <p><a id="page-20"></a>“Yes, thank you. Perhaps it was all part of Milim’s plan, but in this most recent war, I’ve successfully transcended my limits as a harpy.” Frey smiled.</p>

      <p>“Fine news,” a satisfied Guy replied.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, well, it was kinda the same way for me,” Carillon added with a hearty laugh. “I helped us lycanthropes put all the shame behind us, too. Sometimes playing along with Milim’s schemes actually turns out all right, huh?”</p>

      <p>“Huh?! What schemes? I don’t know what you’re talking about!”</p>

      <p>“Heh. Don’t bother hiding it, Milim,” Guy scoffed. “You musta figured we’d die in some battle to come if we both remained a couple of wimps, right? That’s the whole reason why you gave us a chance to fight humans.”</p>

      <p>“Precisely,” Frey agreed. “It’s a chance we’ll lose, besides, if the world turns out the way Sir Rimuru would like it. This might be our final opportunity, for all I know.”</p>

      <p>“No doubt about it. Are we right?”</p>

      <p>“Hrm…! Well, <em>I</em> dunno anything about that stuff. Quit your yappin’ and just take your seats!”</p>

      <p>Milim was practically screaming at them—her classic way of hiding her embarrassment. So <em>that’s</em> what her aim was? Made sense. But anyway.</p>

      <p>“Um, Ms. Frey, given what we just talked about, you can skip the ‘sir’ with me.”</p>

      <p>I wanted to point that out when I had the opportunity. But Frey just sniffed at me.</p>

      <p>“Denied. You are the friend of our master Milim. I need to pay you the proper respect.”</p>

      <p><em>But you called her “Milim” in that same sentence just now… I’m not at all convinced about any of this.</em></p>

      <p>“If you’re going to bring <em>that</em> up—”</p>

      <p>“Also, if you’re going to be <em>that</em> way, can you drop that ‘Ms.’ stuff?”</p>

      <p>She beat me to the punch.</p>

      <p>Her request was kind of a tall order for me. Carillon was one thing, but I hated to call Frey straight up “Frey.” She had this kind of…<em>aura</em> I struggled with. You know? Whenever I dealt with a <a id="page-21"></a>beautiful woman like this, I couldn’t help but shrivel up. Milim was a little girl and Luminus still looked pretty young, too, so they were okay. If they acted more like adults, though, I’d be wavering a lot. Someone as asinine as Shion, on the other hand… <em>Way</em> easier to deal with.</p>

      <p>“Ah-ha-ha-ha! Don’t tell me you don’t know how to act around grown women, Rimuru!”</p>

      <p><em>He saw through me?!</em></p>

      <p>“Hey, don’t worry about it. Next time I ask ya for something, I’ll show up as a lady bombshell for ya.”</p>

      <p>Ignoring Guy’s advice, I went ahead and said what I really felt.</p>

      <p>“I don’t need <em>that</em>, thank you! You’re not exactly doing me a favor if I know it’s <em>you</em> inside anyway!”</p>

      <p>I guess the resentment building up inside made me forget about my nerves.</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee! Of course! Besides, Sir Rimuru has a beautiful secretary: me!”</p>

      <p><em>Um, why’s Shion herself saying that?</em></p>

      <p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh… The likes of <em>you</em>, Guy, trying to entice Sir Rimuru with romance—how ruthlessly narcissistic. I could learn how to transform into a woman easily as well. If Sir Rimuru wished for it—”</p>

      <p>“I don’t, so let’s drop this, okay?”</p>

      <p>Diablo was even more worrying than Shion. Let them be, and they’d start running in all these crazy directions, so I hurriedly put an end to the conversation. My staff was <em>so</em> hard to wrangle sometimes. I began to regret not bringing Benimaru along a little.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">As we engaged in this friendly bickering, Daggrull arrived. He came alone, but even by himself, he dominated the room.</p>

      <p>“Whoa, whoa, this place is lookin’ awful. It’s <em>that</em> kind of meeting this time, huh?”</p>

      <p>That was how he chose to greet everyone before thunking down on the large chair Raine showed him. It was a heavy one, made of thick stone slabs, but I thought I could almost <em>see</em> it sag under his weight. Hilarious.</p>

      <p><a id="page-22"></a>So he’s the one bringing up what everyone else politely avoided mentioning up to now, huh? I mean, we all knew it anyway. It was sorta clear from the large cracks running across the walls of this reception hall. That alone made it pretty obvious that <em>something</em> happened here. Something big and serious enough that we all avoided bringing it up so we could avert our eyes from reality. It was a kind of escape, a desire not to be involved…except now that we were all present, we didn’t have much choice but to get down to business.</p>

      <p>“Yeah,” Guy said with a nod, “we’ve got a couple of thorny issues on our plate. This time, at least, I really <em>do</em> want some feedback from you all.”</p>

      <p>“Wow. If you’re going <em>that</em> far, it must <em>really</em> be serious.”</p>

      <p>Daggrull sounded quieter now. He must’ve gotten the picture—this truly <em>was</em> going to be a pain in the ass. I stared into the space in front of me, as did quite a few others. He’d probably want a lot more than feedback, no doubt.</p>

      <p>Then Guy stood up with a smile. “Right. Time for a change of scenery. Let’s kick this off with a high-level meeting solely between members of the Octagram. We get along <em>so</em> well with each other, after all!”</p>

      <p><em>We do?</em></p>

      <p>I almost whispered “Save that crap for someone else” to myself. That smile foretold all kinds of doom to me…but, sadly, I don’t think I had any right to say no to him, so we all reluctantly let Guy guide us out.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">This space, featuring a large, round table, was cut off from the outside world. There were already drinks set in place for us; I really had to hand it to his staff.</p>

      <p>Guy was sitting in his ornate leader’s chair with me opposite him. From my seat, Milim was on the right side of Guy, Ramiris on his left. Leon was adjacent to me on the right, with Luminus between him and Milim, and Daggrull on the opposite side. Ramiris had this teensy little chair set up on a pedestal a fair bit higher than the table, while Daggrull had a seat several times heavier-looking than <a id="page-23"></a>all the others, so you could say the seating arrangement was pretty well-balanced, at least.</p>

      <p>Once we were all seated, the first thing we noticed was the empty chair between me and Daggrull.</p>

      <p>“By the way, I don’t see Deeno among us. We don’t have to wait for him?”</p>

      <p>It was once again Daggrull saying what we were all thinking. The other demon lords looked concerned about this as well, their eyes settling upon Guy.</p>

      <p>“Ah, yeah, about that.”</p>

      <p>Guy looked at me. I had a feeling I was already being targeted for something.</p>

      <p>“Rimuru…”</p>

      <p>Guess Guy found out about Deeno’s treachery. I didn’t know what kind of intelligence network Guy had, but if he was steering this conversation in my direction, he must’ve known at least <em>some</em> of the details.</p>

      <p>“Okay, okay, you want me to explain why? Well, it’s because Deeno’s a traitor. End of story!” I said.</p>

      <p>“No it’s not! We need some more thorough details.”</p>

      <p>“Tsk… Oh, all right…”</p>

      <p>No point trying to resist him any further. Giving up, I decided to relate the whole story. Deeno, now a resident of my nation, had turned traitor and switched sides in this conflict…but it wasn’t anything he volunteered for. I had a good hunch that he was being influenced by Ultimate Dominion, one of Michael’s skills. This I revealed to everyone, leaving out nothing.</p>

      <p>“So Deeno’s gone to the other side…,” Daggrull muttered once I was done. They had been good friends, and I was sure he had his thoughts about this.</p>

      <p>“I think it’s more that he had his mind taken over,” I explained. “I didn’t get to ask him how <em>he</em> saw all this, but—”</p>

      <p>“Michael was his name, you said?” Guy chimed in. “Are you claiming that a <em>skill</em> has obtained some kind of self-awareness, like a regular person?”</p>

      <p>Ah. So Guy didn’t know <em>why</em> Deeno did what he did?</p>

      <p><a id="page-24"></a>“I suppose I am, yes. There’s no doubt in my mind about that. The signs of sentience are there even as we speak. It’s taken over Ludora’s body, so now it’s functioning as Michael in real life.”</p>

      <p><em>I mean, I’ve got Ciel in my life, after all. There’s a litany of evidence for this.</em></p>

      <p>“Wait, Rimuru! You’re saying that this Ultimate Dominion could affect angelic powers? Terms like <em>angelic</em> and <em>demonic</em> are quite vague concepts. How are you categorizing these?”</p>

      <p><em>Yow! Sharp observation from Luminus there!</em></p>

      <p>I wasn’t all too clear on that either, but then Guy stood up.</p>

      <p>“I can explain.”</p>

      <p>He then went into a surprisingly detailed lecture about skills. They were one of the great secrets of the world, apparently, closely intertwined with how the world itself worked. However, he left nothing to the imagination in his explanation.</p>

      <p>In essence, the laws governing this world were originally crafted by Veldanava, but these laws could be influenced and affected by those with administrative power over them. Even if you didn’t have that, however, you could make a request in your mind, instill it into your magicules, and that would rewrite the laws of the world to some extent as well. That was the basic concept behind magic, which was a type of ability. Skills, the way Guy put it, were a kind of systemized approach to influencing and altering these laws.</p>

      <p>These skills resided in the souls of sentient beings, triggered by the pure energy housed inside them. That included, of course, the angelic ultimate skills crafted by Veldanava, and among these were seven abilities known as “virtue-based” skills.</p>

      <p>“When I fought Veldanava, he tapped into a vast arsenal of abilities,” Guy continued, “but once the world reached a more stable point, the only one he kept around was Michael, the strongest. Some of the others he gave away; the rest he released into the world at large. As a result, these abilities were claimed by the cycle of death and resurrection, appearing from time to time within the souls of those strong enough, and qualified enough, to house them. Some of them, of course, received a demotion and became <em>merely</em> unique skills, as they were too strong in their original ultimate <a id="page-25"></a>form. Sometimes they’d become angelic uniques, even, spreading around the world but still retaining some of their powers.”</p>

      <p>I had a feeling these virtue-type skills were a kind of yin to the yang of sin-based skills. Virtue and sin, angelic and demonic. That kind of thing.</p>

      <p>The way Guy was talking, though, I wasn’t so sure there were still seven virtue-based ultimate skills going around. My Raphael skill was evolved from Great Sage, for example, and I don’t think that was a “virtue”-based thing.</p>

      <p>I wasn’t smart enough to see anything wrong with Guy’s explanation, but once again, Luminus had some questions, refusing to allow anything to go unexamined.</p>

      <p>“Guy, if you know this, I want you to tell us: Are there really seven of these angelic skills in all? And what sort of abilities do they have?”</p>

      <p>I was wondering about that too, actually, and I guess the other demon lords were as well.</p>

      <p>“Heh. You guys are gangin’ up on me more than ever before, huh? All right—I’ll tell you. First, the seven virtue-based skills…”</p>

      <p>Guy knew a whole lot about them, these seven skills once possessed by Veldanava. According to him, they were:</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><strong>Michael, Lord of Justice</strong> (ultimate skill): The most powerful of abilities, best suited for a commander role. Your orders become the dominating impulses within your targets’ minds, and you enjoy literal Absolute Defense, like having Castle Guard around you at all times.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><strong>Raphael, Lord of Wisdom</strong> (ultimate skill): A support-oriented ability suited for administrating the laws governing the world.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><strong>Uriel, Lord of Vows</strong> (ultimate skill): An ability suited for overseeing physical spaces, providing the user governance over all physical phenomena.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><strong>Sariel, Lord of Hope</strong> (ultimate skill): An ability meant for managing the origins of life and the cycle of resurrection.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><a id="page-26"></a><strong>Metatron, Lord of Purity</strong> (ultimate skill): An ability that sorts through the chaotic mix of all laws combined, preventing interference. Works at the level of pure energy.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><strong>Raguel, Lord of Relief</strong> (ultimate skill): An ability that supports and provides amplification for the needs of others. Given to Velgrynd.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><strong>Gabriel, Lord of Endurance</strong> (ultimate skill): An ability meant to lock conditions in place and deal with unexpected events. Given to Velzard.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">That sort of thing. Honestly, he knew <em>way</em> the hell more than I thought he did about them, but I kept my surprise hidden from him.</p>

      <p>“So that’s how these abilities add up, but as of this moment, we’ve only verified the presence of three of them. Veldanava gave his skill Michael to Ludora, and in turn, he took Uriel back for his own purposes—that’s something Ludora acquired and made into an ultimate, you see. I’m not sure, but chances are some changes occurred to that skill in the process. Either way, it’s been lost now, so there’s no way to confirm anything.”</p>

      <p>Guy paused. No one interrupted him.</p>

      <p>“Now, I knew that the Michael skill given to Ludora has the power to make anyone do your bidding. But it turns out this is <em>far</em> more powerful than I originally gave it credit for.”</p>

      <p>He suddenly grew hesitant. I waited for him to continue…and then our eyes met.</p>

      <p>“You know what I mean, don’t you, Rimuru?”</p>

      <p>Well, no reason to lie, I guess. I wanted to pretend I knew nothing, if I could, but that wasn’t gonna happen. I didn’t get to talk fully about Ultimate Dominion before, so it was time to lay out my perspective on this. With the problem growing to the point it had, it’d cause more harm than good to avoid the subject.</p>

      <p>“Yeah. Well, not <em>know</em> so much as, like, I was fighting against it just the other day. When Veldora got taken over by the enemy, I thought for sure that was the end.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-27"></a>Velgrynd got ruled over, too, after all.</p>

      <p>“You did?”</p>

      <p>“I went through a lot, in fact—thanks to <em>you</em> pushing this trouble on me! It wasn’t just a duel against Ludora; it was all-out war!”</p>

      <p>I went ahead and said what needed to be said. But it wasn’t like Guy actually cared.</p>

      <p>“Ah-ha-ha-ha! What’s the big deal? You won,” he told me.</p>

      <p>“It’s a <em>huge</em> deal! Velgrynd destroyed Ramiris’s labyrinth! The land around our town is a burned-out hellscape! And, yeah, the rebuilding process is going along great, but this is the <em>last</em> time I ever do any favors for you, okay?!”</p>

      <p>I could feel my momentum picking up. I really didn’t want him making any more impossible requests—for a little bit, at least.</p>

      <p>“Pfft. A little of your magic, and you could clean that whole mess up in two minutes. But fine. So what’s your conclusion?” Guy asked me.</p>

      <p>“Well, I vaguely talked about how it could influence people before, but let me be a little more honest about it. Michael’s Ultimate Dominion is a menace of an ability. It gives the user complete control over anyone or anything that possesses an angelic ultimate skill.”</p>

      <p>“No…”</p>

      <p>“I find that hard to believe,” said Luminus. “Whether man or monster, those who wield an ultimate skill have a powerful, well-honed mentality. How could anyone take over someone like that?”</p>

      <p>“They can. How else to explain why Velgrynd, too, was dominated by Michael, and not just Veldora? I never would’ve believed a spiritual life-form could be taken over like that, either, until I saw it for myself.”</p>

      <p>In fact, I still didn’t want to believe it. It was the stuff of nightmares, something I never wanted to experience again.</p>

      <p>“Well, Rimuru’s telling the truth, guys. Velgrynd possessed the skill Raguel, and like I just said, Velzard has the skill Gabriel,” Guy told everyone.</p>

      <p>And there you go. I was wondering if that was the case, actually. Judging by how trashed Guy’s stronghold was, he must’ve been fighting against someone crazy powerful. I hated to admit it, but <a id="page-28"></a>Velzard must’ve really been under Michael’s control. My worst premonition had come true, which did nothing but depress me.</p>

      <p>“Whoa! Guy, are you saying that Lady Velzard’s on the enemy’s side?”</p>

      <p>“That’s right, Daggrull.”</p>

      <p>“You’re kidding me! That’s dreadful news, isn’t it?!”</p>

      <p>The confirmation from Guy clearly disturbed Daggrull. They had been acquainted for a long, long time, and he knew full well just how dangerous Velzard could be. I personally didn’t know as much about her—I mean, I understood she’d probably be a handful, but I couldn’t be sure just what kind of a threat she was. Thanks to that, it didn’t quite seem real to me.</p>

      <p>“Just for safety’s sake, I want to ask—she hasn’t been maybe defeated or put in a cage somewhere yet, has she…?”</p>

      <p>“Rimuru,” said Guy, “do you think life would be that easy for us?”</p>

      <p>Guess not. A pity my hopeful expectations didn’t play out. I hated to have Guy act all exasperated at me, too.</p>

      <p>“Well, this couldn’t get much worse, could it? Now even Velzard is on Michael’s side…”</p>

      <p>I couldn’t help but say that out loud, although I knew I was talking on behalf of everyone else.</p>

      <p>“…You’ve got that right.”</p>

      <p>Leon sounded troubled over it, too.</p>

      <p>“I had my doubts whether that was true, but this is certainly no laughing matter any longer.”</p>

      <p>Luminus had a dark look on her face. I could see why. I mean, this was Guy we were talking about, and even <em>he</em> let her get away without concluding the fight. All of us very much doubted that we’d do any better against her.</p>

      <p>“No need to worry! There’re still seven points left on this Octagram, and the rest of us are pretty darn strong, too, right? Let’s kick some ass and show them just what we’re made of!”</p>

      <p>Why does only Milim seem glad about all this? Something in the blood of a True Dragon must affect you mentally or something.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="tx1"><a id="page-29"></a>So now we knew things couldn’t get much worse, but that wasn’t even the end of the bad news.</p>

      <p>“Continuing with my answer to your question—are there really seven angelic-type ultimate skills in total? The answer to that is no,” said Guy.</p>

      <p>“Mm… Most unfortunate.”</p>

      <p>Luminus seemed less than cheerful about it.</p>

      <p>“So you really don’t have <em>any</em> idea how many of those there are?” Daggrull asked.</p>

      <p>“I don’t know all of them,” Guy gravely replied. “When I fought Veldanava, he didn’t show me every single thing in his arsenal. When I speak of seven virtue-based skills, I am taking him at his word. Beyond that…he said he’d give one special ability to each of the Seven Primordial Angels. Or intended to.”</p>

      <p>The hall fell into silence. First the seven virtue-based skills, and now seven others he gave to those angels. That meant fourteen in total…?</p>

      <p>“You’re hinting that he didn’t manage to…?”</p>

      <p>“That’s right, Daggrull,” Guy replied. “The angels of the time didn’t have much in the way of self-awareness yet. Some of them lacked the ability to handle an ultimate skill. That’s why Veldanava gave Velzard and Velgrynd Gabriel and Raguel, respectively. He <em>did</em> also give skills to the angels that qualified for them, but anything he couldn’t give out, he let loose on the world instead.”</p>

      <p>All Veldanava kept was Michael, which he later traded for the Uriel skill Ludora obtained. Then, when the dragon died, Uriel was lost as well…only to become my own ability, much later on, merged with Velgrynd’s Cthugha, Lord of the Fire God. You could really sense the history behind all this…but this wasn’t the time to turn my eyes away from reality. It <em>really</em> felt like I’d better keep that tidbit a secret.</p>

      <p>Still, we now had a better grasp of the whole situation.</p>

      <p>“So these angelic skills are just that—pure skills, crafted by Veldanava himself—and there are likely at least fourteen of them floating around. And anyone who manifests and acquires one of these <a id="page-30"></a>skills is completely unable to resist Michael’s Ultimate Dominion?” I asked.</p>

      <p>“That’d be the case, yes.”</p>

      <p>Guy nodded at me. And that begged the next question.</p>

      <p>“Hold on, hold on. Enough about angelic skills—what about the <em>demonic</em> ones, then?”</p>

      <p>Whoops, Ramiris was kind enough to ask what I meant to ask. Everyone’s eyes focused on Guy.</p>

      <p>“That’s a tougher question to answer, but hear me out. When I was defeated by Veldanava, I acquired the unique skill Pride. That was thanks to me observing him and trying to imitate his strength. I think there’s a secret lurking around that.”</p>

      <p>“Whaddaya mean?”</p>

      <p>“Ramiris, your skill was something you were born with, right? So maybe it doesn’t feel too real to you, but acquiring a skill has a lot to do with what exactly you’re wishing for. It varies from person to person, but still.”</p>

      <p>Guy then gave us a quick recap on the nature of skills.</p>

      <p>Skills generally reside in either the material, spiritual, or astral body—the three things that make up a physical creature. However, certain special skills instead take up residence in the soul itself. These are usually quite strong skills, as one’s biggest desires are naturally going to be those nearest and dearest to their heart.</p>

      <p>I combined this thought with Ciel’s own opinion. Certainly, there were some unique skills that resided in the material body—ones like Berserker, for example, which Razen inherited when he snatched Shogo’s body. You saw assorted cases like this, but in the end, I agreed with Guy that the stronger skills were those that latched on to one’s soul. They were easier to hide, harder to have taken from you, and served you well as unexpected trump cards in battle. Ultimate skills, too, were “soul skill”–level in power, and I suppose that means only a limited number of people could wield them.</p>

      <p>But that wasn’t all. There were actually two types of “soul”-oriented skills—not just those that <em>resided</em> in the soul, but those that were <em>carved</em> into it. Ciel, for one, was pretty much fully <a id="page-31"></a>assimilated into my soul; we were inseparable, so I didn’t need to worry about anyone taking it away from me. Still best kept a secret, but regardless.</p>

      <p>This same rule applied to ultimate skills. If they resided in your soul, there was a chance someone could take them away…but if they were carved in there, you could safely assume that was no longer a concern. However, it was impossible to tell one from the other…</p>

      <p>I thought about this as I listened to the conversation around me.</p>

      <p>“So, connecting this to our earlier topic…,” Guy began.</p>

      <p>“Right—the abilities Veldanava released are part of the resurrection cycle now, residing in souls strong enough to take them?” Luminus asked.</p>

      <p>“Yes, exactly… But in my case, I didn’t receive any abilities from Veldanava. He also didn’t give me anything special, either—unlike you, Ramiris. No, this unique skill of mine is entirely my own creation. You see? It’s a skill that imitates one of his pure abilities. And <em>that</em> is what a demonic skill is.”</p>

      <p>“I see. So my Asmodeus is simply an inferior copy as well?”</p>

      <p>“No, not in your case, Luminus. If the skill is modeled after your own will and wishes, it’ll have the same abilities as the original. And this is something I’m less than excited to reveal, but my Pride skill has since evolved into the ultimate skill Lucifer, Lord of Arrogance. That skill works perfectly fine against angelic abilities—whether it wins out against them is purely a matter of my will against theirs.”</p>

      <p>“A match I’m sure you’re confident about winning, Guy…but very well. To confirm, do you believe along those lines that there are at least fourteen demonic ultimate skills, to go along with the fourteen angelic ones?”</p>

      <p>“Probably. Demons are born as a response to angels, so I’m working on the assumption that demonic skills are created as a response to angelic ones.”</p>

      <p>Hmm… About what I figured, then. This world had far too many weird, unexpected connections. Heroes were fated to always cross paths with demon lords, so I suppose it wasn’t too weird to see skills work in kind of the same way, but…</p>

      <p>“At the very least,” said Guy, “Veldanava’s seven virtue-based <a id="page-32"></a>skills work in a pair with seven sin-based skills, each modeled after a different sin.”</p>

      <p>Lucifer, Lord of Arrogance, formed a pair with Uriel, Lord of Vows, according to Guy. And that was far from the only one. As he put it:</p>

      <p><strong>Michael, Lord of Justice</strong>, was a pair with <strong>Satanael, Lord of Wrath</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>Raphael, Lord of Wisdom</strong>, was a pair with <strong>Belzebuth, Lord of Gluttony</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>Sariel, Lord of Hope</strong>, was a pair with <strong>Belphegor, Lord of Sloth</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>Metatron, Lord of Purity</strong>, was a pair with <strong>Asmodeus, Lord of Lust</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>Raguel, Lord of Relief</strong>, was a pair with <strong>Mammon, Lord of Greed</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>Gabriel, Lord of Endurance</strong>, was a pair with <strong>Leviathan, Lord of Envy</strong>.</p>

      <p>In this way, he theorized, each ultimate skill was in a paired relationship with one on the other side. Personally speaking, I wasn’t sure how I should react to this, given that I had already kinda sacrificed some of these skills and I knew it’d cause a huge stink if people found out. Keeping quiet about that, though, seemed like it’d present its own scary problems. And of <em>course</em> Ciel was being notably silent, too. So I decided to wait and see how things worked out.</p>

      <p class="tx1">With Guy’s skill lesson over, we went back to the original topic.</p>

      <p>“If I could add to what Guy said,” I began, “it looks like angelic skills include a kind of override circuit that prevents the owner from resisting Michael’s orders. We believe that’s why Deeno turned traitor on us, so if you run into him, don’t immediately assume he’s our ally again.”</p>

      <p>“Sounds like a handful,” Daggrull groaned. “He’s the most un-dedicated man I know, but he can be surprisingly strong in a pinch.”</p>

      <p>“What matters more,” Luminus solemnly interjected, wholly <a id="page-33"></a>ignoring the topic of Deeno, “is the fact that Lady Velzard is in the enemy’s camp now. Is the same true for Lady Velgrynd as well?”</p>

      <p>Daggrull brought a hand to his forehead. This <em>was</em> a more present issue. I’d like to pretend I didn’t know the answer to that, but I kinda had an obligation to tell the Octagram about Velgrynd’s current state. Ramiris knew all of it, too, so they were gonna find out anyway.</p>

      <p>But just as I opened my mouth, Leon sharply interjected.</p>

      <p>“Wait. Velgrynd doesn’t matter at the moment. Shouldn’t we instead be checking whether any of <em>us</em> possess angelic skills?”</p>

      <p>Yep. That’s Leon for you—always diving into the crux of the issue. He always was astoundingly courageous that way, being an ex-Hero and all.</p>

      <p>“I <em>knew</em> you’d bring that up, Leon!” a delighted Guy said. And, yeah, once I realized what today’s conference was about, I understood that was going to be the most urgent topic at hand. The only question was who would bring it up. We’d be putting our own demon-lord peers under suspicion, after all, and the only way to avoid any doubts was to reveal everything in your hand. That was why Guy and Luminus were so freely revealing their own skills earlier.</p>

      <p>Seeing this coming a mile away, I spoke up before people started leering at me. I was already late to the party, but then Ramiris shot into the air.</p>

      <p>“Hey! Wait a minute! Are you doubting me or something?”</p>

      <p>“Don’t you worry,” Guy told her. “You were factored out of this from the beginning.”</p>

      <p>Yeah, exactly. Ciel had already vowed to me that Ramiris’s abilities were a special case. According to Ciel, those skills weren’t something Veldanava gave her…so much as a subsection of the abilities Veldanava lost when he was no longer a god. That was enough to make me stop suspecting Ramiris at once.</p>

      <p>“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Well, I don’t have any, either. I don’t really know <em>what</em> my skills are, actually…”</p>

      <p>“No need for concern, Milim,” Guy assured her. “With the amount of sheer, insane force you throw around, your skill’s clearly going to be the opposite of the ultimate skill Michael.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-34"></a>In other words, it was Satanael, Lord of Wrath. I didn’t know exactly what it gave her, but it wasn’t any kind of mind-control thing.</p>

      <p>“I suppose that means I’m next,” Daggrull said. “To tell the truth, I have no experience with any skills in the way that all of you do. I’m closer to Ramiris along those lines, in that I’ve possessed these abilities from the moment I was born.”</p>

      <p>Everyone fell silent at this. But it didn’t seem like he was lying. Milim was sharp about these sorts of things, and her silence spoke volumes in his defense.</p>

      <p>“I believe in you, Daggrull.”</p>

      <p>“Me too!”</p>

      <p>“Heh. Well, if Rimuru and Milim say so, I’ll trust you, too,” said Guy.</p>

      <p>So three out of the seven voiced their trust in him. Counting Daggrull himself, he now had a majority vote, but his supporters weren’t done talking yet.</p>

      <p>“Pfft. I’ll believe in him, too.”</p>

      <p>“Whoa, hey guys, I’ll trust him, too, if you’re all gonna be like that!”</p>

      <p>Leon casually dropped his suspicion of Daggrull. Ramiris, a little late but still sensible enough to see the trend, hopped on the bandwagon as well. The only open vote left was Luminus.</p>

      <p>“Tsk! How annoying. I was hoping to engineer Daggrull’s downfall here, but it appears the odds are against me.”</p>

      <p>“Gah-ha-ha! Well, Luminus, people seem to see me as a man of virtue, don’t they? Too bad for you!”</p>

      <p>“Silence! If <em>you</em> ever fall under someone’s control, I’ll ridicule you as a weakling until the end of my days.”</p>

      <p>The two of them didn’t seem to get along much, but they also seemed to have this odd sort of faith in each other. Maybe I was just imagining it, though. Regardless, Daggrull was now free of suspicion.</p>

      <p>Luminus and Guy had already revealed their skills Asmodeus and Lucifer, and everyone had already concluded they were safe. That left just me and Leon, and I thought I should go on the offensive while I still could.</p>

      <p>“Um, I’m gonna exercise my right to remain silent on this topic,” <a id="page-35"></a>I said, smiling brightly. “I have, like, a whole bunch of skills, and I don’t wanna go telling everyone about them, so!”</p>

      <p>Right? I mean, my skills were all kinds of messed up. The ultimate skills Azathoth, Lord of the Void, and Shub-Niggurath, Lord of Abundance… I mean, how would it possibly benefit me to reveal those? I could try acting all serious and explain how they worked, but they’d all accuse me of making up a bunch of crap. I was fully convinced nobody would ever buy it, so I wanted to just keep mum about the whole thing.</p>

      <p>…But, of course, this wasn’t going to be allowed.</p>

      <p>“…You think we’ll accept <em>that</em> reason?!”</p>

      <p>Guy promptly shut me down.</p>

      <p><em>Hmm. No dice, huh? But I’m sure all hope isn’t lost yet…</em></p>

      <p>“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Well, <em>I</em> trust Rimuru, so he can keep quiet all he wants!” Milim chimed in. “But only if he promises to give me some honey later!”</p>

      <p>I guess I could always trust her, despite how she was already trying to get something out of me. Either way, Milim was always gonna be an ally.</p>

      <p>“In that case, I’ll want some cake, then. Three days’ worth!”</p>

      <p>And, yes, I could buy out Ramiris, too. “Three days” was asking an awful lot, but we could work something out.</p>

      <p>“Great!” I espoused with a nod. “Let’s go with that! Milim, I’ll give you three jugs of Apito’s honey, and Ramiris, you’ll get to have all my desserts for three days!”</p>

      <p>“Excellent! And I’ll tell the world that you’re perfectly okay, Rimuru!”</p>

      <p>“Ooh, yes, of course! Besides, Rimuru’s the guy who exposed all those secrets about angelic skills in the first place. What’s <em>he</em> stand to gain from revealing what’s in his own hand? And there’s no <em>way</em> anyone could rule over him!”</p>

      <p>Wow! Ramiris bringing some actual logic into this! Normally, I’d never place any trust in what she said, but sometimes she had these flashes of brilliance. What’s more, the logic was so convincing that the rest of the demon lords seemed to be buying it.</p>

      <p>“Hmm… That’s a good point. If the master I trusted would betray <a id="page-36"></a>us, that puts me under suspicion as well. I suppose I need to cast my lot for Rimuru!”</p>

      <p>Daggrull accentuated his decision with a friendly guffaw. That gave me the majority, albeit one with me as the tiebreaker. If I could recruit at least one more ally here, that’d be perfect.</p>

      <p>As I thought that, I took a glance at Luminus.</p>

      <p>“…What? If you think you can bribe <em>me</em> as well, you’ve got another—”</p>

      <p>I spoke up before she could finish.</p>

      <p>“Shuna, you know—she’s designed a new set of swimwear.”</p>

      <p>“…Pardon?”</p>

      <p><em>There’s</em> a nibble! Heh-heh-heh… Looks like my flanking maneuver on Luminus worked to brilliant effect.</p>

      <p>“And y’know, I’ve been working with Ramiris to create a real ocean in the labyrinth, too. Sandy beaches and everything.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah! We really nailed that, lemme tell ya!”</p>

      <p>“We sure did. Just picture it. A fully private seaside paradise, right in the Forest of Jura—”</p>

      <p>“Rimuru,” Luminus said, “I think we need to take a few moments to talk this over.”</p>

      <p>“Imagine this perfectly blue, transparent sea, warmly embracing everyone who swims in its waters. Sunlight dancing beautifully on the surface—but it’s still the labyrinth, so no need to worry about sunburn! But then, I seem to recall that <em>you</em> can make your skin any shade of tanned you like, can’t you?”</p>

      <p>“Wait, wait—”</p>

      <p>“And so many beautiful women, baring it all, basking in the sense of pure freedom from all their worldly concerns…”</p>

      <p>“Right. I have several requests and plans to show you as well, so I will pay you a visit after this meeting is over. Do you have some spare time for me?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, of course. Soooo…”</p>

      <p>“Fine, fine. I trusted you from the start anyway.”</p>

      <p>Ya-<em>hoo</em>!</p>

      <p>Pumping my fist in the air was probably a faux pas, but either way, my victory was now set in stone.</p>

      <p><a id="page-37"></a>“…Come on, people. You actually think this kind of thing’s okay? The mighty Octagram, getting won over <em>this</em> easily?!”</p>

      <p>Guy glared at me. I guess my blitzkrieg of corruption wasn’t sitting well with him. But it wasn’t any care of mine. The winners get to write the history books, and all that.</p>

      <p>“Sorry, Guy, but you’re gonna have to admit defeat. I’m not exactly thrilled to see it, either, but it’s fairly obvious Rimuru isn’t being controlled by anyone, at least.”</p>

      <p>I loved that tinge of frustration in Leon’s voice. So, with that, I successfully bribed my way out of suspicion.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">That just left Leon.</p>

      <p>“Now, Leon, how about you?”</p>

      <p>“Heh! My skill? Well, it’s Metatron, Lord of Purity.”</p>

      <p>“““…”””</p>

      <p>Leon was quick to answer Daggrull’s question…but, <em>hmm</em>, what did he just say? Metatron, Lord of Purity? That’s <em>totally</em> an angelic skill, right?! It was hard to describe the “Oh, God, <em>now</em> what’ll we do?” atmosphere that suddenly pervaded the hall.</p>

      <p>“Um… Leon? Pretty rare of you to crack a joke in public,” said Guy. “This <em>is</em> meant to be a serious meeting, remember. Can you perhaps take a deep breath and answer the question?”</p>

      <p>“I’m not here to waste time, either, Guy. The Metatron skill you mentioned a little bit ago is absolutely in my possession.”</p>

      <p>I was sure everyone hated to see this development. It looked for a moment like we were close to ending this meeting, and now we had this bombshell to deal with.</p>

      <p>“Well…what to do about this, eh? Right, Rimuru?”</p>

      <p>“Why’re you turning it over to <em>me</em>?!” I hollered at Guy. “It’s blatantly obvious that you’re angling to push anything you don’t wanna handle on <em>my</em> shoulders! You’re not even trying to hide it!”</p>

      <p>“That’s what you got to say to me, huh? Then quit whining about it and come up with a solution, dammit!”</p>

      <p>“Enough of this! Stop with your ugly infighting!” Luminus spat.</p>

      <p><a id="page-38"></a>“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! But I know how Guy feels, Luminus,” Milim added. “You can always rely on Rimuru at a time like this!”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, for real!” said Ramiris. “Let’s leave this to Rimuru and go whip out some tea or something!”</p>

      <p>My so-called allies were off in their own little world. And Ramiris was the worst of them all. I cursed her in my mind, swearing I’d get her back for it. Having people throw all these headaches at me… This was why demon lords were such scary dudes. Who ever said we cooperated with each other? Anyone who saw these shambles would think the opposite.</p>

      <p>“Rimuru,” an exasperated-looking Daggrull said, “I know you have it tough. I’ve had a certain affinity for you ever since Deeno got pushed on you, but you have my sympathies for this as well.”</p>

      <p>What a nice guy! A giant and a demon lord, maybe, but you can’t judge a book by its cover.</p>

      <p>“Thanks, Sir Daggrull!”</p>

      <p>“No need for that ‘sir’ stuff. Didn’t we just discuss this?”</p>

      <p><em>Oh, right. I really need to start thinking like a demon lord. Too much self-deprecation can be harmful at times.</em></p>

      <p>“All right. Well, thanks, Daggrull!”</p>

      <p>“No need to worry about it,” he said with a nod. “But are we okay with Leon and all?”</p>

      <p>“Yes,” chimed in Luminus. Considering how much they sniped at each other, they often seemed to be of similar minds about things. “He doesn’t look unusual, but if his mind’s been taken over, that is bad news for every one of us.”</p>

      <p>All eyes were on me. They really needed to be talking to the man himself, but that didn’t seem to occur to anyone. I wasn’t capable of much more than conjecture on this topic, but there <em>was</em> one thing I had already confirmed earlier.</p>

      <p>“Like I said, when Deeno double-crossed us, the labyrinth was all busted up and open to enemy invasion. I think that’s when he contacted the Mystic Lord Feldway.”</p>

      <p>“Once he entered the labyrinth,” added Ramiris, “it became impossible to fully shut it away from the outside. So I don’t think <a id="page-39"></a>they ever had a direct conversation or whatever, but they coulda used telepathy to communicate with each other, y’know?”</p>

      <p>Nice to see her at least try to contribute. I reevaluated my opinion of her as I spoke to Guy.</p>

      <p>“So I want to ask—what exactly happened over here, Guy? I imagine this was Velzard attacking you, but I want to know what transpired.”</p>

      <p>“You noticed?”</p>

      <p>“I believe that’s the first thing anyone would think after seeing this mess.”</p>

      <p>It was obvious to everyone that Guy and Velzard had a fight. There wouldn’t have been all this carnage otherwise. But what I wanted to know was the reason—or, really, how Velzard fell into enemy hands. Could her override circuit be tapped into from anywhere, or did you need to be a certain distance away? The answer to that would tell us how much of a threat this really was. Also, unlike Velzard and (presumably) Deeno, who both received their abilities from Veldanava, Leon’s was probably created by himself and evolved to an ultimate. His override probably hadn’t gone away, but for all we knew, maybe some sort of bug kept it from working. That’d explain why no orders had worked on Leon so far…but either way, it was crucial that we obtain some more accurate information.</p>

      <p>“Like you said, that bastard Feldway penetrated our barrier of ice and snow and made his way in,” Guy explained. “Mizeri and Raine stepped up to engage him, and I wanted to teach him a lesson or two as well…but then Velzard got in our way.”</p>

      <p>Hmm.</p>

      <p>“So there was no contact, but he got pretty close to you?” I asked him. “Same situation as Deeno, then… But it’s hard to figure out how to judge this.”</p>

      <p>“Meaning whether you need to be physically nearby to access the override circuit? Or do you think that’s just what he’s trying to make us think?”</p>

      <p>“Pretty much, yeah.”</p>

      <p>“Well, Leon? Do <em>you</em> feel anything?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-40"></a>“Nothing palpable, no. I am still myself, and I sincerely doubt anyone’s taken over my mind.”</p>

      <p>Leon sounded wholly confident about that, but neither Lieutenant Kondo nor Velgrynd herself had actually realized they were being controlled. It was a little tough to trust him at face value.</p>

      <p>“Right,” said Guy. “So that means you still love me the most out of anyone—”</p>

      <p>“No, you fool. It is Chloe, of course,” Leon spat. “<em>You</em> hardly register in my mind at all.”</p>

      <p>Great. He’s okay, then. That unwavering avowal definitely felt like Leon’s own will. Besides, it’s not like I had any solid evidence either way.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Just as Feldway was recorded in the labyrinth.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">Ciel was right. When Chloe was facing off against Feldway, he said—quoting here—<em>“Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! So that’s where it was! It seems Sir Veldanava’s will is for me to win after all!”</em> You could interpret that to mean that, until that point, neither Feldway nor Michael knew exactly who possessed an angelic ultimate skill. There was no guarantee that wasn’t just an act on his part, but we couldn’t go around self-doubting ourselves forever. My gut was telling me I was in the clear, so we needed to proceed on the assumption we could trust Leon.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>We could be more certain if you used Predation on Leon and destroyed the override circuit itself.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">Ciel made that sound all casual, but I had to say no. Preying upon Leon like that just didn’t sit right with me. I suppose that might’ve been all the more reason why I wanted to trust him.</p>

      <p>“Right. We won’t reach any conclusion talking it out here. We could question him about all kinds of things, but I’d like to believe that he’s okay. Let’s call it a gray area…close to a black area, really…and see how things turn out!”</p>

      <p>“You’re fine with that?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-41"></a>I nodded briskly at Guy. “I can’t be absolutely certain on this, but I don’t think the enemy knows where the angelic skill holders are located.”</p>

      <p>“Do you have any basis for that?” asked a curious-looking Daggrull. I decided to lay out my thoughts to him.</p>

      <p>“Well, I have full records from when Feldway fought us in Ramiris’s labyrinth. Based on what he said during the battle, the only angelic skill holders they’re aware of are the ones who received their abilities straight from Veldanava. If someone manifested one of those skills themselves, I don’t think they can pick up on that until they’re physically pretty close to them.”</p>

      <p>“Right, yeah! I’m not really a fan of revealing labyrinth data in public like this, but if it’s for a good cause, no complaints from me!”</p>

      <p>“I appreciate it a lot,” I said, trying to assuage Ramiris. The labyrinth really <em>was</em> exceptional in all aspects, and I had no problem expressing my appreciation for it.</p>

      <p>“Hey, I’ll never get sick of praise, y’know!”</p>

      <p>She seemed to enjoy it, too. Not wanting this to become an endless cycle, I got back to the subject.</p>

      <p>“Anyway, Leon hasn’t made his skill public outside of here, so I think it’ll be a while before the enemy finds out about it, if at all.”</p>

      <p>“Indeed,” said a discouraged-looking Leon. “I’d be foolish to reveal the cards in my hand, save in exceptional circumstances like these.”</p>

      <p>“Yes,” Luminus agreed, “Leon is right. I imagine he could be found out rather easily if he’s approached at close range, so I agree that we can’t fully rest easy about this, but it’d be ridiculous to be <em>too</em> wary of each other and ruin our relationships at a time like this.”</p>

      <p>“Mm… I have no objection to that.”</p>

      <p>Daggrull also agreed. They really <em>did</em> think alike, despite their differences. It was funny to see them constantly seething at each other, but they were still keeping their cool and making sound judgments, so I didn’t see any problem with that.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I trust whatever Rimuru says, and Leon isn’t lying, either!”</p>

      <p>With Milim’s seal of approval as well, this problem was fully solved…or so I thought, until Ramiris just had to get in another word.</p>

      <p><a id="page-42"></a>“Right, so there ya go. We might need to keep an eye on Leon, but the problem is <em>who’s</em> gonna do the watching!”</p>

      <p>Great. If she tossed something like <em>that</em> in here…</p>

      <p>“Rimuru?” said Guy.</p>

      <p>“No. Don’t say any more. I know what you want.”</p>

      <p>I knew it. I knew they’d want me to be Leon’s observer. So I acquiesced.</p>

      <p class="tx1">“Outside of Deeno the deserter, we’ve concluded that all seven of us in here are united under the same cause,” I declared. “That, and I think we all understand just how dangerous a foe this is.”</p>

      <p>We’d figure out how to track Leon later.</p>

      <p>“Now, Guy, what do you plan to do with this Michael thing?”</p>

      <p>I focused on what Guy had to say.</p>

      <p>“Huh? I’m gonna crush it, of course.”</p>

      <p>“Mm. It will be all-out war, then.”</p>

      <p>Luminus sounded thoughtful about it. It was the will of everyone else in here as well.</p>

      <p>“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! I’m getting so pumped now!”</p>

      <p>“Heck yeah!” Ramiris agreed with Milim. “The time has come to show off what I can <em>really</em> do! Whether it’s Feldway or Michael, I’ll floor ’em all with a single punch!”</p>

      <p>“If this so-called Mystic Lord is back, we won’t be able to avoid a fight. Our very lands are at stake.”</p>

      <p>Milim could back up her boasting with results, but Ramiris talking like that seemed pretty unrealistic to me. A punch from her wouldn’t do much, but her labyrinth was extremely vital to us, so I opted not to pick on her about it.</p>

      <p>“Do we know just how large the enemy force is?” Leon asked.</p>

      <p>Guy shook his head. “We know it consists of at least the Seven Primordial Angels, including Feldway and Deeno. That, and Michael, who’s serving as their supreme commander.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm…and to that we can add Lady Velzard as well?” said <a id="page-43"></a>Luminus. “A Temma War is never a breeze, but <em>this</em> one could prove quite a challenge.”</p>

      <p><em>Pardon?</em></p>

      <p>“A Temma War, you said?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. A war that occurs approximately once every five hundred years. But isn’t that usually kicked off when whoever holds Ludora’s ability summons the angels?”</p>

      <p>Daggrull was being awfully casual about this, but it was enough to surprise me and everybody else.</p>

      <p>“What?! Do not make up stories like that, Daggrull!”</p>

      <p>Luminus flared up at him, but Guy raised a hand to stop her.</p>

      <p>“Calm down, Luminus. What Daggrull says is accurate. Ludora has an ability called Armageddon, you see, and he can use it to summon a force of angels and have them do whatever he wants. Ludora himself seemed to have trouble keeping control over that skill, though. It looks like he was only capable of giving them simple orders.”</p>

      <p>As Guy explained, this battle occurred on a five-hundred-year cycle. However, since the summoned angels didn’t have any physical bodies, they wound up vanishing after no longer than a week’s time. I rued the fact that I wasn’t informed of this sooner.</p>

      <p>“Question,” I said to Guy.</p>

      <p>“Yes?”</p>

      <p>“Could angels remain in this world if they’re granted physical bodies, like demons can?”</p>

      <p>…Actually, I didn’t need to ask, did I? The tengu race—Benimaru’s wife Momiji among them—were created when angels were granted bodies by the wolfmen. With all the things that might happen in these wars, I could easily see lots of species being born that way.</p>

      <p>But this did nothing to dispel my bad premonition.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>It is the forbidden curse known as Dead Birthday.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">Ciel was on point yet again. It knew exactly what I was thinking.</p>

      <p>“You look worried about something. Speak up. I’ll listen to you.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-44"></a>With Guy pressing me, I decided not to hide anything.</p>

      <p>“Well, you guys know about Kazalim the Curse Lord, right? To tell the truth, Kazalim’s been taken over by the enemy, too, and he’s been creating a bunch of walking dead…”</p>

      <p>I had given orders to stop this ceremony if they found a chance, but I didn’t really know how effective that was, sadly.</p>

      <p>“A Dead Birthday, you mean? How many thousands died in it?” Guy asked me.</p>

      <p>“Around sixty thousand. The imperial members of Yuuki’s Composite Division. So I think that created maybe ten of them max.”</p>

      <p>“Mm. Emphasizing quality over quantity, eh? They’ll each at least have the power of a Clayman, then. Perfectly fine vessels for a Primordial to slip into.”</p>

      <p><em>Ah, I think Guy’s got the wrong idea. My concerns lie elsewhere, so I better correct him while I can.</em></p>

      <p>“No, um, those Seven Primordial Angels obtained physical bodies a long time ago. I think they made the transformation over on their world, with Feldway leading them. And Deeno’s buddies, too…”</p>

      <p><em>Um, what were their names?</em></p>

      <p>“Pico and Garasha, right?”</p>

      <p>Yeah, them!</p>

      <p>Ramiris saved me once again. <em>Gotta thank her for that.</em></p>

      <p>“So what <em>you’re</em> worried about is…”</p>

      <p>“Right, I’m thinking these walking dead will serve as bodies for the high-level angels they summoned via the Dead Birthday. Angels have only a very thin sort of sentience, right? So if you let them set up shop inside the soul of something with much more defined self-awareness, I think you could create a new species of utter bruisers with angelic powers, you know?”</p>

      <p>“““…”””</p>

      <p>Guy and the other demon lords fell silent. After a few seconds, they began to talk among themselves, saying things like “Oh, come now” and “You scare me with your conjecturing sometimes.” But it’s not like I wanted to tell them stuff like that. The possibility just came to mind, is all.</p>

      <p><a id="page-45"></a>“And you think there’s a good chance of that happening, Rimuru?” Guy asked me.</p>

      <p>“Again, can you stop trying to push responsibility on me for everything I say?”</p>

      <p>“Sure, sure. So what is it?”</p>

      <p>“If it were me, I’d certainly make the attempt. Failure just means losing one walking dead, after all.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah… I guess I’d do the same, too. No point having a huge army if they’re all weaklings.”</p>

      <p>Guy and I nodded at each other, the other demon lords looking at us in disgust. What’s with that, huh? I think anyone would try it, if it’d boost their warpower and all.</p>

      <p>“Don’t look at me like that!” I shouted. “I dunno what’s actually happening, but we need to think about worst-case scenarios, don’t we?”</p>

      <p>“You’re right, but…,” Luminus said, kicking off the debate.</p>

      <p>“You really <em>are</em> a menace. And the scariest thing of all is how you act like you can <em>do</em> something about that if it happens.”</p>

      <p>“That’s right, Rimuru,” said Daggrull. “By ‘high-level angels,’ you’re talking about seraphim, but a body as powerful as Clayman’s would be able to support that well enough, I’m sure. The result could reach the level of an awakened demon lord, I imagine.”</p>

      <p>“Mm. And if something like what Daggrull described appears—several of them, even—we too would need to brace ourselves,” added Luminus. “Louis and Gunther would have a hard time, at least.”</p>

      <p>Instead of whining at me like I expected, they were whining more about how to deal with this.</p>

      <p>“Sir Guy, everyone seems pretty worked up about this. Can you help restore some order here?” I asked.</p>

      <p>“Whoa, whoa, I told you to drop the ‘sir’ already. We all have the right to speak as equals in here, don’t we? And it’s not like it’ll hurt you to step in and deal with this problem, either!”</p>

      <p>“Oh, shut up! Like <em>you</em> ever pay me any respect. Why do <em>I</em> always get the short end of the stick, huh?!”</p>

      <p>I was no longer holding back. It calmed me down a bit. Sure, Guy was scary, but we were good.</p>

      <p><a id="page-46"></a>“What’s the big problem? Just kick their asses, and it’ll all work out fine!”</p>

      <p>“Yeah! And we have my master Veldora here, too. You don’t need to be quakin’ in your boots <em>that</em> much!”</p>

      <p>Milim and Ramiris had been the most consistently optimistic voices in this meeting. I was jealous of how unconcerned they were. As for Veldora, the guy Ramiris was placing her hopes on, he was…well, probably reading manga in the other room. He’d been talking recently about all this wondrous knowledge he’d uncovered, but it turned out he was just reading a long nonfiction historical series. He’ll probably be talking about Zhuge Liang’s brilliant strategy from the <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em> pretty soon, and it’ll probably be up to me to conjure up the rest of the series for him, so I can’t say I’m too excited about any of that. At least he wasn’t bothering us in here.</p>

      <p>“It’s not going to be easy, though. Both Lady Velzard and Lady Velgrynd are in enemy hands, aren’t they? Even with that wretched Veldora on our side, the enemy has a clear advantage! And it’s a silly idea to rely on that stupid dragon anyway.”</p>

      <p>Luminus was right. Veldora might seem reliable, but he rarely was. He got all wimpy whenever his sisters were around, and he’d been caught by the enemy not long ago.</p>

      <p>“Oh, I think we’re safe when it comes to Velgrynd.”</p>

      <p>I was so distracted by everything that I kind of let that drop. A clear mistake, of course.</p>

      <p>“Why are you so sure about that?”</p>

      <p><em>Oops</em>, I thought—but it was already too late. I hated standing up onstage like this and delivering all this tumultuous news, but by now, I had no choice but to be honest.</p>

      <p>“Well, thanks to some stuff that happened during her battle with me, Velgrynd managed to escape Ultimate Dominion. Also, she doesn’t have the ultimate skill Raguel any longer, so we don’t have to worry about Michael controlling her.”</p>

      <p>“““Huhhh?!”””</p>

      <p><em>Play dumb about it, play dumb about it…</em></p>

      <p>“Hey, it was a really hard battle, y’know? I was totally absorbed <a id="page-47"></a>by it, brain working on automatic…and the next thing I knew, I had a pretty good victory drop in my lap, sort of thing!”</p>

      <p>The demon lords’ doubtful eyes were killing me. But if I lost here, they’d probably make me reveal everything else I knew.</p>

      <p>“What the hell did you do to her?”</p>

      <p>Even Guy looked shocked for a change.</p>

      <p>“That’s, um, a trade secret…”</p>

      <p>I had to keep mum about my abilities. They wouldn’t believe me if I talked about them; all it’d do was place more suspicion on me. Maybe I was worrying too much, but I really felt I had to block this at all costs.</p>

      <p>“Tsk! All that petty nonsense,” Daggrull spat. “Why you gotta be so stingy, huh?”</p>

      <p>I don’t think it’s a matter of that. Call it strategizing.</p>

      <p>“Uh, no, I mean—I know you haven’t experienced it, Daggrull, but the rest of us have seen our skills evolve now and then, right?”</p>

      <p>“<em>I</em> haven’t, though.”</p>

      <p><em>Yeah, thanks, Ramiris.</em> I ignored her attempts to put a word in edgewise.</p>

      <p>“Well, Velgrynd kinda ran into the same situation. During our battle, it’s like…you know, she got her senses back, just like that. She told me that Raguel evolved on her right then.”</p>

      <p>I was embellishing the story a little bit—okay, a lot—but I think I got my point across.</p>

      <p>“True, yeah…”</p>

      <p>“I don’t totally remember, but I think something like that’s happened to me, yeah,” Milim noted.</p>

      <p>“Hmm… Skills evolving amid pitched battle?” Luminus mused. “It doesn’t seem impossible to me. Not <em>normal</em>, but…”</p>

      <p>“That was the case with me, too, actually. I was walking the line between life and death, and I wagered everything on my own potential. That was how I obtained Metatron, and even now, I have no regrets about that.”</p>

      <p>Leon seemed convinced, at least, given the experience he had. That was a relief. If I claimed that Velgrynd didn’t tell me about her current abilities, I could pretend I never knew about Cthugha, her <a id="page-48"></a>new ultimate skill. It wasn’t technically my fault anyway. Ciel did all that stuff for me.</p>

      <p>“…I thought ultimate skills were as far as they could go, but apparently there is still room to evolve? Tsk. I got a lot to learn, I see. Guess I was kidding myself into thinking I was at my limits.”</p>

      <p>With that final observation from Guy, the topic was put to rest.</p>

      <p class="tx1">I had the feeling that our debate wasn’t making much progress, so I decided it was time for one more recap. It was vital that we had an accurate picture of our enemy’s powers; this wasn’t something we could gloss over.</p>

      <p>“So you’re certain that Velgrynd is all right?” Guy asked me.</p>

      <p>“Yeah. She’s protecting Masayuki the Hero right now. He and I are on friendly terms, so we agreed to help each other when we need to.”</p>

      <p>“We can count her as on our side, then?”</p>

      <p>Hmm… I didn’t want to make that call for her, but she’d probably lend a hand if asked.</p>

      <p>“Well, we should just be glad she’s not on theirs, shouldn’t we? <em>I</em>, for one, never want to fight her again.”</p>

      <p>“Fair enough. Almost no one could beat her in a fight, I’m sure, so good job on that one. With Velzard already opposing us, we’d be up the creek if Velgrynd switched sides, too.”</p>

      <p>Guy sounded like he hated the idea, and I’m sure he meant it. I’d say a good half of us in the room didn’t stand a chance against a True Dragon. The only ones who could take a swing at her were me, Guy, and Milim—maybe Daggrull, too? Either way, taking an enemy like her out of the picture was nothing but a godsend.</p>

      <p>Oh, and one more thing.</p>

      <p>“And while we’re talking about Velgrynd, let me bring this up, too. So four out of the Seven Primordial Angels have traveled back to their own world, Feldway included…but three of them attacked Ramiris’s labyrinth.”</p>

      <p>“You bet they did! And with <em>my</em> talents, I trundled them right outta there.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-49"></a>Ramiris nodded, like this was news to her. I kept going before she derailed my train of thought.</p>

      <p>“Um, regardless of the details… They introduced themselves to us as Feldway the Mystic Lord and the Three Mystic Leaders serving him.”</p>

      <p>“Ah, yeah, they’ve been plotting behind the scenes for ages to wipe out the humans on this world,” said Guy. “We opposed them, calling them the ‘magic race’ and so on, but they were actually mystics all along.”</p>

      <p>“I thought ‘magic race’ was the generic term for anyone that fought against humans, but that’s where it came from? Huh. But anyway, out of these Three Mystic Leaders, Velgrynd’s already destroyed one of them. Just something to keep in mind.”</p>

      <p>Cornu was the name of the guy, I think—the one who riled up Velgrynd by talking trash about Masayuki. I could sense that she had grown stronger, but one-hitting a Mystic Leader? Scary.</p>

      <p>Then again, this Cornu didn’t seem to have the same lofty aspirations as Feldway or even Zarario for that matter. That’s just something I sensed looking back at the video footage…but after analyzing everything that happened in the labyrinth, Ciel said that while they were mostly equal in existence points, Cornu was a step behind in terms of actual strength. I’m not sure how it came to that conclusion, but I trusted in it. Thus, while I wasn’t trying to underestimate my foes at all, there was no need to worry about someone who was already destroyed. That’s why I decided to tell them.</p>

      <p>“I’m sure it was Cornu, right? I’ve known him for years and years, and I’m not exactly shedding a tear for him right now.”</p>

      <p>Guy sounded like he couldn’t care less about the man. It meant one less enemy to worry about, and he was glad for that, but that’s about it. Very Guy-like of him, I thought, so I moved on without commenting on it…or I meant to, but Milim interrupted me.</p>

      <p>“Hey, now seems like a good time for this. I got something to report, too!”</p>

      <p>I decided to let her have her say.</p>

      <p>“So one of the other Mystic Leaders is this girl named Obela, and a li’l while ago she asked to serve under me outta nowhere. We <a id="page-50"></a>had this meeting totally in secret, so I don’t think Feldway or any of the other mystics are on to her!”</p>

      <p>This didn’t throw me for a total loop, but I wasn’t sure how to react to it, either. My first thought was: <em>That’s her move, huh?</em></p>

      <p>“W-wow. Great job, Milim. How did you win her over?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, tell us. Obela’s not as narrow-minded as Cornu was. I think she’s a pretty serious woman, too. The last person I’d expect to switch sides. So how did that subject come up?”</p>

      <p>Me and Guy questioned Milim at the same time. Our eyes met, indicating that we were thinking the same thing: In essence, we were concerned that Milim was being tricked. We both nodded at each other.</p>

      <p>“With my natural wiles, of course! She understood how amazing I was, so she came up to me with the offer! It’s tough being so popular, huh?”</p>

      <p>She was smiling through this, but we weren’t about to take her at her word.</p>

      <p>“Don’t get carried away like that,” admonished Guy. “It might be one of the enemy’s schemes.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, it’s fine,” replied Milim, not listening to him at all. “Obela didn’t tell me any lies or whatever!”</p>

      <p>“Hmm…,” I murmured. “Well, Milim, there’s this manga I read about the <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em>, and one chapter’s about this really obvious trick they call ‘ambush poison.’ Basically, they send this guy over to their opponent’s side, pretending to surrender and asking to join them, and then they can spy on them all they want to. We’re talking something that’s been around since ancient times. And here she is, coming over right when war’s about to break out. That’s all but asking us to question her motives, isn’t it?”</p>

      <p>Veldora was reading that manga right now. <em>“Now I, too, am a master strategist,”</em> I recall him saying, but if it were that simple to train a military tactician, war would be a lot easier for all of us. Besides, the story setting’s so different from here, I don’t think it’s useful as much more than a reference.</p>

      <p>Either way, this was clearly suspicious, something I tried to convince Milim of. But she just gave me her usual bold smile.</p>

      <p><a id="page-51"></a>“It’s no problem! I doubted her, too, but I talked it over later with Carillon and Frey, and we all agreed to trust in Obela.”</p>

      <p>Hmm. Milim was no fool, of course. I’m sure she did all the necessary checking. And if Carillon and Frey made the same decision, maybe we could trust her after all.</p>

      <p>“What did you and Obela talk about?” I decided to ask.</p>

      <p>“Well…”</p>

      <p>Then, upon hearing the whole story, I opted to make the same decision.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">

      <p class="tx1">“So Obela’s over in the Mystic Palace, tracking Ivalage the World-Destroyer Dragon? In that case, she wouldn’t have the free time or capacity to try anything against us anyway.”</p>

      <p>That was the conclusion Guy made after Milim finished. Ivalage, and the cryptids under it, were apparently hell-bent on destruction and weren’t open to negotiation. If Obela got distracted at all, it could lead to Ivalage’s return, so it was natural to assume she wouldn’t be part of any invasion.</p>

      <p>But something still bothered me.</p>

      <p>“If Feldway really doesn’t care if the world’s destroyed, like Obela said, wouldn’t he try to release Ivalage on us?”</p>

      <p>Feldway and Michael wanted to resurrect Veldanava, but even if they failed, we’d still be in big trouble. They might lose all hope and turn to wanton destruction. Nothing’s scarier than someone who doesn’t consider the consequences of their actions. That’s why I brought it up, however:</p>

      <p>“I find that hard to believe, Rimuru.”</p>

      <p>It seemed like a perfectly viable scenario to me, but it was surprisingly unpopular among my peers. First Luminus shot it down, followed by Daggrull. “Feldway,” he said, “isn’t enough of a fool to try using a monster too strong and uncontrollable for him to handle.”</p>

      <p><em>Oh, so Ivalage is stronger than him?</em></p>

      <p>“It was a real pain last time, lemme tell ya,” added Ramiris. “Guy <a id="page-52"></a>took the dragon on, but I had to pitch in to make sure the whole planet didn’t get busted up!”</p>

      <p>“Gah-ha-ha! Yeah, Ivalage really <em>could</em> destroy a planet if you’re not careful. Fight the wrong way, and you’re gonna have a lot of trouble on your hands,” said Daggrull.</p>

      <p>“Maybe it’ll destroy his foes for him, but what about after that? You can’t really rule a world if it’s been torn to shreds,” I offered.</p>

      <p>Huh… Guess I was being unrealistic. Ivalage honestly <em>did</em> seem like some kind of freak.</p>

      <p>“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Just the kind of opponent I like!” Milim crowed. “If it decides to rear its ugly head around me, I’m gonna give it a good thrashing!”</p>

      <p>“Don’t.”</p>

      <p>“Forget it.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, no way!”</p>

      <p>“Milim,” Guy started, “me and everyone else here understand how strong you are, but you need to think this through. Not that I’m one to talk, but consider the damage you might cause to the surroundings.”</p>

      <p>“Oooh, come on, I know how to let up a little, y’know? So whether it’s this world-destroying dragon or not, just a quick punch or two, and—”</p>

      <p>“Okay, okay, fine. Realistically speaking, if Ivalage gets revived, then sure, I’ll take it on. I’ve been wanting to settle the score with it anyway. The next chance I have, I <em>will</em> take it out.”</p>

      <p>Guy’s voice resonated ominously across the room. Nobody was going to challenge him on that. Milim looked a tad put off, but we all agreed that should Ivalage show up, Guy would take care of things.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Now, back to Obela.</p>

      <p>“Would it be possible,” queried Daggrull, “to ask her about enemy internals and such?”</p>

      <p>“I tried, but it didn’t seem like she knows very much about their warpower over in this world,” Milim replied. “Feldway’s a pretty suspicious guy, so maybe he gets anxious about people asking him too many questions.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-53"></a>“Obela’s right about that,” agreed Ramiris. “Feldway’s a smart fella, and I’m sure he doesn’t want his staff to know more than they need to.”</p>

      <p>“So he just gives people orders and sends them off?” I asked. It reminded me of at least one annoying boss I’d had.</p>

      <p>“Not exactly,” said Guy, leaning back as if recalling a memory. “The way he thinks, if you’re actively trying to carry out the tactics he gave you, then you shouldn’t even <em>have</em> the time to worry about other people. Obela’s smart not to pry into him.”</p>

      <p>If she wanted to deceive us, she could have earned our trust by divulging some false intelligence. If she’d simply said “I don’t know” instead, that actually would have improved our trust in her a fair amount. I highly doubted Feldway and I saw eye to eye about very much, though.</p>

      <p>“Thinking about your team as nothing but pawns… Pretty self-righteous of him. I bet he thinks that everything he conceives is correct.”</p>

      <p>I couldn’t help but speak my mind. Guy smiled back at me.</p>

      <p>“Is that sarcasm meant for me?”</p>

      <p>“Not at all!”</p>

      <p>Careful there. Guy isn’t self-righteous—more like despotic. He sees the demons serving him as <em>less</em> than pawns. Best not to inadvertently stir him up like that.</p>

      <p>“For now,” I said to take his mind off it, “let’s lean toward trusting in her and see how things work out, maybe?”</p>

      <p>Everyone nodded back at me.</p>

      <p class="tx1">With Obela behind us, we returned to the main subject. Getting sidetracked this much was starting to tire me out.</p>

      <p>“I swear,” I said out loud, “this meeting’s not going anywhere at all. Does anyone <em>else</em> in here have any secrets they’re not sharing?”</p>

      <p>“““<em>You’re</em> one to talk!”””</p>

      <p>Fair point. I probably had the most secrets of everyone, so that statement was a mistake. Regretting it, I focused back on the meeting, which was mostly being led by Luminus at the moment.</p>

      <p><a id="page-54"></a>“Regardless, it’s hard to build cooperation between ourselves if we hardly see each other. So let me step up and try to summarize matters.”</p>

      <p>With that, she ran down all the forces our enemy had. Michael was their leader, Velzard the Ice Dragon serving under his rule. There was Feldway the Mystic Lord, and his assistant Zarario of the Three Mystic Leaders.</p>

      <p>Zarario was tasked with watching over the insectors, led by Zeranus the Insect Lord. Zeranus must’ve had his own staff, too, but Obela didn’t know much about them—another unknown, and honestly, it was this force I was the most curious about. All the insectors <em>I</em> knew, at least, were scary strong. Zegion and Apito go without saying, of course, but there was also Razul, the guardian deity of the west, and Minaza, a Single Digit (number six, I think) who Shion defeated. Zeranus looked like a handful to me, and I’m sure he had a lot of powerful insectors under him, something we’d need to watch out for.</p>

      <p>Then there was the trio of Deeno, Pico, and Garasha. Being as powerful as an awakened demon lord was trouble enough, but we didn’t know what kind of ultimate skills they had, if any. It wouldn’t be weird if they possessed some of their own ultimate skills, so it was best to assume they did.</p>

      <p>And that just left…</p>

      <p>“…Those walking dead with angels housed in them? Hmm. If they’re about equal to us, that makes them a menace indeed. If we had an accurate idea of their numbers, at least, that would put my mind at ease.”</p>

      <p>“You can’t ask for the world like that, Daggrull,” Luminus countered. “We should be glad we know what we do and form a strategy based on that.”</p>

      <p>“How do you mean?” retorted Leon. “Do you want to decide who will take on whom in battle?”</p>

      <p>It sounded like a waste of time to me, but it wasn’t meaningless, either.</p>

      <p>“Well…at the very least, Leon, we know that <em>you</em> shouldn’t try fighting Michael,” Daggrull replied.</p>

      <p><a id="page-55"></a>That was a given. He’d be in Michael’s thrall, and that’d be it for him. In fact, we all needed to work together to make absolutely sure that didn’t happen. I was concerned that Feldway might have these mind-control abilities as well, not just Michael…but after examining all the info, I now had at least a vague idea about how that worked.</p>

      <p>“So listen, it looks like Michael’s abilities can be transferred to other people…including his mind-control skills, to a certain extent,” I told everyone. “Thus, I think we’re gonna need to keep Leon away from Feldway, too.”</p>

      <p>We needed to assume that Feldway was borrowing that skill, much like Lieutenant Kondo did.</p>

      <p>“How troublesome,” Luminus said. “If Leon were to be taken over, that would tip the balance of power in rapid order.”</p>

      <p>Hearing her, I realized I had forgotten to say something.</p>

      <p>“Oh right—and it’s not only Leon who’s in danger, either.”</p>

      <p>“Mm? What do you mean?”</p>

      <p>“Well, like I just said, in the fight not too long ago, Veldora fell into enemy hands for a bit.”</p>

      <p>“…I am <em>very</em> keen to hear more about this,” the bewildered Luminus urged.</p>

      <p>So I told them all about Regalia Dominion, an ability of Michael’s that gave him absolute control over pretty much any target. I avoided talking about Chloe, since she’d already taken care of that herself. If things had gotten really bad, I’m sure Ciel would’ve forcibly gotten itself involved, so I just trusted that it would save me if needed. Thus I stuck entirely to how Veldora acted in battle.</p>

      <p>“““…”””</p>

      <p>“You <em>were</em> the one who asked if anyone was holding any more secrets, weren’t you, Rimuru?” asked Guy.</p>

      <p><em>Uh-oh.</em></p>

      <p>“Oh, um…did I?”</p>

      <p>“Yes!”</p>

      <p>“You sure did!” said Ramiris.</p>

      <p>“That you did,” added Daggrull.</p>

      <p>“Absolutely,” agreed Luminus.</p>

      <p><a id="page-56"></a>“I’m certain you did.”</p>

      <p>I had nobody on my side. “It wasn’t anything like a <em>secret</em>,” I pleaded, “just something I forgot to say earlier.”</p>

      <p>…Nobody was buying it. Why me? Ramiris knew about all this, too…but bringing that up wouldn’t improve my situation any. So I gave up and apologized.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">With the other demon lords all peeved at me, it proved surprisingly difficult to smooth things over. We were back on track, at least, but looking at matters, we really were in just a terrible situation. Not only had we lost key firepower, but the enemy had in turn gained some. It was like one player in a chess game getting to replace any pieces they lost, and I honestly wasn’t sure how we were gonna win under these conditions. It was my fault for forgetting to mention that earlier, and I’m sure it badly unnerved everyone who heard it.</p>

      <p>“So is anyone here being influenced by Regalia Dominion, then?” Luminus asked.</p>

      <p>“No worries there. People with angelic skills don’t seem to realize they’re being mind-controlled, but Regalia Dominion is more of a forced thing, so you lose yourself and start acting weird, like, immediately. With Veldora, we’re connected by our souls anyway, so he told me that he was taken over the moment it happened.”</p>

      <p>“I see. So how did you free Veldora from that?”</p>

      <p>“That—”</p>

      <p><em>This</em> question again? Well, I ate him up and Ciel did a bit of Ability Adjust magic on him, but I had no intention of being honest about that. No one would believe me anyway. So I had to conjure up another story.</p>

      <p>“It was just like with Velgrynd. We were involved in this heated battle for who knows how long, and then Veldora evolved his own abilities. I guess you could say that our friendship won the day, yeah?”</p>

      <p>“““…”””</p>

      <p>The stares were almost painful. I could tell that everyone found this a little hard to believe, but that was my story and I had to stick with it.</p>

      <p><a id="page-57"></a>“You know, Rimuru,” Guy began, “I fought pretty hard against Velzard myself, but <em>she</em> didn’t show any signs of evolving her skills.”</p>

      <p>“Hey, I’m sure it varies from dragon to dragon.”</p>

      <p>I knew expecting them to believe any of this was asking way too much of my peers.</p>

      <p>“It <em>varies</em>, eh…?”</p>

      <p>No dice? I’m being doubted <em>so</em> damn much in here. What’ll I do? I <em>could</em> always just tell them the truth—it doesn’t really matter whether they believe it or not. But if I go with that move…</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>If you go with that move, Master, you will be asked to fight against anyone who’s been mind-controlled, and your ability set will be pored over with a fine-toothed comb.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">Right, I’m sure it would. It was all Ciel’s doing anyway, not mine—I couldn’t even begin to explain it. Keeping quiet was definitely the way to go.</p>

      <p>“Enough,” Luminus said. “Clearly he’s in no hurry to talk, and I’m sure it was another incomprehensible miracle on his part anyway. If we can tell who’s under its influence, I’d say Regalia Dominion isn’t as much of a threat as Ultimate Dominion. The question here is how we’ll counter it.”</p>

      <p>The way she saw it, at least we could tell when it was happening. What we <em>really</em> needed to do was discuss how to deal with Michael and his force. I nodded my agreement.</p>

      <p>“Instead of deciding who fights whom, why don’t we work out what moves we’ll make based on where they might strike us?”</p>

      <p>Guy nodded. “I agree with Rimuru. The enemy’s no fool, so I doubt they’ll try spreading their forces wide.”</p>

      <p>We clearly needed a way to call for help if it turned out to be a huge enemy force, or if one of us ran into something we had trouble with. We knew that, but there were problems to address.</p>

      <p>“All right, but <em>we’re</em> spread out, too, aren’t we?” I asked. “Should we all stay in one place to make sure we’re ready whenever the enemy shows up?”</p>

      <p>“Hmm, that won’t work.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-58"></a>“Right?”</p>

      <p><em>Looks like Guy’s on my side, then.</em></p>

      <p>Personally, my plan was to defend my nation with my life. Surely Leon and Luminus would hate to leave their homeland, and the same was true for Daggrull and Milim as well. Okay, I had my doubts about Milim, but I was certain about everyone else. Thus, we needed a system where we could send reinforcements anywhere we might be attacked.</p>

      <p>“True enough,” said Luminus. “We have an obligation to defend our own nations. If worse comes to worst, we may need to abandon our territories, but I’d very much like that to be a last resort.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I agree. And don’t worry, Luminus,” Daggrull urged. “If <em>you</em> abandon your land, I’ll gladly take it for you.”</p>

      <p>“Don’t give me that! I have <em>no</em> intention of letting you have it, so don’t even think about it.”</p>

      <p>Daggrull was ready to take the land, and Luminus was ready to stop him. But beyond their squabbling, it was clear that nobody could leave their home bases.</p>

      <p>“What will <em>you</em> do, Guy?” I asked. “Ramiris lives in my nation, but you don’t really have much in your territory that you need to defend at all costs, do you?”</p>

      <p>“Not really, no. Maybe I’ll pay a visit to Leon. I’m worried about him.”</p>

      <p>Leon scowled at that, but I could understand his concern. He <em>was</em> my biggest worry, and it wasn’t like he had been fully cleared of all doubt yet. That was why we talked about me keeping tabs on him. So Guy was being perfectly valid.</p>

      <p><em>If Guy will be there, maybe I don’t need to watch Leon after all…?</em></p>

      <p>“But here, Rimuru, you have all kinds of extra staff you can send out, don’t you? Go deploy them to Luminus, Daggrull, Milim…and Leon, too, while you’re at it.”</p>

      <p><em>Huh?</em></p>

      <p><em>Whoa, whoa…</em></p>

      <p>This sudden demand from Guy plunged me into the depths of bewilderment.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <a id="page-59"></a><img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">To make a long story short, I couldn’t say no to him. I bravely resisted, but Guy wasn’t interested in hearing it. Even worse, he ordered me to set up transport circles in each of our domains so people could travel to and fro quickly.</p>

      <p>It made me want to shout at him that I wasn’t his employee, but there was one thing stopping me: the fact was that I could never, ever beat him. So it was better just to give up fast. When Guy was serious about something, the sheer pressure he put on you was far too staggering to defy. Maybe I could force my way through it, but it was a lot easier for me to just surrender.</p>

      <p>Who should I deploy, and to where? I needed people with consistent transportation and Thought Communication skills, the ability to work alone in any situation, and a decent resistance to mind control. Along those lines, I could think of three demonesses perfect for the job. But I had already assigned Testarossa to tackle assorted schemes of ours around the Eastern Empire, and I didn’t think I could tap her for this. Carrera and Ultima would have to be my main players. Maybe a few people from my cabinet, too.</p>

      <p>“First off,” I began, “I think Geld would be the best guy to send to Milim’s domain. I need to get construction back on track over there, and you know each other already, so I’m pretty sure he’d sign on for it.”</p>

      <p>“Great! Yeah, everybody loves him,” Milim agreed. “And speaking of which, Middray’s really keen on seeing Gabil sometime, too. He said he wanted to spar with him again.”</p>

      <p>Oh yeah? Not a bad idea, maybe. I had assigned Ultima to train Gabil, and just a few days later, he was already staring at me with tears in his eyes. Maybe Middray could be a nice break for him. Ultima would also join him in that case, but since Tempest was still in war mode, there wasn’t much police work for her to do anyway. Plus, I could call them right back as needed, so this seemed easy enough to commit to.</p>

      <p>“All right. In that case, I’ll send Geld, Gabil, and Ultima to Milim’s domain.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-60"></a>“Okay! Looking forward to it!”</p>

      <p>First one down. Next came the Holy Empire of Lubelius.</p>

      <p>“So, as for you, Luminus, do you have any requests?”</p>

      <p>I’ve learned a thing or two in negotiations like this. I knew she’d fly into a rage if I suggested sending Veldora over. I figured it was better to talk things out before stepping on any landmines.</p>

      <p>“Hmm, let’s see…”</p>

      <p>She thought for a moment before answering. Guess asking that question was the smart thing to do.</p>

      <p>“I’d like to have Shion, the woman you came in with. She’s visited my land before, so she’d be familiar with things.”</p>

      <p>I knew Luminus was a huge fan of Shion’s violin skills. It didn’t strike me as strange that she remembered her.</p>

      <p>“All right, I’ll send Shion over. Her, and…maybe Adalmann and his assistants, too.”</p>

      <p>Adalmann knew Luminus as well. He had some beefs with the Seven Days Clergy, I think, but that was all in the distant past now, so it’d probably be fine.</p>

      <p>“Hmm. Yes, I did cause some…trouble for him before. It could be interesting to provide him with some of my teachings. Very well. I accept.”</p>

      <p>“Roger that!”</p>

      <p>Luminus was now taken care of.</p>

      <p>“Now,” Daggrull said, “who will you send to my domain? I don’t know any of your underlings personally, so I suppose it doesn’t matter too much…”</p>

      <p><em>True enough. If anybody’s okay with him, then…</em></p>

      <p>“I’ll send Carrera.”</p>

      <p>“Carrera?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. You might know her as Jaune, the Original—”</p>

      <p>“Jaune?!!” he shouted, looking tremendously alarmed. “Don’t tell me you’ve tamed <em>that</em> firebrand!”</p>

      <p>“I dunno about ‘tamed,’ exactly, but…yeah, kind of.”</p>

      <p>“You’ll just have to accept that, Daggrull. I know you have things to say about that, but now’s not the time for it.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-61"></a>“And by the way,” added Luminus, “when he said Ultima, he meant Violet. I am just as exasperated about it as you, trust me.”</p>

      <p>Oh, that’s right. The domain Ultima ruled over overlapped with Luminus’s and Daggrull’s lands, apparently, so they had known each other for a while. Luminus’s comment made Daggrull shout out “Gehhhh?!” in abject surprise.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I’m real exasperated, too!” he said to her.</p>

      <p>“And it’s not just Jaune and Violet, either. There’s simply no point arguing over all the insane things Rimuru has done by now.”</p>

      <p>They were having their way with my good name. Milim was nodding along as well, and honestly, wasn’t she supposed to be on <em>my</em> side? Whatever.</p>

      <p>“So…yeah. I’ll send Carrera over to you, okay, Daggrull?”</p>

      <p>“Wait! Wait just a minute!”</p>

      <p>He stood up from his seat, loudly protesting, arms open wide like he was about to start dancing. <em>Hang on, is he trying to defy me?</em></p>

      <p>“Objection! I <em>do</em> believe I have the right to refuse this!”</p>

      <p>His face told me just how desperate he was. Clearly he wasn’t going to give an inch. Leon, meanwhile, was flashing a calm, collected smile, all but proclaiming out loud how glad he was Carrera wasn’t coming his way.</p>

      <p>“Listen, Rimuru. If you send that wild marauder to me, my Damargania will fall in just a few days. I’m not here to make demands, but could you at least select someone a little less hotheaded?”</p>

      <p>Personality counts more for him than strength, I guess. Which, I dunno, a lot of my Tempest friends have a screw or two loose, so…</p>

      <p>I decided to ask him some more questions. Daggrull’s domain was the Holy Void of Damargania, a barren land with little in the way of resources. Most of its structures had been abandoned and reclaimed by the sand dunes. His image of Carrera couldn’t be worse—he basically saw her as this vengeful destroyer who constantly tossed around nuclear magic spells as a kind of hobby. Milim’s nickname was “the Destroyer,” and as far as Daggrull was concerned, Carrera was worse than that.</p>

      <p>“Gee, she’s not <em>that</em> bad of a—”</p>

      <p><a id="page-62"></a>“Yes she is!”</p>

      <p>“I’d agree with Daggrull. She damaged my own lands on a daily basis once, so I think I understand his feelings all too well.”</p>

      <p>Daggrull was staying absolutely firm, and now the normally taciturn Leon was regaling us with tales of Carrera’s violent streak. I had to believe their stories—really, I had no choice.</p>

      <p>So what did that leave me with?</p>

      <p>“All right. In that case, why don’t I have Carrera go to Leon instead?”</p>

      <p>They seemed to know each other, and Guy would be over there anyway. He’d keep Carrera from going too far out of line, right? A pretty good idea, if I do say so myself. And yet:</p>

      <p>“Surely you have to be joking! Did you even listen to what I just said?! I absolutely refuse. I would <em>never</em> let that demon set foot in my lands! <em>Ever!</em>”</p>

      <p>Daggrull was all smiles, but Leon was putting his foot down hard. He was angry enough that I could practically see the italics he was adding to his rant, so I must’ve struck one serious nerve with him. It was kind of funny to see, so I resolved that I’d send Carrera over no matter what. But Guy stopped me.</p>

      <p>“Rimuru, you know you can’t send Carrera there.”</p>

      <p>“Why not?”</p>

      <p>“Because she likes to pick fights with me, too, all the time. And whenever it looks like she’s going to lose, she leaves a few parting words and tries to run away from me, do you know that? <em>This</em> war isn’t any kind of game, and I don’t want to waste my stamina on extraneous distractions. Am I clear?”</p>

      <p>He was correct, of course. And the dreadful tinge to his eyes indicated just how serious he was about this.</p>

      <p>“Now, <em>if</em> Carrera was absolutely faithful in following your orders, and <em>if</em> you are willing to take responsibility for whatever happens, then maybe I’ll think about it, all right? But you know that’s impossible, isn’t it?”</p>

      <p>Hmm… Having it put it in such stark terms didn’t make me too confident. I could stop her if I was standing next to her, but with Carrera, once you take your eyes off her, you just never know.</p>

      <p><a id="page-63"></a>“Right, of course not! Carrera’s the girl who tried popularizing this game in my labyrinth where she tried to punch a hole through as many floors as she could! I wish she’d stop with that! It’s <em>really</em> annoying!”</p>

      <p>Wow. She was being <em>that</em> reckless? Guess she was a problem child in more places than I knew about.</p>

      <p>“For cases like that, Diablo’s the one responsible for supervising her, so I’ll put the screws on him.”</p>

      <p>As I deflected responsibility, I thought about what I should do.</p>

      <p>“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! I dunno, I kinda like Carrera! I’d love to see her, so you can just send her over to my domain as a guest.”</p>

      <p><em>Oh! Here’s Milim giving me exactly the kind of offer I want!</em></p>

      <p>“You sure about that, Milim?”</p>

      <p>“Totally!”</p>

      <p>Great. Problem solved. Milim would host Carrera, and I’d send Ultima over to Daggrull instead. Frey might yell at Milim about it later, but that was none of my business.</p>

      <p><em>Let’s move on before Milim changes her mind.</em></p>

      <p>“Okay, I’ll put Carrera over in Milim’s domain and give Daggrull Ultima. I guess she’s familiar with the area, and you don’t have any complaints about her, right?”</p>

      <p>“No, I don’t want—”</p>

      <p>“Great! It’s settled, then. Daggrull, play nice with Ultima for me, okay?”</p>

      <p>I took that as a green light from Guy. Daggrull was about to say something, but I just pretended I’d imagined that.</p>

      <p>So now I had my assignments for Luminus, Milim, and Daggrull’s lands. That left Leon’s Golden Land of El Dorado. Who would I send there?</p>

      <p>“You know, if Guy’s going there anyway, do I really have to send any of my own people? Besides, Guy can watch Leon to check if he’s suspect. I just don’t see the need to dilute my fighting power for Leon’s sake.”</p>

      <p>I had been wanting to say that. Why did I have to send my forces out of the nation when this huge war was about to break out?</p>

      <p>I mean, it wasn’t all <em>that</em> bad, of course. The three demonesses <a id="page-64"></a>could teleport back home in a crisis, and at worst I could just summon them back anyway. I needed to send Geld out because we couldn’t hold up that construction project forever, and Gabil, well, he was kind of bodyguarding Geld, too, you could say. Geld had more pure fighting power, but defense was his main specialty, so it’d be more helpful if we had a dedicated attacker with him. Gabil was good at both offense and defense, so I thought pairing him with Geld would produce some pretty neat outcomes.</p>

      <p>As for Adalmann and his crew, I really wanted them to focus on labyrinth defense…but sending Shion alone to Luminus’s domain made me anxious. She’s beyond well qualified on the fighting front, but her behavior is, well, dicey at times. Adalmann’s mastered all types of magic, and he told me he knows teleportation travel like the back of his hand. He knows Luminus, and I’m pretty sure he’ll be perfectly polite around her. I thought it was a pretty appropriate assignment, really.</p>

      <p>So all that was set in stone. And now I didn’t have anyone left to send to Leon.</p>

      <p>“Hey, quit being so stingy. You’re practically swimming in Million-Class underlings,” Guy spat.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I am, but I still need people to protect my nation, so…”</p>

      <p>“You worry far too much. You have Veldora, I presume? And how about that Benimaru character? No one would complain about having him.”</p>

      <p>“You <em>know</em> I can’t do that! Benimaru just got married! And he has <em>two</em> wives! And they’re <em>both</em> pregnant! What kind of ogre would I be if I sent him off on assignment until who knows when right at this huge milestone in his life?!”</p>

      <p>Benimaru was ogre-derived himself, however, so he wouldn’t mind… Jokes like that weren’t funny at this juncture, though. If he <em>wanted</em> to go, that was another thing, but…</p>

      <p>Back when lifetime employment was still a mainstream thing in Japan, big companies were known to send employees out on long-term business trips at the worst possible timing—right after marrying, or just after they built a new house—merely to test out their faith in the firm. If there was a good reason for it, then fine, but the <a id="page-65"></a>way I heard the story, this was mainly done to harass employees. Any company that tried that today would get beaten down and go bankrupt in a hurry. And there’s no way I wanted any injustice like <em>that</em> taking place in my own nation…but that was beside the point.</p>

      <p>“Anyway,” I told Guy, “I gotta give a firm no on sending out Benimaru.”</p>

      <p>“Pfft. Your reasoning makes no sense to me, but fine. So who else, then…?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, um, we can send Diablo out!”</p>

      <p>I kept forgetting about him because he was always right next to me—but if I deployed Shion, I might as well deploy Diablo, too. If I left one behind and not the other, that was bound to lead to arguments. Shuna was my <em>real</em> secretary, too, so I doubted them being gone would hobble me much.</p>

      <p>That’s the best decision for everyone, isn’t it?</p>

      <p>“Diablo, you said?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. He’s pretty strong, too. He’ll be fine by himself.”</p>

      <p>“Hold on just one moment, Rimuru.”</p>

      <p>Guy was speaking very softly, but nothing he’d say would be good news. So I ignored him and tried to bring this topic to a conclusion.</p>

      <p>“And, you know, I have a lot to deal with right now. I don’t have enough personnel to pass out just for funsies, but I’m still handing out some of my best aces to everyone. So if you could show some consideration for that, please?”</p>

      <p>When it came to Guy, it was better to start with your final offer than try to negotiate. With that in mind, I recalled my old job as a general contractor, way back when. The HQ chief once fought off one of our partner firms asking for more personnel on a project. Claiming he couldn’t give up any more, stating that he’d already given them his best crew and there was nothing else to offer, that kind of thing. I’m sure the other side thought something like “We don’t have enough people <em>because</em> your staff is so incompetent!” most of the time, but nobody was foolishly honest enough to actually say that.</p>

      <p>Everybody involved, me included, knew that there was little to no sincerity behind this defense. Whether the staff we provided really <a id="page-66"></a><em>were</em> the best or not…well, that depended on luck, mostly. If the local government or partner firm had the right to name who they wanted, that could be a lot more…interesting, though. It certainly gave insight into exactly <em>who</em> your partners actually valued, and who they wouldn’t miss at all if they were gone. But anyway, that’s all well in the past. Right now, my main goal was to palm Diablo off to Guy.</p>

      <p>“Youuu…”</p>

      <p>“Is there a problem?”</p>

      <p>“…”</p>

      <p>“…”</p>

      <p>I waited for Guy’s answer, staying dignified on the outside but sweating it hard on the inside.</p>

      <p>“Tsk. You’re getting more and more shameless every time I see you. But fine. I’ll put up with Diablo this time.”</p>

      <p><em>Whew! I won!</em></p>

      <p>Leon gave me no time to bask in my victory: “Well, I don’t care who I receive. I’d normally want to call Chloe over, but not in these circumstances, of course. And come to think of it, Rimuru…if you’re interested, you should come visit my nation alongside Diablo. I promised I would invite you, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet.”</p>

      <p><em>Bringing Chloe over is out of the question, but maybe I should consider paying Leon a visit?</em></p>

      <p>“Okay. I’ll need to leave Chloe behind, but if our schedules work out, I’ll drop by sometime in the future. I’ll contact you through Diablo in advance when I do.”</p>

      <p>I couldn’t move Chloe around; she needed bed rest for now. Telling Leon that could lead to all kinds of unintended consequences, so I was better off keeping quiet about it. His invite, though, I didn’t mind accepting at all. I may not have the free time for it with everything going on, but just sitting back home and waiting for Michael’s side to act would get boring fast. Once all my prep work was done, I was planning to gradually segue back to my normal lifestyle.</p>

      <p>“Very well. I look forward to hearing from you.”</p>

      <p>“Sure. And if Diablo causes you guys any trouble, just let me know. I’ll reeducate him right then and there…and I won’t take no for an answer.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-67"></a>“Got it. We won’t be shy to reach out, okay? Give him a good lesson for us.”</p>

      <p>This was Guy reinforcing the point, not Leon, even though Diablo hadn’t done anything yet. I wonder why they have it out with each other so much? But maybe I’m better off not knowing. It’s probably a bunch of drama I don’t care about.</p>

      <p>So, with that thought in mind, I had a general idea of our future direction.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">“Right,” began Guy once we returned to the large reception hall we started the day in. “I’m going to set off with Leon right now, but I’m counting on all of you to take action as directed.”</p>

      <p>“Whoa, whoa, you’re not gonna tell <em>us</em> what’s going on?”</p>

      <p>“Mizeri told us some of it, but you could at least explain what direction you’re going to take.”</p>

      <p>Carillon and Frey had a word or two for Guy, it seems, and their concerns seemed valid to me. Guy always had a tendency to hurry things along to their conclusion too quickly. If he was convinced about something, nobody else’s opinion mattered; he’d happily leave them in the dark.</p>

      <p>However, there was no way Guy could explain everything. And not just him. Milim and Ramiris were too childish to remember it all, Daggrull and Leon weren’t exactly gifted public speakers, and Luminus would never volunteer for such an annoying job. We’d get nowhere with any of them, so I needed to step up and do the talking instead.</p>

      <p>“Well, regarding what we’ve all decided upon…you’ve been briefed about our enemies, right?” I asked.</p>

      <p>“Sure, yeah,” Guy replied. “Velzard’s on the opposing side, huh?”</p>

      <p>“It looks that way, yes. But not because she’s betrayed us or anything…”</p>

      <p>I gave them my organized summary. It really <em>was</em> smart to have only us seven demon lords in that conference. If we’d brought our attendants, we would’ve made even less progress. Guy saw that in advance, so it was right for him to make that choice—all those years <a id="page-68"></a>of experience weren’t for nothing. But, really, Guy had it pretty rough, too. We demon lords had, well, an idiosyncrasy or two, and it took an extraordinary sort of mental strength to bring all of us to a common agreement.</p>

      <p>That was how I mentally reevaluated Guy as I finished up my summary.</p>

      <p>“I didn’t think it was very like you to be so frantic like that…but things are a lot more serious than I imagined.”</p>

      <p>Frey was amazed. I think she regretted hearing about it.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, well, I’ve got all this power. I wanna see how far I can go against a True Dragon, but if it’s Lady Velzard, there’s no way I’m ever gonna win.”</p>

      <p>Carillon was talking as boldly as usual, but I could see the sweat on his brow. I’m sure he grasped the levity of this situation, trying to figure out a way through it.</p>

      <p>“Kwah-ha-ha-ha! Your name was Carillon, right? I have never come close to defeating my elder sister. If you wish to test yourself, you should do so against me first!”</p>

      <p>“Master, I <em>seriously</em> don’t think it’s the right time for this. You have to be more serious or else Rimuru’ll yell at you again.”</p>

      <p>Hmm. Maybe Ramiris is right—I <em>do</em> need to yell at him. But Veldora’s over-optimistic chatter is doing a lot to lighten the mood. Getting <em>too</em> serious will only serve to depress us all.</p>

      <p>“Oh, really?” Frey said. “Well, you’d better pool your strength so you can resist being taken over. You can’t resist Regalia Dominion at all?”</p>

      <p>“He can,” I chimed in, “as long as his will’s strong enough. In Veldora’s case, the enemy was aiming for a sneak attack when his resistance would be at its lowest, so…”</p>

      <p>“Indeed, I am sure I could’ve repelled it normally…but it was right in the middle of a battle against my sister, you understand. It was a touch difficult to handle.”</p>

      <p><em>Difficult? You got brainwashed, dude.</em></p>

      <p>I wished he wouldn’t try to downplay it like that.</p>

      <p>“Rimuru,” Daggrull said as I rolled my eyes at Veldora, “do you think you could perhaps send Veldora to my domain while you’re at it? Because I must admit, Vio—er, Ultima and I don’t see eye to eye <a id="page-69"></a>on too much. Veldora, at least, I’m more familiar with. We know each other’s dispositions.”</p>

      <p>He was asking me for a last-minute reshuffling of my job orders, and sadly I had to turn him down.</p>

      <p>“Sorry, but I’m afraid you’re barking up the wrong tree. Veldora doesn’t work for me; he’s more my friend and equal, so I can’t decide for him.”</p>

      <p>If <em>he</em> was fine with it, I had no right to intervene either way…but I wasn’t about to ignore Veldora’s own desires and decide for him. Let’s see what he thinks.</p>

      <p>“Well, Veldora? You have an invite—what’ll you do?”</p>

      <p>Veldora gave me the haughtiest smile possible. “Heh-heh-heh… Daggrull, I do sincerely wish I could stride in to help you, but I am a busy dragon. I have an obligation to keep Ramiris’s dungeon protected, for one!”</p>

      <p>In other words, I realized as I looked at him, he was going to do what he always did—sit around the labyrinth and waste everyone’s time.</p>

      <p>“Master!!”</p>

      <p>I felt bad for Ramiris, shouting with tears in her eyes, but I genuinely felt that Veldora was just looking for the easy way out.</p>

      <p>“Ah. Too bad, then. I’d have quite a bit of trouble defending myself against Velzard if she attacked, you know. Having you on hand to help out would put my mind very much at ease.”</p>

      <p>“Kwa—kwah-ha-ha, <em>kwaaaaahh</em>-ha-ha-ha! Yes, yes, with someone as powerful as me around, even my sister is nobody to fear. A pity, then! Truly a pity, Daggrull.”</p>

      <p>He’s being so blatantly pretentious about this, isn’t he? But Velzard really <em>is</em> big trouble, so I’m pretty glad overall that Veldora’s staying in Tempest. Not very good news for Daggrull, but I really do need to put my own nation’s safety first.</p>

      <p>“Daggrull’s right,” Milim said, overhearing us. “I’ve never fought Velzard before, but my instincts tell me she’s one <em>meeean</em> customer. If she comes over to my domain, I’m the only one who could take her on, and then I wouldn’t be able to focus on anything else. We really need a way for me to call for help on a moment’s notice.”</p>

      <p>She was being perfectly reasonable, of course. It was a surprisingly <a id="page-70"></a>realistic suggestion from the usually overconfident Milim. But I guess it showed just how much we all feared Velzard—and since it was unlikely that she’d attack us solo, we needed to avoid being caught alone out there. I agreed with that, and so did Frey and the others.</p>

      <p>“Very true,” said Frey. “We’ll be careful not to work alone, then.”</p>

      <p>“Yep, we sure will! So, Rimuru, that’s why I want you to bring Geld and Gabil over to me on the double! In fact, I could pick them up for you if you like?”</p>

      <p>“Nah, that’s okay, Milim. I’ll explain things to them when I return and get them ready to depart.”</p>

      <p>Geld had transport-gate skills he could use for travel purposes, so there was no need for excessive rushing. I had to brief my entire cabinet on today’s proceedings, and I figured it wouldn’t be too late if I sent them off after everyone was on the same page.</p>

      <p>“Okay, Rimuru! I’ll leave that to you, then.”</p>

      <p>“Certainly. And we’ll contact you at once if the enemy attacks us.”</p>

      <p>Right, yeah. They’d be receiving Carrera, and by the looks of things, Frey didn’t seem to have realized Carrera was a Primal Demon. No real need to tell her, though. Better to end this conversation on a calmer note. Besides, if our mission was to stop a potential Velzard attack in its tracks, I’m sure they’d have no complaint about deploying Carrera for that.</p>

      <p>“One thing I do wonder about,” added Louis, “is Michael’s goals. I doubt he seeks only to rule this world…”</p>

      <p>“Right, well, what it’s trying to do is revive Veldanava. Michael and Feldway are both trying to resurrect their master, basically.”</p>

      <p>“““Huhhh?!”””</p>

      <p>Everyone who hadn’t heard the news before gasped. My fellow demon lords were already aware, but for everyone else, it must’ve been quite a shock.</p>

      <p>“Yep.” Milim nodded. “Rimuru’s right. Obela’s helping our side now, and that’s what she said.”</p>

      <p>“For real…?” Carillon frowned. “News to me.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, didn’t I mention that? I thought I already told you two.”</p>

      <p>“<em>I</em> sure didn’t hear about it, Milim,” said Frey. “But then, Middray’s to blame for that, too. We’ll need to quiz him in depth about this later.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-71"></a>Just when I was starting to rethink my opinion of Milim, this happened. She and Middray both spoke to Obela, they said, but it looks like the nature of their conversation didn’t come across to her other associates. This is exactly why it’s so important to make sure all your staffers strive to communicate with each other. Of course, <em>I</em> forgot to tell them, too, so I’m not one to talk.</p>

      <p>“But a True Dragon is immortal,” a pensive Louis said as Milim’s crew carried on with themselves. “Veldanava is bound to revive himself in due time. There’s no need for anybody’s help.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, that’s what one would normally think…but this Michael is a self-conscious entity that has taken the form of a skill, something you would never normally expect to exist. Perhaps that’s why it’s contemplating things that would never occur to normal people.” Luminus shook her head in disbelief.</p>

      <p>Guy, meanwhile, had his own thoughts:</p>

      <p>“Yeah, but it’s a fact that Veldanava’s showing no signs of reviving right now. I can understand why people think Feldway might not care if he destroys the world on the way to his desires.”</p>

      <p>Having fought him once before, Guy could confidently attest to Veldanava’s immortality. That, and he understood if someone like Feldway yearned for his resurrection that badly.</p>

      <p>“But doesn’t dying affect some of his memories and personality and stuff?” I asked. “He might wind up being someone completely different.”</p>

      <p>“It would be little more than an aesthetic difference,” Luminus replied. “To me, he would still be one and the same. His soul would be just as it was before.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm… Kinda hard for me to picture. Velgrynd said kinda the same thing—that she didn’t care whether Ludora was reborn as a good or bad guy, just as long as he was reborn. That deserved to be addressed sometime, I felt.”</p>

      <p>“Ah-ha-ha-ha! Looks to me like you haven’t shaken off your prejudices from your human years. But don’t worry. You’ll understand in time.”</p>

      <p>“That’s how it is, huh?”</p>

      <p>I wasn’t too convinced, but to people as long-lived as them, <a id="page-72"></a>concepts like “good” and “evil” might seem like nothing more than ephemeral trends. If so, it’s a reminder that I better cherish my own thoughts on this issue. I mean, what if I decided to start doing evil things? I might turn into exactly the kind of despot the late Maribel worried I’d become.</p>

      <p>I’m a pretty selfish guy, after all. I know that. So no matter what happens, I need to ensure my selfish behavior doesn’t plunge the world into chaos. I got a lot of leeway to do what I want already, but it’s all part of my effort to make this a better world. Causing pain for others in my pursuit of happiness—well, I’d never do that. It’s something I’ve sworn in my heart.</p>

      <p class="tx1">As I thought about the importance of constantly asking myself if what I was doing was all right, Guy suddenly spoke up about something new.</p>

      <p>“Oh, um, Rimuru, I just had a thought.”</p>

      <p>“Mm? I’m not hiding anything else, though.”</p>

      <p>“I kinda doubt that, honestly, but whatever. It’s not that. I’m wondering what Michael might be thinking. For example, how does he intend to awaken Veldanava? If you know, tell me.”</p>

      <p>He was being awfully pushy. I was about to tell him that I had no way of knowing before my own mind stopped me.</p>

      <p>“Oh, actually, didn’t he say something along those lines?” I muttered.</p>

      <p>“Yes, he did,” Veldora said, nodding.</p>

      <p><em>If I recall…</em></p>

      <p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh… Apparently he believes that if he brings the power—the ‘draconic factors’—of three True Dragons together, Sir Veldanava will be reborn. A foolish idea, in my opinion, but one that we can’t completely discount, either.”</p>

      <p>Diablo explained my thoughts before I could. Right, right, it was that sort of thing, wasn’t it? It didn’t seem realistic at all, and it seemed so impossible to make work that I had forgotten all about it. Those “draconic factors” were the keys to it all, apparently.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><a id="page-73"></a><span class="special"><em>You are in possession of draconic factors as well, Master.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1"><em>Ah yes, I’m something resembling a True Dragon now, aren’t I? Maybe it’s a given that I have these factors, then. Anyway.</em></p>

      <p>Even if you could collect the draconic factors from the three remaining True Dragons—Velzard, Velgrynd, and Veldora—I don’t think it’d matter. You’d still be lacking the factors of Veldanava himself, and those were the most important of all. Nobody else would have his soul, after all. Diablo didn’t see it as totally impossible, but still.</p>

      <p>“Huh? That logic is completely flawed, though. The only thing Michael could create with <em>that</em> is a pseudo-copy. And maybe it could imitate all of his abilities, but without that all-important soul, it’s not at all the same thing.”</p>

      <p>Guy apparently agreed with me.</p>

      <p>“Well, I cannot say either way, but if a completed physical body is in place, there may be a chance of the lost soul returning to it.”</p>

      <p>“Mm, could be. Veldanava’s a fully spiritual life-form, so his soul won’t be scattered across the universe like Ludora’s, I don’t think. It’s not <em>impossible</em>, no.”</p>

      <p>Hmm… I think I’m losing sight of the logic here.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>There is no reason for Veldanava’s soul to return to that body. If he wished to return, he could simply recreate his own body for that purpose.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">Right? And with Ciel joining the naysayers, I was now full-on skeptical of the enemy’s plan. If it’s bound to fail anyway, maybe we could just ignore them—</p>

      <p>“Hmm. Then perhaps the enemy’s true goal is obtaining Veldora.”</p>

      <p>Everybody in the chamber stopped.</p>

      <p>“Hweh?”</p>

      <p>Veldora’s half-breathed exclamation echoed across the quiet room. He seemed completely oblivious to this, so it was best to just leave him be. Luminus’s suggestion was far more important.</p>

      <p><a id="page-74"></a>“Ah yes, I’ve been overlooking that. Veldora’s been taken over once already, but his draconic factors weren’t taken from him.”</p>

      <p>I suppose Michael cared more about possibilities than probabilities. If so, then whether reviving Veldanava was a harebrained idea or not, there was a decent likelihood that he’d still be after Veldora’s draconic factors.</p>

      <p>Uh-oh. I never considered Velzard getting mind-dominated in the first place. Now I’m worried our enemy’s catching us flat-footed.</p>

      <p>“Hmm,” mused Milim. “If I recall correctly, Obela said that Emperor Ludora—in other words, Michael—had taken in the draconic factors of Velgrynd. If Velzard has been taken over as well, that means Veldora’s the only one not in his collection!”</p>

      <p>“Whoa, whoa, wait. Are you trying to say that Velzard’s had her factors taken away from her?!”</p>

      <p>Guy looked a little panicked about what Milim just said. I decided to express my own thoughts.</p>

      <p>“You’re really sure about that?”</p>

      <p>“If it’s true,” a somewhat frantic-looking Guy replied, “you know Velzard won’t emerge unscathed. She’s as good a fighter as I am, but the process may very well make her cease to exist, maybe?”</p>

      <p>“Hmm, I’m not sure. In Velgrynd’s case, it was only one of her Parallel Existences that was taken and absorbed. We’re talking maybe a tenth of her overall magicule energy at most, I think, and I bet even that pushed Michael’s body to the limit.”</p>

      <p>That helped reassure Guy a bit.</p>

      <p>“Ah. Yeah, true. As obscenely powerful as a True Dragon is, they’re not gonna be absorbed <em>that</em> easily.”</p>

      <p>I nodded. At the time, Velgrynd had been pretty severely damaged by Carrera’s Judgment Bullet…but even then, she had a lot of stamina left. Michael himself was using Lifestealer (an ability of Yuuki’s) to sap Velgrynd’s life force, but he never fully absorbed her.</p>

      <p>That, and I had a good idea of why Michael tried to banish Velgrynd from this world.</p>

      <p>“Also, he won’t just take away her power and factors—he’ll take her abilities, too. But that’ll cause him to lose his absolute thrall over angelic skills, so he’ll have to be careful about it, lest he get counterattacked.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-75"></a>So Michael’s plan was likely to use and abuse Velzard, weaken her to the limit, take everything she had, and then banish her.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>I agree.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">Right. I can be pretty sharp myself sometimes.</p>

      <p>“But why would he need to take her abilities, too?” said Guy. “If he can rule over her already, wouldn’t it be smarter to use her as a pawn in battle? Why take away all her powers and banish her?”</p>

      <p>Um. Good point. Michael’s abilities gave him access to those of the target he was taking over. He wouldn’t seem to have much reason to seize them entirely. And here I thought my reasoning was perfect, too. Ciel even agreed with me.</p>

      <p>“But you know,” Daggrull said as I wailed over this, “do we really think it’s necessary for Michael to collect every single ability out there to revive Veldanava?”</p>

      <p>“You think he could ignore demonic skills, and the other types, too?”</p>

      <p>“I would imagine so,” Luminus replied. “He might believe the abilities that Veldanava possessed before are the only ‘pure’ ones.”</p>

      <p>I think she was striking at the core of the issue, actually. Pretty impressive, considering she chimed in late on our conversation.</p>

      <p>“So you think he’s trying to collect only Veldanava’s genuine skills, and that’ll let him create the ‘complete’ Veldanava? This omnipotent being who’s created all abilities? It’s a pretty big concept to grasp, but if that’s what Michael wishes for, he’s probably not gonna get it. As long as Leon’s on our side, there’s no way he’ll get <em>all</em> the needed abilities.”</p>

      <p>Guy flashed a bold grin. But I wasn’t sure it was that simple. If he was right, then we’d already foiled Michael’s strategic objectives. I mean, I—or Ciel really, but regardless—had already consumed Raphael, <em>and</em> Uriel, <em>and</em> Raguel.</p>

      <p>But before I could ponder this any further, Ciel offered some assistance.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>When Velgrynd had her draconic factors seized, she became unable to maintain her own existence and was doomed to perish <a id="page-76"></a>even before Dimensional Transfer could be cast. However, it is believed that after you released her main essence, that had the effect of resynthesizing all her energy.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1"><em>Okay. So why bother banishing her at all, after already shriveling her up like that?</em></p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Likely because he feared that she could have revived herself. Taking her draconic elements is a different thing from breaking her soul or heart core. Presumably, he wanted to prevent a revived Velgrynd from exacting revenge upon him.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">With all the qualifiers Ciel was adding to the analysis, this clearly wasn’t a 100-percent guarantee. Maybe that’s why it was avoiding this topic up to now. It always was a perfectionist that way, but I nonetheless appreciated having someone to bounce ideas off like this.</p>

      <p>Is Ciel wavering this much because it doesn’t know what would happen if Velgrynd was resurrected after losing all her abilities?</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Yes, exactly. She was doomed to perish, but that would also mean being released from Michael’s rule. Once that happens…</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">Once it happened, Velgrynd—who’d probably still have her memories from being mind-dominated—might be pretty pissed off. If she saw that this domination was being driven by an ability, she might do away with Raguel (the cause of it), gain her freedom, and reappear before Michael, just like that.</p>

      <p>So he’d just banish her entirely, then, right? Makes sense to me. And with Velgrynd no longer around to exercise her skills on anything, it wouldn’t be strange for him to want to fetch any beneficial skills from her before she went away.</p>

      <p>But I was starting to think the whole “collect all abilities” theory we talked about was mistaken.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Once a skill is created, after all, it can be re-created again and again.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1"><a id="page-77"></a>Right, exactly! Just what I wanted to say. I feel like Ciel’s been polishing that confident streak quite a bit compared to before. What a relief.</p>

      <p class="tx1">With my thoughts now better organized, I rejoined the discussion.</p>

      <p>“Certainly, I think that collecting abilities would benefit Michael, but maybe that doesn’t have anything to do with reviving Veldanava, y’know? I think what we <em>really</em> need to focus on is those draconic factors.”</p>

      <p>“Going full circle on us?” Daggrull asked, eyebrow raised. He seemed pretty sick of this endless talking, and I could sympathize with him. Nothing’s more meaningless than a meeting that doesn’t produce any answers. That’s why I wanted to dish out my conclusion right now.</p>

      <p>“No, I’m just talking about certainties. Michael never talked about abilities at all, so I think those are just kind of a bonus to him.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm… Continue.”</p>

      <p>I didn’t really ask Luminus for permission to continue. I don’t know why she acted so high and mighty like that, but it was time to end this debate, not tease her about that. I wasn’t trying to avoid her, I promise.</p>

      <p>So. The conclusion.</p>

      <p>“Well, if abilities were so important, I have some ideas of who we need to watch besides Leon. So I think we need to ignore that whole question and just focus on keeping Veldora away from the enemy.”</p>

      <p>“Oh? You sound confident about that.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, well… I know I talked about him snatching abilities earlier, which might’ve caused some confusion, but how about we not worry about that for now?”</p>

      <p>Guy looked at me, thinking. “Hmph! I hate to leave the question of why he took Velgrynd’s abilities go unanswered…but all right. You have my trust.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-78"></a>Wow, Guy’s actually a pretty understanding person sometimes.</p>

      <p>I felt I had a solid direction in mind. You could call it me reverting back to my first conclusion, but let’s just gloss over that detail.</p>

      <p>“So that means,” he continued, “the thing we <em>really</em> need to do is keep Velzard and Veldora from facing off against each other. We’ll be counting on you for that, Rimuru.”</p>

      <p>One could interpret this as him palming off more responsibility on me, but accusing him of that would’ve kept us locked in here for even longer, so I just nodded. It’s something I do a lot whenever I’m growing sick of a meeting, but by this point, I didn’t really care.</p>

      <p>So yeah—</p>

      <p>“Oho! I knew it! I <em>knew</em> I would be so extremely important in all this, eh?”</p>

      <p>—I don’t think anyone would blame me for hearing Veldora chime in with this stupid crap, instead of seriously trying to participate at all, and getting a little incensed.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">We were now demonstrably several steps behind the enemy. We all had to admit to that—but it was possible to catch up.</p>

      <p>Veldora didn’t have any angelic skills, and he’d already wriggled out of Regalia Dominion once. The enemy knew that, though, so they would likely try a more frontal approach next time. That meant total war, so our first objective was to get everybody with angelic skills together.</p>

      <p>If I were Michael, I’d definitely be as careful as possible with my actions, yet the main gist of his strategy was still unknown. But no need to panic, either. We were certain that Veldora was the enemy’s main target, so I could just take measures to prevent access to him. In the worst-case scenario, I could even cut out the override circuit inside Leon, though I preferred not to.</p>

      <p>“All right, everyone… Good luck out there. If something happens, drop me a line immediately.”</p>

      <p>With that, Guy wrapped up the Walpurgis Council. “Cooperation” wasn’t exactly a major theme of this conference—in fact, there was absolutely none of it at all—but at least it was over now, at long last.</p>
