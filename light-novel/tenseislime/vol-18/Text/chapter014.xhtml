      <p><a id="page-133"></a>Very reassuring. Gazel’s power, plus Agera’s sword moves, would let him put up a good fight against someone like Kondo, even—or, at least, buy us some more time.</p>

      <p>But…</p>

      <p>“But if that enemy winds up being Velzard, you better not hesitate to run. I’m guessing that with her, it wouldn’t even be a battle at all.”</p>

      <p>“That bad, eh?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. I can’t be sure since I’ve never seen her seriously fight, but she always struck me as scarier than Velgrynd.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm… I hate to admit it, but you’re likely correct. And now that I’ve seen Velgrynd for myself, I know just how rash it’d be to take on a True Dragon. Still…I am a king, and I cannot abandon my citizens.”</p>

      <p>“Well, just pray Velzard doesn’t come for your kingdom, then. If she does, call me.”</p>

      <p>I showed him my cell phone.</p>

      <p>“Ah! Yes! There was <em>that</em>, wasn’t there?!”</p>

      <p>“Like I said before, it’s a magic device that lets you converse directly with me. There aren’t a lot made yet, so take good care of it, okay?”</p>

      <p>That being said, all I gave him was my number and a link to the Control Center’s hotline. He wouldn’t receive El and Mollie’s numbers—it’d be poor manners. He’d need to ask them for those himself. I had coworkers give clients my personal number a few times in my past life, and it annoyed me beyond belief.</p>

      <p>“All right. So I type in the numbers recorded here, and that will connect me to that person?”</p>

      <p>“Exactly, yeah. There aren’t a lot of people with these yet, but if you run into one, you can have them give you their number, too.”</p>

      <p>“Mm. I suppose can discuss matters, then, should I run into trouble.”</p>

      <p>“That’s the intended use of this, yeah. I’ll make sure I can step up for ya when you call me, too.”</p>

      <p>“Very well. I will count on that. And, of course, don’t hesitate to let me know if I can do anything for you, too. I’m personally willing to help in whatever way I can.”</p>

      <p>Gazel and I exchanged smiles. I didn’t think the chances were <a id="page-134"></a>high that Dwargon would be targeted, but this was still a relief—and we now knew how to stay in touch in an emergency, too.</p>

      <p class="tx1">After spending a few days in the Dwarven Kingdom, I moved on to the kingdom of Farminus.</p>

      <p>Gadora, now an apprentice to Diablo, was staying here, aiding Testarossa as well. We were having him provide all the intelligence he could from within the Empire as we tried to build a rock-solid foundation for Masayuki’s enthronement. He was a busy man, traveling frequently between the two nations, but for now he had settled down in Farminus, and I wanted to talk things over with him while I could.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">The Farminus capital was brimming with way more activity than I anticipated. Most of it was under construction the last time I came, and that was still true now, but a lot more of it was looking nice.</p>

      <p>A large rail station had also been completed just outside of the capital, and warehouses lined the streets nearby. This was a stopover point for traffic between Blumund and Dwargon, so they needed a lot of storage space for all the different types of goods that came through. This proved difficult within the capital itself, so the station building was put up outside the city.</p>

      <p>The capital itself was still very much under construction because they wanted to get all the station facilities up and running first, in anticipation of Farminus’s future economy. That, and the current Farminus royal family was surely flat broke. To be brutally frank, I was financing basically the entire cost of this construction. Tempest was contracted to lay the rails for the magitrain lines we were developing, too. You might think we didn’t stand to gain much from this besides goodwill, but think again. We’d be earning all the usage fees, and we also had free rights to all the required land for eternity—really, a mind-blowing deal. Once all this construction was over, we’d do nothing but rake in the revenue. Even minus <a id="page-135"></a>labor, equipment, and rail-maintenance costs, we expected quite a bit of yearly profit.</p>

      <p>So, thanks to those reasons, I was heading up all the magitrain business. Farminus, meanwhile, handled development for all the surrounding urban area. Queen Mjurran was the main person in charge of planning for that stuff, but she had to take some childbirth leave, so Yohm, the king, became a more prominent figure. He kept mentioning how uneducated he was, but I felt he had a lot of natural intelligence; he studied urban planning hard so he could fill Mjurran’s shoes while she was on leave. As a result, even though the pregnancy went without a hitch and she was back in action, Yohm was still the go-to man on the project for the kingdom’s nobility and government officials.</p>

      <p>In order to support his efforts, I offered him a series of low-interest, collateral-free loans. Why weren’t they <em>no</em>-interest loans, you ask? Well, because it’d make the receiver feel so obligated to me that it’d lead to a lot of needless restraint on their part. It’d make the lender feel like the superior party, and then it wouldn’t be a partnership any longer. Lending or borrowing money is a great way to torpedo a friendship if you’re not careful, so we drafted an official contract between our nations and enacted it with a clear understanding between ourselves.</p>

      <p>So, with future economic development the watchword for Farminus at the moment, large-scale construction on the capital was only beginning to roll into action.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Checking in at the gate, I watched people go to and fro in the city for a little while before an express wagon was sent over for us. Normally, I should be bringing in all my top officials so we can do this fancy royal visit, stage a parade down the main street, the whole bit—but these were tense times, and an elegant train journey was out of the question. So I just teleported myself over with Soei and Ranga.</p>

      <p>I contacted Gadora to have him bring us a wagon so we wouldn’t be too conspicuous here in Farminus. The wagon actually came, too, which relieved me. Unlike Milim’s gang, they know how to follow through on promises around here.</p>

      <p><a id="page-136"></a>“Very sorry for the delay! King Yohm is waiting for you, so I’ll take you directly to the palace.”</p>

      <p>In fact, it was Gadora himself stepping out of the carriage. He couldn’t <em>be</em> more careful, could he?</p>

      <p>“Whoa! You scared me. You didn’t have to come meet us at the gate,” I told him.</p>

      <p>“Oh, I’d stand for nothing else! And I hardly get to enjoy <em>this</em> honorable a role any longer, outside of times like these. Besides, Sir Rimuru, if I did <em>not</em> personally greet you, I rather think Sir Diablo would have my head for it!”</p>

      <p>Gadora laughed, but I don’t think he meant it as a joke.</p>

      <p>“Um, if he’s bullying you around, let me know, all right? You answer directly to me, after all, just like him.”</p>

      <p>He looked like an old man, but I talked to him like he was an even older friend. It felt a little weird, but I was used to it by now.</p>

      <p>So I gave him a little friendly advice. Diablo is obedient around me but tends to go off the rails when my attention is elsewhere. We could laugh off his antics over in Leon’s domain, but pulling that stuff on one of Tempest’s closest allies would be a huge problem. Gadora was now Diablo’s apprentice—or part of his family tree, I suppose it’s more accurate to say—so maybe he wasn’t in much of a position to complain. It was up to me as the boss to keep everyone on their best behavior.</p>

      <p>But Gadora laughed and said it wasn’t a problem. Any hardship, he said, was worth it in the name of new knowledge. It was like a fetish with him; I sure didn’t understand it. Best not to get too deeply involved, I thought, resolving to let Gadora continue doing what he wanted.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Inside the carriage, Gadora told me how things went with Masayuki after his crowning. The wagon was taking its time traveling through the city, so we made the best use of it we could.</p>

      <p>“So did Masayuki’s coronation go without a hitch?”</p>

      <p>“It did, yes. Very smoothly, in fact. Of course, Lady Testarossa and Lady Velgrynd were doing everything they could to back it up, so I’d have been more surprised if it were a failure.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-137"></a>“Ah. Well, with <em>those</em> two on our side, I’ll bet it went fine.”</p>

      <p>I wouldn’t want the opposite to be true, but…yeah, about what I figured. Masayuki was always blessed by luck (so to speak), and he had both the talented Testarossa and the rock of strength that was Velgrynd. You’d have to be crazy to oppose them.</p>

      <p>“Once the citizens saw the full glory of Lady Velgrynd,” Gadora said, “they were more than welcoming of the new emperor Masayuki. Really, anyone who was there to see it wouldn’t ever dream of defying her again.”</p>

      <p>Well, yeah. Triggering a volcanic eruption, then using her own powers to block it? Like, she conjured up the biggest natural disaster ever, then put an end to it without causing any damage. I don’t think anyone would complain to her after that. And tapping into a volcano for the task… Velgrynd really doesn’t know what “too much” means.</p>

      <p>“There were <em>some</em> who’ve voiced their disapproval, of course, but I believe Lady Testarossa will be addressing those complaints.”</p>

      <p>“You think it’ll work out?”</p>

      <p>“It will not be a problem. Some, like Sir Caligulio, were concerned that Lady Testarossa would simply kill any potential opposition…but those worries, at least, appear unfounded. She’s making exceptionally good use of the information I provide her, and Sir Moss’s own skills are proving quite impressive. He’s done a perfect job, digging up dirt on the enemy and wrapping things up neatly.”</p>

      <p>I’m sure of that. I’d never want <em>them</em> to work for my enemies.</p>

      <p>“Well, if anyone over there’s brave enough to oppose it, I’d almost want to scout them for my own nation.”</p>

      <p>“You’re certainly right on that point!”</p>

      <p>“I know <em>I’d</em> never say no to them.”</p>

      <p>“No doubt about it. Like I said, anyone who saw what unfolded would feel exactly the same as me.”</p>

      <p>Gadora and I had a little laugh over this. He really is a fun old guy to hang out with. And considering how much we thought alike on this topic, I really feel like we made a close connection here.</p>

      <p class="tx1"><a id="page-138"></a>Inside the castle, we were greeted by the full set of ministers and officials, King Yohm and Queen Mjurran leading them.</p>

      <p>Edmaris, the former king of Farmus, was casually mixed in among them, notably thinner and also with his beard shaved. He looked like a different man from when I first met him—especially given how pure and uncorrupted his eyes looked now. I didn’t speak to him, though, since it’d just be awkward.</p>

      <p>This was technically an unofficial visit, but we informed them in advance that we wanted to discuss the great threat facing us. I’d wish nothing more than for Farminus to be spared in this war, but everybody knew that this was far too optimistic a thought.</p>

      <p>It was still a newborn nation, one with limited financial resources; as mentioned, they were highly dependent on Tempestian investment. What’s more, their military hadn’t really recovered yet. You can’t train a new set of knights in a day, and it went without saying that they didn’t have the budget for soldiers of fortune. I had a lot to do with that, yes, but I’m not planning to shoulder any of the blame. You can’t fight for the greater good if you get bogged down over every little detail. I don’t think everything I’ve done is just, but I still want to declare as much in public. Otherwise, I’d be doing a disservice to everyone who died along the way.</p>

      <p>So, yeah, I owe them one, but I’m not gonna say it out loud. But we have an alliance going, so I intended to offer them as much support as I could. Sending Gadora here was part of it, and the royal court understood that well enough. The government knew, in so many words, that they better not mess around with me too much right now.</p>

      <p>“Well, Boss, things improvin’ any for ya?” Yohm asked on behalf of everyone else.</p>

      <p>“I’ve worked out some countermeasures with the other demon lords, but honestly, we’re gonna have to see what happens. But that makes me pretty anxious, so I’m visiting a bunch of different nations at the moment.”</p>

      <p>Gadora had already reported the news, so I didn’t see any surprise from him. He showed me where to place my transport magic circle without prompting, too.</p>

      <p><a id="page-139"></a>“You can ask Gadora here for help on fine-tuning and how to use it.”</p>

      <p>“Any time, Sir Rimuru.”</p>

      <p>“So we can use this to evacuate if we’re against the wall, huh? But the big question is, who’ll stay and who’ll go?”</p>

      <p>“It’s an important one, yeah. Your destination may not be much safer. It might be a cold comfort at best.”</p>

      <p>“Well, Boss, if <em>your</em> nation gets taken down, there ain’t gonna be no runnin’ anywhere after that, for sure. If it happens, we’ll just chalk it up to fate, y’know?”</p>

      <p>Yohm was awfully brisk about it. The other ministers nodded in agreement. Maybe people around here fear me more than I gave them credit for. The prevailing wisdom seemed to be that if <em>I</em> couldn’t beat something, they had no chance to start with—a pretty funny thing to think, really.</p>

      <p>“Hey, don’t just admit defeat like that. You’re supposed to struggle until the very end, you know that?”</p>

      <p>“Sure we do. My baby girl was only born a little bit ago—I’m not about to die now! She hasn’t even called me ‘daddy’ yet!”</p>

      <p>Glad to see he’s already a doting father. He was poking at Mieme, the little girl in Mjurran’s arms, as he spoke.</p>

      <p>“I didn’t know that… But don’t crowd her too much. You’ll wake her up.”</p>

      <p>That was likely to anger Mjurran, her mother, so I thought fit to offer that advice. Being thoughtful like that is the sign of a successful person…I think…probably.</p>

      <p>“I wish you were around to say that more often,” a sighing Mjurran said. “Whenever this girl comes up, it’s like he loses all common sense.”</p>

      <p>Sounds like a pretty typical set of parents, then.</p>

      <p>“Well, you know that stupid wolf who claims that it’s <em>his</em> girl. We can’t let our guard down for a moment!”</p>

      <p>I had no idea what Yohm was talking about.</p>

      <p>“Don’t be ridiculous! I’m second in line for the throne, so that means I’m gonna marry Mjurran someday! And when I do, that’ll make Mieme <em>my</em> daughter, you know!”</p>

      <p>“God dammit, Gruecith, stop with that creepy junk already! <a id="page-140"></a>How many times do I have to tell you—your whole <em>assumption</em> is demented!”</p>

      <p>Oh. Okay. Yohm’s a little weird, but Gruecith the “stupid wolf” is wholly off his rocker. I know Mieme’s cute and all, but any claims that she belongs to him are sheer fantasy.</p>

      <p>“I must admit, I have to side with Yohm here…”</p>

      <p>“Right? You hear that, Gruecith? I <em>knew</em> you’d understand, Boss!”</p>

      <p>Apparently Yohm was obsessed about hanging with Mieme whenever he could find time in his busy schedule, lest she forget about him as a father. It was a very touching effort he was making, just to ensure that Gruecith didn’t somehow win her over. Still, in times like these, having a distraction was important. No matter how stupid it was, anything that kept your mind off things should be welcomed.</p>

      <p>However:</p>

      <p>“Just try not to act stupid <em>all</em> the time, okay? Because comic-relief characters often wind up being the first to die.”</p>

      <p>I decided to offer a little advice to Yohm and his court, based on my video game experience.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">We held a more formal conference in an assembly hall that dated back to the glory days of Farmus. The itinerary was pretty well laid out in advance, so things went smoothly with my presentation.</p>

      <p>I wasn’t asking Yohm and his government for war support. All I’d be doing was helping Farminus’s people evacuate, if need be. That transport magic circle didn’t have enough capacity for everyone, so we needed to decide in advance who’d have access to it. This I asked them to work out for themselves, so there wouldn’t be chaos if push came to shove.</p>

      <p>That being said, any destination they’d go to might not be safe, either. The main goal of this magic circle wasn’t to transport dignitaries out, but to transport needed warpower to where it belonged. If Farminus became a battleground, the newly established knight corps would be called up. Gruecith had been training up both the new recruits and the old Farmus knights, but I couldn’t expect them to be nearly enough. So I planned for reinforcements to be sent <a id="page-141"></a>from other nations. It’d be nice if we could set everything up in advance, but we didn’t know where the enemy would aim at first, so we needed as much flexibility as possible.</p>

      <p>In terms of importance, Farminus was admittedly rather low priority. If the kingdom fell, we could rebuild it later. As long as we kept casualties to a minimum, I didn’t see the need for them to resist down to the last man. I wavered over telling Yohm’s government about this, but I did, and they accepted it well enough. Worst-case scenario, we’d help them rebuild; I promised them all the support I could spare for that.</p>

      <p>This sort of political groundwork was key if we wanted to use our limited resources as best we could.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I know, Boss,” said Yohm. “I know you’re not gonna just abandon us.”</p>

      <p>“Nah. But keep in mind, the transport magic circle can only handle fifty or so people at a time. It’s not nearly enough to be cheering about.”</p>

      <p>“Still, a nation’s only obligated to protect itself, y’know? But here you are, makin’ all these arrangements… Why, I couldn’t hardly ask for any more!”</p>

      <p>I felt like Yohm directed that less at me and more at some of his dubious government ministers. I could understand their point of view, even if they didn’t voice it—they wanted help, they didn’t want citizens to die, and they wanted more weaponry. Unfortunately, I could only spare so much. I’m sure they understood; that’s why they begrudgingly agreed to it.</p>

      <p>Regardless, that was the end of my errand in Farminus.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">Yohm then took us around to see a few sights. The most impressive one was the construction site where they were building some of their most important facilities.</p>

      <p>Farminus was using the same capital city as Farmus, so the central part of town, encircled by defensive walls, was the noble quarter. The neighborhoods grew poorer the farther away you went from <a id="page-142"></a>there, with free citizens shunted out to the far edges of the city walls. A lot of rezoning was going on to address this inequality, and as part of it, they were digging up the road that went through the heart of town and building a large tunnel. This would house a subway that’d go from the station next to the capital right into the city itself.</p>

      <p>“Pretty ambitious move.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, Mjurran is really somethin’ else. Using magic to evaluate the strength of the ground, comin’ up with all those plans…”</p>

      <p>Magic really is a cheat sometimes. Geological surveys were a pain in the ass at the best of times, but a talented enough sorcerer could complete one without breaking a sweat…or breaking any ground. Searching for underground water veins, cavities, weaker soil, other features—they could grasp all of that. In fact, they could even conduct soil improvements, working with earth, sand, soft or hard soil, you name it.</p>

      <p>All hail magic! No wonder science hasn’t advanced much around here. That’s exactly why the Empire, and those vampires we treated as weirdoes, were seen as so unusual for their focus on technology. They’re making incredibly beneficial discoveries, though, so I saw no reason to make fun of them.</p>

      <p>“Well, it’s nothing I would have come up with. I didn’t think tunneling shields were something I’d ever see in this world, for example, but with magic, you can kind of build the equivalent, can’t you?”</p>

      <p>“I dunno what that ‘tunneling shield’ would be, but I’m sure our stuff’s just as good, huh?”</p>

      <p>“It’s this thing that bores through the earth while providing a support structure to prevent cave-ins. It’s a really large-scale machine, but a talented sorcerer could do the same thing, yeah. Or even better, maybe.”</p>

      <p>I remember telling people in the past that it’d be neat if we could run trains underground. Mjurran remembered that, and now she actually made it happen, which left me beyond impressed. Razen apparently pitched in as well, helping to complete this out-of-the-box otherworld approach to construction. It saved a lot of money, too.</p>

      <p>And besides, it’s not a matter of winning or losing. Applying the <a id="page-143"></a>right technology to magic really could trigger a revolution around here, I felt.</p>

      <p>“So we’re thinkin’ that we’ll delay construction for now and use the tunnel as a shelter. The ceilings are all reinforced by magic, so it should hold out even if some magic blast torches the city.”</p>

      <p>“It’ll depend on the scope of the destruction, but I think it’d make for a good air raid shelter, yeah. Keep a supply of food and water in there, and you could hole up in there for a pretty long time.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, and it sounds like we can magically supply the water, so we’d only need to ship food inside. We dug several tunnels for use as sleepin’ quarters, along with rooms with doors and big holes in the bottom. For use as latrines, they told me.”</p>

      <p>He took me into one such room, which…well, was a public bathroom, all right. It was divided into lots of cubicles, and I’d estimate a good hundred people could use it at the same time. The toilets were the standard sit-down type, but waste just dropped right into the hole below like an old-style outhouse.</p>

      <p>“But won’t it stink really bad, being underground and all?”</p>

      <p>“You’d think so, wouldn’t you? But we spread wood chips and stuff like that underneath, and they said it removes the smell entirely.”</p>

      <p>Oh. So it’s like one of those composting toilets? That was outside of my expertise, but you could use these microorganisms to break down waste and turn it into water and carbon dioxide, right?</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>That is generally correct, yes. I have checked this facility and confirmed that it does function as intended, so problems related to smell are unlikely to occur.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">Ah, wonderful. And as Yohm explained, they had five of these bathrooms ready to go. Sounds like they’d be all set, even in the event of a long siege. The tunnel also extended all the way underneath the palace, keeping the royalty prepared for anything. I was relieved to hear that—relieved, and newly excited about the technology of this world.</p>

      <p>“So, yeah, our city’s defensive barrier is airtight, and we’re holding <a id="page-144"></a>evacuation drills regularly, too. The moment we spot the enemy, we’re sendin’ everyone right down there.”</p>

      <p>“That’s why your ministers didn’t demand too much from me?”</p>

      <p>“Well, pretty much, yeah. And I ain’t about to let any of ’em act stupid in public, either. If all they can do is whine about how tough life is, well, don’t let the front door hit ya on the backside on the way out, ’n all that.”</p>

      <p>As Yohm saw it, anyone can complain—what matters is keeping your head up and being constructive. This he told me with a smile. I gotta say, he’s grown such an incredible amount from when I first met him. It was a reminder that anybody’s got the potential to transform, if they’re really forced to.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Back on the surface, we headed over to their training grounds. I wanted to see how well Gruecith was training the new Farminus knight corps.</p>

      <p>There I found that they had around five hundred knights that ranked B or higher, along with three thousand that merited a C or below. If they gathered able-bodied citizens from across the land, they could amass a force of around forty thousand…but numbers like that won’t count for much in this war, so this corps was chiefly focused on peacekeeping duties.</p>

      <p>“Makes sense. If a huge angel force came along, it’s not like they could do very much from the surface.”</p>

      <p>“Right. We got some anti-air magic, to be sure, but not a whole lot of sorcerers to cast it, y’know? Rommel decided that it’s better for us to concentrate on defendin’ our city via legion magic.”</p>

      <p>“Razen agreed with that, too,” added Gruecith, “so that’s how we’ve been conducting our training. For these knights, if enemies come flyin’ down from the air, their mission’s to get the residents to safety.”</p>

      <p>At least they weren’t sending them out for a bloody battle against the invaders. That gladdened me.</p>

      <p>“I was a bit worried you’d take a far more reckless strategy.”</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! I’m a lot more of a coward than Sir Phobio, y’know. I realize how far my abilities can take me, and I’m not going to take <a id="page-145"></a>any further risk,” Gruecith said. “Of course, Razen <em>has</em> been training me, so I think I’m stronger than before. And I had a sudden surge of new power recently, too. So I’m ready to be a shield for our citizens. I’ve got a knight-captain title to live up to!”</p>

      <p>I wouldn’t call him a coward at all. Cold decision-making is the one asset any commander needs the most. Knowing how calculating Gruecith can be, I doubt he’d misjudge any gaps between himself and the enemy.</p>

      <p>But I wondered what that “surge of new power” was. Certainly, Gruecith’s magicule count put him up there with the Three Lycanthropeers, rating maybe a special-A. Between that and his skill level, I was sure he’d grown into quite a powerful presence. And even though his lot was cast with Yohm now, he never forgot his respect for Carillon—and given that “surge,” the reverse was probably true as well. It proved there was still a deep bond between the two of them.</p>

      <p>“Well, that’s because Carillon had an awakening and evolved. You got to enjoy some of the effects of it.”</p>

      <p>“Sir Carillon did?!”</p>

      <p>“Yep. So don’t let that new power go to waste, okay?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, of course, yes! I know that full well!”</p>

      <p>“Ah, I’m sure you didn’t need me to remind you.”</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! Don’t worry about it. I’m glad to know the reason, and Sir Carillon fully recognizes <em>your</em> talents as well. I genuinely appreciate it.”</p>

      <p>Nice. Didn’t want him thinking I was lecturing him or something.</p>

      <p>“Great to hear, then. By the way, you said Razen was training you?”</p>

      <p>Good old Razen. It’s thanks to him that I thought about spreading ramen across this world in the first place. He was a sorcerer, wasn’t he? But he can outclass Gruecith in battle, too?</p>

      <p>“Oh, yes, Razen can do just about anything. His magic knowledge is on par with Mjurran’s, and—”</p>

      <p>“Hey, that’s <em>Queen</em> Mjurran to you, bozo!”</p>

      <p>“Ah, shut up. She’ll be mine someday, you—”</p>

      <p>“Shut that damn mouth of yours right now!”</p>

      <p>“Okay, okay, enough fighting. You were saying?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-146"></a>I was getting a little sick of this comedy act, so I pushed things along.</p>

      <p>To sum up Gruecith’s explanation, when Razen seized the body of an otherworlder named Shogo, he was able to make that guy’s power his own. He couldn’t take all the skills and stuff, but Razen’s kind of in-the-trenches experience made him both a wizard and a first-class martial artist. He was killer when it came to punch and kick attacks, and that’s what he was imparting to Gruecith.</p>

      <p>“The idea of fighting just with your natural gifts… It made no sense to me at first.”</p>

      <p>Gruecith chuckled a bit.</p>

      <p>“I’ll bet,” replied Yohm. “Saare beat Razen in muscle, but he couldn’t even beat Razen in an arm-wrestling match. Nobody could take him on in actual combat, either. Man, was I impressed. Razen’s name as a magic-born was huge all across the Western Nations, and I sure could see why.”</p>

      <p>“No wonder the Three Lycanthropeers kept such a keen eye out for him. But…”</p>

      <p>Gruecith stopped there, looking at me, and then he shook his head.</p>

      <p>“Oh, I know, Gruecith,” Yohm said, patting him on the shoulder. As I wondered what this meant, they looked at each other and sighed.</p>

      <p>“There’s always someone better out there, huh, Boss?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, exactly. And when he was faced with Sir Gadora, Razen got played with like a little baby, too. I just about lost my mind, watching it.”</p>

      <p>Ah. That kind of thing? Well, yeah. Diablo called Razen a “weakling who’d never cause me any problem,” and I got a bunch more people like him, besides. Gadora’s strong, for sure. I had no doubt about that, but in Tempest, he’d maybe be in the middle ranks? But after becoming part of Diablo’s family, I think he’s been undergoing some kind of weird evolution, so maybe I’ll need to adjust my opinion. Still, I don’t think he’d make it to the top ranks.</p>

      <p>This talk was making me wonder what Gadora was up to, actually.</p>

      <p>“But speaking of Razen and Gadora, I don’t see either of them in here. Are they off doing something else?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-147"></a>Yohm gave me a half smile. “They’re trainin’, of course. They show up for things like your visit or when we’re talkin’ about our future direction, but outside of that, they’re pretty much always fightin’.”</p>

      <p>“For real?”</p>

      <p>“Really real, yeah!”</p>

      <p>Gruecith was nodding, too, so it must be true. Here I thought Gadora’s talents were more strategic in nature; I didn’t know he liked fighting that much. Maybe Diablo’s been a bad influence? That concern flashed across my mind, but I hurriedly banished it.</p>

      <p>“If you’re curious, I could bring ya over.”</p>

      <p>I gratefully accepted Yohm’s offer, and so we were off to see how Gadora and Razen were doing.</p>

      <p class="tx1">We were taken to a field a good hour away by carriage. On it was a simple little cottage, a bit reminiscent of a vacation home, and nothing else—just wild plains, as far as I could see. Only four people lived here, Yohm said, and I could guess who they were: Razen, the most powerful fighter in Farminus; along with two of the former Three Battlesages, Saare and Grigori; and finally, Gadora. <em>Pretty interesting combo</em>, I thought; when we arrived, they were all standing in a row to greet us. It was kinda weird seeing Gadora speak for them as if he was their boss.</p>

      <p>“It is a tremendous honor to see you travel all the way here!” said Gadora.</p>

      <p>Razen, Saare, and Grigori bowed along with his greeting—to me, not Yohm.</p>

      <p>“Hey,” said Yohm. “I’m here too, y’know.”</p>

      <p>“Your Majesty,” Razen said, “Saare and Grigori are guests of Farminus, but they have not pledged your loyalty to you. They were therefore expressing their respect to Lord Rimuru, the master of Sir Gadora, on their own volition.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, I know. You don’t have to keep lecturing me over stuff that’s better left unsaid.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-148"></a>Razen tried his best to assuage the whining Yohm, but to me, they seemed a lot friendlier with each other than I thought. I don’t know how Razen felt about it, but he <em>was</em> considered a loyal subject of Farminus. I didn’t think he had a shred of loyalty for Yohm, but judging by this attitude, maybe he cared about him after all.</p>

      <p>But outside of them, I had no idea why Saare and Grigori would care to act polite around me.</p>

      <p>“By their own volition, though? Why act so nice to me?”</p>

      <p>I was curious enough to ask. Yohm looked on, just as curious about this; I guess it was news to him, too. If they wanted to move to Tempest, I could consider the request. I don’t think Hinata was out hunting for Saare and Grigori so she could execute them as traitors or whatever.</p>

      <p>“We have a very clear reason, my lord. Our instructor Master Razen has shown us just how immature we were…but Holy Master Gadora has shown us the true nature of your majesty. It has left a deep impression upon us, and we now wish to be a part of your force, however low you may place us!”</p>

      <p><em>Holy Master?!</em></p>

      <p>“Yes, indeed. Sir Gadora’s strength was beyond imagination, Your Majesty, but he tells us that he couldn’t even hold a candle to you. And not just you! When he told me there were many strong people in your force that he couldn’t stand a chance against, well, it inspired in us a desire to try our hand against them sometime…”</p>

      <p>Grigori was eagerly pleading his case, but he got interrupted by Ranga jumping out from my shadow.</p>

      <p>“Well said! Grigori was your name? I always thought you had immense potential! If I may suffice, I would happily let you test your skills against me!”</p>

      <p>“Ah… <em>Ahhh!</em> It’s that dog from back then!”</p>

      <p>“Hmm?”</p>

      <p>“N-no, um…Sir Ranga, I mean.”</p>

      <p>Grigori was breaking into a worryingly intense cold sweat as he stood there shaking. I guess Ranga kicked his ass at some point—did that cause some kind of trauma in him? No way.</p>

      <p>“Well, if he’s offering, why don’t you accept?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-149"></a>“Huh?!”</p>

      <p>“Gladly, my master!!”</p>

      <p>“N-no, I…”</p>

      <p>“Come, Grigori. Let us go a distance away, so we do not harm my master.”</p>

      <p>“Ah, wait…!”</p>

      <p>So Ranga grabbed Grigori by the neck—with his mouth—and joyfully pranced off. I couldn’t see Grigori’s expression, but I’m sure he was delighted that his wish had come true and stuff. It almost teared me up, seeing them go, and everyone else was the same way.</p>

      <p>“Um, I’d like to test my skill as well, but, er, I’m still too immature, so I’d maybe prefer someone a little lower in rank…”</p>

      <p>Saare sounded like he’d rather be anywhere else right now.</p>

      <p>“I’m sure. Ranga’s strong enough to be my watchdog, so he’s ranked pretty high, yeah. Grigori sure ain’t afraid of a challenge, is he?”</p>

      <p>“Absolutely not! I believe he’s cultivated a fear of dogs ever since he lost to Sir Ranga. Perhaps he’s attempting to overcome it today?”</p>

      <p>Saare’s conjecture made Razen bring an embarrassed hand to his forehead. Next to him, though, Yohm and Gadora were chatting away.</p>

      <p>“Not even I could pose a threat to Ranga,” said the old man. “He must truly be a fool.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah? Pretty drastic treatment he’s taking, I guess. Well, good on ’im. <em>I’d</em> never volunteer for that.”</p>

      <p>“You don’t need to, Your Majesty. As the king of this land, nobody is seeking physical feats of strength from you.”</p>

      <p>“Well, I <em>do</em> wanna get stronger, y’know. I just know my limits these days, is all. Now that I’ve come to know Rimuru and his whole gang, it’s pretty damn clear to me that a little muscle doesn’t count for too much.”</p>

      <p>“It won’t go to waste, perhaps, but you’re right. At best, it’d let you struggle on for a bit longer until help hopefully arrived in time.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. But I’ll keep up my training, y’know? Gotta protect the people I love, as much as I can.”</p>

      <p>“A fine idea.”</p>

      <p>Seemed like Yohm was beginning to settle into his position as king. <a id="page-150"></a>Better not let him get ahead of me. I’m not planning to perform any crazy stunts like Grigori, though. It’s one firm step after the other.</p>

      <p>And it looked like Razen had recognized Yohm as king, too. “As long as the king keeps doing his all for his nation,” he said, “I will do everything I can to help you. I have a promise with Queen Mjurran that I will take in Princess Mieme as an apprentice in due time, so I’ll be <em>sure</em> to protect her above all others.”</p>

      <p>He had supported the Kingdom of Farmus for hundreds of years, and I’m sure Yohm loved having a rock like him around. But I was thinking about something else—namely, how much Razen spoke like an old grandfather, despite not looking that far removed from college.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">As we talked about this and that, Ranga came back with a limp Grigori in his mouth.</p>

      <p>“My master, we only played a little bit, and then he stopped moving!”</p>

      <p><em>Too much, boy!</em></p>

      <p>“Look, you’re not Shion, are you? You know how to hold back a little, right?”</p>

      <p>I evaluated Grigori as I scolded Ranga. Fortunately, the man had only fainted.</p>

      <p>“I have to say, he should have known better. Why did he mention Ranga out of nowhere?”</p>

      <p>I could understand if he wanted revenge or something. But he really needed to know his place.</p>

      <p>“I’m not so sure that’s the case, Boss.”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>“He’d <em>never</em> want to fight him. In fact, he told me he didn’t want to ever see him again.”</p>

      <p>“Really?”</p>

      <p>That’s what Yohm and Saare said, but maybe I had this all wrong, then? Because Saare, in particular, said the exact opposite a little bit ago. So instead of being delighted to see Ranga again, he wanted to run away as soon as possible?</p>

      <p>“…No, I’m not so sure. He was a courageous man, boldly striving <a id="page-151"></a>to take on a foe he had already lost to once. I’m really moved by that. That’s why I gave Ranga permission to fight him. Right, Ranga?”</p>

      <p>If I called it my mistake, that’d be admitting responsibility. Grigori was safe, luckily, so I pretended to not know any better. And Ranga kindly backed me up.</p>

      <p>“Yes, exactly! I was so overwhelmed by the force of this man’s spirit that I’m afraid I went a little too far!”</p>

      <p>What a talent. And way to gloss over all <em>his</em> own mistakes, too. He’s developed a bit of a crafty streak lately, not that I’d know who he got it from. But thanks to his clutch teamwork, Yohm and his friends were convinced.</p>

      <p>“Yes, Sir Rimuru is exactly right. Isn’t he, all of you?”</p>

      <p>“Um, yeah, if the boss says so, I’m sure it’s true.”</p>

      <p>“I have no disagreement with that. Perhaps you were mistaken, Saare?”</p>

      <p>“Ah, right! Yes, Grigori’s become a far gutsier man as of late…”</p>

      <p>Good, good. No problems now.</p>

      <p>“Yeah. I respect that kinda thing. A lot. I know! I’ll call him <em>Mister</em> Grigori from now on!”</p>

      <p>That was my reward for him…but when he opened his eyes, Grigori himself promptly turned down the offer.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

      </div>

      <p class="tx1">My little tour of Farminus was over.</p>

      <p>After talking it over with Yohm, we agreed to let Saare and Grigori live in Tempest for training purposes. I worried about Farminus losing those valuable weapons, but with Gadora still there, I was sure it would work out. Him and Razen, too. Unless the main enemy force attacked all at once, they could probably buy enough time until we showed up. If <em>that</em> happened, Saare and Grigori would be little more than a drop in the bucket anyway. So, instead of fretting over every scenario, I decided to work on their talents and prep them for whatever came up.</p>

      <p>By the way, comparing all of them in terms of fighting power produced some pretty interesting results. In terms of their estimate <a id="page-152"></a>magicule count alone, Saare was at the top, followed by Razen, Grigori, then Gruecith. Yohm—no offense to him—wasn’t even in the competition. With Hakuro’s hellish training and the abilities of his equipment, he could just barely rank an A, and I wouldn’t expect him to grow fast in a short time.</p>

      <p>Gruecith, I have to say, was truly one of the Beast Master’s Warrior Alliance elites. The gifts from Carillon had brought him up to the level of Grigori, the ex-Battlesage…but it’d be a problem for a knight captain to leave the nation and he wasn’t asking to anyway, so I didn’t take him. He said he’d pay us a visit once everything was wrapped up.</p>

      <p>So here’s Grigori, the first new guest to Tempest. An iron wall of a man with a special skill known as Impervious. He likes to wield a halberd, but he’s a talented martial artist as well. He lost big to Ranga, but he was Enlightened-level, putting him close to a demon lord seed, and his existence points totaled around four hundred thousand. Certainly stronger than I thought, and with the right training, he might even have another breakout.</p>

      <p>He’d join us alongside Saare, the former Chief Knight of the Master Rooks over in Luminus, although he lost the role after Hinata defeated him. A former Battlesage, he’d fought against Diablo, which eventually brought him over to Farminus. Guess he has a knack for picking bad opponents. Just like Grigori, luck hasn’t always been on his side, but there’s no doubting his abilities. As a Saint, his EP was over a million, a shocking discovery for me. Having him attempt a serious labyrinth run could be pretty neat.</p>

      <p>Razen, by the way, was only a little higher than Grigori in magicule count, but his actual power was well above Saare’s. When he took Shogo Taguchi’s body, he apparently also earned the unique skills Berserker and Survivor.</p>

      <p>According to Ciel, unique skills may either bond to a person’s heart core, be carved into their soul, or take residence in their astral, spiritual, or material bodies. There are abilities that can seize skills from the enemy, but they only work if the skill is “in residence” like that. Some exceptional skills can reside in the soul instead, but those could be snatched away as well.</p>

      <p><em>So if a skill’s carved into a soul, that makes it much harder to steal?</em></p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em><a id="page-153"></a>Not for certain. However, if it has bonded to a heart core, it is impossible to remove.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">Ciel sounded confident enough about that. You <em>could</em> just copy a skill instead of stealing it, though, which is why Michael could do all this crazy stuff…</p>

      <p>But anyway, after obtaining these two unique skills, Razen realized that he could take far better advantage of them than Shogo could. That’s why he dominated Saare despite having maybe half his magicules—a real testament to his abilities.</p>

      <p>However, that was only in the early stages. Saare had his own unique skill, something called All-Rounder, which let him identify and learn any technique after watching an enemy use it just once. Razen, aware of this, had taught Saare every technique and magic spell he could think of. Magic was an “art” as well, a skill derived from one’s knowledge, and while he wasn’t a natural at it, Saare never complained, constantly asking for more instruction. That’s why he called him his “master.”</p>

      <p>So, by this point, Saare was stronger than Razen in name and deed. But Gadora still beat the crap out of him, apparently. How do their EPs compare?</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Displaying Gadora’s information.</em></span></p>

      <div class="top">
        <p class="ul-list">Name: Gadora (EP: 1,126,666)</p>

        <p class="ul-list">Race: High-level chaos elemental Metal Demon</p>

        <p class="ul-list">Protection: Noir clan</p>

        <p class="ul-list">Title: Servant #2 “Poochie”</p>

        <p class="ul-list">Magic: Dark magic, elemental magic</p>

        <p class="ul-list">Ability: Ultimate gift Grimoire</p>

        <p class="ul-list">Tolerances: Cancel Melee Attack, Cancel Ailments, Cancel Spiritual Attack, Cancel Natural Elements, Resist Chaos Attack</p>
      </div>

      <p>There were a few things in his file I could comment about, but it was best to focus my limited energy elsewhere.</p>

      <p><a id="page-154"></a>I was asking for a comparison with Saare, but in terms of EP, Gadora was ahead of him. Honestly, I didn’t think he had grown this strong. He sure wasn’t at <em>this</em> level before his reincarnation anyway. His magical knowledge was now off the charts, his skill levels quite a sight to see…but when judging battle skill alone, I wouldn’t call him a threat. He was a shrewd player, though, crafty to the core—if he were on the enemy’s side, you’d want to crush him first. That was my honest evaluation of him.</p>

      <p>Thinking of it that way, I’d say Gadora made a string of good choices. He was still alive, for one, and he was now a full member of my hierarchy. In terms of ability in actual battle, he had surpassed Saare the Sage.</p>

      <p>Saare’s All-Rounder skill is quite a menace, but actually quite simple to counteract—just use a basic, frontal approach, and you’re all good. No arts, no magic—just overwhelming melee strikes. If you <em>do</em> resort to magic, cast it when you’re going in for the kill, so he can’t copy you. I had heard Saare lost to Hinata, and now I could guess why. Hinata never dropped her guard, so I’m sure she fought Saare without revealing any of her cards. This meant he had nothing to copy from her, so he immediately lost the advantage his unique skill gave him.</p>

      <p>This time, too, the clincher that helped Gadora beat him was the presence of his ultimate skill. Gadora’s just as crafty, after all, so maybe he didn’t reveal his full hand to Saare, either…but even if he did, Saare wasn’t likely to copy it. A unique skill can’t compete against an ultimate, after all. Looking at it that way reminded me of how eminently unfair it was, me being able to shower my subordinates with ultimate gifts.</p>

      <p>The ultimate skill Grimoire, by the way, was in the same family as Adalmann’s Necronomicon and boasted similar abilities. These included Hasten Thought, Universal Detect, Lord’s Ambition, Cast Cancel, Analyze and Assess, All of Creation, Mental Strike, Browse Knowledge, and Share Concept. Browse Knowledge let him learn stuff from Ciel, and Share Concept was a skill that let him share stuff with Adalmann, apparently. Another case of Ciel taking someone’s wishes and turning them into just the right abilities.</p>

      <p><a id="page-155"></a>Anyway, that explained why Gadora was stronger than Saare. And I also had a general idea of Saare’s actual ability, too.</p>

      <p>I knew that the Crusaders were making regular labyrinth runs, but Apito’s floor was as far as they’d reached, right? And that was before Adalmann’s evolution, so I’m not sure how good a reference point that is…but anyway, they had visited the labyrinth recently, and we had a full set of data for them. Arnaud and Renard were the standouts in strength among their band, their existence points both close to half a million. The other squad leader–class Crusaders were at around three hundred thousand, too, definitely a big leap up from the early days. That put them on the same level as Grigori, and maybe it’d be fun to put them all in the same party, actually.</p>

      <p>As for Saare, I think I’ll pair him up with Hakuro, given how easily he can learn other people’s arts. He’d probably make a great training partner for the kids, and I wanted him to learn a lot in Tempest. Not any of our national secrets, but still.</p>

      <p>So I now had a general idea of how Saare and Grigori would train with us.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">For the time being we’d let them get used to things down in the labyrinth. I gave Benimaru a quick rundown about Saare and Grigori, so they’d be sent to their respective training sites when the timing was right.</p>

      <p>“So I’ll be taking care of someone again?”</p>

      <p>“If you could, please. Throwing them right at Hakuro might just lead to confusion.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, true,” Benimaru said with a chuckle. “But we went through the same experience, remember. You sure you’re not being overprotective?”</p>

      <p>He had a point, but this pair were guests of Tempest. If they were moving in for good, that’d be another thing, but I didn’t want them to get <em>too</em> reckless.</p>

      <p>And speaking of training…</p>

      <p>“So how are Carillon and Frey doing?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-156"></a>“Heh. It’s pretty interesting, actually.”</p>

      <p>The moment Benimaru said that, Ciel put up some data for me.</p>

      <div class="top">
        <p class="ul-list">Name: Carillon (EP: 2,773,537)</p>

        <p class="ul-list">Race: Beast-god; high-level chaos elemental Lightsoul Beast</p>
      </div>

      <div class="top">
        <p class="ul-list">Name: Frey (EP: 1,948,734)</p>

        <p class="ul-list">Race: Bird-god; high-level chaos elemental Skysoul Bird</p>
      </div>

      <p>Damn, my labyrinth was scary. Ciel was giving me these EP figures—basically people’s personal information—in a flash.</p>

      <p>When Carillon and Frey evolved, they achieved some level of divinity. Frey’s EP was just under two million, but I guess she still passed the test for demigod-hood anyway. It must not be a strict cutoff.</p>

      <p>Their skills and tolerances weren’t divulged to me, but awakening and becoming a true demon lord granted them all the strength you’d expect. Awakening boosted my magicule count a good ten times over, but Carillon and Frey didn’t seem to power up quite that much. It must vary from person-to-person.</p>

      <p>In my personal estimation, pre-evolution Carillon had an EP of around seven hundred thousand, with Frey’s maybe a bit under four hundred thousand. Assuming that wasn’t wholly off the mark, Carillon’s strength went up four times and Frey’s nearly five times. But then, maybe <em>my</em> stats were relatively low when I went through with it? When I thought about it, that was pretty obvious. I really need to think in terms of how much improvement was shown, not how many times stronger they became. It seems clear, though, that the more EP you have, the more intense the power you receive upon awakening.</p>

      <p>Now it was time to use this data to perform a little battle analysis.</p>

      <p>Carillon’s bodily abilities nearly tripled when he transformed, but convert that into EP, and I don’t think it was even a doubling. No, I think that’s just a temporary ability boost—that transformation didn’t give him omnipotent powers, safe to say. It just meant he’d <a id="page-157"></a>get weaker again once time expired. That also applied to Gabil and his crew, not just Carillon—if not for that time limit, they’d just spend all day transformed, after all.</p>

      <p>Still, transformation does have its advantages. It heals your wounds, refills your stamina, and does a bunch of other stuff. It was one of the merits of being a lycanthrope, and I wasn’t about to downplay it. All about how you use it, really.</p>

      <p>So how well was the transformed Carillon using his newfound powers?</p>

      <p>“How’re they looking to you?” I asked Benimaru.</p>

      <p>“Well, Sir Carillon took me on first. Revenge, as he called it.”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>“Do you remember when we sent an observation team over to Eurazania? He failed to land anything on me back then. So I tested out the awakened Sir Carillon to see how much I had grown.”</p>

      <p>Hmm… I think some wires got crossed. I wanted to test out Carillon and Frey’s powers with everything I had, not Benimaru’s. What would that achieve?</p>

      <p>…On second thought, maybe that’s no biggie? Benimaru, fighting for keeps, against Carillon, bringing out everything he’s got. In the labyrinth, where nobody has to die… I couldn’t imagine a more entertaining card, actually. Ramiris and her team recorded everything for me, so I’ll sit back and relax with the video later. For now, let’s just hear the results.</p>

      <p>“And who won?”</p>

      <p>“Me, by a nose.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, that’s great!”</p>

      <p>I praised Benimaru, but internally, I was unsure how to react. I realized that something in me was so assured of his victory that hearing how close it was unnerved me.</p>

      <p>“But by a nose, huh? How did it go?”</p>

      <p>Before Benimaru could address my curiosity, an image flashed across my mind.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>It appears Carillon unleashed one of his hidden techniques as his first move.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1"><a id="page-158"></a>Nice one, Ciel. It immediately gave me the info I sought. And as Ciel said, the video revealed that Carillon was the first to move. Weapon in hand, he sank down in a flowing motion—and the next moment, his entire body began to glow. Then he quite literally turned into a storm of particles, all streaming Benimaru’s way.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Carillon has named it Burst Roar. It transforms his body into a sentient stream of particles that plunge into their target. Call it an ever-changing scattering/converging particle ray.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">Sentient, huh?</p>

      <p>With Carillon awakened, he’d acquired all the unique traits of a spiritual life-form. I could see how the light doubled back and consumed Benimaru after he dodged it the first time.</p>

      <p>“The moment the fight began, I felt a shiver down my spine…or I could just <em>tell</em> something bad was coming my way,” Benimaru explained. “I knew I couldn’t just stand there, so I triggered some Shimmering Haze…”</p>

      <p>This Shimmering Haze was something at the deepest level of his Formhide skill set. It kept any kind of attack from tracking down his body. Unless an ultimate skill was involved in the attack, it’d never work against him.</p>

      <p>If he didn’t use that, however, Benimaru would’ve lost in the first shot. Carillon was working at a speed several hundred times the speed of sound, in a similar vein to Velgrynd’s own ultraspeed attacks. I’m amazed Benimaru dodged it, but if the light could home right back in on him, there was nothing he could do. It took his ultimate skill Amaterasu, Lord of Shimmering Flame, to hold out against it.</p>

      <p>“So your sixth sense and your ultimate skill made all the difference.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, it was quite dangerous. My pride convinced me that victory would come far easier. It’s proven to be a good, if painful, lesson.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I had no doubt you’d win, so I’m not sure how to take this, either. Pride and carelessness are two shortcuts to defeat, you know, and they’re also difficult to keep watch over. Good thing you picked up on this before the <em>real</em> fight.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-159"></a>“I know. Even if I’m aware of it, my subconscious still lets me grow conceited. That’s why they call it being careless, but it’s truly a scary thing.”</p>

      <p>“You said it.”</p>

      <p>Carillon gave us both a good reminder of the dangers of underestimating matters. I had to thank him for that.</p>

      <p class="tx1">After that little postmortem, I sipped the cup of café au lait prepared by Shuna as we continued talking.</p>

      <p>“Did you fight against Frey, then?”</p>

      <p>“No, after watching the two of us fight, Frey decided that she didn’t have a chance against me. You know how she hates wasting time and effort, of course.”</p>

      <p>“Ah, yes, she <em>did</em> seem that way.”</p>

      <p>I nodded. Benimaru was right. And Frey was never the belligerent type, so I could understand that reaction. She was much more methodical, something that Milim complained to me endlessly about. It was beyond infuriating to Milim, in fact, but it was none of my business, so I just nodded and said “yeah” a few times.</p>

      <p>“So, after that, we talked about the two of them marching into the labyrinth to see how far their skills could take them.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, that’d be the quickest and easiest way to test her strength, maybe.”</p>

      <p>“Yes. They both went in solo, beginning on Floor 51.”</p>

      <p>The video played in my brain as Benimaru commentated. Ciel’s always on point like that.</p>

      <p>First, Carillon. He gave Benimaru a good run for his money, and he proved why as he steadily advanced. Gadora was absent from Floor 60, so he got a free pass through there, but chances are Carillon would’ve wiped the floor with him. That’s how much of a head of steam he had going.</p>

      <p>It turns out he had “tested his strength” against Adalmann and his army, too, back when they returned to do some fine-tuning on the transport magic circle. It was three against one, and Carillon <a id="page-160"></a>still took them down easily. It’s hardly a wonder why—he wasn’t shy about using Burst Roar back then, either, and Adalmann had no time to devise any countermeasures. Venti was their tank, with Alberto providing hit-and-run raid attacks and Adalmann serving as main attacker—but that combo fell apart the moment Venti got toasted first. Carillon then went straight for Adalmann, ignoring Alberto entirely—like a mighty lion on the hunt, mane flowing in the air.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Actually, it’s the female lions that do most of the hunting for—</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1"><em>I</em> know <em>that!!</em></p>

      <p>Ciel’s commentary is incredibly useful, but sometimes I feel like it’s making fun of me. And it’s not the first time. It’s been going on since back in the Great Sage days, hasn’t it?</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>I will be more careful.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1"><em>If you could, please.</em> I nodded, my feelings hurt.</p>

      <p>But anyway, Carillon’s Burst Roar had an insane amount of force. Adalmann’s main attribute is light, but so is Carillon’s. There was no advantage or disadvantage there, so it just came down to a strength contest.</p>

      <p>The thing that piqued my interest was the fact that Adalmann possessed an ultimate gift. I don’t think Carillon had an ultimate skill, or any God-class gear, either. So how did he beat him? Because I think Ciel smugly stated to me that only an ultimate could beat another ultimate…</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>That is not in my memory.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1">Oh, it’s not?</p>

      <p>I feel like I’m being gaslit here, but I’m not too confident <em>I’m</em> right, either…</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><span class="special"><em>Carillon now has the properties of a spiritual life-form. That, combined with the force of his will, has likely given him strength equivalent to an ultimate.</em></span></p>

      <p class="space-break1"><a id="page-161"></a>I see. That thinking makes sense. So Carillon simply possesses enough attack force to overcome a Multilayer Barrier reinforced by Adalmann’s Necronomicon.</p>

      <p>“Sir Carillon’s next opponent was Kumara. She sent a request to fight him ahead of anyone else remaining, and we accepted it.”</p>

      <p>“Oh? Yeah, Zegion’s stronger than her nowadays. Maybe I need to rethink the labyrinth’s boss floors sometime soon.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. But it actually resulted in a pretty good fight.”</p>

      <p>More video popped into my brain.</p>

      <p>Kumara went all-out from the start, declining to summon any of her tail beasts. She had heard about Adalmann’s defeat, but apparently she didn’t ask how the battle proceeded. Knowing your enemy’s preferred moves can make a world of difference in battle, but she made a deliberate decision to challenge him fair and square.</p>

      <p>Carillon had the EP advantage, but Kumara had the ultimate skill Bahamut, Lord of Fantastic Beasts. Here, too, he broke out Burst Roar first thing—but this time, the light formed into several flashing rays, extending out at Kumara from all directions. In response, Kumara leaped into the air and invoked Dominate Gravity. The sudden intense gravitational pull made the light itself bend, pushing it down so it struck nowhere but at her legs.</p>

      <p>I don’t think Kumara planned that defense; it was just a bit of good luck for her. But she failed to capitalize with a counterattack, opting instead to prioritize her healing. Couldn’t her tail beasts’ legs propel her instead? She could resurrect those anytime if she had the magicules for it, which would make it hard for an evenly matched foe to knock her out entirely.</p>

      <p>So Carillon’s first strike didn’t work, and soon after, he reverted back to his usual form. There must be a time limit to that “particle” mode after all. But instead of pursuing Kumara, he kept his distance, White Tiger-Blue Dragon sword at the ready. Kumara watched him from above, and he sneered back, thinking about his next move.</p>

      <p>Their eyes met, and the next moment, there was an intense rumble. Kumara dove down at terminal speed, unleashing a piercing <a id="page-162"></a>attack with her nine tails. Carillon, on the other side, focused his magic on his blade and invoked Beast Roar.</p>

      <p>It was Kumara who won the clash. Carillon’s particle beam dissipated, and the White Tiger-Blue Dragon sword shattered to pieces.</p>

      <p>“Victory is mine!”</p>

      <p>Shouting with joy, Kumara attempted to strike the final blow. But it didn’t go as planned.</p>

      <p>“Not so fast,” Carillon whispered—and only after Kumara’s heart was torn apart did that whisper echo against the walls. His weapon was in pieces, but it was not broken. The jagged fragments floated into the air, following his will, and they formed particles of light that stabbed Kumara from behind.</p>

      <p>It was all over. But Carillon, not one to let his guard down, kept going, mercilessly firing another Beast Roar at the limp Kumara to end it for good.</p>

      <p>“…And that’s how Sir Carillon won.”</p>

      <p>“Sounds like it. And, you know, given how much stronger Kumara’s gotten, I can’t believe she was beaten so easily.”</p>

      <p>“Well, that’s how battle works. Good thing this wasn’t a real fight, at least.”</p>

      <p>“Right. I think it’s great experience for her, too.”</p>

      <p>Seeing Carillon storm down my labyrinth was a humbling experience. I was <em>so</em> sure of myself, too.</p>

      <p>“I wonder if us volunteering to host Sir Carillon was itself an overly arrogant move to make. We have much to teach him, and much to learn as well.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I’m sure. Some people say being a teacher is a good opportunity to discover what you’re lacking.”</p>

      <p>The idea being, I guess, that if you’re asked something you don’t know, you can’t just talk your way out of it. You need to quickly investigate the answer, then make it your own.</p>

      <p>In this case, I feel like staging these real fights with Carillon is teaching us to be more careful in battle. Still, the same was true for Carillon. I think he’s refining his battle style more and more with each fight. If Kumara had fought him before Adalmann, I bet we would’ve seen the opposite results—that was how wonderful Carillon’s growth was.</p>
