      <p><a id="page-213"></a>Kagali was amazed.</p>

      <p>“No! Please, no. Forgive me, Zarario, please forgi—”</p>

      <p>Zarario had not allowed him to state his name again.</p>

      <p>“Jupiter Flash.”</p>

      <p>A single flash of lightning danced from his fingertips, a defined bolt that seared Gnohm. His body was unharmed, but the heart core had been overwritten with a cataclysmic amount of data, re-initializing it with a new personality.</p>

      <p>It was a staggering power to have. Zarario had not actually been seriously fighting in Ramiris’s labyrinth at all. And Kagali, witnessing this force, realized just how hopeless her situation was.</p>

      <p><em>Well, that’s it. This isn’t the kind of opponent I could even begin to fight. I thought Deeno was a lot of trouble, but this man… He’s in the same class as Guy, or Milim…</em></p>

      <p>It was of another dimension. And it was at that point when Kagali gave up all further resistance.</p>

      <p>“So,” she drummed up the courage to ask, “what’s going to happen to me?”</p>

      <p>If she was going to be executed, so be it—she just wanted to retain her pride until the end.</p>

      <p>“Nothing’s going to happen. I suppose Gnohm was causing you some trouble, but don’t expect an apology for that.”</p>

      <p>“What?”</p>

      <p>The matter was so quickly resolved, it puzzled Kagali. But from Zarario’s point of view, he was telling the truth about everything.</p>

      <p>Kagali had been picked up by Lieutenant Kondo, but Kondo himself was only carrying out Feldway’s will. She had been taken so she could create vessels for further physical incarnations, using a skill granted by Michael. That was now complete, and although it resulted in only nine bodies, they were all excellent specimens.</p>

      <p>As transcendent beings, Zarario and his team needed to be choosy about which bodies they would incarnate into. Regular humans and monsters, much like the temporary bodies they were currently using, would disintegrate under the kind of power they wielded. It was a similar situation to back when the Primordial Angels fought each other, competing to get incarnated first.</p>

      <p><a id="page-214"></a>These difficulties manifesting themselves in the material world made their invasion strategy far more difficult than it should have been. Then Kagali happened to be in the right place at the right time, and they came up with the idea of using the walking dead as a base. They’d need to experiment first, but the results were superb. They’d later stumble upon the idea of using Vega’s body as well…but the side effects of that led directly to Gnohm’s outburst. This body seemed to be altering Gnohm’s very personality for the worse. Zarario chalked it up as a failure.</p>

      <p>By comparison, the walking dead had no free will. And since Footman had clearly just proven his powers, it was decided that he’d be strong enough to withstand being possessed by Zarario and the others.</p>

      <p>“Well, so much for the idea of using that man Vega. Gnohm was always a more prudent man than that. I can only assume the body was influencing him the wrong way.”</p>

      <p>Zarario muttered those words to no one in particular. To Kagali, they were food for thought. She replied to him without thinking, even though what he’d said needed no response.</p>

      <p>“Vega’s a greedy man. He symbolizes power itself. He practically lives off desire and ambition—and it enhances him.”</p>

      <p>“Oh?”</p>

      <p><em>Uh-oh</em>, she thought. But it was too late. Zarario was silently pressuring her into continuing.</p>

      <p>“Vega is a very pure-minded man. He serves the strong and preys on the weak. It may be vile of him, but those are the convictions he lives by. And that’s what makes him so powerful.”</p>

      <p>He never feels bad about losing. If he thinks he can’t win, he won’t hesitate to become as servile as possible. If he can survive and take that experience to the next round, he’ll see that as a win. That’s why Vega has never felt like he lost. Any opponent who lets him go is a fool who he’ll get even with someday, once he’s able to beat him.</p>

      <p>That was how Kagali saw Vega.</p>

      <p><em>But in terms of greed, of course, Sir Yuuki is the clear winner.</em></p>

      <p>Yuuki had a good grasp of Vega’s personality, and he had the strength to take advantage of it. Kagali had to respect him for that.</p>

      <p><a id="page-215"></a>“I see. So you’re saying that this greed, this insatiable desire, has penetrated so deeply into Vega that it exists at the cellular level?”</p>

      <p>Kagali didn’t think she had explained herself well enough. Now she nodded at Zarario’s precise analysis.</p>

      <p>“Exactly. So I don’t recommend propagating his cells for use in your projects, to be honest.”</p>

      <p>“I’ll make a note of that,” Zarario said, turning his eyes toward the castle. “But…yes, there’s no making use of <em>him</em>, then. Follow me.”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>Zarario was already walking briskly toward the castle. Gnohm, who barely registered with anyone here now, followed. Kagali wasn’t sure what to do, but she decided that disobeying him was unwise.</p>

      <p>“You all follow me, too,” she told her comrades.</p>

      <p>“Right away.”</p>

      <p>“Okay!”</p>

      <p>So Kagali came after Zarario, accompanied by Footman and Teare. Yuuki also followed Kagali, as if that were perfectly natural of him.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">The only ones left there were Deeno, Pico, and Garasha.</p>

      <p>“So now what’re we gonna do?”</p>

      <p>“What <em>can</em> we do? It’s none of our business.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah.”</p>

      <p>“That’s what I sure think, yeah. But Pico, don’t try to ingratiate yourself with Deeno too much. I can’t have <em>you</em> turning out all weird on me, too.”</p>

      <p>“Okay.”</p>

      <p>“Hey, why’re you talking about me like I’m some kind of failure?”</p>

      <p>“Well, aren’t you?”</p>

      <p>“You’re the lamest angel ever. <em>Totally</em> a fallen angel!”</p>

      <p>“Oh, shut up! I bet you think that sounds really cool, but shut up!”</p>

      <p>Their shouting echoed across the small house they occupied.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="tx1">Upon stepping into the castle, Kagali was immediately impressed by how majestic it was. She thought she had expended every effort <a id="page-216"></a>to make the castle she gave Clayman as luxurious as possible, but now she realized she hadn’t done nearly enough. That royal palace she lived in long ago looked like a hovel compared to here.</p>

      <p>“It’s wonderful…”</p>

      <p>“Of course it is. This is the home of Lord Veldanava.”</p>

      <p>Kagali hadn’t expect a reply. It made her rethink her opinion of Zarario; maybe he was a lot more open to conversation after all.</p>

      <p>She mulled this as they reached their destination—a room with two large cultivation tanks, looking a bit like a laboratory. Five people were surrounding one of the tanks, and floating inside of it was something human-shaped. Taking a closer look revealed a figure who looked like Vega’s identical twin.</p>

      <p>The staff all turned upon noticing Zarario, bowing their heads. “Welcome back, Sir Zarario,” one of them said on their behalf. This man’s name was Dhalis—mystics were all genderless, strictly speaking, but he had been serving Zarario in a male form since way back from his time as a cherub.</p>

      <p>Zarario gave him a light nod and immediately announced his business.</p>

      <p>“The project’s hereby canceled.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

      <p>Dhalis didn’t ask why. Zarario’s words were always correct, no matter what he said, and as they saw it, their only job was to follow them. This was why angels were consistently described as having little self-awareness, and why Gnohm was so easily influenced by Vega’s cellular-level greed.</p>

      <p>“I went through all the trouble of granting all of you names. Now I’m not sure the benefits were worth it.”</p>

      <p>“I’m very sorry, sir. Are we at fault in any way?”</p>

      <p>“No, nothing like that. Surely I was just expecting too much.”</p>

      <p>Zarario always did his best at everything, but he didn’t expect every single outcome to be perfect. He tried to accurately evaluate the results he was given, in the hopes they’d come in useful later on. Thus, no matter the outcome, he never had an emotional attachment to his projects.</p>

      <p>Dhalis, meanwhile, was deathly afraid of disappointing Zarario. <a id="page-217"></a>Despite his frustration, he meekly followed his words, ordering his staff members Gnohm and Berun to shut off the cultivation tank. Neece, Dhalis’s fellow supervisor, had no objection to this, ordering her researchers Behm and Sonne to assist her. While Dhalis and Neece had defined genders, the same was not true for former throni like Gnohm. However, as Zarario mentioned, they had recently obtained names, which subsequently helped them grow distinctive personalities. They were becoming individuals now, although it was still a work in progress.</p>

      <p>During one invasion Zarario wished he could take back, Cornu—a fellow Mystic Leader—lost control over some of his troopers because they were possessed by the locals. This was due, they believed, to a weak sense of ego among the angels. As a countermeasure, it was decided to grant names to the top management—but only the ex-angels among them. However, after several decades, the amount of change was still pretty scant, leading Zarario to believe that little further growth could be expected. That was why he was looking for a suitable vessel for himself to possess.</p>

      <p><em>…I thought using Vega’s body as a base for cultivation was feasible, but I had no idea even his cells were so corrupted. The only other way is to use the walking dead we’ve created…</em></p>

      <p>They had only nine of them, which was enough to provide bodies to the current top ranks. But Feldway was also planning to have Michael invoke Armageddon in order to boost their strength further. When it happened, instead of summoning a vast number of angels at once, they planned to concentrate their energies and create a handful of all-powerful seraphim. That’s what the walking dead were for.</p>

      <p>The people serving Zarario directly—even Dhalis, his right-hand man—were ranked only second in the hierarchy. There was a need to amass great power, the kind that couldn’t be shaken by anything—and so the walking dead had to be reserved exclusively for the seraphim.</p>

      <p><em>Well, fine. We don’t know how many we can summon, so there’s no need to be hasty. I’ll discuss this matter with Feldway later.</em></p>

      <p>Zarario was about to leave, but then he heard the sound of shattering glass. The cultivation tank was destroyed.</p>

      <p><a id="page-218"></a>“Wait! Wait, god dammit! How dare you rip my arm off like that! It’s you, right? I’m taking it back!”</p>

      <p>With the tank put offline, Vega was awake and on the move. His target: Gnohm, with Vega’s cells inside of him.</p>

      <p>“Hng… Grrrrrrrhaaaahh!!”</p>

      <p>Before anyone could stop him, Vega grabbed Gnohm with an arm. That was all it took for the fusion to begin. In a scant few seconds, Gnohm was fully absorbed into Vega’s body.</p>

      <p>“Oooh! This is delicious! This power… It’s coursing through me!”</p>

      <p>Vega was overjoyed. Gnohm contained an enormous amount of magicules, and now they were boosting his own power.</p>

      <p>“Kah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! This is perfect! I could take on any of you bastards right now— <em>Ooh?!</em>”</p>

      <p>But his ego trip ended when his eyes met Zarario’s.</p>

      <p>“I’ve heard about you. Which will it be—will you be a grown man and befriend us, or will you fight right here?”</p>

      <p>Vega didn’t need long to decide.</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh… Sorry. Got a little carried away. I’m takin’ your orders, of course.”</p>

      <p>It was impressively pathetic of him. Zarario expected it, so he didn’t show any dismay. <em>I thought so</em>, was how he took it.</p>

      <p>Losing Gnohm was an unfortunate event, but he had helped further strengthen Vega. In the battle to come, they didn’t need a vast army—they needed a few exceptional talents. The more allies like <em>this</em> they had, the better it’d be for them all. Besides, Gnohm had just lost his sentience, lowering his value as a useful pawn. If anything, they were better off feeding his power to Vega. It was a heartless move against someone who had served him for eons, but those were Zarario’s thoughts on the subject.</p>

      <p>And if that was Zarario’s will, nobody else had any complaints. Vega’s bout of violence was forgiven, and they all treated him as a close friend.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Kagali, watching all this, couldn’t help but feel exasperated. Vega’s attitude was terrible, but it was hard to understand why Zarario was willing to tolerate it so readily. He didn’t act like Yuuki <a id="page-219"></a>one bit, so she had trouble guessing his thoughts. Yuuki, at least, fully understood the danger Vega presented, and handled him well. But Zarario…</p>

      <p><em>Does he even think Vega’s dangerous at all? I don’t think so. Is that just how far above everyone else he is in strength?</em></p>

      <p>That was how Kagali saw the situation, and she was right. Zarario didn’t even see Vega, as he stood now, as a threat. Those who served him were little more than slightly useful tools in his mind. But that wasn’t arrogance. Zarario, after all, wasn’t mistaken when he thought that. He had a knack for correctly assessing information, something far removed from arrogance. It was far too incomprehensible for Kagali to understand, though.</p>

      <p>“Hey. That you, Kagali? Man, and Yuuki’s with ya, too, huh? The gang’s all here, ain’t it? Let’s have some fun while we’re together, eh?”</p>

      <p>Vega, noticing Kagali, called out to her. There was no way she could beat him; if Teare and Footman double-teamed him, the result would be a coin flip, and Yuuki was still deprived of his free will. For now, it was best to just play along with him.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I guess so. Friends, right? We’re all in a pretty different set of circumstances right now, after all.”</p>

      <p>“You bet. But, hey, where are we?”</p>

      <p>“They call it the Celestial Palace. I don’t think there’s any escaping from here, so we’ve got no choice but to obey these people.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah? Well, no point tryin’ to escape. I’m sure they’re gonna need my power anyways. Might as well enjoy it, huh?”</p>

      <p>Kagali was jealous of how naïvely undeterred Vega was. Zarario didn’t seem to want anything to do with Yuuki, but she couldn’t guess what those controlling him were after. Dead Birthday could be her ticket out of here, but she couldn’t really be sure of that yet. A forbidden curse that required tens of thousands of dead bodies to work wasn’t something you could organize overnight.</p>

      <p><em>I need to find a way to make us seem useful. I’ll abase myself as much as it takes if it lets us survive.</em></p>

      <p>She had come this far. There was no possible way they’d abandon their hopes at this point. Right now, surrender was the name of <a id="page-220"></a>the game. They were prepared to throw away their pride…and that resolve would soon be put to the test. Michael and Feldway were back.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">The center of the castle housed an audience chamber. The throne, however, was empty. No one had sat on it for a long time.</p>

      <p>Chairs were lined up across the hall, people sitting wherever they pleased. Michael was seated in the one closest to the throne, Feldway standing next to him and glaring at the rest of the audience. Deeno’s group was here—this was one event not even he could skip out on—and the newly-born walking dead had also been taken inside.</p>

      <p>And that wasn’t all. Obela, along with her close associate, had also been summoned on short notice.</p>

      <p>This assistant’s name was Ohma, and it was the only close one Obela had left after the others were killed in battle against the cryptids. As one can surmise from this, Obela was often sent over to the bloodiest, most grueling battles. The transformation to mystic beast had cost Ohma both eyes, but in their place was a single eye that could perceive everything. Its mouth was also visibly stitched shut, leaving it to communicate via telepathy instead of words. It was a scary sight, but it was also a former cherub and a tested warrior who had served Obela for ages upon ages.</p>

      <p>Feldway had taken in more than just Obela and Ohma. There were also insectors, foes he had fought a near-eternal war with—but now they were building an alliance. Zeranus the Insect Lord was the leader of this group; he was accompanied by his closest officers, the so-called Twelve Insect Masters, although they only numbered eight at the moment.</p>

      <p>One of the missing members was Razul, guardian deity of the west. Under Zeranus’s orders, he had invaded the key world over two thousand years ago, only to betray his lord and become an ally of Granville in his Hero days. He was a noble, proud insector, but he met his end at the hands of Shion and Ranga. Another absent member was Minaza, an insect general sent by Zeranus to assist <a id="page-221"></a>Emperor Ludora. He had promised Minaza half of the world as compensation, but—by cruel chance—she, too, was defeated by Shion.</p>

      <p>The remaining two missing members were still very young, born more recently to serve as replacements, but they were currently absent without leave. One of them was a direct descendant of Zeranus, so a top-secret search order was out for him…but he was still missing at this time.</p>

      <p>However, the eight Insect Masters present were all capable of fighting on par with awakened demon lords, just as Razul and Minaza had been. Among them was Zeth, chief insectoid general and another relation of Zeranus. His strength set him apart from the others, and he and Zarario were close rivals, often dueling each other with deadly force.</p>

      <p>The strength of the other seven was largely equal. There was Beethop, who bore both bee- and grasshopper-like traits; Mujika, who looked like a giant humanoid centipede; Tishorn, resembling a mantis; Torun, a drone beetle–like insectoid with dragonfly-esque wings; Abalt, with spider-like limbs on his back; Sarill, a poisonous scorpion; and Piriod, as beautiful as an antlion.</p>

      <p>These strong figures all stood there, not bothering to sit as they showed off their strange and unusual characteristics. The audience chamber was quite large, but so oppressive were their figures that they made the space seem smaller. Kagali was in awe, but remained silent, ready to watch events unfold around her.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Once everyone was assembled, the meeting with Michael began.</p>

      <p>“Thank you for coming,” Feldway began. “With Ludora’s disappearance, Sir Michael is now free—and we have also successfully banished Velgrynd, the first step toward resurrecting Lord Veldanava. With this, our plan is—”</p>

      <p>Zarario chose this moment to interrupt. Normally he wouldn’t dare interfere with his boss like this, but it was a matter of deep urgency.</p>

      <p>“Sir Feldway, if you please, I think there are some differences in perception here.”</p>

      <p>Feldway was in a festive mood, but Zarario made the smile disappear from his face. “…What is it?” he asked, audibly peeved.</p>

      <p><a id="page-222"></a>“Velgrynd is still alive… And what’s more, it is thanks to her that Cornu fell.”</p>

      <p>“““…?!”””</p>

      <p>Even Zeranus’s face twitched a bit.</p>

      <p>Feldway frowned, intensely displeased. This new obstacle in his way, the demon lord Rimuru, was proving quite irksome, but overall the plan had been going well. Guy Crimson and Rimuru Tempest would be obstacles, yes, but Veldanava’s resurrection was all but imminent. Of the three remaining True Dragons, they had obtained the factors of Velgrynd. Two remained, but plans were underway to procure them. If Zarario was telling the truth, however, it was a major snag in the project.</p>

      <p>That, and as if to confirm his words, Cornu’s presence was notably absent. He could be found neither here, in the Celestial Palace, nor in the Mystic Palace.</p>

      <p>“You’re sure about that?”</p>

      <p>“Yep, it’s true. Cornu’s gone, and the plan’s a big failure. We had no choice but to retreat and stuff. I didn’t think your plan would fail like that, but I guess it’s all thanks to you not delivering in the end, huh?”</p>

      <p>This was Deeno speaking up, not Zarario. The way he so casually shifted the blame showed just how quick-witted he could be.</p>

      <p>Zarario sat in silent agreement. He didn’t appreciate Deeno’s opinion very much, but there was no need to outwardly deny it. He may be fair-minded and strict with himself, but he could be flexible that way. And with that reaction from both of them, Feldway had no choice but to stop doubting.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>This unexpected turn of events made Feldway understandably cranky. But, his mind still clear, he quickly came up with a countermeasure.</p>

      <p>The most important thing right now was to secure the True Dragons. Their draconic factors were essential to revive Veldanava, so that naturally took top priority. Velgrynd’s was already in hand, fortunately. But while her being back in this world wasn’t the worst possible outcome, it was both unexpected and very distressing.</p>

      <p><a id="page-223"></a><em>We were careless. I retrieved her skills because she was going to disappear anyway, but the override circuit vanished with her. I banished her into the far reaches of space, so she’d never bother us even if she was revived, but now I have another headache of an enemy to deal with…</em></p>

      <p>Velgrynd, at the time, had lost most of her power and her draconic factors as well. She was on the verge of vanishing, and that was why Michael took Raguel, Lord of Relief, from her. There was no way he could’ve predicted that it would lead directly to Cornu’s destruction.</p>

      <p><em>Well, so be it. As long as Veldanava is revived, the rest doesn’t matter. Velgrynd can be left alone. Let’s add Velzard to our side first.</em></p>

      <p>This time, he’d be careful not to let her disappear. He’d make her a full-fledged ally, leaving her with some degree of free will. It’d be a good countermeasure against Velgrynd, and it could be useful for capturing Veldora, too.</p>

      <p>But once Velzard was in their ranks, what next? They had planned to go for Veldora at once, but they may need to rethink this.</p>

      <p><em>If even Velgrynd is against us, do we need to shore up our fighting strength? I thought we could get by with just me and Michael, but we can never be too careful.</em></p>

      <p>Deeno had just told him he failed to execute in the very end. So Feldway decided to make some major changes to his initial plan.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>“In that case,” said Feldway, “I think we will need to take immediate action. For starters, let’s take in Velzard. Instead of banishing her to the far reaches of space, why don’t we recruit her as an ally and make use of her that way?”</p>

      <p>Michael nodded in agreement. “It is the only way to go. If we eliminate as many uncertainties as possible and conduct the final ceremony once the three True Dragons are taken in, that would put us on much more solid footing.”</p>

      <p>Velzard had received the ultimate skill Gabriel, Lord of Endurance, from Veldanava, which meant her override circuit was still active. It’d be possible to add her to their side in a completely safe and secure manner.</p>

      <p><a id="page-224"></a>The problem was what came next. Michael eyed the audience, appraising them.</p>

      <p>“I did not think it was necessary at first, but we’ll need to provide physical bodies for everyone. Do that, and we will be able to handle anything that arises.”</p>

      <p>“Good point. Let’s put Veldora on the back burner and finish up as much prep work as we can, then.”</p>

      <p>Feldway and Michael had reached their conclusion. Zarario, sensing this, continued his report.</p>

      <p>“I have one other thing to say about that.”</p>

      <p>“And that is?”</p>

      <p>“Our attempts at using Vega over there to create body vessels has ended in failure. The only sure way we have of creating vessels is via the walking dead.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm. So we have nine, then? It’ll be difficult to decide who gets them…”</p>

      <p>Zeranus spoke up as Feldway pondered over this.</p>

      <p>“You may do whatever you like with those walking dead. We have no need of them.”</p>

      <p>In times of need, insectors could create a new body by coagulating the magicules inside of them. That was what enabled them to travel to other worlds. Having spare bodies would be nice, but it wasn’t essential for them. Such had been the case with Minaza. She had assumed a physical form after taking in matter from the other world, but the insect creatures she summoned shared her same properties. Actually crossing into another world was extremely difficult, but once someone like Minaza pulled off a successful jump, they were fully able to exercise their vast and powerful abilities at their destination.</p>

      <p>The “world crossing” problem had already been solved for this project. It was only natural for Zeranus to give up his right to the walking dead.</p>

      <p>“Zarario and Obela of the Three Mystic Leaders are givens, then. Shall we fill the remaining seven slots with our other top leaders?”</p>

      <p>“I have something to say about that.”</p>

      <p>“You may speak freely.”</p>

      <p>“Thank you.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-225"></a>It was times like these when Deeno marveled at how serious-minded Zarario was.</p>

      <p>“Unlike us Primordials,” Zarario began, “those at the cherub level or below are too weak-willed. They were able to fight up to now through sheer willpower, but in the war ahead, I fear we cannot expect them to contribute very much to our offense.”</p>

      <p>“Mm. So what do you suggest?”</p>

      <p>“Well, why don’t we leave their struggle for survival in the hands of nature, I say?”</p>

      <p>Zarario had basically given up on his entire staff. The same was true for Cornu’s team—the group that had their minds taken over by humans in the world they invaded. Now people were being influenced by Vega’s <em>cells</em>, of all things, to go on insane rampages. Offering such a precious vessel to people like that wouldn’t make them of much use in the battles ahead.</p>

      <p>“We still have many obstacles in our way—Velgrynd, Veldora, and the demon lords are all alive and well. Even those damned demons will be a nuisance. In the face of these threats, sending in mere tools who do nothing more than follow orders is—”</p>

      <p>“Worthless?”</p>

      <p>“Yes.”</p>

      <p>Feldway nodded at Zarario’s hypothesis. He had the same deep-seated concerns.</p>

      <p><em>Yes… What matters the most is the strength of someone’s will. Without that kind of burning desire, it’s meaningless to give anyone an ultimate skill. Conversely…</em></p>

      <p>On the other hand, no matter how strong someone’s sense of self was, giving them the ultimate enchantment Alternative would ensure against betrayal for good.</p>

      <p>Feldway looked at Michael. Their eyes met. Apparently he had other opinions.</p>

      <p>“Is something on your mind?”</p>

      <p>“Well, I was thinking I might call forth my seraphim with Armageddon once it was ready, then have them possess the bodies…”</p>

      <p>“That works as well, but we don’t know how many angels will be called or what kind of will they’ll possess, do we?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-226"></a>“There would be seven at the most. But we will not know what kind of will these seraphim have until they are summoned.”</p>

      <p>If the walking dead were to be possessed by seraphim, that alone would likely make them more powerful than an awakened demon lord. But, again, their strength of will was a sticking point. It took many, many years for the people in this room to firmly establish their own wills, so trying to put a force together too quickly was pointless—such was Feldway’s outlook.</p>

      <p>“Interesting,” Zeranus said. “If you think there will be too many of these seraphim, I or my children could always eat them up for you.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm…”</p>

      <p>Feldway thought about it. They were in an alliance with the insectors now, but only because they shared a common interest. Once either side achieved their objectives, chances were good that they’d return to being enemies. Allowing such an untrusted partner to strengthen themselves gave Feldway pause, but if they wanted to destroy this world, it seemed like an effective strategy.</p>

      <p>“Let’s hold off on that for now,” he advised. “We can think about it when the opportunity arises.”</p>

      <p>“Very well. I will not force the issue,” said Zeranus.</p>

      <p>That was enough about seraphim. They returned to the question of whom to put in their vessels.</p>

      <p>“In that case, we should reserve these vessels for Zarario and the others.”</p>

      <p>“That sounds good to me. Feldway’s right when he says that it would eliminate any uncertainty.”</p>

      <p>“I have no objections,” Zeranus added.</p>

      <p>Both sides were in agreement.</p>

      <p>“We’ll adopt Zarario’s proposal, then. Is that all right with you?”</p>

      <p>Feldway posed the question to his own staff. He phrased it as a question, but the decision was already made. Anyone who objected would be branded as too timid, so Dhalis and his colleagues had no right to argue with it.</p>

      <p>So it was settled. Zarario and the others would possess the walking dead—and, at the same time, release the wills that resided in those bodies.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">Once that was decided, it was time to begin the incarnation ceremony. Zarario and five members of his staff would receive bodies, along with Obela and Ohma. The process of installing these egos into the walking dead would be handled by Kagali.</p>

      <p><em>There’s one extra, then? What are they going to do with that?</em></p>

      <p>Just when Kagali was wondering this, her eyes met Feldway’s.</p>

      <p>“Ah, Kagali, right? You must be released from your thrall now that Kondo is dead, but what are your plans going forward?”</p>

      <p><em>Here we go</em>, she thought, tensing up. “Do you think you could let me go?” she cautiously asked, unsure how much she’d be allowed to say. The response was beyond unexpected.</p>

      <p>“Certainly. Once this ceremony is over, I don’t mind at all.”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>“Really, your job was done once you crafted the walking dead who’ll serve as our vessels. You’ve contributed more than enough to the cause, so if that’s what you want, I could return you to the surface.”</p>

      <p><em>You’re kidding.</em></p>

      <p>Kagali was confused. At best, she expected to be locked up for life; at worst, she expected a swift execution. But now she was being let go? Feldway didn’t seem like he was lying, and lying about this would just lead to pointless trouble for him. Clearly, Kagali was useless otherwise—she lacked the power to do anything else. She saw no reason why he would try to trick her otherwise, so she concluded that Feldway must be telling the truth.</p>

      <p>With that in mind, she stepped further onto thin ice.</p>

      <p>“And do you think it’s possible to release the rule over Sir Yuuki and release him along with me?”</p>

      <p>Michael stepped up to answer.</p>

      <p>“That I cannot permit. The ultimate skill Mammon, Lord of Greed, as possessed by Yuuki Kagurazaka, is extremely valuable to me.”</p>

      <p>To Michael, Yuuki’s fighting ability didn’t matter as much as that skill. The idea of releasing him was dead in the water. Kagali, understanding that, decided to stop wishing for more.</p>

      <p><a id="page-228"></a><em>So what’ll I do? Is running the right choice?</em></p>

      <p>“If it’s just you and those two,” Feldway said, “I’d gladly take you down there. However, I’m sure the key world is in a state of chaos right now. I have a deep-seated hatred for everybody on that planet, you see. And I don’t need the death of all living things to achieve my goal, but I’m sure the flames will burn high and hot as we fight against those who defy us. But that is just the punishment of the gods. Those who Lady Veldanava loved are now betraying that love. They need to pay the price.”</p>

      <p>It sounded so matter-of-fact, but it sent shivers down Kagali’s spine. When he talked about flames burning high, he meant that the ravages of war would spread across the entire world. Even if she fled there, would it be safe at all? It didn’t seem so. Yuuki was still in their grasp, and if all the utter powerhouses here went on the rampage, there would be no safe sanctuary left on the planet.</p>

      <p><em>We just wanted to create a world where we could be happy. But given how things are, hoping for something like that would just be in vain. The important thing right now is to survive…and to do that, I need power.</em></p>

      <p>It may have been a foolish decision. But it seemed like the only correct answer to Kagali at the time. So she made the wish.</p>

      <p>“Please give me one of the walking dead. And, if you don’t mind, please give me permission to house a seraphim in my body…”</p>

      <p>She wanted to leave her fragile body behind and be reborn as a walking dead. That, plus the seraphim, would give her the kind of strength she wanted. The strength she <em>needed</em>. As long as she had that, nothing more would be taken from her.</p>

      <p>Her words had no chance of convincing anyone…and yet, nobody refuted them. Deeno looked dumbfounded but said nothing. Zarario and Obela would obey whatever Michael decided, and the insectors didn’t care either way; they had no interest in the weak.</p>

      <p>As all these sides reacted to her, Michael nodded. “Hmm. Interesting. But I will not tolerate betrayal. Accept my ultimate enchantment, and I will grant your wish.”</p>

      <p>“I swear that I will not betray you… And I accept your dominion over me.”</p>

      <p>So the contract was sealed.</p>

      <p><a id="page-229"></a>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>Installing self-awareness in the walking dead is akin to waking up their original personality. In some cases, the strongest will prevails; in others, they form a mixture and create a wholly new ego. Not even Kagali could say how it would turn out—as Teare and Footman demonstrated, it’s very hard to aim for any particular personality.</p>

      <p>Would Kagali’s ego triumph over the one in that body? It was a crapshoot, even for her. But she was still resolved to gain that power for herself. So, after awakening these eight bodies, she conducted the same ritual on the one she would occupy—and with that, she transferred herself from her artificial body to the walking dead.</p>

      <p>So the ritual was completed. And the results…</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>Zarario woke up. Realizing he was surrounded by the armor of actual flesh, he could feel how great a force he’d be able to wield in the key world.</p>

      <p>Obela woke up. She prided herself on her noble will, completely impervious to any challenge, and she had just proved it.</p>

      <p>When Dhalis was just about to awaken, he realized that another personality resided within him. His name was Tornewot, and he was a man of ambition, apparently. Dhalis could sense that this man’s warrior skills were becoming his own, and he was sure it would make him far more of a presence than before.</p>

      <p>Neece woke up. She was stronger now, as ordered, but nothing had changed personally for her. Her strong sense of self was alive and well.</p>

      <p>Ohma woke up. Its indomitable will was intact, but now it had internalized a being with similar sensibilities. The name of this being was Zero, it seemed, but now it was Ohma’s flesh and blood.</p>

      <p>Orca and Alia woke up. Alia’s had a wizard’s knowledge, Orca that of a warrior—and with both egos coexisting in the same body, <a id="page-230"></a>they were reborn as a magical warrior. There was not a shred of the ego of Sonne, Zarario’s servant, left in that body.</p>

      <p>Arius woke up. His unique skill Murderer was still there. He never forgot his grudge against Damrada for killing him, and now he had resurrected himself, seeking even more strength.</p>

      <p>Mai Furuki woke up. There was no way she could die. In the other world—the one she used to live in, not this one—she left behind a sickly younger brother. She swore to herself that she’d come home for him someday.</p>

      <p>The eight of them had awoken. One was left…but she was still in a deep sleep.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">

      <p class="tx1">Kagali had a dream. One that brought back old, cherished memories. From back when she was the demon lord Kazalim? No. It was of a much, much older time, back when she was still a little girl.</p>

      <p>She could no longer remember the name she went by at that time, but she was a happy young princess. The nation her family ruled was founded on the site where the high humans had once built their great civilization. A large river flowed through it; the forest grew thick; and fertile plains spread all the way to the horizon, making it a natural utopia. This bounty—along with the ruins of the ancient, highly advanced empire of magic that once existed there—made this country into a superpower of its own, a paradise for the elven race.</p>

      <p>But all too suddenly, her father—the king—went mad. Kagali remembered him as an extraordinarily kind and gentle ruler, praised and lauded as the wise king of the high elves, but one day, he suddenly transformed into someone different. He changed his own name, calling himself the sorcerous dynast Jahil.</p>

      <p>Her memories were not as clear after that. Jahil proved to be a brutal despot, exploiting his people and thinking about nothing but his own prosperity. He conducted a number of vast, failed experiments, creating all sorts of nightmares for his people.</p>

      <p>Kagali was one of his victims; born a high elf, she was stripped of her powers, killed, then resurrected as a walking dead. All she <a id="page-231"></a>was left with was a hideous appearance and the name Kazalim. Her beautiful looks were gone, and now she was doomed to be a cursed figure her whole life. Rotting flesh covered her bones. It was dry, at least, and therefore didn’t stink of the dead.</p>

      <p>Few people knew Kagali’s secret. She was so saddened by it that she began to hide herself behind a mask.</p>

      <p><em>“Why are you doing this to me?!”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Geh-heh-heh-heh! Because it’s fun. Why, you should be rejoicing! Tens of thousands of our people had to die to bring you back to life! Har-har-har-har!!”</em></p>

      <p>It was a nightmare. Her father was so kind to her once—why did he turn into such a ghoul? But this was her reality, and there was no point lamenting over it.</p>

      <p><em>“Father! I don’t care what you do to me. But at least spare a thought for your citizens, as you did in the past…”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Silence! Are you here to mock me as well? I knew having a daughter would do me no good. I will not make the same foolish mistake</em> he <em>did. I have instilled a sense of loyalty to me inside of you…but you still cannot be trusted! Kazalim, from now on, you will live as a man, do you understand?”</em></p>

      <p>It was an absolute order. Kagali’s pleas had no chance of reaching Jahil’s ears. Everything was decided for her. At least she wasn’t killed—or, really, the fact she had already been killed and turned into a faithful puppet meant that she was too useful a tool to be discarded.</p>

      <p>At that moment, Kagali internally said her goodbyes to the father inside her mind. So the nightmare continued.</p>

      <p>The glory of the arrogant emperor Jahil seemed like it would never end, but then the day came. He had committed the ultimate sin—antagonizing the Dragon Princess Milim, hoping to make her into a puppet as well. Soma, the capital of this superpower, was reduced to ruins overnight, and Jahil himself was never found.</p>

      <p>He was presumed dead, since it didn’t seem that anyone could possibly survive that flash of lethal light. Instead of dwelling on him, Kagali’s mind turned toward those more important to her. The kind female attendants who always watched over her. The knights <a id="page-232"></a>who accompanied her after she became a warrior. The people she loved, living out their happy lives. Thinking of all those she loved, she invoked a forbidden spell.</p>

      <p>She had learned the theory behind Dead Birthday thanks to becoming one of its test subjects. Thus, she had no problem completing the spell—and this was how Teare, Footman, and Clayman were born. They were an adorable set of children, and Kagali named them herself.</p>

      <p>Then she learned a fact she preferred not knowing. Walking dead that were born via Dead Birthday were not inherently doomed to be ugly. Only Kagali had been made that way—on purpose. Jahil, her hated father, had taken away her beauty for the sole purpose of making her suffer.</p>

      <p>But it was far too late to do anything. Kagali’s appearance was the result of a curse, and there was no way to reverse it. But the children Kagali created did not leave her alone to suffer. They, too, hid their true faces behind masks, sharing in her suffering. <em>I’m not alone</em>, she thought—and that planted within her an earnest hope for survival. And before long, Kagali’s four-member family was joined by the elves that managed to survive the attack.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><em>We can bring this country of ours back to what it was. And we’ll make it into a land where everyone can keep a smile on their face…</em></p>

      <p class="space-break1">That was the wish Kagali secretly resolved to have come true. But it turned out to be a faint, fleeting dream. The land was attacked by a Chaos Dragon, one that contaminated it for good, and Kagali’s followers were all cursed and transformed into dark elves.</p>

      <p>Kagali took this opportunity to act like she, too, had been cursed. She and her children were walking dead, making them impervious to any such curse…but she lamented, over and over, about how she was different from everyone else. Hiding her face with a mask was a blessing to her along those lines, ensuring nobody noticed the difference, but it only served to make her sadder. Having Teare and the others around was a great relief to her.</p>

      <p>After that, she and her family abandoned their homeland and <a id="page-233"></a>fled. Their followers joined them, leaving all their unfulfilled memories behind.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">They all spent a long period wandering the land before finally discovering their next safe haven.</p>

      <p>Once life had settled down for everyone, Kagali decided to visit her homeland again. She needed to recover the assorted treasures that were left behind, but most of all, she just wanted to see the land for herself once more. The city may be in ruins, but in her memories, it was still shining as beautifully as always. She felt a clean break from the past was necessary—something she could make use of for the future.</p>

      <p>So Kagali set off. When she reached her destination, she came across a man lying on the ground.</p>

      <p><em>“Oh, it’s you, huh? If you were watchin’ over this land, you coulda lifted a finger to help me, couldn’t ya?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Don’t be ridiculous. How could I ever defend us against that evil dragon?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Ah, you’re bein’ too modest. From my point of view, you’re just as much of a menace, but… Owww…”</em></p>

      <p>The man’s name was Thalion Grimwald, the Hero who finally chased the Chaos Dragon away from this land. Unfortunately, his fight against this dragon had brought him to the brink of death.</p>

      <p><em>“Take it easy. I’ll cast some healing magic—”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Don’t waste yer breath. The Chaos Dragon’s attacks are all cursed—my wounds ain’t never gonna heal. I had a few healing tricks up my sleeve, too, but, ahhh, you see how well they worked.”</em></p>

      <p>Thalion’s body had in fact been blown off from the chest down. It was a wonder he was still alive. But he still had the wherewithal to laugh about it, making the strength of his spirit clear for the world to see.</p>

      <p><em>“I got a message for you. Tell everyone that I beat the Chaos Dragon here. I died in style, the way a Hero needs to.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Heh… What do you mean by that? Here… Before you die, I have a proposal for you. There’s a chance I’ll be able to use my evil magic to give you another lease on life. It may cost you your memory—you may very well end up like me, in fact—but are you interested in giving it a try?”</em></p>

      <p><a id="page-234"></a>Kagali took off her mask as she spoke, revealing her ugliness for the Hero to behold. But Thalion just gave that visage a half smile.</p>

      <p><em>“Well, look at you, huh? You got some nice aspects to ya after all. Sylvia would kill me if I died in a place like this. An offer like yours…well, how can I say no to that, eh?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Are you sure? I’m a cursed man… And if I’m going to be persecuted either way, I’ll choose evil over good any day. If you became a Hero to protect everyone…well, I’ll become a demon lord to do that, all right? That’s what I’m ready to do. And you realize this evil magic will also make you my puppet, don’t you?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Aw, it’s fine, it’s fine. It’ll be fun! I’m a free spirit, y’know? You ain’t gonna control me that easily. Besides, Heroes and demon lords are always fated to get intertwined with each other ’n all that. That’s probably why we ran into each other, huh?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“Heh… All this nonsense, in your condition. You’re a real strange one. Well, all right, then. Be my puppet, for all I care!”</em></p>

      <p>So the negotiations were concluded. Kagali took Thalion’s words as a joke, but he was telling the truth… And as a result of her passing whim, Thalion became a walking dead, surviving this ordeal.</p>

      <p>And that was the moment when both Kazalim the Curse Lord and Laplace the Wonder Jester were born.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">A lot of other things happened afterward. Kagali secured a domain, fighting fierce battles with assorted human and demi-human races…but, overcoming all the persecution, Kazalim the Curse Lord rose to prominence. Recognized as a demon lord, she began to steadily expand her powers—and along the way, she backed Carillon the Beast Master and Frey the Sky Queen’s entry to the demon lord class, establishing a powerful alliance with them both.</p>

      <p>Everything couldn’t have gone better. It went too well, in fact. So much so that she was completely unaware of the conceited pride growing in her heart.</p>

      <p>Kagali’s next target was an up-and-coming figure by the name of Leon, governing over some rural backwater and claiming to be a demon lord. He needed to be taught a lesson about where he stood, and Kagali also wanted to bring him under her wing.</p>

      <p><a id="page-235"></a>The first time she caught sight of him, Kagali grew jealous. This man, calling himself a demon lord, was beyond beautiful. Thanks to being disfigured by her demonic father, Kagali had struggled every day of her life, robbed of even her gender…but here was Leon, a man more beautiful than any woman. The sight dulled her thoughts—and then she made the mistake of overestimating her abilities.</p>

      <p>With a single strike from Leon, Kagali’s physical body was lost. She was forced to stalk the land with only her spiritual body once more; it was a miracle that she didn’t just fade away. She had her grudges, but more than that was a single wish—one that helped her cling to life.</p>

      <p>Using what little of her Curse Lord power remained, she patiently took the time to prepare her own resurrection. In a daze, she completed her final summoning—but failed to occupy the one she summoned. Her plan failed, and no physical body would be hers. All that remained was to perish for good…</p>

      <p><em>“…Help me. You have to help me. I don’t want anything else taken from me. All I wanted was to live happily with my friends. Why am I the only one who has to go through this…?”</em></p>

      <p>She begged for help, wailing about her misfortune, but nobody reached out to help her. She wasn’t alone, but still no one would lend a hand. It had been an arduous path to walk. Her ideals seemed to be far, far away now, even as Kagali was obliged to be a leader for everyone. She wasn’t allowed to whine about her lot in life; instead, she constantly had to keep her head pointed forward.</p>

      <p>So Kagali had given up hope that she would ever be saved. All she could trust were herself and the companions she loved. That’s how she had lived her life.</p>

      <p>But that boy, Yuuki Kagurazaka…</p>

      <p><em>“All right, sure. You look pretty tired, so just rest inside me for now.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“…?!”</em></p>

      <p>Kagali, this monster nobody wanted to save, had tried to take his life a moment ago. But now he was reaching out to her.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">A few years later, Kagali was still resting inside Yuuki, providing him counsel and advice. Her unique skill Schemer still worked <a id="page-236"></a>even in her current soul form, fortunately, but she nonetheless had to deal with a lot of fearsome opponents.</p>

      <p>Maribel Rozzo, in particular, was a major headache. Yuuki was a genius strategist, and Kagali was confident enough about her own ingenuity…but despite the two of them conspiring together, outwitting Maribel proved extremely difficult. They were outmatched in every possible way, from finances to human resources. They had obtained an organization that allowed them to be free, but it was Maribel who had the final say over whether they’d be free at all.</p>

      <p><em>“I gotta kill her. I have to do it sometime, or our plan will never go anywhere.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“That’s for sure. That devil of a girl’s the biggest obstacle we have.”</em></p>

      <p>An economic battle cannot be won off one’s pure fighting ability. And Maribel was still a young girl. If she grew to adulthood, they wouldn’t be able to compete with her in any aspect at all.</p>

      <p>A few years after Kagali and Yuuki resolved themselves to this, the times began to change. It wasn’t caused by the birth of the demon lord Rimuru, that weird slime, but by Kagali obtaining an artificial body. Yuuki had kept his promise all along.</p>

      <p>And what’s more…</p>

      <p><em>This is how I originally looked…</em></p>

      <p>Yuuki’s kindness made her want to cry tears of joy, but Kagali kept it cool on the outside. She tried to maintain the manly speaking voice she had nurtured, but Laplace stopped her. He was teasing her about it, but deep down, he was concerned for her.</p>

      <p>“I appreciate this, Boss,” she said—and she sincerely meant it.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">With her new physical body, Kagali was excited to get a few good meals (plus dessert) in her. The cream puffs, in particular, were just exquisite. Laughing with her friends, enjoying fun times together—how happy could she be?</p>

      <p>But the happiness didn’t last long. Clayman died, and both Kagali and her colleagues realized that once again, a valued friend had been taken from them. They had to conquer the world, for the sake of their own happiness. And once they ruled the world, they’d lead it the right way.</p>

      <p><a id="page-237"></a><em>Clayman, you were so foolish, so arrogant…and so charming. I’m sorry you had to go through all of that. Rest well now and watch over us. We’ll make our ambitions come true, I promise you.</em></p>

      <p>Kagali wasn’t on the side of good, but her faction wasn’t evil, either. They were…moderate. And that’s why she thought she could create a world that provided happiness for everyone.</p>

      <p>Trusting in this fact, she continued on. When they defeated Maribel, Kagali’s true identity was revealed by the demon lord Rimuru, she fled to the Empire, and then her mind was taken over by Lieutenant Kondo. It was enough to break Kagali’s heart, but she couldn’t afford to give up now.</p>

      <p><em>“I swear that I will not betray you… And I accept your dominion over me.”</em></p>

      <p>It was a contract, and it had to be followed. She received a great favor, and now it had to be repaid. And Kagali was willing to do whatever it took.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">And so she, too, woke up. She had abandoned her fragile, artificial homunculus body and gained one of the walking dead’s vessels, making her stronger and far more beautiful than her days as the demon lord Kazalim.</p>

      <p>Thus all nine of the walking dead were reborn. But these were only the first few steps.</p>

      <p>When Kagali finally awoke, the last of her peers to do so, the first thing she saw was Feldway leading the group that was bringing back Velzard. Michael had already taken Velzard’s draconic factors from her, hoping to use them for further evolution—but before that, he invoked Armageddon in order to implant the resulting seraphim in Kagali and the others. She could sense the strength of Michael’s will; he was completely unwilling to make any compromises.</p>

      <p>Seven seraphim had been successfully summoned. They’d be installed in those walking dead who weren’t from angels to start with, and Kagali was naturally part of them. She, Teare, Footman, Vega, Orca/Alia, Arius, and Mai Furuki would each receive one.</p>

      <p>Extraordinary powers struggled against each other within their <a id="page-238"></a>bodies, remodeling the vessels as they did. All of them, with the exception of Vega, were reborn once more as mystic angels.</p>

      <p>And by the time this had happened, five months had passed since Kagali first arrived at the Celestial Palace.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="tx1">At the audience chamber of this vast castle above the heavens, lined with pillars of chalky white, the very air seemed to be filled with a divine spirit. The space was filled with angels, each bearing wings of pure white; they had yet to gain physical bodies, but they still couldn’t wait to invade the planetary surface. Lacking their own will, they were motionless as statues, their presence giving the chamber a solemn feel.</p>

      <p>There was a circle of chairs up front, with those who existed above these angels—all the reborn, Kagali included—sitting on them. Having gained far more power than before, the aura they exuded was amplified up to even greater levels. They had been called here because Michael was about to awaken. He was still asleep when Kagali woke up with the seraphim in her body…but his continued absence told the audience that things were apparently behind schedule.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Kagali, with nothing else better to do, turned her attention to the angels behind her.</p>

      <p>The way it was explained to her, the only limit to what you could summon at once was the total amount of energy you could expend on it. Summoning an army a million strong was the normal custom, but after calling forth seven seraphim at once, they couldn’t expect this kind of quantity.</p>

      <p>Still, the quality was impressive. All the low-level rabble of angel-dom had been eliminated, and this force consisted entirely of the middle and upper classes. There were around a thousand Dominion angels, three thousand Virtue-class, and six thousand Power types. Not having physical bodies, they couldn’t tap into their full strength, but despite that, even the Powers enjoyed combat ability <a id="page-239"></a>on an over-A rank. They could remain active for just seven days, but that was more than enough to turn the world into a wasteland.</p>

      <p><em>…But the demon lords could probably handle them, couldn’t they?</em></p>

      <p>That was Kagali’s impression.</p>

      <p>“This won’t be enough, will it? If this is all we have, it’ll be hard to defeat even a single one of the forces opposing us.”</p>

      <p>Kagali’s under-her-breath muttering still echoed in this quiet hall. She didn’t expect an answer, but she was surprised to hear one.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, well, I didn’t have anyone serving me, but all the other demon lords have a whole bunch of strong guys, y’know? Honestly, I dunno if we could take down even a single member of the Octagram.”</p>

      <p>Kagali looked at her sudden conversational partner. “Well! I never thought I’d agree with you about something, Deeno. But…” Her voice went to a whisper. “You know, I had no idea you worked for Sir Feldway until now.”</p>

      <p>“Like I could’ve told you,” he flatly responded. “I’m a Monitor, you realize. I’m supposed to hide my true identity and be as inconspicuous as possible. And lemme set one other thing straight—I’m <em>former</em> friends with Feldway. I don’t work for him.”</p>

      <p>Deeno’s Monitor duties had driven him to even infiltrate the Octagram. The reason? So he could keep an eye on things in their world. He, Pico, and Garasha—the three fallen angels—were on a special mission to investigate the world of man. They were tasked with monitoring the human race so it would never be destroyed by the will of Veldanava.</p>

      <p>If mankind grew too strong, it was the job of the demon lords, led by Guy, to put them back in their place. The Heroes, meanwhile, served as a deterrent to keep the demon lords from getting carried away—and it was Deeno and his team’s job to ensure the fated relationship between demon lords and Heroes was working correctly.</p>

      <p>With Deeno taking a prominent, attention-grabbing position as demon lord, Pico and Garasha were busily conducting their investigations while staying out of the public eye. Deeno also had another, hidden role—to conceal the other two’s presence, so it’d be easier for them to move around.</p>

      <p><a id="page-240"></a>Now that Veldanava was gone and un-resurrected, though, they had nobody to report to. So Deeno was just chilling out, enjoying life as a demon lord and talking about stuff like this openly, with no intention of hiding it at all. Kagali wondered why he was even here, and it must have been obvious from her facial expression, because Garasha gave her a little laugh.</p>

      <p>“This guy, you know… He kinda owes a lot to Feldway. If it’s him asking, Deeno just can’t say no.”</p>

      <p>“But at this point,” Pico added, “he says that he can’t go back to the demon lord Rimuru. So he decided to serve Sir Michael instead.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, pretty much,” Deeno agreed with a nod.</p>

      <p>Kagali couldn’t believe it. Would <em>that</em> be the only reason he was serving Michael? She doubted it—but this whole story seemed so ridiculously Deeno-like, it was almost convincing.</p>

      <p>“So,” she said, moving on, “what was the demon lord Rimuru like? Because I still resent him for killing Clayman, and I’d like to get some revenge if I get the chance.”</p>

      <p>This was a lie. She didn’t have any hate at all for Rimuru. Certainly, he was a foe who figured large in her life—but he had just formed an alliance with Yuuki, and even if that were dissolved, Rimuru piqued her interest a great deal. If she should hate anyone over Clayman’s death, it should be Lieutenant Kondo for manipulating him—and by extension, Michael for controlling Kondo. She could understand that well enough, but she wasn’t foolish enough to say it out loud.</p>

      <p>“He’s a menace,” Deeno said, not pursuing the previous subject, “and so is everyone in his government. Especially that Zegion guy.”</p>

      <p>Deeno’s role in the previous operation, apparently, was to neutralize the forces within the labyrinth—to be exact, he was asked to either kidnap or eliminate Ramiris. He was one step away from completing that mission (or that’s what he claims, at least), but either way, he failed. Why? Because, he said, he was stopped by an unstoppably powerful magic-born named Zegion.</p>

      <p>“He’s that strong?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, strong doesn’t even begin to describe it. Like, seriously, it’s not even funny. He’s rumored to be the best in the Ten Dungeon Marvels, and I can tell you that he’s stronger than <em>me</em>, at least.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-241"></a>He had just finished up a series of fights, and Deeno admitted that he maybe looked down on him a little, but Zegion made him look like a fool without even really trying. The way he put it, he couldn’t even feel like a sore loser about it—that was how thorough his beating was.</p>

      <p>“Of all the wimpy things to say. Well, don’t worry—I’m gonna crush that bastard! Sounds like he deserves a good beating!”</p>

      <p>Vega was already in a bragging mood. <em>Must be nice to be such an idiot</em>, thought Deeno, although he refrained from saying it. It was pointless anyway.</p>

      <p><em>Vega never changes, does he? Now I’m not sure we’ll have any effective use for his new powers…</em></p>

      <p>Kagali let out a sigh as well. Confidence in your own strength was all well and good, but if it cost you the battle sense you needed the most, it wouldn’t do you any good. <em>Sense</em> here meant the ability to gauge the difference in strength between two sides. Going up against someone you can’t beat, after all, will do nothing but hurt your side.</p>

      <p>Pico and Garasha, apparently understanding this, frowned. They only said nothing, in all likelihood, because they weren’t friendly with Vega and thus figured any warning they’d give would be ignored.</p>

      <p>But just when everyone thought this conversation was over:</p>

      <p>“Either way, if you guys notice any insectors inside the labyrinth, watch the hell out, got it? Zegion’s a beetle type, but they got this bee girl named Apito who’s real dangerous, too.”</p>

      <p>Deeno meant that as a way of wrapping up this topic. But it caught Zeranus’s attention.</p>

      <p>“A beetle type and a bee type? Tell me more.”</p>

      <p>Suddenly Deeno found himself overwhelmed by Zeranus’s sheer vigor. Before he could think about it, he divulged everything else he knew about them, although it wasn’t very much.</p>

      <p>“Oh…? Um, well, if I recall, I think Rimuru’s been giving them shelter since before he became a demon lord…”</p>

      <p>Zeranus listened silently. And when Deeno was done talking, an awkward silence drifted over the chamber.</p>

      <p><em>Dude, give me some kinda reaction!</em> Deeno begged internally.</p>

      <p><a id="page-242"></a>But Zeranus was beyond intimidating. He didn’t want to call him out over it, though, so he had no choice but to change the subject and keep talking.</p>

      <p>“…But anyway, inside Ramiris’s labyrinth, the defenders have a huge advantage. There’s a group of really strong guardians in there, Zegion leading them, and taking them down’s gonna be a huge challenge, trust me!”</p>

      <p>With that, Deeno was done talking.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">As silence reigned once more, everyone gathered in the chamber were caught up in their own thoughts.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Kagali had a wide range of topics she had to think about. Deeno’s guidance was pretty important, but for now, the first priority was getting to grips with her own changes.</p>

      <p>As she searched for information and checked over her own body, she could feel a tremendous power welling up within her. A seraphim is the highest level of angel, allegedly comparable to an awakened demon lord. After taking on the power of one of them and becoming a mystic angel, Kagali was now so strong that the memories of her demon lord days just embarrassed her now.</p>

      <p>What’s more, in addition to her unique skill Schemer, she discovered a new skill embedded in her soul. This was the ultimate enchantment Melchizedek, Lord of Dominion, one earned by Michael separating his domination skills off and granting her a piece. A fearsome skill, it allowed her to instantly analyze any other skill and place it under her control. However, Kagali herself was placed under control of this skill, which made it impossible for her to betray Michael.</p>

      <p><em>It’s just terrifying. A war between people with these kinds of powers… It’s unimaginable for someone like me.</em></p>

      <p>That’s how she felt about it, but when it was time to fight, Kagali’s body would no doubt slaughter the enemy on its own, no input required from her. She instinctively understood this, and seeing <a id="page-243"></a>this change in herself made her shiver. But she also couldn’t help but think, too, that she wanted to test out this immense power she gained. She knew she shouldn’t think about it, but something inside of her was wishing for that so badly. And she also predicted that she’d have a chance very, very soon.</p>

      <p>She thought her desire for revenge was gone. But now she was growing resentful of Leon for killing her and of Rimuru for killing Clayman. And perhaps she could beat them now? She knew it was pointless, but she couldn’t stop that desire from bubbling up.</p>

      <p><em>Am I really weaker than Deeno right now? No. I just can’t see it that way.</em></p>

      <p>In fact, now that she was a mystic angel, Kagali was on the same tier as Deeno.</p>

      <p><em>Heh… And what an embarrassing sight Deeno is. You know, even back in my demon lord days, I never did see Deeno fight anyone. No wonder he’s so weak—</em></p>

      <p>She had a hard time suppressing the pleasant, joyful feelings coming up from the bottom of her heart. She knew she couldn’t let her guard down against these foes. But even so…even if this opponent played Deeno like a fiddle…she thought she could win.</p>

      <p>She had gone well past an awakened demon lord, after all. Even the older demon lords, like Luminus and Deeno, couldn’t beat Kagali today. And if not, maybe even the demon lord Leon wouldn’t be a challenge.</p>

      <p><em>You just wait for me, Leon. You’ll be the one crying next!</em></p>

      <p>So she kept thinking, attempting to suppress those dark feelings of pleasure as she did. The skill controlling her mind was now radicalizing her thoughts, but she never noticed it happening.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Vega wasn’t thinking about anything. He was just waiting for orders.</p>

      <p>He had gained power. He had experienced death many times, giving him a look into the yet-deeper abysses of the world. He had consumed Gradim, and his own weapon had taken in the God-class Azure Dragon Spear. He had even feasted upon a seraphim, taking its power for his own.</p>

      <p>All the countless defeats he’d tasted had granted him more <a id="page-244"></a>power. He was the very personification of explosive force. That’s what he was—a being created and transformed by Yuuki, infused with various skills that fused and complemented each other to help him become the ultimate fighting creature.</p>

      <p>His unique skill Scavenger had now evolved into the ultimate skill Azhdahak, Lord of Dark Dragons—one with such destructive power that it literally overwhelmed all other existing skills. It was a disaster for the world that Vega, who never thought to temper any of his powers, was granted something like this. Or maybe the opposite was true. Maybe he only obtained this skill because of his constant, thoughtless drive to master the ways of pure force.</p>

      <p>But regardless, Vega waited. He waited for the orders to come. And all he’d have to do was annihilate, then consume, those who stood before him.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Deeno stared at the floor, thinking about his current situation. <em>Why did it turn out like this?</em> he asked himself multiple times, but he never seemed to reach an answer.</p>

      <p>Long ago, Veldanava asked him to take on this role, and so he descended to the surface. He didn’t think he had much in the way of sentience at the time, but somewhere along the line, he started thinking about things for himself. He asked his colleagues Pico and Garasha about it, but it sounded like they had developed self-awareness at about the same time.</p>

      <p>For various reasons, the three of them had become fallen angels. The only purpose in their lives had been to obey the orders of their vanished lord, and Deeno had become a demon lord to comply with that. He continued to watch over the world, and he wanted to see how the game between Guy and Ludora would turn out, although he’d never dream of intervening.</p>

      <p>Through all this, Deeno’s loyalty to Veldanava was unwavering. He still believed that someday, at the end of time, he’d be able to return to him.</p>

      <p>And then he met him—that weird slime. A single glance was all he needed to understand the blinding brightness of his soul. It was totally different from Veldanava’s, but somehow it felt familiar to him.</p>

      <p><a id="page-245"></a>So began a happy period of his life. He hated working so much, but getting used and abused by humans all day was satisfying for him. He could hardly believe it himself, but somehow he felt contentment with this life. It was all thanks to the colleagues he was working with.</p>

      <p><em>Ahhh, and I just had to double-cross Ramiris anyway…</em></p>

      <p>That’s what he regretted the most, the attack that took place five months earlier. On Feldway’s orders, he betrayed Rimuru’s people and invited the enemy right into their labyrinth. As if that wasn’t enough, he’d also attempted to capture Ramiris, the enemy’s most vital target. The order said to kill her if capture wasn’t possible, but Deeno had no intention of that—not kill, at least. Instead he’d seal her in a Deep Hypno state and make it look like she was dead.</p>

      <p>But, fortunately or not, the plan failed. And now Deeno found it strange he’d ever tried it in the first place.</p>

      <p><em>Nah, but that just proves he was telling the truth, doesn’t it?</em></p>

      <p>Deeno couldn’t help but think so. He didn’t want to make excuses for attempting to harm Ramiris, but he was fully sure he was being driven by Michael’s control over him.</p>

      <p><em>So as long as I have the skill Astarte, I have no way of defying Michael and Feldway? You gotta be kidding…</em></p>

      <p>He thought he had an accurate grasp of the situation, but he couldn’t think up any brilliant ways out of it. The only saving grace he had was that Rimuru still trusted him.</p>

      <p><em>He acts all shrewd and calculating, but he’s really a big softie. You’d think you could trick him easily, but really, you gotta keep your guard up around him, too.</em></p>

      <p>Deeno looked at the blue butterfly-shaped mark on his right arm. He thought that Zegion had let him off the hook, but apparently this mark had become a corridor that connected the two of them, heart and soul. That’s how Rimuru was able to contact him.</p>

      <p><em>See? Totally calculating.</em></p>

      <p>Now Rimuru was speaking directly into his mind, taking all the information he could get from Deeno. All but forcing him to spy on the enemy with impunity. He didn’t feel disgusted about it or anything—in fact, he got a strange sort of thrill from the work. Maybe he was oddly happy to receive Rimuru’s trust.</p>

      <p><a id="page-246"></a><em>Here we go again…</em></p>

      <p>Deeno suddenly realized that, for the first time in a while, he felt pretty amused about all this. <em>This sure has turned into a big deal</em>, he thought.</p>

      <p>He had no intention whatsoever of betraying Veldanava, his creator. As long as Veldanava’s revival remained Michael and Feldway’s goal, he felt it was his duty to help with that. But, deep down, he couldn’t help but feel that this was turning into a lot more trouble than it was worth.</p>

      <p><em>Well, whatever. I’m not that much use around here regardless. I mean, the more serious I am about my work, the weaker I get. Not much I can do about it now. It’ll be better for everybody if I half-ass my work anyway, so what more could I ask for?</em></p>

      <p>That was one good trait of Deeno’s. If a problem presented itself, he could accept it and not dwell on it forever. There was an easygoing, positive solution for everything when it came to Deeno, who was unrivaled when it came to slacking off. That positivity was something terrifying about him, really.</p>

      <p>Regardless, he now felt quite refreshed as he waited for Feldway and the others, a relieved look on his face.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Arius was thinking.</p>

      <p>His bosses—Kagali and the others—were talking, but he had no idea what they were talking about. His temperament would normally make him complain about that, but his instincts told him that wasn’t a good idea.</p>

      <p>Of course it wasn’t. Arius was under Kagali’s full control. He had become a mystic angel, a figure well above the walking dead, but his locking curse was still in effect. If he awakened under his own power, it’d be a different story…but since this evolution was wholly set up for him, it only served to strengthen the dominance over him.</p>

      <p>Arius had no time to be annoyed by this. He was aware enough of his current situation. He was brimming with unbelievable power; the omnipotence at his fingertips elated him. And the biggest change of all was the evolution of his unique skill Murderer into the <a id="page-247"></a>ultimate enchantment Sandalphon, Lord of Judgment. Michael had retrieved this skill from Kondo and ferried it right over to Arius, consuming Murderer in the process.</p>

      <p>It was nothing Arius had any say in, but he wasn’t dissatisfied at all. And as he waited to be called up, he honestly felt pleased to have this new power.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Orca/Alia was confused. They had no time to eavesdrop on the conversations around them, because they were having a heated one inside their own body.</p>

      <p><em>“Who am I? Am I Alia? Or Orca?”</em></p>

      <p><em>“I don’t know. I’m Alia, but also Orca at the same time.”</em></p>

      <p>In this rather chaotic way, they could feel their consciousnesses unify into one. But it wasn’t unpleasant to them. In fact, it felt quite nice.</p>

      <p><em>“I…am Orlia…”</em></p>

      <p>Then the answer came to her.</p>

      <p>Orlia was a newborn, but already a first-rate warrior and magic-user in one. What’s more, Alternative—the skill granted to her—had optimized itself within Orlia’s body, transforming into the ultimate enchantment Multi-Weapon. This enabled her to create a variety of weapons by using the experiences accumulated within her own body. There were only so many she could bring out at the same time, but each one of them was equivalent to God-class.</p>

      <p>With all these weapons at her disposal, there wasn’t an enemy out there she was afraid to fight.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Mai Furuki was in despair.</p>

      <p>She thought she was dead, but here she was, back to life. That was fine, but the problem was that even now, with all this power in her hands, she still hadn’t fulfilled her wish to return to Japan.</p>

      <p><em>…I won’t give up. My unique skill Drifter couldn’t cut it, but Yuuki still said it was possible. And if skills get created from your wishes, I know I’ve got the power to make mine come true…</em></p>

      <p>But the moment that thought crossed her morose mind…</p>

      <p>When the seraphim was implanted within her, the ultimate <a id="page-248"></a>enchantment Alternative granted by Michael was consumed, evolving Drifter into the ultimate enchantment World Map. It was an astonishing ability, letting her accurately visualize any location in this world and grasp what was happening there at that moment. Even more amazingly, it also let her instantaneously travel to the location of her choice without any time lag. Someone with a spatially oriented skill would be shocked to hear of it.</p>

      <p>And yet, Mai’s wish did not come true. The coordinates programmed into World Map covered this world alone. It wouldn’t let her cross the walls between dimensions, something she could understand without testing it out.</p>

      <p>It was a tragedy, a huge disappointment—but either way, Mai wasn’t free right now. Everything was following the will of Michael. And until that day she could set off and freely travel back to her beloved brother, Mai would continue to follow orders, her heart closed to the world.</p>

      <p class="tx1">The newborn mystic angels weren’t the only ones trying to figure out what was going on. Zarario and Obela were thinking about their own situations as well.</p>

      <p>Zarario was quite grateful for his new physical body. He always had great power to wield, but it only really worked over in his own world. In the key world, the more power he exercised, the more energy he lost. A physical body was the only way to prevent this, but for someone as strong as Zarario, finding a vessel that could withstand his force was extremely difficult.</p>

      <p>That problem was solved now, allowing him to break out his full strength on the surface of the world—but another big problem arose.</p>

      <p><em>Well, great. Acquiring all this power has earned me Israfil, Lord of Trials, it seems. An</em> angelic <em>skill.</em></p>

      <p>And that was the issue. Zarario picked up Israfil as part of his new incarnation.</p>

      <p><em>Now there’s no way for me to go against Michael. But if I do away with this skill, he’ll think I am rebelling against him.</em></p>

      <p><a id="page-249"></a>Feldway, the way Zarario saw him, was a colleague. He recognized that Feldway could give him orders, but he wasn’t absolutely obedient to him. He also had qualms about Michael. Feldway trusted Michael wholeheartedly, but Zarario did not. He wasn’t about to readily trust the kind of will that’s strictly based on someone else’s authority. He agreed with their current objectives and was willing to help with them, but he couldn’t say whether that’d be the case forever. He had wanted to avoid acquiring any angelic skills just in case the time came to part ways later on.</p>

      <p>Nonetheless, Israfil had been tossed into his lap. It wasn’t an ultimate enchantment, so Michael’s will had nothing to do with it. Zarario obtained this power naturally, that much was for sure, and that made it all the more impossible to throw away.</p>

      <p><em>Now, how much does Michael know about this?</em></p>

      <p>Given his ability to tame Velgrynd and Velzard, there’s no doubt that Michael could wield full control over all angelic skills. But would he know exactly who possessed what? He should have thought about that question and acted accordingly.</p>

      <p><em>My will belongs to no one but me. I cannot allow anyone to rewrite my very thoughts without me realizing it.</em></p>

      <p>Zarario was a rational thinker. He didn’t intervene when it came to dominating the True Dragon sisters, not wanting to hurt its high chances of success…but in truth, he never liked that operation from the start. And now here he was, in pretty much the same position as them.</p>

      <p><em>Look at this… Just awful.</em></p>

      <p><em>It’s what he deserved</em>, he thought, <em>for not putting his foot down against it first thing.</em> He could see that now but didn’t dwell on it. It was time to figure out how to deal with this.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Obela, too, had acquired an angelic ultimate skill. And much like with Zarario, it was at best an unwelcome guest.</p>

      <p>During her evolution, Obela picked up the ultimate skill Azrael, Lord of Salvation. It was incredibly powerful, but ultimately useless to her. That was because, as a Primordial Angel, she was born with managerial abilities that were wholly non-reliant on skills. <a id="page-250"></a>Primordials could instantly cast all kinds of magic, and that was enough to conduct their business without skills entering the picture. It was that resourcefulness that gave angels like her that aura of omnipotence.</p>

      <p>For Obela and her fellow Primordials, who were already an ultimate form of existence, ultimate skills didn’t really make any difference. She wasn’t wishing for this at all, but she just <em>had</em> to get one at this exact moment. And of <em>course</em> it was going to be an angelic type…</p>

      <p><em>This is bad news. At this rate, he might find out that I’m turning traitor.</em></p>

      <p>That was exactly what Obela was intent on doing, which meant she was facing much more of a crisis than Zarario.</p>

      <p>She pondered over her options. Having her mind read wasn’t a concern; it was easy for her to erase her surface conscious well enough. But she couldn’t discount the possibility of falling under Michael’s control without realizing it, and that called for countermeasures.</p>

      <p><em>Perhaps some self-suggestion is in order</em>, she decided. If any contradiction made itself known in her mind, she would promptly destroy Azrael. It was an act that defied common sense, but for ultimate spiritual life-forms like them, it was completely possible.</p>

      <p>Of course, if it were to reach that point, it’d mean a complete breakaway from Feldway. Not even Obela could be safe then. But even so, Obela felt no need for concern. The fate of Milim, the orphaned daughter of Veldanava, was at stake.</p>

      <p><em>It’d be beyond disrespectful for us to second-guess the thoughts of the Creator, wouldn’t it? Perhaps Feldway isn’t performing this resurrection on his own volition, but either way, he’s gone far out of line.</em></p>

      <p>Those were her true feelings. Obela believed that Milim was the rightful successor to the title of Creator.</p>

      <p class="tx1">The beautiful tones of a bell rang out—solemnly, clearly, and tugging at the heartstrings of all who heard it. Then the door opened.</p>

      <p>Michael, Feldway, and Velzard breezily walked in. The three of <a id="page-251"></a>them alone radiated an aura so intense that it instantly banished the divine atmosphere of the audience chamber. Michael took his seat, followed by Feldway and Velzard.</p>

      <p>“Now…let us begin.”</p>

      <p>With that, their strategy conference kicked off.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">First, Mai was ordered to project a three-dimensional view of the entire key world in the center of the seating. This was, in essence, a miniature of the planet as perhaps seen by God, the bases of each demon lord depicted on it.</p>

      <p>“These are the domains and strongholds of the Octagram, the group of demon lords opposing us. There are six of them in total…”</p>

      <p>At Michael’s bidding, Mai placed six points of light on the lands: Guy’s domain at the north pole, Daggrull’s in the far west, Luminus’s a bit west of center, Rimuru’s in the forest, Milim’s to the southeast, and Leon’s vast island continent.</p>

      <p>“I would like to hear all of your opinions on how we should tackle this.”</p>

      <p>Feldway was asking for feedback from the whole audience, but his eyes were on just a few members—his closest advisors Zarario and Obela, along with Yuuki and Kagali. Deeno and his cohorts weren’t much for tactical thinking, and Vega was never going to contribute to something like this. Everyone else was a level below in Feldway’s eyes, not even granted the right to speak.</p>

      <p>Zarario and Obela kept their mouths shut, perhaps gauging the reaction from the others. Kagali, picking up on this, spoke first.</p>

      <p>“I would think the attackers would have the advantage here. I believe we should focus our fighting force on a single target.”</p>

      <p>“I agree with you there. It’s just hard to figure out where to strike.”</p>

      <p>The defending side was obligated to spread their forces wide, but there was no need for the attackers to follow their lead. Kagali and Yuuki agreed on that…but, surprisingly, Deeno was the first to react.</p>

      <p>“Lemme just say, you probably shouldn’t attack Ramiris’s labyrinth. Also, the Tempest capital of Rimuru is gonna be quarantined inside the labyrinth during the entire war. It’s designed <a id="page-252"></a>to be as tough to take down as possible, so I’d recommend saving it for last.”</p>

      <p>This information had already been shared around, so nobody objected. If they stumbled in the labyrinth, they could quickly be surrounded and annihilated by reinforcements from all the other allied nations.</p>

      <p>“Right. That’ll be last, then. And perhaps attacking elsewhere will lure out some forces holed up in that labyrinth for us.”</p>

      <p>Being dragged into a defensive battle would make Ramiris a major headache to deal with. They’d need to work out a clear strategy for whatever location they attacked.</p>

      <p>Velzard suddenly spoke, her gaze sharpened upon Leon’s continent. “There’s nobody left in Icefayr Castle right now. I don’t <em>see</em> any sign of people, at least.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm. The enemy’s thought up a few measures of their own, then? Consolidating the demon lords so they don’t spread themselves too thin?” Feldway mused.</p>

      <p>“…Indeed,” said Michael. “It looks like there are large powers concentrated upon five locations on the surface.”</p>

      <p>Mai took the dot off the north pole Guy called home and turned up the brightness on the other five. They had eliminated one option, although now the difficulty level seemed much higher. Despite that, the attacking side still had a great advantage.</p>

      <p>So where to aim? Zarario was the first to make a move.</p>

      <p>“Sir Feldway, I have a question.”</p>

      <p>“What’s that?”</p>

      <p>“We know that Sir Michael has full control over the angelic set of skills, but can he find out where the owners of these skills are, or at least a general idea of their location?”</p>

      <p>It was a vital question, one that had major implications for Zarario himself.</p>

      <p>“I was wondering about that, too,” added Obela. “If we had a grasp of that, we should try to recruit those skill holders first.”</p>

      <p>Michael nodded. “I was unable to sense it before, but now, it has come into focus. I see that you and Zarario have Azrael and Israfil, and Deeno’s group has Astarte, Haniel, and Jibril as well. Kagali <a id="page-253"></a>has taken Melchizedek, the remaining skill, and Arius over there is now the owner of Sandalphon. As for the higher-level angelics, the ones on my level…”</p>

      <p>He paused at this point, scowling.</p>

      <p>“…Something is missing.”</p>

      <p>The words caused everyone to tense up.</p>

      <p>“What do you mean, my lord?” Feldway asked.</p>

      <p>“First,” Michael began in a straightforward tone, “Raguel, the one Velgrynd possessed. I recovered it from her and granted it to a qualified receiver.”</p>

      <p>No one reacted. An eerie silence pervaded, but Michael paid it no mind.</p>

      <p>“Next is Gabriel. This has not been retrieved from its source. It’s still possessed by Velzard, isn’t it?”</p>

      <p>The ice beauty remained motionless, no expression on her face. It was the natural step to take, in order to ensure the Ultimate Dominion over her stayed active.</p>

      <p>“So I know the owner of all these skills so far, but out of the remaining four, three are still in question.”</p>

      <p>As Michael explained, he had taken Velgrynd’s abilities as his own, as well as Velzard’s draconic factors. This greatly increased his powers, granting him the ability to search for the owners of the angelic skills under his control. However, the only one of the four remaining skills he could track down was Metatron, Lord of Purity.</p>

      <p>“What? But didn’t the Hero Chronoa possess the ultimate skill Sariel, Lord of Hope?”</p>

      <p>“I failed to detect it. Either my detection skills cannot reach into Ramiris’s labyrinth, or there is some other cause afoot. I cannot say.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm. No, Ramiris is not one to trifle with. Perhaps the labyrinth is impossible for us to see into, then. Should we take that to mean that the owners of Uriel and Raphael are in the same location as Sariel?”</p>

      <p>“We can’t be sure, but it seems reasonable to assume so. There is no other possible place that my detection skill could not penetrate.”</p>

      <p>No skill created by Veldanava could go undetected by Michael. The only way to explain this was Mazecraft, Ramiris’s intrinsic skill. <a id="page-254"></a>This was why Michael concluded that the three “missing” skills must be in the same location. He was correct, in a way. All three of them were already gone from this world, their very essences transformed into something else…but, unaware of this, Michael assumed this problem was solved, and so did Feldway and the others.</p>

      <p>“Hmm. Well, that’s not a problem, then. We know Veldora’s in that labyrinth, so we’ll be attacking it sooner or later anyway. We can just track down those skill holders then, and add them to our ranks.”</p>

      <p>“It’s kind of like having an inside mole, isn’t it?”</p>

      <p>“Exactly. So let’s drop this topic for now. A single peek inside that labyrinth, and we’ll know where all the skills are. What we need to consider right now is which target to strike first…”</p>

      <p>“Well, I think we’ve already answered that question. If we’re one hundred percent sure where <em>one</em> of those angelic skills is, let’s add that guy to our group first, why don’t we?”</p>

      <p>That was Yuuki’s conclusion. His free will had been taken away, but his deep insight was still alive and well.</p>

      <p>“Mm. The one who possesses Metatron…is here.”</p>

      <p>All eyes focused on Michael’s finger. He was pointing straight at El Dorado, the capital of Leon’s domain.</p>

      <p>“The demon lord Leon,” muttered Kagali. “The one who killed me?”</p>

      <p>So it was Metatron, Lord of Purity, then? The blinding flash of light that burned her until she was a pile of ash? Now it was clear to her.</p>

      <p>“Sounds like we have a plan.” Yuuki smiled. “So who’ll be attacking?”</p>

      <p>“I’ll go,” Vega offered. “I dunno who this demon lord Leon guy is, but nobody minds if I eat him, right?”</p>

      <p>“Weren’t you even listening? Leon might wind up becoming our ally.”</p>

      <p>“Tsk… Oh, all right. I’ll make do with some other guys, then.”</p>

      <p>Yuuki and Vega were chatting like they already had a plan ratified. But with no one else objecting, that was the direction they went in.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">The whole object of this was to revive Veldanava, so there was no need to send a formal declaration of war. That was Michael and Feldway’s decision, and inevitably that meant things would kick off with a surprise attack.</p>

      <p>There wasn’t any need to be stingy with the firepower they threw into this…but Feldway had his own ideas about that.</p>

      <p>“So our objective here is to recruit the possessor of Metatron. If we could eliminate at least a few of the fighters who’d get in the way of that, even better, but I wouldn’t want to see this result in too many casualties. Let’s leave the rank-and-file soldiers behind for this one.”</p>

      <p>Only the strongest would be involved in this. Michael’s Ultimate Dominion might have been all-powerful, but it wasn’t universally available. It held absolute control over angelic skills, yet the user still had to make eye contact with the target to make it work. Dominion Bullet, lent to Lieutenant Kondo, only worked against a single target, and it also was unlikely to work unless you diverted that target’s attention.</p>

      <p>Regalia Dominion, by contrast, could control a varying number of people, depending on the existence points of the targets. Another important factor: The success rate went down if the target was of similar rank to the skill user, which meant it was likely to fail unless this target was fairly seriously wounded. Success wasn’t really guaranteed unless the target was below the user in rank, which made it a difficult power to leverage very well.</p>

      <p>Michael’s EP was at around ninety million. However, Yuki’s own EP of around two million needed to be subtracted from this. And considering Veldora’s EP was eighty-eight million, Regalia Dominion wasn’t likely to work on him. Michael had no way of knowing this, of course, but he still thought that controlling Veldora would be a trying task at best. That’s why he wanted to gather up as much offensive force as he could before tackling Ramiris’s labyrinth.</p>

      <p>So they needed to decide who to deploy on this mission.</p>

      <p><a id="page-256"></a>“I’m staying behind.”</p>

      <p>Deeno spoke up first. No one objected.</p>

      <p>“What about myself and my force?” Zeranus asked.</p>

      <p>“For now, I’d like you to be prepared to move your forces. This operation will be followed by a full-scale invasion.”</p>

      <p>“Very well.”</p>

      <p>The insectors, much like the mystics, would be preparing for total war. Dhalis and Neece would manage the Zarario force, while Obela would need to return to the other world to pick up her force before handing it over to Ohma.</p>

      <p>Now all the top staff were deploying for war.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Mai could use her skill to instantly transport just this group to their destination. Obela could also use Detect Aura to easily work out the right coordinates and teleport herself right over.</p>

      <p>That was how the logistics would work—and with that, the surprise attack was underway.</p>
