      <p class="noindent"><a id="page-259"></a>So I got word from Deeno, but what he had to tell me was pretty whacked out.</p>

      <p>I guess I should’ve seen it coming, but yes, Michael was on the move. That much was expected, so I didn’t mind—but the real surprise was what Obela was up to. It turns out that she left Michael’s camp for an unknown destination…and took her army with her. I was stunned.</p>

      <p>(What? You’re kidding me.)</p>

      <p>(Nope. I’m pretty surprised, too. And get this—Michael’s still completely unaware of it. I’m about to go inform him.)</p>

      <p>Wow. He really is a huge idiot, isn’t he? Now I’m sure of it. With everything going on, is now really the time to get lazy about that sort of thing? And before that, why is he leaking stuff out to the enemy before telling his own boss about it?</p>

      <p>I mean…Deeno being that way helps a lot and all, but…you know? Now I’m feeling just a little sympathetic for Michael and Feldway. But before I get too carried away, let’s ask one important question.</p>

      <p>(So where are you guys gonna attack?)</p>

      <p>(Oh, yeah, they’re attackin’ Leon’s city. Like I said, Obela’s AWOL and I’m holding down the fort here, so all the other top brass are on the move. Pico and Garasha got taken along against <a id="page-260"></a>their will, too, so could ya give them a pass if you happen to get in a fight with them?)</p>

      <p>(You think I can guarantee that?! Like, I’ll keep it in mind, but…)</p>

      <p>(Thanks. Oh, also, I got one more favor to ask…)</p>

      <p>(Make it quick. I’m kinda busy.)</p>

      <p>I was preparing to set off for battle, in fact. But I let Deeno have his say.</p>

      <p>(Like, I guess I sorta miss working with Vester and Ramiris and the gang. It’s so boring up here, y’know? So can you hurry up and beat Michael’s ass for me? And then get me outta here!)</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>I was stunned into silence.</p>

      <p>(Look, did you get hit in the head or something? You understand that’s nothing you’re supposed to say to the enemy, right?)</p>

      <p>(Wow, so mean! We’re friends, aren’t we? Quit being so cold like that! Oh, right, I just remembered—did you apologize to Ramiris for me yet? I wanna make up with her later.)</p>

      <p>(Don’t give me that crap! I told you to go apologize yourself!)</p>

      <p>(W-wait a second, Rimuru!)</p>

      <p>(Regardless—)</p>

      <p>Yes, regardless, I’m not about to let anyone be mind-controlled against their will like this.</p>

      <p>(Regardless, just do your best to get out from your mind control for me, okay? Hurry up before you shame all us other demon lords!)</p>

      <p>(Ha-ha-ha! I’ll try. But, hey, I know I can depend on you and stuff. Nobody’s better at leaving work to other people than me, so I hope you don’t mind me taking advantage of you like that, okay?)</p>

      <p>He was really starting to piss me off. I’d expect nothing else from him…</p>

      <p>(Also, one more word of warning. Feldway’s in league with the insectors.)</p>

      <p>(I know. It sure doesn’t sound like good news.)</p>

      <p>(Oh, it’s beyond bad. Their king, Zeranus—we met for the first time, but he might be even higher up there than Guy. I won’t know unless I try, but I’m sure I wouldn’t win even if I went all-out. He <a id="page-261"></a>and his force’re sitting out this current attack, but I dunno when they’ll spring into action, so keep your guard up, okay?)</p>

      <p>I didn’t need that advice from him. But as intel, it was really valuable—and really ominous. Hearing he outstripped Guy ratcheted up my despair to maximum. If someone <em>that</em> dangerous is both leading an army and resting up for now, we’ll need to make sure we can respond to any move from him immediately.</p>

      <p>I thought about calling back Geld and the other guys I had stationed across the land, but opted against it. If they targeted us wherever we were shorthanded, we’d be on the ropes in a hurry. We’ll just have to make do with the forces we have on hand.</p>

      <p>(Thanks for the warning. I’ll tell everyone, and we’ll stay on the lookout. Now, seriously, try a little up there, won’t you?)</p>

      <p>(Sure. Don’t get yourself killed, Rimuru.)</p>

      <p>He didn’t have to remind me. I was on my second life as a slime, and I wanted to enjoy it for a change. It’d been nothing but war for a while—I wanted to just clean up all this mess and take it easy. I wanted to have a blast with all my friends, too, and that included Deeno, of course.</p>

      <p>(You too.) I replied—and I meant it, from the bottom of my heart.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="tx1">As soon as I finished my conversation with Deeno, I called the cabinet members still standing by in our capital of Rimuru.</p>

      <p>We assembled in the Control Center. Our Argos surveillance system was showing us Leon’s base of operations, but the whole area was being walloped by a blizzard, making it impossible to see anything. Considering El Dorado’s usually mild climate, a blizzard like this was clearly unnatural; it was obviously Velzard’s work. There was no contact from anyone on Leon’s side, and we had no way of visually confirming the enemy. Communications were probably being jammed somehow, and overall, Deeno was starting to look pretty darn correct about all this.</p>

      <p><a id="page-262"></a>If the enemy was deploying strictly the main forces, we’d need to call up something appropriate in return. We need to send some support for the guys already there—mess that up, though, and it could lead to enormous damage. Too many of us sent over there, and the labyrinth would be too thinly guarded; too few, and we couldn’t complete the mission. We were being asked to thread an exceedingly small needle.</p>

      <p>“I see. So the enemy’s on the large side, then?”</p>

      <p>Benimaru’s eyes lit up when I told him what Deeno had said to me. He was ready to go out there right now, and I wasn’t about to stop him.</p>

      <p>“I was thinking about backing up our crew over there with just me, Ranga, and Soei to start out…but it’s looking like a more powerful force than we thought. We could be in danger if we hold back…so I’ll want you to join us, Benimaru.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, that goes without saying. Who else will you take with you?”</p>

      <p>Benimaru broke into a giddy smile when I announced I was bringing him. As long as he was going, I don’t think he really cared who else was there.</p>

      <p>“Me, perhaps?”</p>

      <p>“No.”</p>

      <p>I killed Veldora’s proposal immediately. He really needs to think a little more. Yes, it’d certainly be reassuring to have him on our side, and I’ll admit that he’d be a huge asset in battle…but I can’t have him so conveniently forgetting that he’s the enemy’s biggest target.</p>

      <p>“Look, you need to realize that they’re after you, okay? And in the first place, we can always revive ourselves as long as one of us is safe, so both of us fighting at the same time is the stupidest idea ever!”</p>

      <p>“Kwaaaah-hah-hah-hah! Perhaps I was careless, yes. Leave the labyrinth defenses to me, then!”</p>

      <p>“Yes. Please.”</p>

      <p><em>We’re in serious trouble here, okay? Don’t try anything funny, I’m begging you.</em></p>

      <p>So, with our problem child out of the picture, I turned toward Zegion.</p>

      <p>“Now, as for you and Apito, I’d like you both to continue guarding the labyrinth. I think they got some serious threats on their side, so we can’t afford to leave the place completely empty.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-263"></a>“We will be on the job, Sir Rimuru. Good hunting out there.”</p>

      <p><em>So</em> encouraging. We have the Dragon Lords on standby down there as well, so they should still be a pretty respectable force—them, and Treyni, Beretta, and Charys, too.</p>

      <p>“Charys, make sure you keep an eye on Veldora so he doesn’t go out of control on us.”</p>

      <p>“There is no need to remind me, Sir Rimuru. I will be sure to keep a close watch on Sir Veldora, so you may go into battle with full peace of mind.”</p>

      <p>“Huh? I’m being watched now?”</p>

      <p>“Don’t worry about it.”</p>

      <p>“N-no, um, I rather am worried…”</p>

      <p>“Here, just read this and relax a bit.”</p>

      <p>Seeing Charys all but force a manga volume into Veldora’s hands was encouraging in a much different way.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, so just leave my master here to us!”</p>

      <p>“We have the labyrinth well defended, and we are training hard so that we won’t be caught unawares next time. I very much look forward to showing you the results.”</p>

      <p>Hopefully the opportunity won’t present itself, but doing all this prep work just in case is reassuring to see. I nodded my approval back at Treyni.</p>

      <p>“With the power you’ve given me, Sir Rimuru, I am stronger than ever. I have never missed a day of training with Charys, and I assure you that I have no intention of losing to Deeno next time.”</p>

      <p>Right. Let’s trust in that. Whether he can defeat Deeno or not, Beretta and his team couldn’t be that far behind him by now.</p>

      <p>So:</p>

      <p>“I’m taking Kumara with me.”</p>

      <p>I decided that my deployment team would be me, Benimaru, Ranga, Kumara, and Soei. Not that I didn’t have my concerns, though…</p>

      <p>“I’m sorry, though, Benimaru. I made this decision without asking your opinion, but you’ve got a right to refuse if you want to. I know you have a couple of wives to protect, after all. Don’t you?”</p>

      <p>Momiji and Alvis were both well into their pregnancies. I think. <a id="page-264"></a>It turned out that the gestation periods of monsters could vary surprisingly widely. Kaede had apparently kept Momiji inside her womb for over three hundred years, after all. And with the lycanthropes, well, sometimes they were embryos in the womb, sometimes they were eggs—they were counted as the same race, but all this diversity!</p>

      <p>Alvis was ovoviviparous, which was kind of a middle ground between the two—the embryos developed inside of eggs that remained in the mom’s body until pretty much the moment they were ready to hatch. Alvis was obliged to stay in her animal transformation during the whole pregnancy, too. I guess retaining human form required some amount of physical strain, but this, too, varied from person to person.</p>

      <p>The science of monster ecology was still in its infancy, really, and I couldn’t devote much time to it. Hopefully we’ll see some enterprising biologists or naturists delve into the topic in the near future. For now, I’ll leave it at that.</p>

      <p>The important thing right now was how Benimaru felt about heading to battle with two pregnant wives to think about. What’s more important to him—his work, or himself? It’s the kind of question nobody likes to answer. And I’m…you know, single, so it’s never one I’ve had to tackle before. Not that I mind or anything. I’m not jealous, I swear! Besides, I was the kind of office flack who had to pull an all-nighter on my own birthday, so having a girlfriend would’ve just sucked for both of us.</p>

      <p>From an emotional standpoint, of course my wife would matter more…but from a practical one, maybe my job would. I can’t make a living without money, so honestly, I might have to prioritize work that way. But what’s the point of working if you can’t protect your family? That question’s gonna come up at times, too. It’s hard.</p>

      <p>It’d be nice if we all worked at companies that understood that sort of thing…but in my nation, at least, I want to pursue ways to get as close to that ideal as possible. I don’t want Benimaru to face marital trouble this early on, so I really wanted to respect his will on this.</p>

      <p>But Benimaru just laughed off my concern.</p>

      <p><a id="page-265"></a>“There is no need to worry. I’ll do everything I can to protect those I love. I always wanted to have a successor to take on my will in case something happened to me, after all. I would hate to get my priorities wrong about that.”</p>

      <p>I see. That seems reasonable. But is he really sure about that?</p>

      <p>“Yes, but…”</p>

      <p>Kind of weird how I’m wavering over this more than he is. But Benimaru gave me a reassuring smile.</p>

      <p>“I’m telling you, it’s fine. Right here is the safest place in the world, and I’ve also asked Hakuro to guard them for me. If worse comes to worst, I’m sure he will step up and raise my progeny. So please, don’t worry about me! Besides, I don’t think I could possibly lose, and I also don’t doubt your victory for a moment, Sir Rimuru.”</p>

      <p>There was something bracing, refreshing, to the way he said it. Soei was nodding his approval, and everybody else in the room seemed to agree with him. Now I feel like I had the wrong idea all along.</p>

      <p>“Ho-ho-ho! You’re a very kind leader, Sir Rimuru. I’m sure you feel that way because you were born in peaceful times, but in a war-torn world like this one, it’s not exactly the mainstream way of thinking, you see. My daughter Momiji is prepared for the worst, as is Lady Alvis. And more to the point, we also believe in Sir Benimaru.”</p>

      <p>It was clear from his choice of words that Hakuro was being serious. And Momiji and Alvis—who had let themselves into the room at some point—were in full agreement.</p>

      <p>“Exactly. My husband couldn’t possibly fall in battle!”</p>

      <p>“I agree with Momiji. Sir Benimaru, if you were to do something like die on us, I’d chase you down to the ends of the earth and make you pay for it. So be ready!”</p>

      <p>Guess they’re all resolved to this. No point in me meaninglessly fretting over it, then.</p>

      <p>“All right. I get the message, yeah. I can’t guarantee that we’ll win this, but I <em>will</em> promise that we’ll all make it back alive.”</p>

      <p>“Heh. You are in good hands, Sir Rimuru. Win, and all is well.”</p>

      <p>I had kind of forgotten how incredibly confident Benimaru was <a id="page-266"></a>all the time. When he and Soei were together, it’s like there was nobody they couldn’t beat. I could say the same for the Kumara/Ranga duo, too, actually.</p>

      <p>“Yes. I will do my best as well. Defeat is impossible!”</p>

      <p>“As will I, my master! No matter who the enemy is, one bite and it’ll be as good as done!”</p>

      <p>I wasn’t so sure about that, but I got what he meant.</p>

      <p>“Yeah… Well, now’s not the time to be wavering like this. We can’t get all worried before a fight this big. It’s kind of funny to see us stepping up to protect Leon, of all people, but let’s do our best and put an end to Michael’s plans!”</p>

      <p>That was my declaration of war. I wasn’t about to sit here and give my team a bunch of pleasantries. If I thought we could maybe come to terms with Michael if we just sat down and talked things out, I’d say so—but not here. He’s dangerous. He’s got no sense of humanity at all, and he’s willing to sacrifice anything to reach his goals. He’s pretty much the worst kind of person, but at the end of the day, if someone’s beyond negotiating with, all you can do is step up and settle things for good.</p>

      <p>“Let’s go!”</p>

      <p>Everyone nodded. I’d fret over things once it was all over. And with that resolve, I was ready to transfer all of us to the battlefield.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">

      <p class="tx1">But while Rimuru and his staff were making preparations, the battle had already begun. There was no lengthy declaration of war at all—it began with Vega going on a rampage.</p>

      <p>“Tsk! Can’t he take any strategic action at all?”</p>

      <p>“You said it…”</p>

      <p>Kagali nodded at Feldway’s pained complaint. Their mission here wasn’t to lay waste to El Dorado. They needed to track down the possessor of the angelic skill, drag him out of there, and add him to their force.</p>

      <p>Hearing that Feldway could use Michael’s domination skills puzzled Kagali at first. But it made sense. It was a tactically sound way <a id="page-267"></a>of keeping your supreme commander away from battle. So, without any further doubts, she accepted their plan.</p>

      <p>And a simple plan it was. Thirteen people were here on the field—Feldway, Velzard, Zarario, Pico, Garasha, Kagali, Yuuki, Teare, Footman, Vega, Orlia, Arius, and Mai Furuki—and they were being asked to kick as much ass as possible. They’d mow down anyone who attempted to engage them, and in the meantime, they’d also search for the angelic skill’s possessor.</p>

      <p>They were working on conjecture instead of proven fact, but Kagali was all but certain this possessor was Leon. But even if she was wrong, that wasn’t much of a problem. Just grab all the potential targets they could find, and the operation was as good as over. If he didn’t come out—if they hardened up the city’s defenses instead—Kagali would lead a storming party to venture into the city.</p>

      <p>However, as soon as Mai teleported everyone there, Vega promptly ignored orders and went berserk, bashing and smashing up the city’s defensive barrier. He was zooming his way to what appeared to be a royal castle, leaving a trail of carnage behind him. Even Kagali was appalled.</p>

      <p><em>I feel like this boost in power has made him stupider than ever. We can’t use him in any coherent tactical maneuvers like this. In fact, we may have to seriously consider purging him.</em></p>

      <p>In their organization, breaking orders was strictly forbidden. If a senior officer was acting like this, it may already be too late to save military discipline around here. They’d likely need to discuss how to handle Vega, if only to make an example out of him to the rest of their force.</p>

      <p>Either way, though, the operation was now underway. Vega could be discussed when they were back. For now, Kagali decided to consult with Feldway about their direction.</p>

      <p>“Velzard and I are a perfect diversion. But Zarario, Pico, Garasha: You stay here with us, too. Everyone else will go under your command, so get out there, start bashing heads, and figure out who we’re after.”</p>

      <p>Many people here were under Kagali’s locking curse—Teare and Footman, of course, but also walking-dead incarnates like Arius, <a id="page-268"></a>Orlia, and Mai. She couldn’t force orders upon them, but she could telepathically communicate into their minds. Kagali was also a good operation planner, something Feldway appreciated, so she had the right to craft any kind of tactics she wanted out here.</p>

      <p>Thus, she gave the orders.</p>

      <p>“We’ll reprimand Vega for his outburst later. For now, just go all-out against the enemy. You may retreat if you feel you can’t win, so go out there and pummel them!”</p>

      <p>Everybody there, except for Yuuki, had freshly obtained untold amounts of power. They undoubtedly had more self-control than Vega, but they all couldn’t wait to test how strong they had become. Thus, as soon as Kagali gave permission, everyone moved en masse.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Kagali followed at a prudent distance.</p>

      <p><em>My own free will has been left intact, as well as a certain amount of authority. I’m not sure I’ll ever get an opportunity this good again…</em></p>

      <p>Perhaps it was wiser to wait for a better chance to arise. That thought crossed her mind, but Michael’s current grip over it scared her deeply. If she were turned into a fully subservient puppet, all hope would be dashed. It was entirely possible that this would be her last chance—optimism was a dangerous thing. So Kagali decided to take action.</p>

      <p>From the very beginning, she had no intention of pledging her allegiance to Feldway and his cohorts. In fact, she thought of both him and Michael as insane—so out of their minds, she could feel it on her skin. To her, she was sure any future that involved her and them was bleak indeed.</p>

      <p><em>“I swear that I will not betray you… And I accept your dominion over me.”</em></p>

      <p>That’s right. Kagali swore that she wouldn’t betray her companions, even if it meant accepting Michael’s control over her. And no matter how dirty her hands got, she was prepared to return the favor she received from Yuuki.</p>

      <p><em>It looks like Michael’s control is absolute within a certain range. But maybe the effect dwindles the farther you are from him. That, or if we can fully isolate ourselves in a different space from him, we could eliminate the effect entirely!</em></p>

      <p><a id="page-269"></a>Michael had done everything he could to search for the remaining angelic skills. But three were still missing—in some kind of safe zone from him. And that was Ramiris’s labyrinth. If she could flee into there, Kagali and her friends had a chance at being saved. Fortunately, she was in an alliance with the demon lord Rimuru…although that might be a bit doubtful by now. Yet as soft and good-natured as he was, there was an exceedingly good chance that he’d shelter them.</p>

      <p>So her mission here was to cause as big a commotion as possible, then find an opening for her escape. And to do that…</p>

      <p>(Can you hear me, Laplace?)</p>

      <p>(…President?! Wow, you’re all right?!)</p>

      <p>(Yes, but I’m in a tricky situation. So—)</p>

      <p>(Well, gimme yer orders, Boss. Where d’you want me?)</p>

      <p>(…El Dorado.)</p>

      <p>Kagali played the most reliable card in her deck—and with that, Laplace joined the battle.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">

      </div>

      <p class="tx1">Leon’s force was feeling the strain. They had been expecting an attack, training for it—and today was the day.</p>

      <p>It didn’t take long for Leon to receive a report that the city’s defensive barrier was broken, allowing the enemy inside. “There’s only eight of them,” a pale-looking knight said in a later follow-up, “but they possess massive strength! They’ve been allowed to penetrate the castle! Our forces are in disarray!”</p>

      <p>Leon looked at Guy as the knight returned to battle.</p>

      <p>“Any word from Rimuru?”</p>

      <p>“Oof. We’re isolated here. Velzard… She’s above us. There’s more than eight of ’em.”</p>

      <p>If he was invading this city, Guy would’ve moved to rob the enemy of its cohesion as well. This was something they all expected. To deal with it, Rimuru was using Argos to monitor the situation with each of his forces, as a countermeasure against just such a situation. There’d be a time lag, but at least they’d all know what’s going on.</p>

      <p>Help would quickly be forthcoming…and even if it wasn’t on <a id="page-270"></a>time and the worst-case scenario occurred, Rimuru had another plan, one he’d explained with a chuckle. He probably wasn’t being serious, and Leon wanted nothing to do with that plan, but if it got that bad, he wouldn’t be in any position to protest. The worst case had to be prevented from happening.</p>

      <p>“So now what? Should we wait here until Rimuru’s backup arrives?”</p>

      <p>“That’s gonna be pretty difficult,” Guy said. “We would’ve had a lot of options if Velzard wasn’t here. But once she gets serious in battle, she’s liable to take down this entire city.”</p>

      <p>“…I wouldn’t like that.”</p>

      <p>A spatial transfer required you to have accurate coordinates of both your current position and your destination. If contact beyond city limits was cut off, that meant the enemy was taking measures against that, no doubt. If their transport magic circle were destroyed as well, it’d delay the arrival of reinforcements even more. If they could buy another ten or so minutes, Rimuru was probably going to show up—but if they wanted to hope for that, they had to protect this position with their lives.</p>

      <p>“I’m sure you wouldn’t, no. Guess I’m gonna have to go out and take them on, then.” Guy stood up.</p>

      <p>“I’ll join you.”</p>

      <p>“Let me show them just how serious I can be.”</p>

      <p>Mizeri and Raine joined him. After living together with them for the past few months, Leon knew exactly what they were capable of. Raine, in particular, had been rapidly improving her skills, giving Leon a run for his money in their training. It’d annoy him to no end in normal times, but with her on his side, he saw her as a trustworthy ally.</p>

      <p>“I wish she could always be that serious,” complained Mizeri, and really, she spoke for everybody else.</p>

      <p>But then another problem child spoke up.</p>

      <p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh… I doubt a pair of weaklings like you would help us very much. I am rather reluctant to lend a hand to Guy, but I have my orders from Sir Rimuru, and I will concentrate on those. You will have my assistance. Shall we go?”</p>

      <p>Diablo smiled, as if to show how grateful Guy should be for this. Raine shot back at him, triggering an argument. A disgusted Guy <a id="page-271"></a>yelled at them, Mizeri shaking her head in frustration all the while. And seeing them yell and scream as they left the room, Leon’s only thought was how much of a happy family they were.</p>

      <p>But he didn’t have time for them. Guy’s team would handle the scene outside, but Leon had his own duties. He could hear his soldiers screaming out in the hallways; the battle clearly wasn’t going their way. Even worse, any rash moves exposed him to potential mind control—the most frustrating thing of all.</p>

      <p>“None of them are headed for the city?” he asked Arlos the Silver Knight, the trusty assistant who always stood by him.</p>

      <p>Arlos used Thought Communication to speak with a few of his fellow knights before answering, “No, sir! All the enemies appear to be heading for the castle.”</p>

      <p>Leon nodded. That, at least, was good news.</p>

      <p>“In that case, have our magic knights seal off the castle! We’ll isolate the intruders inside and keep them from reaching the outside world!”</p>

      <p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

      <p>Deciding that any further worry for Guy was unwarranted, Leon sent a flurry of orders. If the enemy’s cooped up in the castle, there’d be no more damaging the city outside. Then he could wait for Rimuru’s backup and defeat this foe inside their virtual cage.</p>

      <p>“I want every knight captain engaging our enemies to prevent any further casualties.”</p>

      <p>“As you wish!”</p>

      <p>Their standing defense force would never handle them all. Once the castle was sealed off with an isolation barrier, the knight captains would be sent in to intercept the enemy. It was time to deploy the troops they were preserving until now.</p>

      <p>The Yellow Knights, a team of defense specialists, would join the healers in the White Knights to maintain the city’s defensive barriers. The Red Knights, geared for attacking, would then be dispatched to engage the enemy. That only left the Blue Knights, mainly suited as a commando unit; they’d take action as needed to cover any lightly guarded territory.</p>

      <p>Arlos took the lead, sending out Leon’s commands. Then a group <a id="page-272"></a>of six people suddenly appeared before the demon lord, kneeling in submission.</p>

      <p>“Demon lord Leon, please grant us permission to go out as well.”</p>

      <p>These were the generals serving under Guy. They technically served Mizeri and Raine, and with their recent evolutions, they had been promoted to Demon Peers.</p>

      <p>Misora, the chief officer under Raine, must’ve had a hard time in her position, because she was now at the duke level of the demon hierarchy. She was weaker than Moss, who was a grand duke, but she was a head above the rest of this group. Khan, Mizeri’s chief officer, wasn’t lagging too far behind—not as good in battle as Misora, but strong enough to merit a marquis title. Even the other four generals here were on par with the captains of the various magic knight corps present. Idling them here would be a tremendous waste.</p>

      <p>“Granted,” said Leon. “Get going. Work with Fran and the others and defeat our enemies.”</p>

      <p>So the demons were unleashed.</p>

      <p>The only ones left in the room with Leon were his attendant Arlos and the Black Knight Claude, Arlos’s instructor. Leon would have preferred them heading out to face their enemies as well, but since Leon himself was clearly the target, he needed some bodyguards with him.</p>

      <p>“Frustrating, isn’t it?” Leon groused.</p>

      <p>“Be patient, please,” Arlos urged him. “It’s a little strange to be protecting someone like you, Sir Leon, but you must trust us and stay here.”</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh-heh… There are just eight enemies in the castle. We have four knight captains here, as well as those demons and a number of well-trained knight corps. There’s no way we could lose.”</p>

      <p>Claude was trying to assuage Leon. Arlos was optimistic, as if trying to remind himself of their chances. He knew it wouldn’t be that easy, but he had to keep Leon from falling into the hands of the enemy. Patience was key right now. They had to await better news here, on Leon’s throne.</p>

      <p>Then, after a while, they began to sense violent tremors across the castle.</p>

      <p class="space-break1"><a id="page-273"></a>The most intense battlefield was the site of Vega’s rampage. Misora was in command, with four other demons working to stall for time. Maeter, the White Knight and captain of the White Knight corps, was providing support. She was a blond, blue-eyed woman with very ladylike features, but her specialty was healing, and her mere presence ensured they could fight for that much longer.</p>

      <p>Each demon was striking once, then retreating so Maeter could heal them and help them back into battle to repeat the cycle. Faced with overwhelming violence, their only choice was to throw themselves into the fray and hope for the best.</p>

      <p>Misora’s face contorted in pain. But she couldn’t lose heart now. She had to endure her master Raine’s crazed rush over and over again in training…and in any case, Guy would purge her if she fled at this point. Better instead, she thought, to fight proudly and ensure she fulfilled her role.</p>

      <p>But while Vega’s existence points numbered over ten million, the top-level demons did no better than half a million. Even Misora’s EP was at around seven hundred thousand. None of them had any ultimate skills, so the difference in firepower was obvious to everyone.</p>

      <p>“Gah-ha-ha-ha! Weak, weak, weak… <em>Soooo</em> weak!! Or maybe I’m too strong? Sorry, guys! You’re so weak, I don’t even feel like eating any of you. I guess that means your suffering will continue for a while…but don’t hate me. Hate how weak you are!!”</p>

      <p>The trash-talking came nonstop from Vega; he was trampling on the demons’ pride, and they had no choice but to stay calm and deal with it. But that was their exact strategy, actually. With their gifts at reading emotions, the demons were trying to take advantage of Vega’s personality, maintaining the stalemate by letting him kick all the ass he wanted.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">The fight against Vega was intense, but at least stable. By comparison, every moment of the fight against Arius was screeching with tension.</p>

      <p>“Hyaaaaah-ha-ha-ha! It’s all-you-can-kill today! Oh man, oh man, oh man… This power is just <em>so</em> cool!!”</p>

      <p><a id="page-274"></a>Arius was lost in a never-ending spasm of violence, all his cool from his human years apparently lost.</p>

      <p>The ultimate enchantment Sandalphon had embodied itself in the form of a handgun that Arius could fire as much as he wanted, no reloading required. He also had a bastard sword in his right hand, a product of Orlia’s Multi-Weapon skill. These two pieces of equipment were far more powerful than run-of-the-mill God-class gear, and Arius was making full use of them both as he slaughtered the knights. He seemed to be mimicking Lieutenant Kondo in battle style, likely expressing an aspiration that Arius himself would never admit to.</p>

      <p>Oxian the Blue Knight had formed a tag team with Khan to challenge him. There was no way to make up for the weapon difference, but the two of them proved to be an excellent match in terms of skill. Khan was staking his pride as a great demon, casting magic to interfere with Arius’s movements, while Oxian’s graceful sword strikes were letting him hold his own against this adversary. The latter also had a gift for support magic, which was huge; their physical abilities and durability were both upgraded by multiple layers of magic from them both.</p>

      <p>But they still had almost no chance. This was a foe that not even a direct strike could injure, and Oxian, a nihilistic young noble, didn’t expect to win from the start. Taking care not to break his sword, he just kept throwing himself in, trying to extend this battle as long as possible. This was one enemy he wanted to be sure would never reach his beloved Leon.</p>

      <p>It seemed like this fight would last forever…but it had only just begun.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Fighting against Orlia were Fran and Kizona, commanders of the Red and Yellow Knights respectively. Fran was a healthy beauty with auburn skin, lightly armored and focused on offensive force, while Kizona was small, bright-faced, and clad in heavy full-body armor.</p>

      <p>If these two women had anything going for them, it was their foe’s lack of fighting spirit. Orlia was being extremely careful. Unlike Vega and Arius, she was much more methodical about testing out her powers, testing Multi-Weapon to see what kinds of gear <a id="page-275"></a>it could conjure. She had given a one-handed sword to Arius and a crescent bow to Mai, but for herself, she prepared a morning star and a tower shield in order to test both her offense and defense.</p>

      <p>That personality quirk was proving to be a lifesaver for her adversaries. Using the two of them as experimental subjects, Orlia slowly but surely came to grips with the gear she had in hand, thanks to her brand-new ultimate enchantment.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Mai, meanwhile, was on the battlefield, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that she didn’t belong here. She had no idea why she should be fighting, but it was impossible to defy Michael’s will. He had even brainwashed Yuuki, someone she trusted immensely. There was no way someone like Mai could beat him.</p>

      <p>But that didn’t mean she wanted to let off some steam against a bunch of knights he had no grudge against, either. So she just watched from the sidelines. If she <em>did</em> join the fray, the battle would have long ago tilted in the angels’ favor, but that’s not how it turned out.</p>

      <p>“All this is gonna do is bring pain to us all. But what should I do? Tell me, Yuuki…”</p>

      <p>She was lost, troubled, and unable to find an answer. She would still need some more time before she could make a move.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Guy’s party stormed out to intercept the enemy…only to find a giant blizzard blowing outside. It was a special gift from Velzard.</p>

      <p>“I’ll take care of her,” Guy said, and nobody was about to stop him.</p>

      <p>The two of them had fought many times, from long ago in the past to just recently—but frankly, Velzard was crazily strong. Guy was her only natural opponent here—and she wasn’t holding back one bit, either. As if to prove it, she had transformed herself from a young girl to an adult woman, her eyes golden instead of their usual deep-sea blue. They shone bewitchingly, beautifully, portending great disaster to come. This human state was Velzard fighting in her “real” mode, and it made Guy realize just how serious she was.</p>

      <p>That, and Velzard had gone mad—in a good way. When Guy <a id="page-276"></a>flew up to her, floating in the middle of this great snowstorm, she found him shouting with joy.</p>

      <p>“I love, love, <em>looove</em> you, Guy. So join me…and let’s kill, kill, kill, kill, and kill some more!”</p>

      <p>She challenged him, a gigantic smile on her face.</p>

      <p>“Tsk… I <em>told</em> you that’s nothing but trouble!”</p>

      <p>Guy was just as serious about fighting back. Trying to take it easy against Velzard would be tantamount to suicide. So, here in the skies above the castle, a battle broke out between two of the most powerful forces in the world.</p>

      <p>Yes, Guy was strong. His EP was extremely high, almost reaching forty million. But Velzard was simply on another level—her powers more than twice that of Guy, unimaginably. She was the younger sister of the Creator for a reason, and here on the surface of the planet, she wielded absolute power.</p>

      <p>And what’s worse, she had never truly fought all-out before—not even against her sister Velgrynd. She always took the form of a little girl when she did, sealing away her powers. When she obliterated Veldora, that was nothing but a playful blow to her. Her strikes weren’t just powerful—they were energy-efficient.</p>

      <p>The only time she ever got serious was when she fought against Guy. He could only fight on an even keel with her thanks to his superior fighting sense. He was also trying to ensure this fight didn’t damage people and buildings on the ground as much as possible, which perhaps says something about just how all-powerful Guy Crimson can be.</p>

      <p>The battle, as usual, was shaping up to be a stalemate. Then Guy realized something.</p>

      <p><em>She’s not being controlled at all…</em></p>

      <p>He was sure she was, but in his mind, she simply chose not to resist this thrall, likely because her desires matched those of her cohorts. Velzard just looked so <em>happy</em>—a face that brought back memories for Guy, one she only showed in the midst of battle.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t exactly good news, though. Guy was fed up with it. She had bottled up all these desires of hers for so long, and here comes Feldway and his gang, freeing it all. Until Velzard could be convinced otherwise, in other words, their relationship would never <a id="page-277"></a>improve. If this were merely about mind control, they could shut it off and everything would be fixed. But it wasn’t, and now Guy had nothing left to try.</p>

      <p>Velzard wasn’t going to be persuaded. The only way to restore her sanity was to let her have at it with Guy for as long as she wanted.</p>

      <p>“I never should’ve left my bedroom today…”</p>

      <p>Guy was whining, but there was a bold smile on his face. He lunged at his enemy once more, enjoying every moment.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">In the skies, even higher above the castle than Velzard and Guy, Feldway and Zarario were facing off against Diablo.</p>

      <p>“So a single evil demon wants to take us both on? Looks like you don’t know your place, do you?”</p>

      <p>“Keh-heh-heh-heh-heh… You told me to prepare for the worst the next time we met. You <em>will</em> be entertaining me today, won’t you?”</p>

      <p>“…Feh. I don’t have time to play with you. He’s all yours, Zarario.”</p>

      <p>Feldway wanted to avoid a decisive battle with Diablo. He knew how much of a headache that demon was, and he hesitated to take him on in a serious fight. So, without saying another word, he left for the castle.</p>

      <p>Diablo thought about getting in his way, but Zarario wouldn’t allow it. The angel hated every bit of this situation, especially how he was forced into it, and honestly, he wanted to say no to Feldway. But it was an order from his direct boss, and he had no choice but to comply with it.</p>

      <p>“Well, so be it. I suppose you’ve obtained the name Diablo in the meantime, but let’s see just how much stronger you’ve become.”</p>

      <p>With those words, the two of them entered battle.</p>

      <p>Zarario may not have wanted to be here very much, but he liked his chances. He had just obtained a physical body, and already it seemed to fit like a glove. For the first time in too long, he could exert his full strength without breaking himself in the process, and the thought was already lifting his spirits.</p>

      <p>“Eight-Way Dark Authority.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-278"></a>He decided to go first. The technique was simple—gather his aura around his palm, then release—but the power was immeasurable. Eight projectiles streamed toward Diablo.</p>

      <p>“Ridiculous. So that truly <em>is</em> all you have to offer?”</p>

      <p>Diablo, on the other hand, couldn’t have sounded more bored. It wasn’t some strategy to egg his opponent on or brag about his superiority—he meant it. It might’ve been one thing if one side here was notably stronger than the other, but in an even match, you had to be very careful with your first few moves.</p>

      <p>Lightly dodging these blasts of force, Diablo glared at Zarario.</p>

      <p>“Wasting your energy like this… Were you just some amateur who happened to have a little muscle?”</p>

      <p>He was being pretty serious about that. Zarario maintained his composure, despite how annoying he found this. <em>This is exactly why I hate him</em>, he thought as he hid his anger.</p>

      <p>“Silence. That doesn’t even count as expending energy to me. The absolute amounts of power that each of us contains are like night and day. You should worry about yourself first before giving a thought to me.”</p>

      <p>This much was the truth. Zarario was a different creature from back when he stormed Ramiris’s labyrinth. With his physical body, he was able to fully tap into the power of his “real” body from back in the Mystic Palace. With an EP count of over 20 million, he was sure not even a True Dragon could defeat him. A little excessive energy use could be made up for instantly. It wasn’t worth worrying about.</p>

      <p>But Diablo sniffed at this. “This is why amateurs don’t belong here. In <em>our</em> battles, we must either eliminate the opponent with a single blow, or prepare ourselves for a prolonged fight. If you don’t understand that, Zarario… Well, you’ve been lazy with your training, haven’t you?”</p>

      <p>His superiority complex was starting to grate on Zarario. He could put up with it if Diablo talked this way after beating him, but this fight had only just begun. Trying to sap your opponent’s will to fight is a perfectly valid strategy, but that didn’t seem to be Diablo’s aim here. He was honestly, seriously, giving him a word of warning. Zarario understood that, and it irritated him even more.</p>

      <p>“Shut your mouth. I don’t need any of your advice. You don’t <em>need</em> <a id="page-279"></a>to worry about me. I’ve fought on the front lines for years and years against the insectors—the nemesis of both us and you demons. I need to teach you that people like you, lounging around here on the surface, are <em>nothing</em> to me!”</p>

      <p>“Hmm. Well, good to know that. And don’t worry. I’ve been constantly fighting to the death against Sir Zegion as well. He’s an insector, too, and on the strong side of them, I believe. Also, much to my envy, Sir Rimuru has even granted him some of his cells, so there’s very little to his body that’s vulnerable at all. Even for me, he is a difficult foe to conquer.”</p>

      <p>When he said very little of Zegion is vulnerable to attack, he didn’t mean it literally. That was just a rule Diablo invented for himself when he fought him—he didn’t want to target anywhere on Zegion’s body that may contain Rimuru’s cell matter. This rule was also the reason why the three demonesses had yet to defeat Zegion, but that’s another story.</p>

      <p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about, but none of the training you could do on <em>this</em> world could ever—”</p>

      <p>Zarario stopped himself mid-sentence. It didn’t dawn on him at first, but that name Zegion was familiar to him. Deeno described him as a serious challenge, and even Zeranus demonstrated a healthy interest in him, didn’t he? And if Diablo was not just training, but literally fighting to the death against him…</p>

      <p>“Hmm. Perhaps this is no time for playing after all.”</p>

      <p>So Zarario finally resolved to get serious—and the real battle between him and Diablo was about to begin.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Pico and Garasha were standing before Raine and Mizeri.</p>

      <p>“It…it’s cold…”</p>

      <p>But Raine’s heart was already about to break. <em>If I weren’t a demon</em>, she thought, <em>I’d be running for the nearest fireplace long ago</em>—but she had to focus on how to work her way through this.</p>

      <p>“Raine…didn’t you say a moment ago that you were going to show your true colors? Why do you look so unmotivated right now?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-280"></a>“What a foolish question, Mizeri. It’s because I’m cold. Why do we have to fight in this cold—in the middle of a blizzard, no less—against someone we don’t even <em>dislike</em> at all?!”</p>

      <p>She wasn’t even trying to hide her true feelings to Mizeri. It shocked her to hear it—but even more amazingly, Raine wasn’t the only one with that opinion.</p>

      <p>“You’re so right!”</p>

      <p>It was Pico, the enemy, who spoke up.</p>

      <p>“It’s pure white all over the place, we’ve got zero visibility…and why do I have to fight dressed like <em>this</em>, too?”</p>

      <p>Pico <em>did</em> look cold, actually. So did Garasha, for that matter.</p>

      <p>“Oh, stop complaining. I’m just as cold, you know.”</p>

      <p>She might’ve been admonishing Pico, but it was obvious that she shared her feelings. Raine and Mizeri’s maid outfits didn’t exactly offer much insulation, either, but Pico and Garasha were wearing only a single, thin layer of clothing. Garasha’s shoulders were bare, even. Just looking at her would make one shiver.</p>

      <p><em>Wait… So am I the only one seriously trying to fight?</em></p>

      <p>Mizeri, realizing this devastating truth, was visibly upset. The other three paid her no mind, sympathizing with each other over these terrible conditions.</p>

      <p>“Like, I really wish Lady Velzard would stop conjuring up blizzards like this out of nowhere.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, for real. I wouldn’t mind <em>that</em> much, but I wish she could’ve given us some warning, you know? Then I would’ve brought my fur coat along. I could’ve at least shown <em>off</em> a little.”</p>

      <p>“Whoa, Pico, when did you buy a fur coat?”</p>

      <p>“Hee-hee-hee! Oh, I did a little shopping between jobs.”</p>

      <p>“Ohhh, from that city before? I bet you could find some good deals there!”</p>

      <p>They were talking about Blumund, now a vital link between east and west where all sorts of products from around the world gathered. That included goods from Tempest, of course, including some very high-quality clothing and accessories. Pico and Garasha were supposed to be monitoring this world, but they were also having fun traveling all over it—much like Deeno, they danced to the beat of their own drum. <a id="page-281"></a>They also had houses worldwide to serve as their bases, which helped a lot as they stayed at the forefront of high fashion.</p>

      <p>So now everybody was starting to hit it off with each other, despite Raine’s wary eyes upon them all.</p>

      <p>“You can boast all you want, but we have some business first, don’t we?”</p>

      <p>These words came as a surprise to Mizeri.</p>

      <p><em>Ah, there goes Raine again! Was she whining a moment ago in order to catch those two off guard? I didn’t think she was looking to do something like that…</em></p>

      <p>She had to applaud her coworker for it. And if that was the case, Mizeri was just waiting for the signal to start fighting. Instead, what she heard was Raine taking it another step further.</p>

      <p>“But we can’t hold a conversation in a place like <em>this</em>, can we? Don’t you think we should get out of the cold first?”</p>

      <p>“““…!!”””</p>

      <p>The other three were shocked at how self-serving this was. The entire concept of friend and foe was thrown out the window, leaving nothing but confusion in its wake. But Raine didn’t care. Swiftly alighting on the ground, she cast a certain spell.</p>

      <p>“Strategic magic—Cocytus!”</p>

      <p>“Raine! Hey! That spell could destroy the city— Whoa, since when were you <em>that</em> good with it?”</p>

      <p>Mizeri was at a loss for words, and she had a right to be. Raine was just going nuts. Cocytus, the spell she cast, was meant to encase a wide area in ice all at once. Its range depended on the power of the caster, but if Raine wanted to, she could turn a twenty-mile radius around her into an ice rink. Mizeri had no idea why she was playing with fire (or rather, ice) like that, but in a few moments, she was greeted by a perfect ten-foot-tall cube of ice. It was teeming with evil magic, but it hadn’t caused any damage at all. Raine seemed to cast it just because she could, more than anything else. It began to seem like some kind of joke.</p>

      <p>“Well?” Raine smugly asked.</p>

      <p>Pico grinned, perhaps understanding her intent.</p>

      <p>“Garasha!”</p>

      <p><a id="page-282"></a>“Oh, I’m on it. I know exactly what you’re thinking!”</p>

      <p>Garasha was in on whatever this was, too. Seizing the opportunity, she quickly prepared a spell of her own.</p>

      <p>“Icebreaker!”</p>

      <p>This was another elemental magic, a fairly high-level one to cast on a single target. It deliberately froze the moisture in the atmosphere, then crushed the resulting blades of ice—an outstandingly lethal move. But Garasha nimbly manipulated this spell so that all it did was hollow out the large cube of ice before them.</p>

      <p>So their impromptu igloo was now complete.</p>

      <p>“You do pretty good work.”</p>

      <p>“Ha! You too.”</p>

      <p>Raine and Garasha complimented each other. A new friendship was budding.</p>

      <p>“Let’s go inside!”</p>

      <p>Pico was the first to bound in, Raine and Garasha following without a second thought. Mizeri, left outside, just stood there, mouth open.</p>

      <p>“Um, Raine? That wasn’t a joke or a strategy or anything? You were serious…?”</p>

      <p>But the only one who could answer that question was inside the igloo. So Mizeri, feeling like an incredible fool, hurriedly went in.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>“So, yeah, I probably shouldn’t tell you exactly how we did it since it’s a secret and all, but both of us had the honor of being evolved by Sir Rimuru’s hand.”</p>

      <p>That was Raine wrapping up her answer to Garasha. She was asking her why they seemed so much stronger than before.</p>

      <p>“You’re blabbing about that much to the enemy…? Well, whatever.”</p>

      <p>Mizeri had given up on corralling her companion…but Raine was gaining a lot of information from Pico and Garasha, too. For one, it seems their skills, as well as Deeno’s, were under the full control of Michael. Pico also had the ultimate skill Jibril, Lord of Rigor, and Garasha had her own in Haniel, Lord of Glory. And although they <a id="page-284"></a>didn’t seem to be aware of it, Raine surmised that Michael put on some kind of restraint that prevented either of them from defying his orders. All that, <em>plus</em> a full picture of the enemy force’s strength.</p>
