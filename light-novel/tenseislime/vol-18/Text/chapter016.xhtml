      <p><a id="page-164"></a>“Well, at <em>this</em> rate, I bet Zegion had it rough, too, huh?”</p>

      <p>I hated to even imagine Zegion losing, but after all this momentum—</p>

      <p>“Oh, that wasn’t a problem.”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>“They faced off, and Sir Carillon was the first to act, but…”</p>

      <p>The video came back on. A single instant was all it lasted. Before Carillon could even enter particle form—well, that’s not the right way to put it. Zegion just smiled, like someone was showing a neat little illusion to him, and then Carillon’s whole body was sliced up like confetti.</p>

      <p>“…It was <em>that</em> instant? What <em>is</em> Zegion, anyway?”</p>

      <p>“Honestly, I think it was a miracle that I beat him. I don’t think I’d stand a chance now.”</p>

      <p>Benimaru smirked. That might just be modesty, but if a sore loser like him is going that far, Zegion must truly be from another dimension. If <em>he</em> lost as well, we’d have to fully retool our approach to defense from the bottom up.</p>

      <p>“Zegion never seems to get too conceited, no. This experience reminded us to keep our guards up, but it sure doesn’t feel like <em>he</em> needs the lesson.”</p>

      <p>“I agree. He’s beyond stoic that way. It was a complete, total victory, but he still wasn’t satisfied with it. <em>‘I remain a far cry from Sir Rimuru,’</em> he said.”</p>

      <p>So was Zegion pursuing this Rimuru of his imagination? The thought made my eyes water.</p>

      <p class="tx1">That was the end of Carillon’s challenge. But what about Frey?</p>

      <p>“Lady Frey defeated Adalmann as well. Rather handily, in fact.”</p>

      <p>“Really?!”</p>

      <p>That was unexpected. I thought Adalmann’s team would win that one. Him alone, maybe Frey would pull it off, but three-on-one? I really think Adalmann’s team would have the advantage there. But when I brought up the video, it soon became clear why she won.</p>

      <p>“Ah, it’s a complete mismatch!”</p>

      <p><a id="page-165"></a>“It looks to be that, yes. Lady Frey’s Magic Interference completely shut down Adalmann’s magic. That threw their attack patterns off, and then Lady Frey dictated the pace of the battle. It cost him dearly.”</p>

      <p>Benimaru was right. The area in a fifty-yard radius around Frey became an anti-magic zone that blocked all magicule movement. It was a more powerful form of interference than anything the Charybdis could manage, strong enough to cancel out Adalmann’s Necronomicon.</p>

      <p>Frey achieved divinity, too, didn’t she? That’s a property only attainable by spiritual life-forms who shed their natural lifespan, so no wonder Frey could compete against an ultimate gift. In fact, there’s a chance she earned an ultimate skill, too, isn’t there?</p>

      <p>After this, Adalmann switched his main weapon to Holy Cannon, that piece of holy magic, but it wasn’t decisive. Frey’s flight capabilities made it simple for her to dart around these bolts—and in the meantime, she zoomed right up to Venti the tank and grabbed on with her talons.</p>

      <p>“Those talons of hers are a major threat. They disrupt the magicules within your body, so they’re like a natural poison for monsters. Once she latches on, you’re all but robbed of your skills and magic.”</p>

      <p>I had no problem calling those talons as dangerous as a God-class weapon.</p>

      <p>“Wow. If I didn’t know, maybe I woulda been in trouble, too.”</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! Oh, you’d be fine, wouldn’t you? You could just use Replication to escape. But Sir Carillon said he’d have no way out, and I’m not sure I would, either. I’d defeat her before she could latch on, but…”</p>

      <p>Yes, I’m sure that’s what Benimaru would do. But that was asking too much of Adalmann’s party.</p>

      <p>Venti, destroyed from the inside, was forced out of battle. Then Frey switched to a long-range approach. With Adalmann unable to cast flight magic, all she had to do was fly up and rain down attacks from above. Alberto, irritated, leaped up and tried to swipe at Frey, but that just made him ripe for the picking. They called her the Sky Queen for a reason, and before long, Alberto was in pieces and <a id="page-166"></a>scattered across the air. That just left Adalmann, and by this point he had no chance. Faced with Frey’s might, defeat was the only option for him.</p>

      <p>“Then Lady Frey pressed on downward and went into battle with Kumara.”</p>

      <p>“And how’d that go?”</p>

      <p>They were about equal in power, but Kumara didn’t have divinity. And looking at the last battle, Frey was clearly battle-seasoned. She called herself among the weakest of the Ten Great Demon Lords, but I think she was being too modest.</p>

      <p>She was a clever fighter, and Kumara was immature. I thought it’d turn into a fun fight, and that’s exactly what it was.</p>

      <p>“It was one for the record books. They fought for three days straight, both of them bringing out all their strength. I wish I could call it a draw, but Lady Frey was the victor.”</p>

      <p>“Ooh! Sounds like a great fight. I’ll have to study the video later.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I learned a lot from it myself. It’s important to have the fortitude to never give up on victory, but in the end, a bit of ingenuity really can make the difference. If you’re an even match with your opponent in strength, misleading them about your powers becomes so vital. Kumara lost, after all, because she misjudged how much force her opponent had left.”</p>

      <p><em>Wow. Now I’m</em> really <em>looking forward to the video. It has three days’ worth of data, so I’ll need to use Hasten Thought to speed it up a bit.</em></p>

      <p>“And did Fry try her hand against Zegion next?”</p>

      <p>If it was <em>that</em> even against Kumara, she was doomed against him. If Frey declined to fight Benimaru, I doubt she’d take on an even bigger menace.</p>

      <p>“No, she fought Apito instead.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, her?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. I suppose it was a matter of pride, as a fellow winged creature.”</p>

      <p>“Huh. That kinda thing…?”</p>

      <p>It seemed logical. Maybe it prodded that competitive streak of hers.</p>

      <p>“That turned into a pretty impressive fight, too, but Lady Frey won thanks to the difference in core strength.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-167"></a>I’m sure she did. If it was that good a battle, Apito deserves the highest of praise.</p>

      <p>Either way, this made the extent of Frey’s powers much clearer to me—that, and I could see what my allies needed to work on. I’m sure it was a shock for Adalmann’s team, getting a break from work only to have their asses kicked twice in a row. But let’s just be glad this wasn’t <em>real</em> combat and hope they capitalize on this experience.</p>

      <p>That, and maybe Carillon and Frey owed me a favor now, huh? I had Ramiris to thank for that, too, so I’d need to express my appreciation to all of them later. The latter in particular. I can’t thank her enough.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">So what else did I need to tackle?</p>

      <p>“Okay,” I said to Benimaru. “I’ll leave Saare and Grigori in your hands, then.”</p>

      <p>“Roger that. As it stands, they <em>might</em> have a chance against Adalmann’s trio.”</p>

      <p>“I’m with you there. In fact, maybe Alberto could handle them himself. But don’t keep Adalmann from his work for <em>too</em> long!”</p>

      <p>I had just sworn to myself to keep my guard up, so I won’t be too shocked if my prediction turns out wrong. But Saare couldn’t even beat old man Gadora, and that told me Adalmann’s party would be a major challenge for him.</p>

      <p>In fact, my prediction wound up becoming 100 percent true a few days later. And with that proven, Saare and Grigori were assigned to train their hardest with Apito, as Adalmann’s crew had other work to do.</p>

      <p class="tx1">After leaving those guys with Benimaru, my next destination was the kingdom of Blumund, where Mjöllmile was waiting. We planned to meet there, then travel together to Englesia.</p>

      <p>I was pretty used to Blumund by now, after all the visits I made. I wouldn’t be going into any urban areas, so there was no need to work my way through their barrier. Instead, I was headed for the outlying suburban areas, feeling every bit like a tourist.</p>

      <p><a id="page-168"></a>These areas have now become the center for a very large firm. World Central Station was under construction, attracting laborers from all the nearby countries, and our Four Nations Trade Alliance had just opened a new headquarters building in a cushy district not far away.</p>

      <p>I gotta say, I’m pretty happy about it. It was a high-rise by this world’s standards—ten stories and around a hundred feet tall. The gigantic palace under construction in Milim’s domain would dwarf it, but it was still a world-class piece of architecture by local standards—neatly designed, and using rare, valuable glass like it was going out of style. It was all magicked glass, of course, so hurricanes, earthquakes, and magic attacks wouldn’t put a scratch on it. A lot of my other personal preferences were incorporated in the building, too, so you could say I have a lot of emotional investment in it. We were meeting here, and we also had a party planned—sort of a grand opening event. I <em>am</em> the owner, technically, but I was attending this as a guest.</p>

      <p>So there I was, in front of the building. I wanted to take a tour of the place once construction was complete, but I’d been so damn busy lately, I just couldn’t make it happen. Mjöllmile thus had free rein over this building, including who got to work in it. My job isn’t exactly easy, but I’m sure he’s pretty frazzled by now, too. Without him, we never would’ve been able to make this happen.</p>

      <p>I knew Mjöllmile was a talented man, but it’s like he has a gift for conning people. He was the director of the FNTA, but there was another person leading operations within this HQ. Remarkably, Veryard—who had recently earned a noble promotion to viscount—was working for Mjöllmile now, and I was told he’s been appointed the head of this building.</p>

      <p>Having Veryard on our side made me both happy and very relieved. I haven’t forgotten how expertly he swindled me, so I look forward to him working some of that magic for my benefit. That, and I was told we’ve procured a few more key talents for this place, people I’d get introduced to at the party. Can’t wait.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Soei and I were standing abreast, Ranga in my shadow like usual. We were in formal attire for this occasion: a gray three-piece suit <a id="page-169"></a>for me, a black two-piece for Soei. They were made of hellmoth silk—a name-brand Tempestian export these days—and Shuna had tailored them just for us. You won’t find made-to-order stuff like this in the stores, and I’d like to think that people who see us will pick up on the difference.</p>

      <p>The party wouldn’t begin until the evening, so not many people were around. Despite that, I was still attracting looks from passersby. My natural charisma at work, I guess.</p>

      <p>“Wow, look how handsome that guy is!”</p>

      <p>“Are they brothers? He looks like someone bodyguarding for his little brother or something.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, the smaller one’s kinda cute, too. Wonder what he’ll look like when he grows up.”</p>

      <p>“Isn’t he so cool? We’ve had a lot of foreigners visit as of late, but you don’t see many that look as suave as him…”</p>

      <p>…Um? That wasn’t exactly the reaction I expected. It sounds like they’re a lot more interested in Soei than my charisma. It made me realize how self-conscious I was being, which embarrassed me a bit.</p>

      <p>“Okay, let’s go in and say hello,” I said, trying to hide the shame.</p>

      <p>So we went inside and up to the front desk. The first floor was large, like a hotel lobby, complete with a front desk and waiting area. I already knew the layout, so I didn’t bother asking for a guide.</p>

      <p>“Hey, is Mollie around here…?”</p>

      <p>When I asked the woman at the front desk, this fancy-looking man in a sharp suit came out from behind a closed door, giving me a quizzical sneer as he chomped on his cigar.</p>

      <p>“Can I ask who you are, sir?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, I’m Rimuru. Could you tell Mollie that I’m here?”</p>

      <p><em>He looks like a gentleman, but he’s pretty arrogant, huh?</em> I smiled back at him anyway.</p>

      <p>The front-desk woman, upon hearing my name, hurriedly reached for a crystal ball—a magical item, meant to connect the user to whoever has the other half of the pair. It doesn’t have much of a range, but it’s really useful inside buildings like this.</p>

      <p>I watched on, satisfied to see the staff was working as trained…but suddenly that arrogant man stopped the receptionist.</p>
