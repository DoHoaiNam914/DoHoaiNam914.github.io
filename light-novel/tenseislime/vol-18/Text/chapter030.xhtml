      <p><em>Hmm…</em></p>

      <p>Leon could grasp the situation. There were five adversaries in total, each with strength equal to—or, really, greater than—his own. Between that and being outnumbered, the situation couldn’t be much worse. Realizing this, he began to waver over whether to invoke one of his most secret moves. Maybe he could take one of them out himself, but if he wanted to survive, he needed to put it all on the line. If it didn’t work out, he had to run, and he had preparations for that in place, too.</p>

      <p>He only wavered because in Kagali’s eyes, he saw not madness, but rational reason. Rimuru told him before that Kagali was previously the demon lord Kazalim. He had almost forgotten about that man entirely, but even now, he could vividly recall the insanity in his eyes. The current Kagali might describe it as being mad with envy, but to Leon at the time, it was nothing short of terrifying. Now, however, she was as beautiful as lapis lazuli.</p>

      <p><em>It’s…not a different person, no. But she must have some kind of agenda for this. And would that mean there’s room to negotiate?</em></p>

      <p>Despite all the pressure, Leon had an accurate bead on his foe’s situation. But the clowns were still talking in front of him.</p>

      <p>“Demon lord Leon! You are not only responsible for the downfall of Sir Kazalim, but for leaving Clayman the Crazed Clown, our brother and friend, to die! You will not have an easy death, I promise you, because I am <em>quite</em> angry right now!”</p>

      <p>Footman bent his portly frame in a bow.</p>

      <p>“Yeah,” continued Laplace, “that fool Clayman didn’t become a demon lord just for fun. He was the only one for th’ job, so we sent ’im out as a replacement for our president if somethin’ happened to her. And <em>now</em> look how it’s turned out, huh? Ahh, what a regret!”</p>

      <p>Perhaps it was his memory of Clayman that added this twinge of sadness to his voice.</p>

      <p>“It truly <em>is</em> sad, isn’t it? But now Lady Kagali’s given us this opportunity for revenge! I’m gonna throw all my hatred at you, so don’t fall down till we’re all done!”</p>

      <p>With Teare’s final despondent statement, the battle began.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">

        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">Leon had three people on his team. Kagali had five, but Yuuki didn’t seem interested in joining in. Teare faced Arlos, with Claude serving as Footman’s opponent. The remaining two, of course, would be paired with Leon.</p>

      <p>Normally, defeat would have been inevitable…but it was not to be.</p>

      <p>Breaking out his Flame Pillar sword, Leon brought it in front of him—just in time for Kagali to strike with the Ruin Scepter she borrowed from Michael. The shockwave of two God-class weapons clashing with each other reverberated across the chamber, and as they did, Leon heard a voice in his mind.</p>

      <p>(Hey, can you hear me? I want to talk.)</p>

      <p>Leon nodded back. His guess was right.</p>

      <p>(Thank you. There are eyes on me. That’s why I did what I did. There’s no such thing as being too careful with this.)</p>

      <p>That seemed true enough. Leon looked at Kagali, urging her to continue. They were playing out a heated battle through all this, their conversation being held on a thin tightrope.</p>

      <p>Laplace was there, by the way, to serve as a conduit for their Thought Communication. The master-and-servant relationship he had with Kagali was being used to encrypt the information being transmitted before relaying it over to Leon. Leon’s responses would get filtered through Laplace as well, getting encrypted again before reaching Kagali. This roundabout process was designed to keep Michael from reading her mind. Kagali believed that he couldn’t read everything that went through her brain, so she kept her thoughts deep down, behind multiple layers of barriers.</p>

      <p>She was being so careful because here, right now, she was about to betray Michael. She once had a grudge against Leon, but had regained some composure now that she was far away from Michael. Thanks to that, she concluded it was best to join forces with Leon after all. As long as she could get inside Ramiris’s labyrinth, she could escape Michael’s surveillance on her…and something also told her that the mysterious slime over there would do anything to free her and her friends.</p>

      <p><a id="page-290"></a>(You must have some kind of emergency accessway in here, don’t you? We can’t reach the labyrinth via magic, but if there’s a way, we’d like access to it.)</p>

      <p>They could magically transport themselves, but it’d be a risk. Such unexpected behavior on Kagali’s part might make Michael tighten the reins on her. Ideally, she wanted to flee directly into the labyrinth—and if that wasn’t possible, she wanted to meet someone on the other side, ready to receive them as refugees.</p>

      <p>(All right. I understand your situation.)</p>

      <p>(Well, I’m glad to see you’re so unhurried about this, but Michael is after you, you realize. You possess Metatron, Lord of Purity, don’t you?)</p>

      <p>(…I will not deny it.)</p>

      <p>Even Leon recognized that there was no point hiding it any longer. They must’ve known already—they wouldn’t be attacking his domain otherwise.</p>

      <p>That lent a lot more credence to what Kagali and her team told him. With this much difference between them in firepower, there was no point stringing Leon along for information like this. Normally, they could just disable him and drag him in front of Michael. Plus, as flashy and obviously violent as Teare and Footman were, Arlos and Claude were still safe and uninjured. If they <em>really</em> wanted to kill his attendants, they’d almost certainly be in pieces by now.</p>

      <p>Under these circumstances, there was no reason to perpetuate this act. And that’s why Leon was convinced Kagali meant what she said.</p>

      <p>(All right. I’ll trust you. There is indeed a transport magic circle in this castle that leads directly to the labyrinth.)</p>

      <p>(I knew it!)</p>

      <p>Kagali’s face lit up. Now her plan seemed much more likely to succeed than before. And as their blades continued to clang against each other, she leaned forward and began to negotiate even more fiercely.</p>

      <p>Leon might have thrown away his suspicions, but he still wasn’t sure whether to meekly give the nod. But as he wavered, the smile of Chloe, the girl he loved, passed through his mind. A smile that was directed not at him…but at Rimuru.</p>

      <p><a id="page-291"></a>Dark, brooding feelings began to well up from deep within his heart. This was not jealousy. Absolutely not! He tried to swallow up these feelings, enduring them for as long as they lasted. And then he thought:</p>

      <p><em>Rimuru would accept this group, I’m sure. It’d be pushing more trouble on his plate, but I won’t exactly have a guilty conscience about it, no.</em></p>

      <p>If anything, the thought refreshed him. Maybe he had nothing to worry about at all. So, with a broad nod, he began to be much more proactive with Kagali.</p>

      <p>(So would it be just you five?)</p>

      <p>(Yes. Yuuki has his own followers, but they can’t be trusted. I’m planning to leave them here. They’re not going to die anyway, and there’s no point using them as hostages against us, either.)</p>

      <p>(Wouldn’t taking them along help reduce our enemy’s force that much more?)</p>

      <p>Leon was being oddly kind to him. He kept being misunderstood as this coldhearted miser, but that was chiefly thanks to his social awkwardness.</p>

      <p>(You know, you’re not at all like what I thought. You never gave me a break the last time we fought…)</p>

      <p>(I couldn’t help that. I had a demon lord attacking me, and I lost my cool. If I wanted to prevent civilian casualties, I couldn’t let that fight extend for too long.)</p>

      <p>That was understandable. If two evenly matched demon lords fought each other, the damage to the surrounding area would be devastating. If he wanted to avoid that, a quick, decisive battle was likely in Leon’s best interests.</p>

      <p>(That’s fair. Besides, I was a fool back then anyway. I have no right to complain about it to you. Forget I brought it up.)</p>

      <p>Leon wasn’t sure how to react. He expected a lot more complaining.</p>

      <p>(…You truly have changed.)</p>

      <p>And then, leaving those muddled words behind, he flipped the page.</p>

      <p>(So the magic circle in question is behind this chamber. This room itself is the most protected place in the castle, complete with a Multilayer Barrier. Open the hidden door behind the throne and you’ll see it.)</p>

      <p><a id="page-292"></a>(Thank you. But what will you do?)</p>

      <p>Michael’s objective was Leon. Kagali was implicitly inviting him to escape together with her. Leon didn’t hesitate in his response.</p>

      <p>(I will stay here. If I intended to escape, I would have gone to Rimuru first thing.)</p>

      <p>Kagali nodded. It made sense to her.</p>

      <p>(Michael’s rule over you will be absolute, keep in mind.)</p>

      <p>(Yes, but it must involve certain conditions. If the worst happens and I turn into his puppet, I’m sure Guy will analyze the process and come up with a way to cut it off.)</p>

      <p>That was one reason he was staying, but it wasn’t all of it. In truth, Leon’s chief interest was doing what he personally could to protect the citizens of El Dorado. That was the will of Leon Cromwell, a man even willing to abandon his title as Hero to protect those of mixed human and monster blood.</p>

      <p>(You truly are an awkward character, aren’t you? Throwing yourself away to struggle so mightily for the sake of others…)</p>

      <p>(Heh. Not true. You won’t find many people as immoral as I am. I’m willing to sacrifice others, even for the sake of the one person I love. And that’s something I’ll have to personally pay for.)</p>

      <p>That was how Leon expressed his resolve. Kagali, realizing this, decided to respect that will of his. She needed to save her own team first; she didn’t intend to waste time persuading him otherwise.</p>

      <p>So they had a plan. Kagali went through Laplace to inform Teare and Footman of it as well. Leon, meanwhile, was in contact with Arlos and Claude about it. Neither of them felt their foes were seriously fighting, either, and now Leon explained to them why. That only left Yuuki, and by this point, they could just drag him up on that circle, if it came to it.</p>

      <p>Leon looked at Kagali, signaling the location of the hidden door. Reading this sign, Kagali pretended to be blown backward by an attack, bashing herself against the door. Laplace, seeing it open, gave his own signal to Footman and Teare. Arlos and Claude, playing along, pretended to be thrown backward as well, allowing their opponents to scramble through the door.</p>

      <p>“Sir Yuuki!”</p>

      <p><a id="page-293"></a>“Oh, I’m up?” came the reply as he strode inside.</p>

      <p>(Okay, now we just have to have Leon activate the magic circle!)</p>

      <p>Kagali was sure of her success. It was a tightrope the whole way, but now she could escape from Michael. Or she should have.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">Alas, fate had already forsaken them all.</p>

      <p>Michael, who remained in the Celestial Palace, had picked up on Obela’s treachery before Deeno could report to him about it. He was furious. Never before in his life had something like this happened. Seeing things go wrong with his plan made him seethe with rage.</p>

      <p>The cause of this, if you drilled down deep enough, was his own naïveté. He had the absolute power of rule over them all, but he believed he had a friendship with them all, too—this ambiguous, inexact factor—and now it had led to this. Obela had only just obtained Azrael, Lord of Salvation, but Michael was already aware. He should have tightened his rule over here right at that point, and not doing so was his mistake.</p>

      <p>It was up to him to make up for it, so as furious as he was, he began to think rationally. Then, through Feldway, he strengthened his Ultimate Dominion grip on his servants with angelic skills. And with that, Kagali was drained of her sense of self.</p>

      <p class="tx1">There was just one more step. But it was so endlessly far away.</p>

      <p>Feldway appeared through the audience chamber’s broken door.</p>

      <p>“You know, I was <em>wondering</em> what was going on here. Look at you, plotting to betray us! You stupid fools, completely misunderstanding my cause!”</p>

      <p>Seeing Feldway shouting in a rage, Kagali knew her plan had failed. She tried to at least get Laplace and the others through the circle to safety—the next best solution. All she had to do was order them to do it…but now, she was blocked from so much as uttering a single word.</p>

      <p>“Don’t bother. We’ve completely taken you over with Ultimate <a id="page-294"></a>Dominion. Sir Michael is quite angry with you. We’ve let you do what you’ve pleased for too long, he said. And <em>also</em>…”</p>

      <p>Leon had stopped. Feldway’s cold gaze shot right through him.</p>

      <p>“…I see that the man we wanted is in here. <em>You</em> will be our loyal servant, too.”</p>

      <p>Before his voice was even heard, Leon activated Metatron with everything he had. He wanted to unleash a blast at divine speed, hoping to kill in a single shot. But he was already too late.</p>

      <p><em>Dammit… I can’t resist this…</em></p>

      <p>A new loyalty for Michael, a man he had never met in his life, began to shoot up from the depths. His memories and knowledge were all intact, but now Leon’s ego was filled with a feeling of sheer ecstasy.</p>

      <p><em>Chloe, you are mine…!!</em></p>

      <p>The smile of the girl he loved, suddenly flashing through his mind, was similarly overwritten by this irresistible elation. Just like Kagali’s, Leon’s mind had been taken. All his feelings for his beloved companions had been replaced by his utter faith in Michael.</p>

      <p><em>Every single time, I always blow the landing…</em></p>

      <p>Kagali lamented her fate, feeling tremendously sad about it all, but even that regret soon disappeared.</p>

      <p>“Hey, President, yer gonna give up now? C’mon! I believe in ya.”</p>

      <p>A sudden voice confounded her. But it was like a child crying through multiple sheets of glass. She couldn’t clearly make it out.</p>

      <p>“Kagali, does your locking curse not work on him?”</p>

      <p>“No, Laplace is special, so he doesn’t have to heed my orders.”</p>

      <p>“Oh. Well, we don’t need <em>him</em>, then.”</p>

      <p>The cold voice, devoid of all emotion, propagated itself into Kagali’s ears.</p>

      <p>“All right. Thank you for everything, Laplace. At least allow me to finish you off by my own hand.”</p>

      <p>“Whoa! President?!”</p>

      <p>Only Laplace was bewildered by this sudden change in Kagali. Teare, Footman, Yuuki, even their former enemy Leon just watched on, like all of this was obvious.</p>

      <p>Kagali’s Ruin Scepter glowed a golden color.</p>

      <p><a id="page-295"></a>“Don’t just <em>stand</em> there!!”</p>

      <p>And when Laplace had given up all hope, a woman appeared out of nowhere and pushed him away. Then, with her sword, she deflected Kagali’s all-destroying ray of golden light.</p>

      <p>“Who’re you?!”</p>

      <p>“I don’t have time to tell you…but hey, how ’bout I do? I’m Sylvia, and I’ll take care of things in here. Think of me as, like, a superstrong hired hand!”</p>

      <p>She was a beautiful woman, her long greenish-silver hair in a large braid. Her thin dress, with its silken luster, was high-end Tempestian make, suited for use in battle. Her legs were visible through the slits in the dress, and if you took a closer look, you could see that she was wearing denim shorts underneath. Maybe she wanted to be safe in case of a really intense fight, but if so, she should’ve just worn pants instead. Her fashion sense was selfishness personified; you could tell she didn’t want to give up on looking nice, no matter what. And that, in turn, said a lot about her personality.</p>

      <p>The woman called herself Sylvia—Leon’s instructor, and someone called up as a final ace in the hole.</p>

      <p class="space-break1">The sight of Sylvia filled Laplace with nostalgia. He was a walking dead created by Kagali, and while Kagali never exacted her thrall on him (thanks to his Hero role pre-death, perhaps), he had lost almost all of his memories. He didn’t know that his real name was Thalion Grimwald, and he also had no idea that Sylvia, the woman who just saved his hide, was his wife.</p>

      <p>Nonetheless, he could instinctively tell that Sylvia was someone important to him.</p>

      <p>“I dunno what’s goin’ on, but I’m a man, too, y’know. I ain’t pathetic enough to leave all this to a li’l girl like you!”</p>

      <p>It was back to Laplace as usual. Things had moved so fast that he needed some time to catch up, but then, that wasn’t unusual for him. So, like always, he just did what he could to get out of trouble.</p>

      <p>“You guys! If yer still alive, you gotta get outta here, okay? I’m sure Teare and Footman tired you all out, and you <em>ain’t</em> gonna survive what’s about to happen, okay?”</p>

      <p><a id="page-296"></a>His eyes were still fixed upon Kagali and Yuuki, but he was talking to Arlos and Claude, both sprawled out in a corner of the chamber. They both somehow had enough healing potion to hold out so far, but the bags around their waists, despite their spatially expanded capacity, were nearly empty. They barely had any escape route at this rate, but still, they sniffed at Laplace’s call.</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! Don’t worry about us. Like I always tell my students, when times are tough, running away’s the last thing you wanna do. I need to set the example for them, you know, or else they’ll never do it!”</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh… A true knight would never abandon his lord in times of need.”</p>

      <p>They both understood they were no longer a force, but a liability in this battle. But they still refused to leave, because they were prepared to sacrifice their lives for Leon. They believed that Rimuru would come to the rescue before long, so they were willing to take years off their own lives to keep buying time.</p>

      <p>“Man, you guys are <em>dumb</em>, y’know that?”</p>

      <p>“Ha-ha-ha! High praise, coming from a clown like you!”</p>

      <p>“I don’t think that was meant as a compliment, Sir Claude. But I do envy you. At least you still have it in you to laugh over this!”</p>

      <p>A small smile appeared on Arlos’s lips. He and Claude were resolved to the fates, and that fact made them strong. And Laplace, too, was rethinking matters.</p>

      <p><em>Can’t lose out to these guys, no…</em></p>

      <p>“Okay, let’s start over. If we kill that guy over there, the president’ll go back to normal, right? Well, count me in!”</p>

      <p>With that, he glared at Feldway. His gut told him that he—not Michael, who wasn’t in the room—was doing a lot more to cause this.</p>

      <div class="ext_ch">
        <div class="decoration-rw10">
          <div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">
            <div class="pc-rw">
              <img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="tx1">So the battle returned to the audience chamber, pitting Laplace, Sylvia, and two sorely wounded knights against Feldway, Kagali, Leon, Yuuki, Footman, and Teare. It was four against six, and the strength difference wasn’t even worth calculating.</p>

      <p>“Sylvia! Quick question.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-297"></a>“Mm? What’s up?”</p>

      <p>“How far do you think we can go with ’em? Be honest.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm… Well, I don’t think my answer will make you too happy.”</p>

      <p>“Nah. Actually, never mind!”</p>

      <p>Laplace laughed. She had a point.</p>

      <p>Something about this exchange tugged at Sylvia’s heartstrings. It wasn’t the conversation itself, really—just the presence of Laplace himself. It seemed so comfortably familiar.</p>

      <p><em>Do I know him, maybe? No, that can’t be right. But ah well. Now’s no time to worry about things like that.</em></p>

      <p>Sylvia may have had a willowy, graceful body, but she was unmistakably a seasoned warrior. She wasted no time focusing her attention on her enemy. Feldway, meanwhile, wasn’t moving. He fully intended to leave the grunt work to his servants—that was how little he thought of Sylvia’s side.</p>

      <p>But maybe there was a silver lining to the impossibly long odds they were facing.</p>

      <p><em>That arrogance of his could be fatal—is what I’d like to tell him, but he’s the head Primordial Angel, isn’t he? I heard about him from Twilight, but honestly, he’s probably stronger than I am, huh?</em></p>

      <p>As lackadaisical as that demigod was, it was best not to take him at his word. Sylvia had been tricked by him many times, leading to all sorts of unpleasant situations. But judging by what the Primordials were doing, they certainly couldn’t be a bunch of weaklings. Even if it was just a bunch of talk, Sylvia could tell she was outclassed.</p>

      <p>As they confronted each other, she could sense this thick, awful presence. Everybody in this room was a monster—Arlos and Claude included. In another time, even they could’ve had a legitimate shot at calling themselves demon lords and getting away with it. But Feldway was in his own dimension. Fighting him head-on would surely lead to defeat. The only strategy to take right now was to stall for time.</p>

      <p><em>El mentioned Rimuru</em>, thought Sylvia. <em>He’s coming soon, right? I don’t know how well he can do against these freaks of nature, but he even defeated Velgrynd, didn’t he? Well, we’ll just have to hope.</em></p>

      <p>Sylvia, as a high disciple of Twilight’s, was proud of her considerable abilities. Her EP was just under two million, giving her <a id="page-298"></a>the fighting ability of an awakened demon lord, and her weapon of choice was a God-class vajra, surpassing Leon’s sword in terms of level. She could change out the number of blades on it whenever she wanted, and she excelled at stabbing away with it like a spear. Moreover, she even had the ultimate skill Indra, Lord of Thunder, making her stronger than Teare and Footman.</p>

      <p>But not even that would put her at Feldway’s level. She couldn’t even shine his boots. Despite all the bold words she had for Laplace, it’d be a major challenge to turn the tables here. But if Feldway wasn’t making any moves, they still had a chance at winning.</p>

      <p>She was aware of the chance Leon was under someone’s control. She had explained to him how to separate a skill from his heart core, and she was sure he was struggling hard to regain himself right now. If he succeeded, there was a very good chance the skill would be lost entirely—which is exactly what Obela did, by the way. The penalty in terms of battle strength would no doubt be enormous.</p>

      <p>Either way, it wouldn’t be very easy, so she’d taught it to Leon as a last resort.</p>

      <p><em>And, yeah, that’s up to Leon anyway. He was a real skilled pupil, but will he succeed? I’d say it’s around fifty-fifty, maybe…</em></p>

      <p>She couldn’t be too optimistic about it, but there was still a chance Leon could return to battle. Pinning their hopes on that was far too reckless a bet, but she didn’t have any other bright ideas. Complaining wasn’t going to help either way, though, so all she could do was brace herself and do the best she could.</p>

      <p>“Okay, you two, focus on supporting me! And you, the clown! Your opponent is…”</p>

      <p>“It’s me, isn’t it? Well, I gotta do <em>some</em> work, I guess. Don’t want my rep to be hurt.”</p>

      <p>Yuuki, one of their enemies, interrupted Sylvia. Wasting no further time, he unleashed a kick on Laplace.</p>

      <p>“Huh? Whoa! Boss! Are you serious?!”</p>

      <p>Laplace might’ve had the battle start on him without warning, but he still didn’t neglect to ingratiate himself with his new friend.</p>

      <p>“I’m a clown, yeah, but my name’s Laplace, okay?”</p>

      <p>He had to shout it at Sylvia as he fought off Yuuki.</p>

      <p><a id="page-299"></a>“Well, Laplace, you really <em>are</em> a dangerous one. I think there’s room for one more. How about I join Sir Yuuki against you?”</p>

      <p>Now Kagali was part of the fray.</p>

      <p>“Hey! No fair! I’m gonna start cryin’ before too long, y’know!”</p>

      <p>Even Laplace was facing a crisis at this point. Fighting just one of them was enough of a hassle. If they were going at him simultaneously, he had no more time to joke around.</p>

      <p>But then Leon made a move.</p>

      <p>“Heh. Looks like I’ll be facing you, then, Master Sylvia. But personally, I don’t want to point a sword at you. Would you be willing to defect to our side?”</p>

      <p>He gave the offer with only the most gentlemanly of politeness. Even being controlled like this, his memory was still intact. If Michael or Feldway ordered her dead, there was nothing he could do about that—but if not, he still had some control over himself. That being said, he had been ordered not to betray his new master, no matter what. Making this offer to Sylvia was about the best he could do for her.</p>

      <p>“Leon… Look, you called me here, didn’t you?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. And that is why I hope you could take my side in—”</p>

      <p>“This is getting nowhere. You know I don’t want you to hate me, Leon. If I said yes to you right now, you <em>know</em> you’d complain to high heaven about it once you’re back to normal.”</p>

      <p>Sylvia smiled at him. She knew exactly what Leon’s purpose in life was, and what he had always lived for. She understood his true feelings, and she wasn’t there to turn her back on them. But it didn’t come across to Leon.</p>

      <p>“…?”</p>

      <p>Leon still had his memories of Chloe, too. He still cared about her deeply, but that didn’t take precedence above his orders.</p>

      <p>“You have a girl you like, don’t you? What would that girl think if she saw you right now, Leon?”</p>

      <p>The question shook his heart. But he clamped down on it at once, regaining his cool.</p>

      <p>“What a ridiculous question. I will just fulfill my wishes after Sir Feldway fulfills his. Until then, I am sure she will wait for me.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-300"></a>“Um, you really think so…?”</p>

      <p>Sylvia was fairly serious about that question. Based on what Elmesia and others told her, it was clear that Chloe’s own feelings weren’t geared toward Leon. He’d have to get pretty fiercely serious with her right now, or else waiting for him wouldn’t even occur in her mind. But that was Leon’s own problem, not one she was qualified to comment on. “Whatever,” she decided to advise him. “Just don’t come to me if she rejects you.”</p>

      <p>Leon twitched a little, but nobody noticed. And just like that, the battle between him and Sylvia began.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Laplace was the most powerful magic-born in the Moderate Jesters, a demon lord in all but name and the owner of truly vicious powers. Kagali had reincarnated him into the body of a walking dead, but his experience and skills as a former Hero were all intact.</p>

      <p>In addition, he possessed two unique skills. The first was Falsifier, which interfered with an opponent’s perception—quite useful for launching a broad variety of attacks. He could also freely disguise his weapons, making the lance in his hand look like a dagger in his enemy’s eyes—or make himself seem unarmed, only to throw a knife from out of thin air. That, or make a grenade look like a knife. It was a great way to toy with his enemies. With this power, too, it was easy to fake his own death to make good his escape.</p>

      <p>That skill was devious enough by itself, but it had a partner—the clairvoyant unique skill Future Sight, Laplace’s ace in the hole. With this, he could see several seconds into the future at any time—and that meant he always knew whether Falsifier would work against his foe or not.</p>

      <p>He had immaculate physical abilities, a keen sense for battle, and the ability to predict the future and fight any way he wanted. It made Laplace invincible, and while he called himself vice-president of the Moderate Jesters, he easily outclassed President Kagali in pure strength.</p>

      <p>Thanks to all of that, Laplace had enjoyed a long unbeaten streak <a id="page-301"></a>ever since becoming magic-born. With fleeing being such an important tactical tool up his sleeve, he almost never actually admitted to losing against anyone. The only exception he made was when he talked about Yuuki Kagurazaka, the boy in front of him. But that was all in the past…</p>

      <p>“Footman! Teare! Support Leon, and while you’re at it, give that man the death he so richly deserves already!”</p>

      <p>Kagali’s order was the signal he needed. Realizing he had no chance if he kept running, Laplace went on the counterattack. He had two opponents, both as strong or stronger than him.</p>

      <p><em>Really, the boss is probably the more dangerous one, huh? ’Cuz at the end of the day, Lady Kagali really ain’t too good at close-range combat, so…</em></p>

      <p>Laplace had known her for a very long time. He was well aware of her strengths and weaknesses, and even though she was far beyond what she was back in the Kazalim days, he thought she could handle her up close. Kagali had gained stamina, making her harder to beat. She had more power, more destructive force, a huge upgrade in speed…but even with all of that, her overall skill in battle hadn’t changed. If he could speed up his reflexes and read her well enough, it was possible enough to handle her.</p>

      <p>But even Laplace didn’t like his chances against Yuuki. His strength looked to be around the same as before, but making assumptions about that was dangerous. Thus, Laplace decided that instead of actively engaging Kagali, he was better off keeping a wary eye on Yuuki.</p>

      <p>“Don’t hate me for this, Yuuki!” he shouted as he threw an array of knives at him. But Future Sight told him they would all miss. So, without panicking, he made his next move, tossing more knives in the direction Yuuki would dodge.</p>

      <p>He didn’t forget to keep Kagali in check, either. He might’ve been easygoing about it on the surface, but he was desperately working two unique skills at once to stay alive. But not even that could touch Yuuki.</p>

      <p><em>Aw, no way! Even with Future Sense, all I’m seeing is my attacks missing him…</em></p>

      <p><a id="page-302"></a>Seeing just a few seconds ahead meant little against him. Falsifier didn’t even work on Yuuki anyway. He thought before that he couldn’t beat him—and this time, too, victory seemed like a long shot.</p>

      <p><em>But…well, not like I’ll give up ’cause of that.</em></p>

      <p>If he was going to admit defeat that easily, he wouldn’t have gone to such a lethal fight in the first place. That, and Laplace always pinned a lot of his dreams on what Yuuki told him.</p>

      <p>“Boss, you said it yourself! You said you were gonna conquer the world!”</p>

      <p>“Ah-ha-ha! Why are you so dumb, Laplace? You still believe in all that nonsense?”</p>

      <p>“Of course I do! I’m tenacious that way. I ain’t gonna give up on nothin’ till I die, so as long as I’m livin’, I’ll keep on believin’ in ya, Boss!”</p>

      <p>Laplace’s shouting almost seemed desperate. Yuuki laughed mockingly at it.</p>

      <p>“That’s beyond comical, Laplace! Just because you’re a clown doesn’t mean you gotta try to earn a laugh at all costs, man.”</p>

      <p>Yuuki pressed in on Laplace, talking down to him the whole time. With the two of them close together, Kagali put her Ruin Scepter down before firing another death ray with it. But Laplace had no time to pay attention to it, feverishly parrying all of Yuuki’s attacks.</p>

      <p><em>All that power behind his fists! Is this guy really human? I swear, otherworlders really do come in all shapes ’n sizes, don’t they? But still…</em></p>

      <p>Still, something bothered him. At first glance, Yuuki was as fierce as ever on the attack…but in fact, his aim always seemed to be a little off. It wasn’t anything Laplace did—it was all Yuuki’s own free will.</p>

      <p><em>Huh? Wait a sec. This signal… Maybe it’s…?</em></p>

      <p>Whenever he parried a punch or stopped a kick, there was a faint vibration from the blow. Now, he was recognizing the pattern. It was something he used to contact Clayman as well, encrypted so nobody else could decipher it. Only trusted associates knew the code.</p>

      <p>So:</p>

      <p><a id="page-303"></a><em>Uh, let’s see… “Hurry up and notice, idiot! When you do, play along with me”? Wow, really?</em></p>

      <p>Laplace wasn’t so sure at first, but there was almost no chance this was a trap. Yuuki wouldn’t need to go through the trouble of setting it—Laplace was going to lose anyway.</p>

      <p>So, as he was told, he turned this into a sparring session with Yuuki.</p>

      <p>“If you want power, I got a ton more than you!”</p>

      <p>“Let’s see about that.”</p>

      <p>They went into a grapple…and in an instant, he was sent flying.</p>

      <p><em>So it’s real!</em></p>

      <p>It wasn’t a trap. That throw contained his next message. Laplace deciphered it while he pretended to roll around on the floor—except without the “pretend” part, since it hurt really bad. They had latched on to each other for a short time, rather than making momentary contact with their fists or feet, so Yuuki gave him a decent amount of information this time. Now his current situation was clear to Laplace.</p>

      <p><em>Boss! You’ve come to your senses?!</em></p>

      <p>It was wonderful news, given this desperate situation. Laplace smiled joyfully under his mask as he kept reading the message.</p>

      <p><em>Umm… So keep pretending to fight as you restrain the president, and I’ll take care of the rest? The boss must have some kinda plan, then. All right. Let’s do it!</em></p>

      <p>Without a moment’s hesitation, Laplace sprang into action, pretending to go on the offensive anew with Yuuki—but instead, he gripped Kagali in a tight embrace.</p>

      <p>“…?!”</p>

      <p>“Okay—Skill Steal…!!”</p>

      <p>“What are you—?”</p>

      <p>Kagali fell limply to her knees. Laplace held her up.</p>

      <p>“Y-you okay, President?”</p>

      <p>“Huh? Laplace? Um, what happened to—? Wait. My skill… Melchizedek! It’s <em>gone</em>?!”</p>

      <p>Kagali looked confused. But in another instant, she realized what happened.</p>

      <p><a id="page-304"></a>“Teare! Footman! Get back here!!”</p>

      <p>She deserved praise for shouting that to protect herself. Not even Kagali could hide her surprise at what happened…but even so, from the depths of her heart, she knew that this battle had suddenly taken a major turn.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Sylvia, facing off against Leon, was struggling. He might have been her student, but even she had to recognize his talents.</p>

      <p>He had always been as good with a sword as Sylvia was, even back when he took in that light elemental and became active as a Hero—but with the ultimate skill Metatron, Lord of Purity, he was both a world-class demon lord and a peerless swordsman.</p>

      <p>Leon, fighting for keeps now, delivered a string of light-speed slashes. They didn’t really reach the speed of light, but his sword left streaks of light in the air, hence the name. The ultimate skill Metatron made these slashes into purely murderous strikes—the greatest power accessible via the holy attribute.</p>

      <p>This skill gave Leon control over Disintegration, the most powerful holy magic. With Metatron, he could deploy the spiritual particles in his body and around his sword, turning him into a living icon of destruction that could dismantle anything he touched.</p>

      <p>The combination of ultra-fast swordsmanship and the power of absolute destruction made Leon truly undefeatable. But Sylvia wouldn’t go down without a fight.</p>

      <p>Indra, her own ultimate skill, gave her rule over lightning, the most powerful of natural forces. The lightning strikes it summoned were strong in their own right, but the true essence of Indra lay elsewhere. Sylvia could transform her own body into a thunderbolt, allowing her to attack at divine speeds. It was why she was feared as the Thunder Empress long ago, and why she could still hold her own against Leon’s onslaught.</p>

      <p>Deftly maneuvering and transforming her vajra, she unleashed a constant flow of blade strikes. It let her save face as Leon’s master, but inwardly, she felt an impending crisis ahead.</p>

      <p><a id="page-305"></a><em>I knew he was strong, but he’s grown this much…? I’m glad to see how much my pupil has advanced, but maybe not like this…</em></p>

      <p>That’s how she really felt. And the origins of this impending sense of doom stemmed from the fact that Leon still wasn’t fighting all-out.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>It was Sylvia’s position as Leon’s instructor that let her know his weakness.</p>

      <p>Leon was simply too soft. If an ally was nearby, he couldn’t break out his full force. Kindness like that is a virtue, yes, but in battle, all it did was leave him open. Perhaps gaining strength out of his desire to protect was a good ideal for a Hero to uphold, but in real life, all it did was make him seem inexperienced.</p>

      <p>And Sylvia knew it all. She knew about the orphans he picked up, the oppressed magic-born that he’d gathered to create this city with. Elmesia gave him financial support, but it was Sylvia who helped him build this nation behind the scenes. He was often misunderstood, thanks to the “evil” persona he laid out in his words and deeds, but she knew Leon was actually a very kind man.</p>

      <p>When a girl named Shizu went out of control, costing the life of her friend, he cursed himself and called it his fault. He left her in the care of the Hero of that era, reasoning that it’d be better to live in a human world rather than be raised by a demon lord like himself. Sylvia knew he was watching over that girl, and thanks to that, he became aware of the future demon lord Rimuru before anyone else.</p>

      <p>It was a coincidence that Elen and her friends became acquainted with that girl, Shizue Izawa. But Sylvia was also using Elmesia’s troops to strengthen her surveillance beyond Leon’s. That’s why she found all the overlapping misunderstandings that resulted to be so frustrating. Her pupil Leon could be so weak-willed at times, which drove her crazy, but she didn’t meddle in his affairs more than necessary.</p>

      <p>So time passed, her watching over him and feeling frustrated. <a id="page-306"></a>And now here he was, finally relying upon her. She had swung on in to answer that call, but the situation he found was exceedingly bad for everybody.</p>

      <p>That was thanks to one clear and present reason: Leon’s weakness was gone. He had always gone soft, never fighting for keeps—but now that Michael came first in his mind, he might make full use of his skill for a change. Metatron, Lord of Purity—a truly fearsome gift. He had control over it, always using minimal power whenever he called upon it. But Metatron was a skill best suited for large-scale annihilation. Indra was the same way, which only added to Sylvia’s alarm.</p>

      <p><em>If Leon ever tapped fully into it…</em></p>

      <p>What if Leon stopped caring about the fallout and just activated his full skill-driven powers? If he ever got <em>that</em> serious, this country would be wiped off the map. So Sylvia steeled her resolve. No matter how this turned out, she had to stop him.</p>

      <p>………</p>

      <p>……</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>The battle seesawed back and forth, a furious exchange of sword clashes that seemed to last forever. The aftermath of this hyper-speed battle had already devastated the audience chamber—and worse still, the transport magic circle was destroyed. It was made of magisteel and meant to last, but one stray strike from Leon had battered it beyond repair. It was no longer usable. Not only could they not escape through it; Rimuru and his reinforcements wouldn’t be able to reach here, either.</p>

      <p>Sylvia rued that mistake. But Leon wasn’t the sort of person who could fight while simultaneously protecting something. <em>It couldn’t have been avoided</em>, she thought.</p>

      <p>Arlos and Claude were certainly in no shape to help her, either.</p>

      <p>“Wh-what a mind-blowing battle this is… Even with my eyes, I cannot tell who is winning.”</p>

      <p>“I know this sounds strange, but don’t worry—neither can I, Sir Claude. I thought I would be able to keep up with Sir Leon at full force, but I suppose that was wishful thinking.”</p>

      <p><a id="page-307"></a>“Yes, indeed…”</p>

      <p>They didn’t know who Sylvia really was, but it was clear she wasn’t just someone off the street. Seeing her unimaginable force in action silenced both of them.</p>

      <p>The same was just as true for Teare and Footman.</p>

      <p>“Not looking good. Leon’s a lot stronger than I thought.”</p>

      <p>“Hoh-hoh-hoh! Yes, it’d be quite hard to intervene in that fight! So what can we do, then?”</p>

      <p>“Guess we’ll just have to pick off the wimpier guys!”</p>

      <p>They gave each other a high five. Then they turned toward Arlos and Claude.</p>

      <p>“Heh… They’re after us now, are they?”</p>

      <p>“We may not prevail, but at least let us raise our swords up…and show them the pride of a knight!”</p>

      <p>“It’s suicide, though… But we have no other choice.”</p>

      <p>They prepared themselves. As a proud magic knight captain and instructor, they knew where they were fated to die now. Their lives were like a candle flickering in the wind…but then a voice rang out.</p>

      <p>“Teare! Footman! Get back here!!”</p>

      <p>At the very last moment, Kagali regained her sanity—and Arlos and Claude were fortunate enough to escape with their lives.</p>

      <p class="tx1">Feldway was torn. Something truly unbelievable was happening before his eyes right now. For tens of thousands of years, there had been no hitches in his plans. Lately, however, it felt like everything was coming apart at the seams.</p>

      <p>It all began with Cornu’s failures—the unthinkable act of losing an entire army. The Underworld Gate to the world in question had been shut off, making any further investigation impossible. Then the next shock: Velgrynd’s return. She had been banished far off into another world, where she was doomed to wait for her final destruction—but here she was, back in the key world somehow and completely destroying Cornu.</p>

      <p>There was no way any of this could happen, but that was the <a id="page-308"></a>reality he had to face. So, this time, he dove deep into his planning, preparing for any possible contingency. And <em>now</em> look. Not only did Yuuki regain his freedom despite having a total lock on his brain—Kagali, who received an angelic skill from him, had gotten her wits back as well.</p>

      <p>“…What did you do? How did you ever escape Regalia Dominion?”</p>

      <p>Feldway’s voice sounded like it came from a deep pit of hell. He didn’t expect an answer, but this was Yuuki, after all. With a detestable little grin, he spoke up.</p>

      <p>“Oh, the reason’s simple. I’m a genius, so I realized that this Regalia Dominion stuff was pretty bad news. Then I just substituted in this weird kind of will that was growing inside of me.”</p>

      <p>“…A will, you say?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. Maybe it’s my ultimate skill Mammon, Lord of Greed, acquiring its own sentience or something? I originally took that greed-based skill from Maribel, after all, and I never <em>did</em> trust her. She was always kinda creepy, y’know?”</p>

      <p>Yuuki might have become something of an expert at using Mammon, but that didn’t mean he trusted it. That cautious streak was a lot of what made Yuuki himself.</p>

      <p>“It was real tough, too,” he continued. “I had to observe how this sentient Mammon was acting under your guys’ rule and figure out how all of it worked. It took a lot longer than I expected, but it looks like I got it together at the worst possible timing, huh? I mean, give me a break.”</p>

      <p>He winked at Laplace and the others as he spoke.</p>

      <p>This whole thing had been one big strategy. Even while being controlled, he was constantly observing the situation around him. The conclusion he came to: He had no way to beat Feldway. That’d be a different story at a future time, though. If he kept on accumulating strength, he knew he’d be able to compete with him someday. He wasn’t as fast as Rimuru, but his own growth rate was just that extraordinary.</p>

      <p>So, for now, he was fanning the flames. If he could make Feldway’s side think they had a clear advantage and make them retreat, the day would be won. In the worst case, he at least wanted to buy <a id="page-309"></a>some time so Rimuru could come to their aid. Just continuing this conversation would contribute to that cause.</p>

      <p>This attitude of Yuuki’s infuriated Feldway, but he still kept calm. He thought over Yuuki’s words, seeing for himself that he wasn’t lying.</p>

      <p><em>So he discovered how Sir Michael’s skills work? How could some mere human do that? He’s dangerous.</em> Too <em>dangerous…</em></p>

      <p>He narrowed his eyes, seeing Yuuki as the enemy he was…and then he decided to reveal one of his hidden cards.</p>

      <p><em>I wanted to keep this under wraps until the last minute, but so be it. Better to simply eliminate Yuuki here, rather than waste time examining this traitor’s moves.</em></p>

      <p>Feldway saw Yuuki as a clear and present danger. Not because of Yuuki’s agitation, though. He could not allow Skill Steal, a feature of Mammon, to go unchecked any longer. If he did, Yuuki could free not only Leon, but everybody else here from Michael’s control. With Ultimate Dominion now invoked, any trusting relationship they might’ve once had was as good as lost. So no matter how improbable this scenario was, Feldway decided the risk was too unacceptable.</p>

      <p>“Way to go, Sir Yuuki!”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, thanks.”</p>

      <p>“No wonder yer the boss, huh? It takes a lot more than <em>that</em> to keep ya down!”</p>

      <p>“Hey, don’t be shy, guys. Keep the praise coming.”</p>

      <p>“Hoh-hoh-hoh! I’m not at all sure what happened, but now I’m sure we have the upper hand!”</p>

      <p>“I dunno about that, but…yeah, at least we’ve got some leeway to work with, maybe.”</p>

      <p>Feldway glared reproachfully at them as they jabbered on.</p>

      <p>“Hold it, you! Let me ask—can you take Leon’s ability, too?” Sylvia shouted.</p>

      <p>She and Leon had continued their swordfight, regardless of what was happening around them. Now, they jumped a distance away from each other, taking a short pause, and that was the moment Sylvia took to ask the question. She hadn’t even bothered to introduce herself to Yuuki, but he still gave her a friendly smile.</p>

      <p><a id="page-310"></a>“’Fraid not, sadly. Not now anyway. I don’t really have the capacity for it…”</p>

      <p>“Bah. Too bad. Well, you guys take care of your own business, but don’t expect any help from me, okay?”</p>

      <p>“Roger that. And try to figure something out with Leon for us, if you could?”</p>

      <p>“I hear you! Time to show him what his master can <em>really</em> do.”</p>

      <p>So Sylvia and Leon went right back at it. It gladdened Yuuki to see, as he focused himself fully upon Feldway. His statement just now—that he couldn’t snatch Leon’s ability from him—was true. He had just taken Melchizedek, Lord of Dominion, from Kagali, and there was no way he could take another one before he finished analyzing the first.</p>

      <p>The thing that mattered here was whether the skill had been created by the owner or granted by someone else. Kagali’s skill was in the latter camp, making it unstable and more easily taken away. If the skill was more firmly rooted within the body, Yuuki likely couldn’t take it even if he was in perfect condition—and for that matter, Skill Steal didn’t work against those superior to him. Given the way Leon was, being mind-controlled and all, there was a nonzero possibility…but either way, it wasn’t happening right this minute, and wasting time explaining why would just put him at a disadvantage.</p>

      <p>That’s why Yuuki got all vague at the end. <em>I’m sure</em>, he thought, <em>the enemy will doubt me anyway.</em> He knew he’d never trust the enemy, either. If he said, “I can’t do it,” Feldway would interpret it as “There’s a chance he’ll take our skills” and act accordingly. That was how Yuuki worked—he tried to exaggerate himself as much as possible.</p>

      <p>Right now, the enemy wasn’t going to make any sudden moves. And if this stalemate could continue for long enough, they’d have a tactical victory before long. But now it was Feldway laughing.</p>

      <p>“Heh-heh-heh… Boy oh boy. I really <em>do</em> need to finish you all off here, don’t I?”</p>

      <p>The voice made Yuuki shudder—and when he heard it, he realized that his plan was already offtrack.</p>

      <p><em>Did I stir him up too much? No, even if he went all-out right here, we’d be able to withstand him, I think.</em></p>

      <p>Yuuki vs. Feldway would end badly for the former. But now they <a id="page-311"></a>were five against one. Sylvia was holding Leon back, so that’d let everybody else descend upon Feldway at once.</p>

      <p>This, however, turned out to be a great miscalculation. Because now Feldway’s final card was rearing its ugly head—in a way Yuuki could never have imagined.</p>

      <p class="tx1">“Jahil, awaken! Kill this brat!”</p>

      <p>The order came from Feldway.</p>

      <p>“…?”</p>

      <p>Yuuki didn’t understand what he meant. Leon was too busy with Sylvia to comply with the order anyway. If anyone was going to do it, it’d have to be Feldway himself.</p>

      <p><em>What kind of—?</em></p>

      <p>But before Yuuki could figure out the answer, it plopped upon him.</p>

      <p>“You called for me, Feldway? I owe you a debt, yes, but I very much resent being treated like your every wish is my command.”</p>

      <p>The voice reached Yuuki’s ears after the searing pain battered his chest. He spat up blood, looking down at his torso—only to find a gruesome-looking hand emerge from it.</p>

      <p>“Footman! What’re you doing?!”</p>

      <p>Footman turned around at Kagali’s screaming, pulling his arm out from Yuuki’s chest.</p>

      <p>“Silence, Kazalim,” he answered with a laugh. “What have you done? Abandoning the name and appearance I gave you?”</p>

      <p>He spoke with a fluency that didn’t sound like Footman at all, his evil aura greater and more horrifying than ever before.</p>

      <p>“Ah, shit…”</p>

      <p>Yuuki fell to his knees. As a Saint, he was a spiritual life-form and thus had complete control over his physical body. He could stop his bleeding any time he wanted, even. But this was no scratch he just incurred. A normal person would’ve died instantly from it.</p>

      <p>“Hohhh? Still alive? You’re a tough little piece of trash, huh? Stop causing me so much trouble!”</p>
