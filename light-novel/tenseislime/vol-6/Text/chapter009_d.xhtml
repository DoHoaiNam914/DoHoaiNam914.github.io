<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">Hearing this terse explanation was staggering to Adalmann. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">I—I was wrong the whole time? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">I was betrayed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.3">I lost my faith in the goddess Luminus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.4">I thought I would never be able to wield holy magic again…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Luminus betrayed Adalmann—or to be precise, he had been trapped by the supreme leaders of Luminism. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">He still didn’t know why. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">Perhaps they feared his rise in power; perhaps it was another reason. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.4">All he knew was that Luminus, his goddess, offered him no helping hand.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">It’s almost comical, in a way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">The Seven Days Clergy tricked me into setting off to quell a large army of undead attacking our people… I never could’ve guessed it was a trap. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">And thanks to that Gadora conducting magical experiments on me, I’ve been revived as this twisted, reviled figure…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Unaware that he was being led to his grave, he waltzed right into the far edge of the Great Forest of Jura, where he still dwelled today. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">He was awaited by a legion of undead, led by a dragon zombie. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">He was accompanied by Alberto, acolyte and his closest friend, along with four knights and an expeditionary force that loved him, and they fought with all their might. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">It wasn’t enough.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Adalmann fell to the ground—and died once. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">But then Reincarnation, a Mysterious Art placed upon him by his other friend Gadora, activated and resurrected his soul—a soul that had already been poisoned by the miasma across the land, the malice of the dead around him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">He was reborn not as a man but as a wight, transformed into a skeleton. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">The metamorphosis had caught the attention of the demon lord Kazalim, and now here he was today.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">“Thus, if you are incapable of handling holy magic, then I am positive you are incapable of beating me.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Shuna’s words hit home like a knockout punch, reminding Adalmann that he was still in battle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">“Wh-why?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">he instinctively asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4">“Why did you think I was a master of holy magic?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“Because of how you look,” came the cold reply. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">“That white vestment, which only high-level bishops and above are permitted to wear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">You were worthy of such fine robes, and yet, you whine and carry on about being unable to conquer such a basic bind like this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.4">I hardly needed to examine you closely to see that you wore that robe simply out of blind attachment to your former holy magic.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">She had him pegged the entire time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">He could hear it in her voice.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">“Nnnhh… I have let you spout far too much nonsense!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">Adalmann flew into a rage—not at Shuna but at himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">Seeing his true heart now, something he couldn’t notice until it was pointed out to him, made him both exasperated and enraged at his own spinelessness. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.3">But he could also feel an inexplicably refreshing comfort in his heart, like the fog of a thousand years had finally lifted from him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.4">He let his raging emotions drive him to cast another spell.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">“I offer this prayer to my god. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">I seek your divine powers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">May my request reach your ears safely—”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">I simply lacked the resolve. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.3">Having my beloved friends turn into undead, I couldn’t let myself die and leave them behind… I wasn’t good enough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.4">Necromancy and aspectual magic cannot cleanse the undead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.5">Who could say how many times I wished I could tap into holy magic…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">Those “friends” were one reason why Adalmann was bound to this area. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">He couldn’t abandon the fine men and women who died here but lived on as accursed zombies. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">And that intent was the bond that tied them to this land. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.4">Finally, just now, Adalmann realized the mistake he had made.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">So he connected together a complex seal with the bones that were his hands and boldly declared his prayer to the lands above. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">It was an incantation, as shown by the complicated geometrical shapes that appeared in the air before him.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">This girl, Shuna… I have no grudge against her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">If anything, I owe her a great debt for opening my eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">But suicide is forbidden to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.4">I apologize, but I will need to have you join me—</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">That apology came from the heart.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">The checks placed upon him by Kazalim ranged far and wide, holding Adalmann down—but if he was caught up in the fallout from an attack on the enemy, that was hardly his fault. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">He planned to destroy himself, taking Shuna along him, for only then could he free the people who unwittingly joined him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">A layered circle of magic spread out, covering Shuna and Adalmann.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“—and render all to dust! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Disintegration!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“I was waiting for that! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">Overdrive!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Just before Adalmann could complete his spell, Shuna used Parser for a Control Laws rewrite. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">The results wrested control of the local spiritual elements away from Adalmann, driving them haywire.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“Wh-what…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">You have less than a tenth of my magical energy! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">How could you possibly overwrite my magic?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Magicules and spiritual particles were controlled by magical force. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">Having his magic overwritten could only mean that Adalmann’s force was overpowered by Shuna’s. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">To him, Shuna looked hopelessly outclassed, but now, at long last, Adalmann realized he was wrong on that score as well.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“Impressive. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">Let me reward you by releasing you from this land!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">The wight was swallowed up by a flood of light, unable to hear Shuna’s words to the end. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">She had used magic on him, realizing that someone like Adalmann—at least her equal in terms of holy magic—could collect the energy required to purify the local area. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">She wasn’t expecting him to break out the most powerful of all holy spells, but luckily for her, she knew how that one worked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.4">That was what made it so easy to overwrite.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">The light now permeated the land, enveloping not just Adalmann but all the other undead—cleansing them.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">Hakuro and Soei ran up to Shuna.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“I tell you, I wanted to end this sooner, but that death knight was far more capable than I estimated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">You saved my life there, Lady Shuna.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">With the land fully cleansed, the death knight reverted all the way down to a lowly skeletal fighter and fell to the ground. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">Following Adalmann’s will, it had lost any further desire to fight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">The sight was enough to make Hakuro realize the battle was over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.4">He regretted losing such a challenging opponent, but protecting Shuna took priority over everything else, and she required his attention right now.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">“No, Hakuro, you were a great help to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">You too, Soei, distracting that death dragon’s attention and buying me so much time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">If it had fallen out of our control, I doubt we could have won.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“It shames me that I could not defeat it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">As Soei implied, the death dragon was a powerful foe, capable of healing light damage instantly and boasting an aura that infected the mind of anyone who touched it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">It took someone like him, capable of controlling multiple Replications at once, to emerge from that unscathed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">If anything, he deserved praise for holding out so long against a foe that shut down his decisive weapon.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">The death dragon, too, vanished upon Adalmann’s defeat, unable to maintain its existence after the magicule supply that powered it was shut off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">Soei didn’t much like how it ended, but anything you can walk away from is a victory.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">A victory, yes, but one with regrets. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">The three looked at one another and sighed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“Still,” muttered Shuna, “if Adalmann had engaged me seriously from the beginning, none of us would be alive, would we? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">I think I let my anger drive me to be a little too reckless.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">Adalmann never let up on her at all during the fight, but he also never attempted anything underhanded to snare her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">If he really intended to kill them all, he could’ve done so in many other ways. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3">Shuna could see that, and it filled her with regret.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“Quite true,” Hakuro commented. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">“Perhaps our new strengths have made us grow a tad conceited.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“Certainly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">It is just as Sir Rimuru fretted about. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">There is no telling what may happen in battle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.4">I should have gathered more intelligence.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">In the end, however, a win was a win. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">Clayman’s domain had lost its main line of defense. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">But that didn’t end things. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.4">The trio had a job to do—seize Clayman’s castle and fully neutralize the threat inside.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">Noncombatants comprised the majority of the people remaining in the castle, none of whom signed any oath of loyalty to Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">The more quick-witted among them, or those who took the employment simply for money’s sake, surrendered without a hint of resistance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">There were also many who were restrained in the castle by mental or spiritual bonds, but a combination of persuasion and magical de-cursing on Shuna’s part allowed them to capture the entire castle in short order.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">With the occupants neutralized, it was time to start searching. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">They had already confirmed that the demon lord Carillon wasn’t being held here, but they wanted to seek out anything they might be able to use against Clayman.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">As they did, a figure approached them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“…Please, one moment.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“Mm? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">You’re still alive? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">Did you need me to finish you off?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“Wait, Hakuro. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">He has no will to fight left.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">It was Adalmann, and Shuna had to calmly keep Hakuro from drawing his sword. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">The wight fell to his knees, accompanied by a single skeletal fighter.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“Please, allow me to call you Lady Shuna. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Thanks to your magic, all of us have been released from the bonds that tied us here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">Perhaps it was fate that kept us alive without being cleansed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.4">I have a request that I hope you will let me propose.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“…What is that?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">a quizzical Shuna asked, fearing this would be yet more trouble for them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">“Thank you for hearing me out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">I was hoping I would be able to meet the figure that you have devoted your faith to, Lady Shuna. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">When I lost my faith, I also lost the chance to ever reach the heights of my power ever again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.4">My faith in my goddess Luminus is dead—and I need to find a new god for myself.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">“I… Well, we have a great respect for Sir Rimuru, yes, but we don’t worship him,” Shuna stammered in reply.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">“Sir Rimuru, you say?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">Adalmann was unfazed, still eager to sell himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">“Truly a wonderful name, one fully worthy of describing the glories of my new god. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.4">We may merely be a pair of fragile undead, but I believe we may be able to offer you assistance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.5">Lady Shuna, would it be possible to arrange an audience with this Sir Rimuru?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Shuna wanted to remind Adalmann of the difference between blindly, unconditionally worshipping someone and treating them with respect while dealing with your problems by yourself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">But she didn’t. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">It seemed like too much to get into. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.4">Instead, she conjured up a mental image of Rimuru, the boingy slime she knew.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Adalmann seemed to be the type who got the wrong impression of people easily. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">It would take time to persuade him to think otherwise, so Shuna figured it’d be expeditious for everyone involved if she just nodded and said yes.</span></p>
