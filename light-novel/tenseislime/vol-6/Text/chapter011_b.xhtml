<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">So he’s saying I tried to kill him to claw my way into a demon lord’s seat? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.2">And it was Carillon who engineered it all? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.3">I have to say, that’s a pretty impressive story to make up.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1"> If you actually knew Carillon and how relentlessly in your face and warlike he was, it’d be enough to make you blurt out laughing.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Clayman’s tales continued, meandering here and there, but basically, he was accusing Carillon of betraying the Council. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">This enraged Milim enough to destroy the Beast Kingdom of Eurazania, and Carillon was now dead. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">Dead? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">Not missing?</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1"> That seemed unnatural enough to worry me, but I kept on listening.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Milim had taken action out of concern for Clayman, but he had rebuked her, since wrecking nations without any evidence was generally frowned upon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">Ever since, she had fostered an affinity for Clayman, relying on and trusting in him—and with his adviser Mjurran dead, Clayman decided to send out a force to secure evidence linking me to Carillon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">In addition, he wished to use this Council to discuss how to handle me, after I tried to kill him and declare my rights as demon lord.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">The tale he wove couldn’t have possibly painted him in a better light. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">I was impressed.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">But, man, he just kept on talking forever. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">I wanted to counter his excuses with a little logic of my own. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">My intention was to show my innocence, prove that my actions were justifiable, and then crush Clayman, after all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4">That was why I was sitting here politely and hearing him out, but my patience was reaching its limits.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">Could we maybe get started soon?</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Listening to his tale, I had noticed a pretty decisive hole in his logic—his evidence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">His entire dossier of evidence was made up of testimony, all from a single witness—Mjurran, the ring finger, who had sworn absolute loyalty to Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">It made me laugh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.4">Not only was she alive, but the Mjurran-related evidence he presented was as flimsy as a plastic bag. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.5">I suppose he ran out of time to fabricate anything more substantial than that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">All in all, it seemed like I could build a pretty credible case for myself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">I already had all the evidence I needed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">“…That concludes my case,” Clayman bellowed, looking all self-important. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">“Hopefully, everybody in the room now fully understands that Rimuru, that trifling magic-born over there, is nothing more than a charlatan posing as a demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.3">I believe that a purge is in order here…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">The other demon lords must have been pretty darn patient if they were willing to put up with all this prattling. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">Some of them had already nodded off, it seemed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">I guess it was okay, as long as you didn’t bother anyone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.4">The only rule, I surmised, was that you had to shut up and listen to the guy who convened the Council to start with.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Now we were all free to state our own opinions—and I was ready for it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">Raine, who must’ve been taking the emcee post, turned her eyes to me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">“We will now listen to testimony from our visitor.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">Ugh, finally. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">I had been patient long enough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">No more of this clowning around.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“So, um, Clayman, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">You’re a liar.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“I mean, honestly speaking, I don’t give a crap about demon lords. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">That story about Carillon luring me into this is a load of BS, and Farmus attacked us out of their own greed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">Those two things aren’t related to each other at all.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Clayman gave me an irritated sneer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">“Ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.3">Who would ever believe trite excuses like that? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.4">One of my most senior advisers has been killed!”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">Here we go. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Just what I’ve been waiting for.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“Yeah, Mjurran, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">Well, I didn’t kill her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">In fact, she’s alive.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">“Pah! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">Of all the ludicrous—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“Whoa, whoa, hear me out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">Pretty much all of that speech was based off verbal testimony and your own conjecturing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">And maybe that’d be enough to deal with some rank and filer, but it won’t work on me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.4">Mjurran, your supposed tipster, is under my protection. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.5">That’s why I’m not letting you mess with me, and that’s why your testimony has absolutely no credibility whatsoever.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Going into that much detail made even Clayman go a bit pale. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">But he had no intention of ceding his point.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“Heh-heh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">You’re willing to stoop to such lows, then? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">Did you meddle with her corpse and install some evil spirit inside?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">It was a spur-of-the-moment accusation but not an insane one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">In a world as rich with magic as this one, you could even make the dead seem alive if you wanted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">Talk about freaky—and another reason why you couldn’t trust oral testimony like that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“Well,” I said, “I wasn’t planning to believe anything you said anyway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">That’s why I figured I’d come over there and beat you up myself, but I wound up changing my mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">Before this Council began, my forces gathered some evidence of their own.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">I flashed a smile as I attempted to show him up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">This enraged him, I could tell. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">He was easier to toy with than I thought.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">“What are you trying to say? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">If you want to die that badly, just come out and say it—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“Calm down a sec,” I said, cutting him off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">“I told you, I have evidence.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">I then produced several crystal balls from my pocket, teleporting them to the center of the round table and magically triggering them one after the other. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">Each one contained its own video image, including one featuring me fighting the orc general and another shot from Gelmud’s point of view. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">Shuna had found them all in the ancient castle Clayman called home.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">One of them, meanwhile, contained footage from the battle fought just today. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">It was taken by Benimaru, from his vantage point overseeing the entire landscape, and it contained some really juicy stuff.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“S-stop! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Stop that! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">Please, Sir Clayman, stop this at once!”</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Right there, in the ball, Clayman’s field general was screaming and being transformed into an incomplete Charybdis. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">And that wasn’t all.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“…This is quite a surprise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">I was expecting Yamza to turn tail and flee. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">But imagine…”</span></em></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“Clayman’s forces are destroyed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">The mission’s a failure—the losses immense…”</span></em></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“…Well, Laplace warned him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Clayman can’t blame anyone for it but himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">We’ll need to brief</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1"> him </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">about this…”</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">That conversation between the two weird jesters Geld and Phobio had witnessed was all on video. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Probably Footman and Teare from the Moderate Jesters, I assumed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">With Laplace’s name popping up, it had to be them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.4">That and “him”—I thought Clayman was behind all this, but it seemed like there was someone else. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.5">Maybe…</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Understood. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">It is estimated that all of this is connected.</span></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">…I thought so. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">Whoever it was that tried to make me fight Hinata was also controlling Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">That explains the timing—while I was busy fighting the Western Holy Church, this figure had Clayman spur Farmus into combat, and then that whole tragedy unfolded.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">Maybe I could understand all this, even if I didn’t appreciate it much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">But you went too far, Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">So I’m taking you down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.4">Don’t resent me for it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.5">In this world, it’s survival of the fittest.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">I proudly beamed at him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">“</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">This</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1"> is what real evidence looks like, Clayman.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Having this stuff with me definitely made things proceed more quickly, but even if I didn’t have it, it would’ve turned out the same way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">I was gonna crush him with my own force anyway, so all I really needed was something to shoot down his lame excuses with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">It wasn’t a matter of good or evil—it was all about keeping up appearances. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.4">Besides, I had </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">real</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1"> evidence here, and I saw no reason for anyone to complain about that.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">Clayman turned toward me, face scrunched up in anger.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">“Ev… Everyone, you can’t listen to this trickster! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">This slime, Rimuru, is a notorious bluffer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">He undoes the seal on Veldora to destroy the Farmus force, and then he parades around pretending he did the act himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.4">He’s just a little slime, all bark and no bite! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.5">And it is simply outrageous that he dares to deceive us all in the proud demon lord family!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">It was an impassioned speech. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">As if </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">he</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1"> wasn’t the one relying on others to save his ass. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">As if </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">he</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1"> wasn’t the little one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">If he was acting right now, like I said, he was a pretty good actor.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">This was Daggrull, his voice just as grounded and dignified as his appearance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">Wasn’t expecting </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">him</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1"> to speak up.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">“…All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">Allow me to explain.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">Clayman looked lost for a moment but then opened his mouth again, ready to commit to this tale—the story of the attempt to collect people’s souls to awaken into a true demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">I suppose he wanted to keep that under his hat so that the other demon lords wouldn’t get the jump on him, but Daggrull had forced him to fess up.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">“…This low-class, unwitting slime must have had the incredible good fortune to acquire the traits of a demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">But he must have let it go to his head, for he then traveled to the human realms to investigate the truth behind what he obtained. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">That drove him to set off a war with the humans on a whim, using the banished Veldora to stage a brutal genocide.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">He was doing his best to convince the table, complete with overblown, theatrical hand motions.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">“Leaving someone like this free to maraud again would damage our very reputations as demon lords. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">I believe he must be purged, but what is your opinion?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">“So cough up some evidence,” I retorted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">“Not that you have any, do you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">Everything you said was just a bunch of ‘wouldn’t it be nice if…’ junk, and you still think they’re all gonna swallow it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">Clayman gave me another unamused glare. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">It didn’t bother me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">I was already sick of putting up with his pathetic accusations.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">“Ngh… Why does some slime claiming the might of a dragon for himself think he has the right to defy us?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">There is no way you could ever become a demon lord!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">“Whether I’m a slime or not doesn’t matter, and besides, Veldora’s my friend. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">I’m not here to listen to you go on with your bullshit, all right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">Can we get to the point, please? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.4">Just admit it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.5">Phobio, the magic-born in that video, just showed us how Charybdis was resurrected at your demand, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.6">As those jesters guided him to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.7">And now one of your own men transformed into Charybdis and went insane. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.8">That’s what I’m talking about when I say solid evidence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.9">If you think I’m bluffing, go right ahead, ’cause you’ll be thinking that all the way to the grave.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">I shot to my feet, kicking up the adjacent seat as I did, and tried to look as threatening as possible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">Casually, I placed my hand on part of the round table in front of me—and in an instant, the large table disappeared. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">Nothing to be surprised about. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.4">I just stored it in my Belzebuth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.5">Now we had a decent-size space to work with.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">The chair I kicked up sailed in the direction of Clayman, smashing against the wall behind him with a loud crash. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">This didn’t faze the demon lords, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.3">Only Clayman was unnerved by it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">“All of you are willing to put up with this reckless violence?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">He is making light of us all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.3">Should we not be exacting our judgment upon him at once?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">What, all of them? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">I always knew he was a wimp. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.3">I walked to the middle of where the table used to be.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">“Yeah, maybe you’re right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">Like I said, I don’t care about you demon lords at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.3">All I want is to build a nation that I can enjoy living in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.4">I need the humans’ cooperation for that, so I decided to offer my protection to them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.5">Anyone who gets in the way of that, whether a person or a demon lord or the Holy Church, is my enemy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.6">Just like </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">you</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1"> are, Clayman.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">I explained my ideals to the group with far more passion than Clayman could ever manage.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">“What?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">“And if you call </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1"> reckless violence,” I said as I sized him up, “what would you call taking over someone’s mind while we’re all chatting at Walpurgis?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">Did he think I wouldn’t notice? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">In the midst of that whole speech, that little sneak was launching mind-control attacks at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.3">If I had to guess, he was trying to dominate my consciousness. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.4">Too bad it didn’t work; Raphael was guarding me the whole time, so I had it fully taken care of.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">At least I had a justifiable cause on the table, so to speak. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">That was now in the ears of all the demon lords, and Clayman had already started trying to strike me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.3">If any of them wanted to oppose me, it was now or never.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">Time to switch over to </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">real</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1"> action.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">I had asked the question to Clayman, but it was answered by someone else—Guy, the red-haired demon lord seated on the far side of the chamber.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">“Indeed,” he said with a charmingly attractive smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">“In order to keep things fair, we are only allowed to appeal to others through our own voices.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">“But, Guy, he is insulting us all—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">“Shut up,” I interrupted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">“If you don’t like it, then it’s between you and me, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">“He is correct, Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">If you call yourself a demon lord, then use your powers to defeat that magic-born. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.3">And you—” Guy looked straight at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.4">“Do you intend to declare yourself a demon lord?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">“Yep. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">I’m already leader of the Great Forest of Jura, and as far as anyone on the ground’s concerned, I </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">am</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1"> one.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">No matter the path we had to take to get there, I imagined they would all accept that I’d teamed with the Storm Dragon to rule the forest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">There was no point denying that Tempestians were already calling me demon lord.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">“Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">And we have an array of witnesses here as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.3">If you can win against Clayman before us, I will allow you to adopt the title.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">So beating Clayman ties up all these little strings, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">This was </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">exactly</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1"> the development I hoped for.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">He was smiling the whole time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">Did he have a screw loose? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.3">His thin, almost inhuman smile was still clinging to life as he looked at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.4">And then, quietly:</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">The moment we all stepped into the circle where the table used to be, it was shut away from the audience by a barrier. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">The area within it exploded in size, the surrounding chairs seemingly far away and distant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.3">They must have installed some kind of enclosing barrier to protect the other demon lords.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">I kind of expected this, given that they created that whole fancy event space and everything…but Beretta, one of my supports, didn’t make it in.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">And she was ready to do just that.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">Shion was fighting Clayman, but it was two on one with that black-robed figure in the mix, so I couldn’t say she had the advantage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">Ranga, meanwhile, was pitted against Nine-Head, and I thought he was winning, but then those three tails on the fox spirit transformed into two magical beasts. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.3">All of a sudden, it was three on one.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">She had never brought attendants to a Council before, so Guy realized she must’ve had some reason to do it this time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.2">Considering Milim’s involvement, letting Ramiris join in would just add to the chaos. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.3">He had isolated the battle zone in part to prevent this.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">He had spotted the truth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">Beretta’s loyalties weren’t only to Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.3">And as one of Ramiris’s closest friends, he wasn’t willing to allow an attendant who was weighing its master on the scales against someone else.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">“My master is on the balance, yes,” Beretta freely admitted.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">There was Rimuru, its master. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.2">Rimuru, its creator, but also Ramiris, its current leader. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.3">She was a ridiculously optimistic, rash, curious, even cowardly demon lord, but Beretta had grown to love her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.4">It didn’t even mind all that abusive manipulation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.5">Rimuru had wished for Ramiris to be protected and for Beretta to serve her as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.6">There was no contradiction at all in its mind.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">There was just one thing: Beretta wanted to repay the favor to Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.2">It was once a demon, and Rimuru had granted it both a new life and a new mission. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.3">It felt a need to make up for that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">“And if Lady Ramiris wishes to save that figure as much as I do…” It spoke to Guy without any fear.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">“Hoh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.2">Audacious enough to address me, are you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.3">Interesting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.4">May I trust this golem at its word, Ramiris?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">The fairy gave him a look that indicated no answer was needed, but she gave one anyway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.2">“Oooh yeah, yeah, of course! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.3">So you go help out Rimuru in my place, all right, Beretta?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">“Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.2">So it will take action if you wish it to, then? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.3">You’ve obtained quite a good attendant for yourself, Ramiris.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">“Nah, nah, not obtained. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.2">We’re friends! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.3">Me, and Beretta, and Treyni, and Rimuru, too!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.4">She smiled contentedly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.5">“Like, everyone, a whole, whole lot!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">Guy wasn’t quite sure what Ramiris was trying to say, but if she was fine with that, so was he.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">“Well, all right…” He reluctantly extended a hand to open a hole in the barrier.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">“…I thank you, Rouge,” Beretta said.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">“Sure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">Don’t call me that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.3">I’ll allow you to call me Guy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.4">But I </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">refuse</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1"> to allow you to recognize another master apart from Ramiris from now on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.2">Is that all right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">Granting this honor meant Guy saw Beretta as strong enough to live up to his own standards. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.2">Now, he was asking it to pick a master. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.3">If it attempted to weasel out of the question, he intended to smash it up on the spot. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.4">But it immediately agreed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">“In that case, Guy, I will swear my loyalty to Lady Ramiris exclusively from now on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">So please allow me to be of service to Sir Rimuru at least once.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">Guy was a tad surprised. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.2">Demons, as a rule, wanted to be recognized by their masters for their strength. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.3">Beretta, meanwhile, didn’t seem to see strength as too important. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.4">Its standards had gone all haywire. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.5">It was a nonconformist.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">“You are fine with that?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">Sir Rimuru has servants stronger than myself.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">That made sense to Guy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.2">But it also confused him, someone this powerful admitting to not being the strongest out there.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">“I also enjoy conducting research,” Beretta continued. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.2">“The research I do with Lady Ramiris on a daily basis is truly like a dream… Oh, pardon me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.3">My serving Lady Ramiris is part of Sir Rimuru’s request. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.4">There is no need to worry about that.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">The words reminded Guy of a demon he knew, the very definition of strange, one who pursued only what personally interested him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.2">If they were part of the same lineage, perhaps demons with dispositions like Beretta’s shouldn’t be so unexpected—but the demon in Guy’s mind rarely birthed other family members. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.3">Only an elite few were aware of him at all.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">“Let me ask—what is your lineage like?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">Beretta winced underneath its mask and laughed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">“…I was one of the least of the greater demons. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.2">However, I think you will find very few demons in the same family tree as I.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">A small lineage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.2">That has to be it, then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.3">Beretta’s hair was gray, the color gone from it, but once upon a time…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">“I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.2">No wonder you didn’t fear me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.3">That family always was self-centered, curious. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.4">So someone like you admits there are stronger creatures than yourself?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">Guy shot a passing glance at Shion and Ranga fighting away, then turned back toward Beretta. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.2">Yes, Shion and Ranga were powerful—but he didn’t think Beretta was at all behind them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">“I thank you for the honor, but I still have far to go. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.2">As long as the two of them serve Sir Rimuru, if I miss this opportunity, I may never have another one.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">“Yes, true. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.2">I understand how you feel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.3">You may go.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">The barrier already had a hole large enough to wriggle through.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">“Excuse me, then.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">With an elegant salute, Beretta plunged in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.2">Guy cracked a smile as he watched it go. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.3">He had an idea who this would be.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">…So that’s it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.2">You’re on the move as well, Noir?!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">This was an old friend, one who went away from him ages ago. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.2">If </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1"> was the type of people he was serving now, the slime fighting Milim in front of him must be quite the fascinating figure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.2">A nonconformist serving a nonconformist.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">He basked in joy as he watched the battle, even as he thought he could see its conclusion already.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">So I was fully booked with Milim, but my fighting companions were working hard as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.2">I had thought being outnumbered might sink us, but now I wasn’t so sure.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">Ranga had summoned two star leaders, fellow commander-level starwolves, boosting his team so it was three on three. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.2">I guess it was possible for him to summon up to three at once, but Gobta was using the third one right now, so that was all we had on hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.3">Still, I think it was enough.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">That was their standard path to victory, but Ranga saw right through it, breaking down their teamwork. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.2">If he used one of his stronger finishers, he could’ve wiped them out instantly, but he was hesitating since Shion might be caught in the cross fire. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.3">He had the upper hand, but landing a decisive blow was proving elusive.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">This was bad. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">Really, really bad. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.3">Not to sound all depressed, but the chances of me winning in a knock-down, drag-out brawl with Milim were laughably poor. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">Well, so be it—I’ll just have to hold out until Shion and the rest defeat Clayman.</span></em></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">I immediately tried it out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.2">Any direct strike on my body would cause damage, so I was mainly parrying her moves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.3">I would be applying just a little bit of force from the side, enough to adjust the paths of her punches and kicks. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.4">As I did, I’d use Belzebuth to vacuum up her magicules.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">This turned out to be pretty effective. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.2">Milim reared away from me, a scowl on her face. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.3">It was a teeny-tiny amount of damage, but it worked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.4">All of Milim’s attacks were protected by her own draconic aura; if I could take that out of the picture just by touching it, I’d gradually be able to sap her stamina.</span></p>
