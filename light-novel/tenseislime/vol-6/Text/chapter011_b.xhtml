<p><em>So he’s saying I tried to kill him to claw my way into a demon lord’s seat? And it was Carillon who engineered it all? I have to say, that’s a pretty impressive story to make up.</em> If you actually knew Carillon and how relentlessly in your face and warlike he was, it’d be enough to make you blurt out laughing.</p>
<p>Clayman’s tales continued, meandering here and there, but basically, he was accusing Carillon of betraying the Council. This enraged Milim enough to destroy the Beast Kingdom of Eurazania, and Carillon was now dead. <em>Hmm. Dead? Not missing?</em> That seemed unnatural enough to worry me, but I kept on listening.</p>
<p>Milim had taken action out of concern for Clayman, but he had rebuked her, since wrecking nations without any evidence was generally frowned upon. Ever since, she had fostered an affinity for Clayman, relying on and trusting in him—and with his adviser Mjurran dead, Clayman decided to send out a force to secure evidence linking me to Carillon. In addition, he wished to use this Council to discuss how to handle me, after I tried to kill him and declare my rights as demon lord.</p>
<p>The tale he wove couldn’t have possibly painted him in a better light. I was impressed.</p>
<p class="space-break">But, man, he just kept on talking forever. I wanted to counter his excuses with a little logic of my own. My intention was to show my innocence, prove that my actions were justifiable, and then crush Clayman, after all. That was why I was sitting here politely and hearing him out, but my patience was reaching its limits.</p>
<p><em>Could we maybe get started soon?</em></p>
<p>Listening to his tale, I had noticed a pretty decisive hole in his logic—his evidence. His entire dossier of evidence was made up of testimony, all from a single witness—Mjurran, the ring finger, who had sworn absolute loyalty to Clayman. It made me laugh. Not only was she alive, but the Mjurran-related evidence he presented was as flimsy as a plastic bag. I suppose he ran out of time to fabricate anything more substantial than that.</p>
<p>All in all, it seemed like I could build a pretty credible case for myself. I already had all the evidence I needed.</p>
<p>“…That concludes my case,” Clayman bellowed, looking all self-important. “Hopefully, everybody in the room now fully understands that Rimuru, that trifling magic-born over there, is nothing more than a charlatan posing as a demon lord. I believe that a purge is in order here…”</p>
<p>The other demon lords must have been pretty darn patient if they were willing to put up with all this prattling. Some of them had already nodded off, it seemed. I guess it was okay, as long as you didn’t bother anyone. The only rule, I surmised, was that you had to shut up and listen to the guy who convened the Council to start with.</p>
<p>Now we were all free to state our own opinions—and I was ready for it. Raine, who must’ve been taking the emcee post, turned her eyes to me.</p>
<p>“We will now listen to testimony from our visitor.”</p>
<p>Ugh, finally. I had been patient long enough. No more of this clowning around.</p>
<p>“So, um, Clayman, right? You’re a liar.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I mean, honestly speaking, I don’t give a crap about demon lords. That story about Carillon luring me into this is a load of BS, and Farmus attacked us out of their own greed. Those two things aren’t related to each other at all.”</p>
<p>Clayman gave me an irritated sneer. “Ha! Who would ever believe trite excuses like that? One of my most senior advisers has been killed!”</p>
<p><em>Here we go. Just what I’ve been waiting for.</em></p>
<p>“Yeah, Mjurran, right? Well, I didn’t kill her. In fact, she’s alive.”</p>
<p>“Pah! Of all the ludicrous—”</p>
<p>“Whoa, whoa, hear me out. Pretty much all of that speech was based off verbal testimony and your own conjecturing. And maybe that’d be enough to deal with some rank and filer, but it won’t work on me. Mjurran, your supposed tipster, is under my protection. That’s why I’m not letting you mess with me, and that’s why your testimony has absolutely no credibility whatsoever.”</p>
<p>Going into that much detail made even Clayman go a bit pale. But he had no intention of ceding his point.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh. You’re willing to stoop to such lows, then? Did you meddle with her corpse and install some evil spirit inside?”</p>
<p>It was a spur-of-the-moment accusation but not an insane one. In a world as rich with magic as this one, you could even make the dead seem alive if you wanted. Talk about freaky—and another reason why you couldn’t trust oral testimony like that.</p>
<p>“Well,” I said, “I wasn’t planning to believe anything you said anyway. That’s why I figured I’d come over there and beat you up myself, but I wound up changing my mind. Before this Council began, my forces gathered some evidence of their own.”</p>
<p>I flashed a smile as I attempted to show him up. This enraged him, I could tell. He was easier to toy with than I thought.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to say? If you want to die that badly, just come out and say it—”</p>
<p>“Calm down a sec,” I said, cutting him off. “I told you, I have evidence.”</p>
<p>I then produced several crystal balls from my pocket, teleporting them to the center of the round table and magically triggering them one after the other. Each one contained its own video image, including one featuring me fighting the orc general and another shot from Gelmud’s point of view. Shuna had found them all in the ancient castle Clayman called home.</p>
<p>One of them, meanwhile, contained footage from the battle fought just today. It was taken by Benimaru, from his vantage point overseeing the entire landscape, and it contained some really juicy stuff.</p>
<p><em>“S-stop! Stop that! Please, Sir Clayman, stop this at once!”</em></p>
<p>Right there, in the ball, Clayman’s field general was screaming and being transformed into an incomplete Charybdis. And that wasn’t all.</p>
<p><em>“…This is quite a surprise. I was expecting Yamza to turn tail and flee. But imagine…”</em></p>
<p><em>“Clayman’s forces are destroyed. The mission’s a failure—the losses immense…”</em></p>
<p><em>“…Well, Laplace warned him. Clayman can’t blame anyone for it but himself. We’ll need to brief</em> him <em>about this…”</em></p>
<p>That conversation between the two weird jesters Geld and Phobio had witnessed was all on video. Probably Footman and Teare from the Moderate Jesters, I assumed. With Laplace’s name popping up, it had to be them. That and “him”—I thought Clayman was behind all this, but it seemed like there was someone else. Maybe…</p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1">Understood. It is estimated that all of this is connected.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">…I thought so. Whoever it was that tried to make me fight Hinata was also controlling Clayman. That explains the timing—while I was busy fighting the Western Holy Church, this figure had Clayman spur Farmus into combat, and then that whole tragedy unfolded.</p>
<p><em>Maybe I could understand all this, even if I didn’t appreciate it much. But you went too far, Clayman. So I’m taking you down. Don’t resent me for it. In this world, it’s survival of the fittest.</em></p>
<p>I proudly beamed at him. “<em>This</em> is what real evidence looks like, Clayman.”</p>
<p>Having this stuff with me definitely made things proceed more quickly, but even if I didn’t have it, it would’ve turned out the same way. I was gonna crush him with my own force anyway, so all I really needed was something to shoot down his lame excuses with. It wasn’t a matter of good or evil—it was all about keeping up appearances. Besides, I had <em>real</em> evidence here, and I saw no reason for anyone to complain about that.</p>
<p>“You, you <em>couldn’t</em>! All of this was fabricated! Fake images, built with magic, to prop up your lies! How could you be so <em>base</em>, you slime?!”</p>
<p>“Lies? They aren’t lies, you dummy. Your army’s all done. And you’re joining them next.”</p>
<p>Clayman turned toward me, face scrunched up in anger.</p>
<p>“Ev… Everyone, you can’t listen to this trickster! This slime, Rimuru, is a notorious bluffer. He undoes the seal on Veldora to destroy the Farmus force, and then he parades around pretending he did the act himself. He’s just a little slime, all bark and no bite! And it is simply outrageous that he dares to deceive us all in the proud demon lord family!”</p>
<p>It was an impassioned speech. As if <em>he</em> wasn’t the one relying on others to save his ass. As if <em>he</em> wasn’t the little one. If he was acting right now, like I said, he was a pretty good actor.</p>
<p>“Look, Clayman…”</p>
<p>This was Daggrull, his voice just as grounded and dignified as his appearance. Wasn’t expecting <em>him</em> to speak up.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say just now that Rimuru goaded the kingdom of Farmus into attacking? If the news of Veldora’s resurrection is true, why would he execute it in such a roundabout fashion?”</p>
<p>“…All right. Allow me to explain.”</p>
<p>Clayman looked lost for a moment but then opened his mouth again, ready to commit to this tale—the story of the attempt to collect people’s souls to awaken into a true demon lord. I suppose he wanted to keep that under his hat so that the other demon lords wouldn’t get the jump on him, but Daggrull had forced him to fess up.</p>
<p>“…This low-class, unwitting slime must have had the incredible good fortune to acquire the traits of a demon lord. But he must have let it go to his head, for he then traveled to the human realms to investigate the truth behind what he obtained. That drove him to set off a war with the humans on a whim, using the banished Veldora to stage a brutal genocide.”</p>
<p>He was doing his best to convince the table, complete with overblown, theatrical hand motions.</p>
<p>“Leaving someone like this free to maraud again would damage our very reputations as demon lords. I believe he must be purged, but what is your opinion?”</p>
<p>“So cough up some evidence,” I retorted. “Not that you have any, do you? Everything you said was just a bunch of ‘wouldn’t it be nice if…’ junk, and you still think they’re all gonna swallow it?”</p>
<p>Clayman gave me another unamused glare. It didn’t bother me. I was already sick of putting up with his pathetic accusations.</p>
<p>“Ngh… Why does some slime claiming the might of a dragon for himself think he has the right to defy us?! There is no way you could ever become a demon lord!”</p>
<p>“Whether I’m a slime or not doesn’t matter, and besides, Veldora’s my friend. I’m not here to listen to you go on with your bullshit, all right? Can we get to the point, please? Just admit it. Phobio, the magic-born in that video, just showed us how Charybdis was resurrected at your demand, right? As those jesters guided him to. And now one of your own men transformed into Charybdis and went insane. That’s what I’m talking about when I say solid evidence. If you think I’m bluffing, go right ahead, ’cause you’ll be thinking that all the way to the grave.”</p>
<p>I shot to my feet, kicking up the adjacent seat as I did, and tried to look as threatening as possible. Casually, I placed my hand on part of the round table in front of me—and in an instant, the large table disappeared. Nothing to be surprised about. I just stored it in my Belzebuth. Now we had a decent-size space to work with.</p>
<p>The chair I kicked up sailed in the direction of Clayman, smashing against the wall behind him with a loud crash. This didn’t faze the demon lords, either. Only Clayman was unnerved by it.</p>
<p>“All of you are willing to put up with this reckless violence?! He is making light of us all. Should we not be exacting our judgment upon him at once?!”</p>
<p>What, all of them? I always knew he was a wimp. I walked to the middle of where the table used to be.</p>
<p>“Yeah, maybe you’re right. Like I said, I don’t care about you demon lords at all. All I want is to build a nation that I can enjoy living in. I need the humans’ cooperation for that, so I decided to offer my protection to them. Anyone who gets in the way of that, whether a person or a demon lord or the Holy Church, is my enemy. Just like <em>you</em> are, Clayman.”</p>
<p>I explained my ideals to the group with far more passion than Clayman could ever manage.</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“And if you call <em>that</em> reckless violence,” I said as I sized him up, “what would you call taking over someone’s mind while we’re all chatting at Walpurgis?”</p>
<p>Did he think I wouldn’t notice? In the midst of that whole speech, that little sneak was launching mind-control attacks at me. If I had to guess, he was trying to dominate my consciousness. Too bad it didn’t work; Raphael was guarding me the whole time, so I had it fully taken care of.</p>
<p>At least I had a justifiable cause on the table, so to speak. That was now in the ears of all the demon lords, and Clayman had already started trying to strike me. If any of them wanted to oppose me, it was now or never.</p>
<p>Time to switch over to <em>real</em> action.</p>
<p class="space-break">I had asked the question to Clayman, but it was answered by someone else—Guy, the red-haired demon lord seated on the far side of the chamber.</p>
<p>“Indeed,” he said with a charmingly attractive smile. “In order to keep things fair, we are only allowed to appeal to others through our own voices.”</p>
<p>“But, Guy, he is insulting us all—”</p>
<p>“Shut up,” I interrupted. “If you don’t like it, then it’s between you and me, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“He is correct, Clayman. If you call yourself a demon lord, then use your powers to defeat that magic-born. And you—” Guy looked straight at me. “Do you intend to declare yourself a demon lord?”</p>
<p>“Yep. I’m already leader of the Great Forest of Jura, and as far as anyone on the ground’s concerned, I <em>am</em> one.”</p>
<p>No matter the path we had to take to get there, I imagined they would all accept that I’d teamed with the Storm Dragon to rule the forest. There was no point denying that Tempestians were already calling me demon lord.</p>
<p>“Very well. And we have an array of witnesses here as well. If you can win against Clayman before us, I will allow you to adopt the title.”</p>
<p>So beating Clayman ties up all these little strings, huh? This was <em>exactly</em> the development I hoped for.</p>

<p class="tx1">Clayman began to laugh, just as suddenly as he regained his composure a moment ago.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… How exasperating. I simply attempted a little trick because I didn’t want to dirty my own hands, and now look at the storm I’ve unleashed. What a mistake.”</p>
<p>He was smiling the whole time. Did he have a screw loose? His thin, almost inhuman smile was still clinging to life as he looked at me. And then, quietly:</p>
<p>“You’re up, Milim.”</p>
<p>Tension raced across the chamber. Even the demon lords were nervous, although some were maintaining perfect calm as always.</p>
<p>My eyes turned to Milim. There was the source of Clayman’s confidence—the belief that he had her under his control. Control that he exercised right at that moment.</p>
<p>So she <em>was</em>…?</p>
<p>“Wow. What a bigmouth. After everything you said, you’re relying on someone else? And bringing in Milim after you punched her out to make her do your bidding?”</p>
<p>I tried provoking him a little, but not even Clayman was stupid enough to bite.</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous. I will be fighting, too, of course. Is there any issue with that, Guy?”</p>
<p>“Not at all, Clayman. If Milim is aiding you on her own free will, I will not stop her.”</p>
<p>This…wasn’t good. Clayman I had a handle on, but Milim was <em>deadly</em>. With Guy so readily granting permission, there was no way I could dodge having to fight her. Even with what I could do by now, I didn’t like my prospects against her—and besides, I wanted to help her out. <em>No, I</em> will <em>help her out!</em></p>
<p>Just then, the unmoving, doll-like Milim made two fists and struck an overwrought, triumphant pose…or so it looked like to me. Maybe not. It was just for an instant; I dunno.</p>
<p>Man. Poor lady. <em>Don’t worry, Milim</em>, I swore in my heart. <em>I’ll get you out of there.</em></p>
<p>“Well, all right. I was planning to rescue Milim anyway, so I think I’ll just undo that brainwashing trick you pulled on her—by force, if I need to.”</p>
<p>“Enough of your prattle! You will die in despair.”</p>
<p>“The only one dyin’ here is you, Clayman. I think one of my officers would make a better match against the likes of you. Fighting you myself would just make me a bully.”</p>
<p>Clayman’s face stiffened. A thick, black aura began to float out of him, perhaps generated by his anger. You can’t be a demon lord unless you know how to intimidate your foe, I guess. Not that it was <em>that</em> impressive—but between his rage and panic, that should open up some weak points to exploit. Shion would be fighting him in my place, and I was sure she’d be able to take advantage of that.</p>
<p>I motioned with my eyes to Shion. She immediately sprang into action. In a moment, she was upon Clayman, launching an attack. Concentrating her aura around her fist, she used that single instant to land a good thirty or so blows on him. Then she turned back at me with a look of relief and asked, “Is this all right?”</p>
<p><em>…Um, aren’t you supposed to ask before you start clobbering? All I did was give you a sidelong glance. That was supposed to be a “You get it, right? Clayman’s all pissed off, so get ’im while he’s off guard” kind of glance. I wasn’t expecting you to beat the crap out of him before I blinked again. Does the expression off guard mean anything to you?</em></p>
<p>Well…so be it. What’s done is done. The force of the strikes propelled Clayman right in front of me, in the middle of the circle. “You, you, you <em>bastard</em>!” he shouted as he stood up. He was tougher than I thought.</p>
<p>That black aura around him thickened, instantly healing his injuries. It was far faster than what the orc lord could do, but that was pretty much normal for a demon lord. Either way, it made Clayman accept Shion as an enemy, so we were still more or less sticking to the script.</p>
<p>“If that’s what you want,” he said, “then I’ll kill both of you.” Then the fox that had jumped down to his feet swelled up in size.</p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1">Report. This is believed to be the Nine-Head mentioned by Mjurran.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">Oh yeah, she <em>did</em> say that, huh? So it was another servant of his, not some pet. Then another figure emerged from Clayman’s shadow, wrapped in a black robe. He had two servants, and I had Shion in battle mode. Ranga was similarly enlarged now, ready to pounce.</p>
<p><em>Wait. Hang on. We’re outnumbered if Milim is joining in… Nah. No need to panic yet. That’s what Beretta is for— Huuhh?!</em></p>
<p>The moment we all stepped into the circle where the table used to be, it was shut away from the audience by a barrier. The area within it exploded in size, the surrounding chairs seemingly far away and distant. They must have installed some kind of enclosing barrier to protect the other demon lords.</p>
<p>I kind of expected this, given that they created that whole fancy event space and everything…but Beretta, one of my supports, didn’t make it in.</p>
<p><em>Oh, crap, I didn’t see that pitfall coming—</em> But just as I thought it, Clayman started screaming.</p>
<p>“Milim, kill him!!”</p>
<p>And she was ready to do just that.</p>
<p>There was no doubting the fist coming my way. The force behind it was deadly. But after expanding my senses a million times over with Mind Accelerate, there was a chance I could avoid it. It wasn’t impossible, but I didn’t have much leeway to mess up.</p>
<p>A white-hot ball of energy scraped past my cheek. The speed amazed me. Even with Raphael running at full speed, I still couldn’t fully avoid it. If I even thought about a counter, it’d leave me open enough for a lethal strike.</p>
<p>The only thing I could do, then, was try my hardest to keep up with Milim while I concentrated on breaking her mind control. Even so, my Detect Magic was telling me about events in the circle. It was almost scary, the way I could juggle all of that. Too bad I couldn’t bask in it right now.</p>
<p>Shion was fighting Clayman, but it was two on one with that black-robed figure in the mix, so I couldn’t say she had the advantage. Ranga, meanwhile, was pitted against Nine-Head, and I thought he was winning, but then those three tails on the fox spirit transformed into two magical beasts. All of a sudden, it was three on one.</p>
<p>I, meanwhile, had Milim to deal with. There really was nothing I could do. Nothing, besides pray that everyone stayed alive until I could finish running Analyze and Assess on her.</p>
<p><em>So, uh, you guys take care of yourselves! Got it?</em></p>

<p class="tx1">Beretta quickly set to action, asking Ramiris if it could join the battle. Ramiris, for her part, wasn’t about to turn her toy down.</p>
<p>“Whoa, Guy! I’m with Rimuru, all right? So I want my Beretta to be part of that, too.”</p>
<p>“No,” he coldly replied, paying her as little attention as possible.</p>
<p>“Why not?!”</p>
<p>“Mm? Mere attendants aren’t allowed to join a battle between demon lords. This is a dispute between that slime and Clayman, is it not? You have no reason to join in.”</p>
<p>“What’re you <em>talking</em> about?! Milim’s in there, ain’t she?”</p>
<p>“Oh, she’s fine.”</p>
<p>“So what’s with that? Why’s she fine, and I’m not?!”</p>
<p>Guy rolled his eyes, tiring of this. Ramiris was always something of a loudmouth. Once she got started, it was hard to make her stop.</p>
<p>She had never brought attendants to a Council before, so Guy realized she must’ve had some reason to do it this time. Considering Milim’s involvement, letting Ramiris join in would just add to the chaos. He had isolated the battle zone in part to prevent this.</p>
<p>“Because Milim likely has her own motivations for this. Now will you shut up?”</p>
<p>“Oh, so you think there’s not a thought in <em>my</em> mind about it at all?”</p>
<p>“Is there? Besides…” Guy gave Beretta a look. “Who has your attendant sworn its loyalties to? Your other companion seems ready to devote her all to protecting you, but I’m not so sure about this Beretta. It’s faithful to you, but not completely so. You want me to trust someone so suspicious?”</p>
<p>He had spotted the truth. Beretta’s loyalties weren’t only to Ramiris. And as one of Ramiris’s closest friends, he wasn’t willing to allow an attendant who was weighing its master on the scales against someone else.</p>
<p>“My master is on the balance, yes,” Beretta freely admitted.</p>
<p>There was Rimuru, its master. Rimuru, its creator, but also Ramiris, its current leader. She was a ridiculously optimistic, rash, curious, even cowardly demon lord, but Beretta had grown to love her. It didn’t even mind all that abusive manipulation. Rimuru had wished for Ramiris to be protected and for Beretta to serve her as well. There was no contradiction at all in its mind.</p>
<p>There was just one thing: Beretta wanted to repay the favor to Rimuru. It was once a demon, and Rimuru had granted it both a new life and a new mission. It felt a need to make up for that.</p>
<p>“And if Lady Ramiris wishes to save that figure as much as I do…” It spoke to Guy without any fear.</p>
<p>“Hoh? Audacious enough to address me, are you? Interesting. May I trust this golem at its word, Ramiris?”</p>
<p>The fairy gave him a look that indicated no answer was needed, but she gave one anyway. “Oooh yeah, yeah, of course! So you go help out Rimuru in my place, all right, Beretta?!”</p>
<p>“Hmm. So it will take action if you wish it to, then? You’ve obtained quite a good attendant for yourself, Ramiris.”</p>
<p>“Nah, nah, not obtained. We’re friends! Me, and Beretta, and Treyni, and Rimuru, too!” She smiled contentedly. “Like, everyone, a whole, whole lot!”</p>
<p>Guy wasn’t quite sure what Ramiris was trying to say, but if she was fine with that, so was he.</p>
<p>“Well, all right…” He reluctantly extended a hand to open a hole in the barrier.</p>
<p>“…I thank you, Rouge,” Beretta said.</p>
<p>“Sure. Don’t call me that. I’ll allow you to call me Guy. But I <em>refuse</em> to allow you to recognize another master apart from Ramiris from now on. Is that all right?”</p>
<p>Granting this honor meant Guy saw Beretta as strong enough to live up to his own standards. Now, he was asking it to pick a master. If it attempted to weasel out of the question, he intended to smash it up on the spot. But it immediately agreed.</p>
<p>“In that case, Guy, I will swear my loyalty to Lady Ramiris exclusively from now on. So please allow me to be of service to Sir Rimuru at least once.”</p>
<p>Guy was a tad surprised. Demons, as a rule, wanted to be recognized by their masters for their strength. Beretta, meanwhile, didn’t seem to see strength as too important. Its standards had gone all haywire. It was a nonconformist.</p>
<p>“You are fine with that?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Sir Rimuru has servants stronger than myself.”</p>
<p>That made sense to Guy. But it also confused him, someone this powerful admitting to not being the strongest out there.</p>
<p>“I also enjoy conducting research,” Beretta continued. “The research I do with Lady Ramiris on a daily basis is truly like a dream… Oh, pardon me. My serving Lady Ramiris is part of Sir Rimuru’s request. There is no need to worry about that.”</p>
<p>The words reminded Guy of a demon he knew, the very definition of strange, one who pursued only what personally interested him. If they were part of the same lineage, perhaps demons with dispositions like Beretta’s shouldn’t be so unexpected—but the demon in Guy’s mind rarely birthed other family members. Only an elite few were aware of him at all.</p>
<p>“Let me ask—what is your lineage like?”</p>
<p>Beretta winced underneath its mask and laughed.</p>
<p>“…I was one of the least of the greater demons. However, I think you will find very few demons in the same family tree as I.”</p>
<p>A small lineage. That has to be it, then. Beretta’s hair was gray, the color gone from it, but once upon a time…</p>
<p>“I see. No wonder you didn’t fear me. That family always was self-centered, curious. So someone like you admits there are stronger creatures than yourself?”</p>
<p>Guy shot a passing glance at Shion and Ranga fighting away, then turned back toward Beretta. Yes, Shion and Ranga were powerful—but he didn’t think Beretta was at all behind them.</p>
<p>“I thank you for the honor, but I still have far to go. As long as the two of them serve Sir Rimuru, if I miss this opportunity, I may never have another one.”</p>
<p>“Yes, true. I understand how you feel. You may go.”</p>
<p>The barrier already had a hole large enough to wriggle through.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, then.”</p>
<p>With an elegant salute, Beretta plunged in. Guy cracked a smile as he watched it go. He had an idea who this would be.</p>
<p><em>…So that’s it. You’re on the move as well, Noir?!</em></p>
<p>This was an old friend, one who went away from him ages ago. If <em>this</em> was the type of people he was serving now, the slime fighting Milim in front of him must be quite the fascinating figure. A nonconformist serving a nonconformist.</p>
<p>He basked in joy as he watched the battle, even as he thought he could see its conclusion already.</p>
<p><em>Rimuru was his name? I will have to remember it.</em></p>

<p class="tx1"><em>Oh, crap. I’m screwed.</em></p>
<p>Who’s screwing me? Milim, of course.</p>
<p>Dealing with Milim as a foe made Clayman’s anger seem like a toddler’s tantrum. She hadn’t taken the battle form Phobio saw yet, so she still wasn’t going all out…but her strength went beyond all common sense. I was already exercising everything I had. Raphael, at least, was really humming along for me—seriously, if I didn’t have that skill, I would’ve been dead already.</p>
<p>So I was fully booked with Milim, but my fighting companions were working hard as well. I had thought being outnumbered might sink us, but now I wasn’t so sure.</p>
<p class="space-break">Ranga had summoned two star leaders, fellow commander-level starwolves, boosting his team so it was three on three. I guess it was possible for him to summon up to three at once, but Gobta was using the third one right now, so that was all we had on hand. Still, I think it was enough.</p>
<p>Nine-Head boasted a massive amount of magical energy, but it didn’t seem too experienced in battle. Ranga held the upper hand from start to finish. The two magical beasts Nine-Head summoned, however, were trickier than I thought. Analyze and Assess told me they were a White Monkey and a Moon Rabbit, respectively. They were both intelligent and capable of attacking in tandem, which made them fiendish in battle. The Moon Rabbit could control gravity, weighing down everyone in the battle zone. It allowed the White Monkey to pummel their foes and Nine-Head to finish them off.</p>
<p>That was their standard path to victory, but Ranga saw right through it, breaking down their teamwork. If he used one of his stronger finishers, he could’ve wiped them out instantly, but he was hesitating since Shion might be caught in the cross fire. He had the upper hand, but landing a decisive blow was proving elusive.</p>
<p class="space-break">Shion, meanwhile… Well, she was hanging in there, out of pure fighting spirit more than anything. The black robe was hiding an elaborately built magical puppet, and I’m not kidding when I say it looked stronger than Clayman.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha-ha! How do you like Viola, my greatest work of art? Beautiful, is she not?”</p>
<p>Clayman was boundlessly confident, and I could see why. A real tour de force, although <em>beautiful</em> wouldn’t be my choice of words if asked. Not with, you know, all those swords and spears flying out of her. Each one of those projectiles was a Unique-grade weapon, as was her armor, but this kind of kitchen-sink approach wasn’t what I would call beauty, really. Whether it was heat, electricity, blizzards, crushing, resonation, or anything else, she had a seemingly limitless supply of every attack type in the world, and she was lobbing it all at her foe.</p>
<p>It was nothing to Shion, however. That was thanks to Ultraspeed Regeneration, which sucks if you’re fighting someone who has it. No matter how much damage she took, Shion could instantly heal back up. Clayman and Viola working together prevented her from going on the attack, but that was just helping fill up Shion’s anger gauge. Once that blew up, things were gonna get <em>scary</em>.</p>
<p>As I thought about that, Shion had someone join her.</p>
<p>“I apologize for making you wait. Sir Rimuru, please utilize my power.”</p>
<p><em>Whoa, it’s Beretta! I don’t know how, but it must’ve broken into this battle zone.</em></p>
<p>“I’ve been waiting for you, Beretta!”</p>
<p>“Yes sir!”</p>
<p>“This needless meddling… I was just about to turn these fools into a pair of bloody husks!”</p>
<p>Shion was acting like a sore loser, but I’ll just ignore that.</p>
<p>“Well, don’t let up. Smash them!”</p>
<p>“““Yes sir!!”””</p>
<p>We were now fully back to the original script.</p>

<p class="tx1">No losing now. The path we took here got a little hairy midway, but with things as they were, our victory was unshakable.</p>
<p>The only problem was Milim. She still wasn’t going all out. If I could free her, we’d win for sure. My qualms about the future settled, I focused my full consciousness on her. The noise surrounding me disappeared. I sharpened my mind, looking at nothing but Milim. Now, much more clearly than before, I could see the path her fist traced in the air.</p>
<p>I focused, using every cell in my body for my calculations. If I lose this, it’d all be meaningless. I had to do whatever it took to release the curse Clayman placed on her. <em>Come on, Raphael. Analyze and Assess every inch of her for me!</em></p>
<p>What was that? I’m berating my foes for relying on other people, but using Raphael to solve all my own problems? I don’t know where you’re getting the wrong idea. Raphael <em>is</em> my power.</p>
<p>There isn’t a single iota of guilt in my mind!</p>
<p><em>So, uh, yeah, go ahead.</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1">Understood. Conducting Analyze and Assess… No results.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">Huh? <em>Huhhhh?!</em></p>
<p><em>Um, what do you mean by that? You can’t seriously mean that you can’t figure out the silly curses Clayman placed on her?</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1">No curse-oriented magic found. This is—</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Dude, how useless can you get?!</em></p>
<p>Whenever this happened before, I figured it was because I wasn’t concentrating hard enough, but after all that effort, nothing. It couldn’t even discover any curse at all. Guess I can’t trust Raphael in a pinch.</p>
<p>This was bad. Really, really bad. Not to sound all depressed, but the chances of me winning in a knock-down, drag-out brawl with Milim were laughably poor. <em>Well, so be it—I’ll just have to hold out until Shion and the rest defeat Clayman.</em></p>
<p>My mind made up, I confronted Milim. I <em>had</em> gotten stronger. She might be both under someone’s control and not <em>really</em> trying yet, but I was certainly holding my own against Milim. In the past, I’d be eating dirt before a minute elapsed. Right now, we were at minute thirteen or so, and I was still fighting at a full clip.</p>
<p><em>Hey, maybe she’d snap out of it if I just gave her a good sock on the noggin?</em></p>
<p>The thought crossed my mind for just a moment, but I dunno… Striking Milim kind of goes against my personal rules…</p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1">Suggestion. An energy absorption attack using Belzebuth.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">Oh? Ohhhh! That could work!!</p>
<p>I immediately tried it out. Any direct strike on my body would cause damage, so I was mainly parrying her moves. I would be applying just a little bit of force from the side, enough to adjust the paths of her punches and kicks. As I did, I’d use Belzebuth to vacuum up her magicules.</p>
<p>This turned out to be pretty effective. Milim reared away from me, a scowl on her face. It was a teeny-tiny amount of damage, but it worked. All of Milim’s attacks were protected by her own draconic aura; if I could take that out of the picture just by touching it, I’d gradually be able to sap her stamina.</p>
