<p class="cotx"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">So everything was set. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">After giving my final instructions to Veldora, I waited for an envoy to direct me to the Council site. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">I didn’t know where it was, so I’d be going along with Ramiris—who, by the way, also didn’t know.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">I asked why, and she had replied, “Because someone always comes to </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">take</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1"> me there!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">Which made sense, I suppose, in its own way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">The way she always got lost, wherever she went, I guess it’s just a given that she had a guide. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">If someone doesn’t really feel like memorizing a route, they never will, no matter how many times they repeat it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Either way, I figured someone would be teleporting in to guide us, so I decided to wait for that.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">It was almost an hour before midnight when I was contacted—not by an envoy, but by Benimaru.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“What’s up? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">Some kind of problem?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">I was expecting the worst, but Benimaru instead had a request for me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">Battle had just begun with the enemy, and we already had a full gauge of their capacity.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">The gifts Benimaru earned from my awakening had upgraded his class to Oni. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">This was a type of spiritual life-form, along the lines of the dryads—Benimaru, in other words, had reached the same lofty heights as Treyni. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">Shuna, Soei, and Hakuro were all Onis as well, which put them about as high up on that ladder as you can go.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">This was wonderful, but the issue was the skill Benimaru obtained. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">The unique skill Born Leader was geared toward granting enhanced control over his powers, as befitting the naturally aggressive Benimaru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.3">No matter how much of it he unleashed, he could keep himself from rampaging out of control. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.4">Its secret lay in Compute Prediction, which could fully read the flow of power in his body and prevent bursts of waste.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">It was also useful in battles between large armies, not just in duels. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">He could sense the flow of power among his forces, reading his chances for victory like a prophet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">If things were looking bad for his side, he could instantly send orders to his forces and change his strategy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.4">It was almost like cheating. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.5">In a battlefield, the correct conveyance of information meant everything, and this allowed him to command his full army without a single miscommunication.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Right now, the combined forces of thirty thousand were under Benimaru’s command, and he could move them as smoothly and easily as his own limbs. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">These thirty thousand elites were no also-ran army, that’s for sure.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">What’s more, the Born Leader skill also came with the Inspire Forces effect, adding bonuses to the forces he led that boosted their power by some 30 percent or more. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">That meant the entire army was nearly a third stronger. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">We weren’t losing out in troop numbers; we had better-quality fighters… We weren’t disadvantaged in any way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.4">If we could get </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1"> bonus, too, then hell, all the better.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">And with all of that, Benimaru could see from the start that victory was ours. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">Once he did, he had a bright idea for a new strategy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">(…So that’s why I wish to attack the main enemy force. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">Soei’s ready to go as well, and so I thought that, if Clayman’s castle is indeed beyond that cloud, we might as well lay waste to it, too.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">That Benimaru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">Brimming with confidence.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">(Isn’t that dangerous? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">You’ve only barely begun fighting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">We don’t know how this’ll turn out yet…)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">(We’re fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">I am stationed over here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">It would be Soei and Hakuro striking the castle…)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">(Wait, my brother!!)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">Shuna had interrupted our Thought Communication as she was preparing some tea. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">Um, this was supposed to be a secure line? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">She broke in there a little </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">too</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1"> easily for my tastes.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">(Er, hello, Shuna. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">What did you want?)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">I could hear Benimaru’s voice jump several octaves.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">(Don’t ask me what I want, my brother! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">The demon lord Clayman is dangerous! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">He has the power to bend people’s minds! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.4">If Soei or Hakuro fell victim to that…)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">(No, they’d be perfectly fine against—)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">(You can’t!! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">If you insist on sending them in, then I’ll join them!)</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">Whoa, whoa. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">Shuna’s usually a lot more chill than this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">What’s gotten into her?</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Benimaru and Shuna continued to argue as I sat there in shock. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">As my friend in my previous life put it, there’s no way a man can ever win against his younger sister. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">Benimaru was no longer brimming with confidence at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.4">The all-out assault from Shuna sent him reeling.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">The next thing I knew, Shuna was beaming at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">“All right, Sir Rimuru! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">Give me your orders to move out!”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Um, how do I respond to that…?</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">I didn’t want to send Shuna anywhere lethal, but she did have a point. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">No matter how unlikely, I’d never want Soei to be thought controlled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">I wanted to keep them from doing anything dangerous, but taking a castle to rob the enemy of an escape point was a classic strategy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.4">With Clayman gone for the Walpurgis Council, now would be the perfect opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Still… I mean, as long as I made sure Clayman didn’t get away, we’re good, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">And it’s not like I wanted to kill every single one of the magic-born working for him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">(…You have nothing to worry about, Sir Rimuru,) Soei chimed in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">(I promise I will keep Lady Shuna safe.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">(And with me around,) Hakuro added, (it will be no problem to at least peek into the enemy’s stronghold. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">They might be holding Lord Carillon there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3">I feel we need to investigate.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">My Thought Communication was getting worryingly busy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">Shuna must’ve recruited them both to convince me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">It was rare for her to act so selfishly, so I could understand why they wanted her to have her way this time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.4">The fact Carillon was last seen being taken in the direction of Clayman’s castle also intrigued me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“I am terribly angered by all this, Sir Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">It is hard for me to contain my feelings. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">What Clayman has done is unforgivable!”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Dahh… Yeah, I get that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">I know I’m not the only one who felt a little helpless against him, back there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">And I can see how Shuna would resent being left waiting around on the home front.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">(All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">I’ll let Shuna join in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">But Soei and Hakuro, I want her safety to be job one for you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.4">And if their HQ has more defenders than you predicted, put safety first and just bring back intelligence for me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.5">Even if you discover Carillon, don’t reach out to him unless you’re sure it’s safe. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.6">Got it?)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">(Thank you for accepting her request.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">(I will be fine,) Shuna replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">(I can simply teleport out if something happens.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">(Indeed.) Hakuro laughed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">(If anyone might be taking their sweet time in there, I imagine it would be me.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">(All of us have resistances to spirit-based attacks,) pointed out Soei, (so I imagine we will not waste much time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">And with Lady Shuna there, there is nothing to be concerned about. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">If we do discover Lord Carillon, we will think over matters then.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">That put my mind at ease a little. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">Certainly, with Shuna’s unique skill Parser, she’d be able to identify any attacks aimed for her mind—and with Spatial Motion also in her arsenal, I didn’t see that much to worry about. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">She didn’t have that much magical energy to tap, but the skills in her quiver were excellent.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">Soei was right about Carillon as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">He might not be there at all, so there was no point harping on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">(All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">You have my permission, then, but always make sure you’re on top of the situation over there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">Just in case, I’ll have you begin operations at midnight, just after the Walpurgis Council begins.)</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">So now I had a three-member team attempting to infiltrate Clayman’s base of operations.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">It was just before midnight now, so I decided to take a moment to ask Veldora about the demon lords. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">“I have no interest in such little gnats,” he began (of course), but he still had a fair amount to say about them all—except for Leon, who ascended to the role after he was sealed away.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">Given his penchant for violent rages across the countryside, Veldora had fought against a demon lord or two in his time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">Around two thousand years ago, he attacked and destroyed a city of vampires, which naturally earned him the anger of legions of those creatures—a chase he apparently loved. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">One of them, a female vampire, was particularly beautiful (and beautifully dressed) and boasted strength beyond all her peers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.4">When the dust finally settled, her cadre of vampires disappeared from the scene, and Veldora didn’t know what had happened to them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">“What was her name…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">I believe it was Lu, erm, Lurus? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">Or Milus? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.4">Regardless, I never treated her that seriously, but she was a rather challenging plaything for me, so I would be wary around her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.5">She can’t take a joke, do you see?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">I think that was more Veldora’s fault than hers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">Anyone would be a little pissed off after their homeland was burned to embers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.3">Of course, that was millennia ago; maybe she’s mellowed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">“Ooh,” interjected Ramiris from adjacent to me, “didja know that guy Valentine’s a demon lord now, too?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">This Valentine had apparently taken over the original one’s role about 1,500 years ago. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">I can only hope time’s healed wounds between these vampires and Veldora.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">Daggrull, the demon lord giant, was another keen rival of the dragon’s. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">They had tussled several times, with no clear victor ever being crowned, and if Veldora bothered to remember his name, he must’ve been a pretty mean match. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.3">This guy had the power—or the guts, at least—to take on a dragon type. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.4">Probably a standout among the demon lords. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.5">Better watch for him.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">Our conversation moved on to the topic of demons. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">Veldora had apparently dispatched several groups of demons in his time—a practice he found fun, since even if you incinerated them, they always resurrected to an even stronger form over time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">A bunch of great playmates for him, really.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">Not even he had fought the lord of these demons, however. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">This king held his domain in a castle on the frozen tundra of the northern continent, a place so frigid that he never bothered to make the trip.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">“It is far too cold up there! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">What’s the need for me to pay a visit? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.3">Kwah-ha-ha-ha-ha!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">That sounded pretty evasive to me, but he refused to give up any more details. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">No need to think about that now, though. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.3">It </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">would</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1"> be going pretty far out of his way to storm the place.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">So how many demon lords does that leave remaining? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">I had already met Milim, Ramiris, and Carillon; we had just discussed Valentine, Daggrull, and Guy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.3">There was Frey, the one who Phobio said had dealt the decisive blow to Carillon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.4">There was Leon to think about, along with my current target, Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.5">So one more…</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">“Oh, you must mean Deeno!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">Ramiris cried. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">“He’s even more of a goof-off demon lord than I am!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">I suppose he and Ramiris were two peas in a pod, then.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">“We are </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">not</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">So that’s ten, some of whom had a bone to pick with Veldora. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">I’d need to keep that in mind as we discussed matters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">Many seemed far more capable of defending themselves than I thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.4">Using this wimp Ramiris as a baseline could land me in deep trouble—maybe it was better to assume Milim was par for the course with them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.5">Even after my evolution, I was leery about my chances of beating her in battle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.6">We had sparred a few times, but she wasn’t being at all serious about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.7">I needed more data. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.8">In sparring mode, I could totally take her on now, but I couldn’t be cocky until I knew what she was more fully capable of.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">I still couldn’t believe that Milim de facto approved of rubbing me out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">There’s got to be something behind that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">She’s not the type to backstab her friends or be mind controlled like that, and there was never gonna be any negotiating with her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.4">There had to be some reason—a reason of her devising, too.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">As we talked, I felt a wrinkle in space erupt out of nowhere. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Here comes our ride</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">, I thought as this huge, bombastic, ominous-looking gate appeared. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">Pretty fancy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.3">Me, I usually just kind of ripped a hole in time and space, so maybe I could learn from this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.4">Once I had a concrete image in mind, it’d be easier for me to whip up a gate like this next time and teleport through it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Regardless, the door opened, revealing a green-haired woman in a dark-red maid’s outfit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">She bowed her head toward Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.3">“I have come to take you, Lady Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.4">And is this your guest? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.5">I’ll be happy to guide you together.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">Then she stood by the gate and lowered her eyes, eliminating her presence as much as possible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">A well-trained pro at the servant biz, it felt like.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">He had “no interest” in strength, but he had a hell of a lot of interest in fighting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">As he put it, he had been too content with himself before, since becoming </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">too</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1"> strong would squeeze all the fun out of battle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">Was he kidding with me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">Because if he wasn’t, that’s just scary.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">And now I had this other Demon Peer here, this maid. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">Or more like a maiden messenger from the underworld, I suppose. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.3">With the kind of anime and manga I consumed way back when, a maid was more a type of battle unit than anything—and with her being a Demon Peer and all, she was clearly one deadly woman.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">Benimaru nodded his understanding. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">“Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.3">For this battle, at least, I will appoint you as my aide.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">“I appreciate it, Sir Benimaru.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">Now—in name, at least—Benimaru had command of this combined force. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">With the supervisor of all Eurazania’s armies officially declaring herself below him, Benimaru was now officially supreme leader of the entire show. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.3">There was no defying the supreme leader; in the world of monsters, the strongest called the shots.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">“…But despite appointing you my aide, I’m not sure there is much left to do, is there? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">I am keeping a steady watch on matters, but victory is imminent.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">“I agree with you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">However, I do sense the presence of several strong members on their side.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">“True,” the unwavering Benimaru replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">“Once the outcome is set in stone, I will send Geld’s troops their way.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">“Hold on,” Sufia interjected. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">“I want to join in on that!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">“Yeah,” Phobio added. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">“I don’t want you hoarding all the action, Commander. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.3">This is the land of beastmen—our land. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.4">If we leave it all to you, Lord Carillon’ll chew us out for it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">“He’s right! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">If you’ve left us to ensure everyone is safe, you could at least let us handle this battle.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">“Sir Benimaru,” said Alvis, “I leave command of the armies to you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">Please allow us to target and defeat the ringleader of the enemy force!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">All three bowed their heads to him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">Benimaru greeted this with a clicking of the tongue.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">“So </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">that’s</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1"> why you made me commander?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">“Oh, how do you mean?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.2">Alvis replied, playing dumb.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">“…Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">I was planning to have you join the fight anyway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.3">However, if you feel you are about to lose, retreat at once. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.4">With some of their fighters, arrogance could be your downfall.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">He had a point. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">Several members of Clayman’s force remained question marks. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.3">Depending on who was paired with whom, things could become dicey in the battle ahead.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">But</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">, Benimaru thought as he boldly smiled to himself, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">I’m always here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.2">As long as I can detect when we’re in danger, we will not lose.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">Each of the Lycanthropeers already had their targeted prey in mind, sharpening their claws and letting their proud animal instincts run wild in pursuit of these loathsome interlopers.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">The trap would go off in another few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">“…I wanted to ask you something else,” Alvis said as she waited. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.2">“What will we do with those caught in our trap?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">“Kill them all, is what I would like to say…” Benimaru thought for a moment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">“But I would like to leave judgment on that to you beastmen.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">“Meaning?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">“Take anyone willing to cooperate with us prisoner. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.2">Sir Rimuru is a generous leader, despite appearances. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.3">He is not a great proponent of genocide, although he’ll gladly carry it out if they take any of our lives.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">“…I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">In that case, let us decide how to deal with the prisoners later.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">“Certainly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.2">That is fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.3">I imagine Sir Rimuru probably pictures them as a potential source of labor.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">“…Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">“You are going to rebuild your capital, aren’t you?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.2">Benimaru casually asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.3">“The more able workers, the better.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">“You’ll do </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1"> much for us?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">Alvis, along with her two cohorts, was shocked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.2">Rimuru not only took victory almost as a given; he already had the script written for what came next.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">Where does that confidence come from?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.2">We’re fighting the closest companions to the cunning, deceitful Clayman, and yet…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">The biggest surprise of all, though, was fighting this on the assumption that they’d take prisoners. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">In this world, it was far easier for most people to kill in battle rather than capture. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.3">You would never find a commander who’d care whether a force was partially surrendering before doing them all in with ranged magic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.4">The idea of using prisoners as a labor force had never occurred to anyone before.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">This shook the Three Lycanthropeers to the core. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">It meant that the magic-born working under Rimuru never even considered the possibility of defeat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.3">They went into this fight backed by an absolute confidence in their victory.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">“Well,” Benimaru added with a laugh, “assuming our strategy goes to plan.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">It only terrified the beastmen more.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">And then the battle began.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">(Everything to plan, Soka.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">(Understood, Sir Benimaru.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">With that short exchange, the Clayman force experienced its first casualties. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.2">They were about a hundred magic-born, led by a named one of some renown, but they all died at once, their magical cores plucked out by Soka when she appeared out of nowhere. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.3">The four team members working under him were already busy taking down the other squad captains of Clayman’s army, only striking those targets they were absolutely sure they could defeat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.4">That was Benimaru’s order, and they followed it to the letter.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">The result: The enemy’s chain of command was pulverized. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.2">Orders from above were no longer making it to the foot soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">“This is a trap! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.2">The beastmen have surrounded us!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">“That’s crazy! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">How could they—?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">“Retreat! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.2">We have to regroup our forces!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">By the time they noticed, it was too late. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.2">Unlike a human army, monsters tended to over-rely on their own strength and bravery; a leader to guide their instincts was indispensable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.3">Without them, Clayman’s army was doomed to fall to pieces.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">(Geld, you may begin.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">(Yes sir!)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">His orders given, Geld called out the signal.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">“Start it now!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">“““Rahhh!!”””</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">The next moment, the ground caved in, swallowing up the enemy forces. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.2">Tempestians gifted in controlling the earth had unleashed their magic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.3">This natural-looking stretch of land was actually pockmarked with pit traps, an illusion created by their skills.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">Only monsters with the power of flight could escape, and even those were quickly picked off by avian beastmen and Gabil’s Team Hiryu. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.2">The ones who were caught found themselves in a cavernous underground hollow, the soil liquefied beneath. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.3">They were unhurt but buried up to their waists, unable to move.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">These </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">were</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1"> monsters, of course; some used magic or skills to wriggle out of this mousetrap, falling over their weaker companions to reach solid ground again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.2">But the plan accounted for this, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.3">It helped thin out the crowd. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.4">The stronger ones among the force were killed without any chance to resist; the weaker, seeing this, had their hearts crushed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.5">The survivors would know all too well where they stood strength-wise, likely losing their will to fight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.6">The pit trap was set up entirely to procure pliable prisoners, willing to follow orders.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">Ten or so minutes after the plan was launched, the battle was already far too one-sided to offer any hope for a turnaround.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">“This… This many?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">Benimaru had a bird’s-eye view of over ten thousand Clayman soldiers, cut off and plunged into the pitfalls. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.2">Geld’s Yellow Numbers were patrolling the edges, surrounding all the holes at regular intervals and taking out the magic-born who managed to claw their way up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.3">The enemy forces were outnumbered, and any unexpected shows of strength were handled with Tempest’s superior numbers and equipment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.4">Even the most powerful magic-born could be taken out by a handful of beastmen or Team Kurenai. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.5">Most of Clayman’s force had marched into what appeared be a flat field; the remaining several thousand were holed up in the rear, but they weren’t enough to change anything.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">“We won,” Benimaru matter-of-factly whispered.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">“Truly, an amazing show,” marveled Alvis.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">“Heh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.2">We were bound to win. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.3">That was why we couldn’t afford to let our guard down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.4">I have my own work to do now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.5">Alvis, Lycanthropeers, you are free to do as you like. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.6">Take the heads of the enemy leaders!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">“That’s what I’ve been waiting for, man! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.2">I’ll be back!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">“Now we can finally have some fun! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.2">I can smell the bastard who defied me before. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.3">Think I’ll go after him first!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">“I suppose I will join them, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.2">The rest is up to you, Sir Benimaru.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">The commander nodded, face pointed straight ahead.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">“Go!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">“““Yes sir!!”””</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">With that, the three warriors sprang into action.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">She was headed for a small group at the very far end of the battlefield, unarmed and looking out of place. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.2">They were priests, led by Middray of the Dragon Faithful. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.3">She didn’t know them, but Sufia’s animal instincts told her that these were the strongest forces the enemy boasted.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">Still, victory was all but guaranteed today. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.2">Their force was three times the size of the enemy’s, which was not at all a coherent fighting unit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.3">They were being forced to retreat while guarding a large crowd of refugees, rendering them incapable of any counterattack.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">“We might be in trouble, Father. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.2">The battle’s all but lost, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">“Mm… They are weak, Hermes, too weak. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.2">I had no idea the demon lord Clayman’s soldiers were this incapable…”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">“Look, if this was just a one-on-one duel, that’s one matter, but in mass combat like this, the quality of your army’s command is what decides the day! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.2">That, and how well you can catch the enemy unawares. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.3">Today, that was the opposing side. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.4">They hid their war power until the last moment and even sprang a trap on us.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">“Pfft. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.2">I can see that much!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">Middray was never one to use his head very much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.2">Hermes had a habit of bringing up all these meddlesome, annoying topics with him, just because he happened to be a little smarter, and he never liked that much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.3">Now, however, even Middray could see that there was nothing he could retort with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.4">The scene presented to him was all the evidence Hermes needed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">“But, Father Middray—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">“I know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.2">The fighters headed our way… They’re powerful. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.3">As much as I hate to say it, we are standing in the midst of a battlefield. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.4">If they’re coming for us, I say we come for them!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">Hermes reluctantly agreed as Middray next to him began to burn with a desire to fight.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">Here, in the rear of Clayman’s forces, was fought the most intense and ferocious of the day’s conflicts.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">There stood a man wearing a mask of anger and a girl wearing a mask of tears. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.2">This strange duo was Footman, the Angry Jester, and Teare, the Teardrop Jester; both members of the Moderate Jesters and both here observing the battle by Clayman’s request.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">“Hey,” Phobio quietly said, holding back his rage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.2">“I owe you one from last time.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">“Sir Phobio,” Teare said in a chiding, singsong voice as she traipsed around him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.2">“The beastman who could never quite become a demon lord! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.3">Sir Phobio, the one who lost to Milim! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.4">Thank you </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">so</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1"> much for helping us out then!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">Neither could successfully rile up Phobio. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.2">More than anything, he regretted letting his short temper steer him straight to failure in the past. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.3">So, once the greetings were over, he quickly stepped forward and instantly closed the gap between them.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">Realizing their mind games had no effect against him, Footman and Teare changed their approach. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.2">Things began to move quickly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.3">The air twisted around them, opening a portal through which a man with the head of a wild boar appeared.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">“Long time no see, Footman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.2">Remember me?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">Footman attempted to sound playful with the sarcastic taunt, but the expression on his face indicated he was in trouble.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">Despite appearances, Footman was a coolheaded, calculating type—a trait Geld was fully aware of. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.2">The jester was with the forces that laid waste to the ogre village that Benimaru and the others called home, and Geld knew his powers were difficult to ignore. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.3">Footman was on a different level from other magic-born, as far as Geld was concerned.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">Plus, there was Teare. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.2">Footman’s peer in many ways. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.3">The extent of her powers was an unknown, but she wasn’t one to be underestimated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.4">Phobio might have been the Black Leopard Fang of the Beast Master’s Warrior Alliance, but even with his strength, taking on Footman and Teare by himself would spell trouble.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">The beastman let the rage bubble within. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">Heh-heh… Well done, Sir Benimaru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.2">Not a disagreeable piece of prey at all!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">The commander, overseeing the battle from the skies, had ordered Geld to assist Phobio. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.2">He wondered why at first, seeing as it meant Geld would abandon his command post, but now he saw that Benimaru was right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.3">The rest of the battle had already been decided, to the point that even Geld’s aides could handle it well enough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.4">Only the top leaders among the magic-born under Rimuru’s command could handle two Moderate Jesters like this.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">“Allow us to assist, Sir Phobio.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">“Ah, Geld. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.2">Thank you!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1">Phobio wasn’t turning him down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.2">Even here, he could sense the difference in combat ability between him and this pair. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.3">To him, the best path to victory was worth choosing more than his own pride.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">He didn’t want to consider the thought of defeat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.2">It would obviously enrage Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.3">He had to find a way to turn this around, to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat—but he doubted he had the man power left to achieve it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.4">He still had enough of his wits to realize that, and now he had to think of other forces he might be able to stir into action.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">The five fingers, Clayman’s inner circle of associates, was led by the middle finger, Yamza, the strongest magic-born out of them all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.2">Only Adalmann, the pointer finger, and Nine-Head, the thumb, could compare with him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">Adalmann, head of the defense forces in Clayman’s castle, began life as a wight, a deathly spirit who resided in the Great Forest of Jura. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.2">He was a well-known bishop during his </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">living</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1"> years, but that meant nothing now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.2">Clayman’s accursed magic had greatly boosted his power as a monster, transforming him into a wight king that ruled over the undead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.3">The holy force he wielded when he was alive had transformed into impure demonic power that he used to curse the living.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1">But despite his vast strength, Adalmann had one weakness—his lack of intellect. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.2">The only thing he could do was follow his orders to destroy any intruders; that’s why he wasn’t involved in this war.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1">Nine-Head, meanwhile, was a fox spirit, an extreme rarity in her field. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.2">She was still young, just three hundred years old, and only three of her tails had grown out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.3">Her magicule energy, however, was already well past Yamza’s, up to the level of Clayman himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.4">She was with him now at the Walpurgis Council, serving as his bodyguard, so Yamza couldn’t tap her for backup, either.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">It’ll have to be Adalmann, then…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">The problem was how to call him over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.2">Actually, no, it wasn’t a problem. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.3">It would be simple to have him show up right this instant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.4">Yamza would have to then gather up his surviving troops, flee back into Milim’s domain, meet with him there, and go back on the offensive. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">That’s the best approach</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">, he thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">Walpurgis Councils had lasted upward of a month in the past—if all went well, he could wrap this whole thing up before Clayman came back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.3">It wouldn’t exactly be simple to make Adalmann move, but it wasn’t impossible.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">Either way, if he stood down and accepted defeat right now, it was clear Yamza would be purged. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">Lord Clayman is a vicious man. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.2">He would do away with me in no time—I am sure of it… And even if I were lucky enough to survive, I don’t want to turn into a soulless puppet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.3">As much as it vexes me, I must admit defeat here—but I will reign victorious in the end!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">Yamza turned his gaze toward the battlefield—and there, he witnessed a sight that made him doubt his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">In the front was a bewitchingly beautiful woman, her hair a mix of blond and black. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.2">She held a golden staff and was boldly racing across the land, as if no one was around her at all.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">Protecting her was a group of Carillon’s finest, the Beast Master’s Warrior Alliance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.2">They numbered only a few dozen, but almost no one could defy them in combat, each one bearing the strength of a thousand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.3">There was Zol, an elephant beastman; Talos, a bear beastman… They couldn’t beat the Three Lycanthropeers, but they were all stout fighters, worthy of serving under the great Beast Master.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">They were also accompanied by a group in crimson garb, using searing flame spells to burn away the supplemental forces kept in the rear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.2">They meant little to Yamza, but there was no doubting they were ranked above the magic-born around them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">Things had suddenly become very bad for him.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">The unbelievable visitors deepened Yamza’s gloom.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">“It can’t be… Why are the Three Lycanthropeers here?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.2">Have they abandoned their troops and come to provide reinforcements themselves? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.3">But how could that…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">He could hear the trusted magic-born around him shouting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.2">Agitation was in the air.</span></p>
