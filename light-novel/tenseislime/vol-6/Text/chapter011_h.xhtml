<p>Too bad, though.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I just tell you? You’re cornered. That attack won’t do a thing. Projectiles don’t work on me.”</p>
<p>Belzebuth gobbled up that massive energy blast, leaving our surroundings completely unaffected. Clayman’s scheme bit the dust hard.</p>
<p>“…Whaaaa?!”</p>
<p>It surprised Clayman enough to leave himself open—just long enough for me to snap my fingers. At that instant, a Barrier erected itself over the two of us, a kind of imitation of the one Guy built.</p>
<p>“So he’s stealing my skills?” a bemused but unangered Guy asked. “Talk about shameless.”</p>
<p><em>Now</em>, I calmly thought, <em>I can consume Clayman with confidence. Man, my thought processes are getting more and more evil by the day, aren’t they? Because I’m a monster, maybe?</em> I wasn’t shirking the idea of eating him up at all. Or was it because I’m a demon lord now? Ah, it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>“Wh-what? What happened…?”</p>
<p>Clayman could no longer hide his confusion. The biggest, proudest attack he had was wiped away in an instant, and his brain hadn’t caught up to that yet. <em>Like, how many times do I have to say it? You’re already cornered. The moment someone with your level of talent took me on, your future was cast in stone. It’s so important, isn’t it, to fully gauge your abilities against those of your opponent?</em></p>
<p>“Look, if you’re gonna be serious about this, make it fast. I’ll wait for you. Or were you thinking about ducking out of this chamber while that attack exploded all over us?”</p>
<p>It was a fully rhetorical question I was cornering him with. Talk about disrespecting your fellow man. Well, I’m a slime now, so it’s all right.</p>
<p class="space-break">I mean, Clayman was still screwing with me. He was on high alert, watching for what I’d do next, but he was still a wimp about it.</p>
<p>Just as Raphael expected, getting awakened didn’t do all that much to change him. He had a ton more magical energy, but that was it. Apparently, he hadn’t obtained any ability to control it or new skills to take advantage of it with. His “awakening” was a far different thing from mine. Me, I could use Mind Accelerate to speed up my brain a million times until it felt like time stopped. I could even cast spells in that state, making it look like I could just <em>think</em> of a magic spell to set it off.</p>
<p>Kneading together a big ball of magic was a terribly inefficient use of my time, so I didn’t opt for that here. Unlike a full spell, which could be conceived and cast through one’s will (or knowledge, in other words), controlling one’s aura always led to a time lag. Of course, I could handle that because I had Cast Cancel and All of Creation. No matter how long and intricate a spell was, living life a million times slower than normal made it simple. One second, after all, now felt like two hundred and seventy-seven hours. Even the fanciest of spells could be pulled off in less than a day, so that meant I could trigger them in less than a tenth of a second. With regular magic, it was simple for me to set off multiples at the same time, even.</p>
<p>Thus, if I were in Clayman’s shoes, I’d use multiple layers of magic to throw the chamber into confusion, then attempt to run as fast as I could. He didn’t choose that, which meant he didn’t have the strength for it. He hadn’t even noticed that I built a barrier around us—one that cut off any escape route. If he wanted to get out, he’d have to do it over my dead body.</p>
<p>Whether he was aware of this or not, the atmosphere around Clayman began to change.</p>
<p>“Heh…heh-heh-heh… A mere slime with a big mouth, I see. You are strong, I will admit that much. But I am capable of far more than this!!”</p>
<p>He had changed tactics to the first scenario—a desperate bull rush to kill me. Giving up the escape, revealing his full force to the demon lords… A risky bet, to be sure, but it gave him a winning chance. Surrounded by a bunch of lords who believed that strength was everything, it’d even be a chance to write off all his previous crimes.</p>
<p>Assuming, of course, he could beat me.</p>
<p>“You seem confident in your aura-control abilities, but do you think you could deal with this? Here we go—my most powerful hidden skill! Demon Blaster!!”</p>
<p>After that long speech to throw off my game, he put his feelers to the ground, stretching them out around me, and then released.</p>
<p>The attack harnessed the ley lines under the ground, stacking them together and mixing in his own magicules to amplify them, then released it as a destabilizing ray of light. That was the long and short of it, and anyone caught in it would have their arrangement of magicules thrown into chaos, destroying them from the inside. Physical resistance would be useless, and even a magical Barrier would be instantly smashed.</p>
<p>This was the natural enemy of any monster, and I had to hand it to him—this was real demon lord stuff. But it didn’t work on me.</p>
<p>“Swallow it all down, Belzebuth…”</p>
<p>The Demon Blaster light beam looked like a herd of dragons rising up from the ground—but now they were caught up in a rift before they could reach me, screaming their last as they were sucked inside. There was no escape, almost like a black hole that consumed all light around it.</p>
<p>“Forget it, Clayman. You’re weaker than me.”</p>
<p>I had to crush him. Crush him and hopefully make him reveal something about his patron. The best way to do that was via terror.</p>
<p>“No… That, that’s not possible!! That—that was my secret weapon!”</p>
<p>Secret or not, projectiles just didn’t work on me. Maybe if he used his head and did something to land a direct hit on me, things would be different.</p>
<p>“Do you see that you can’t win now? So let me ask you. Tell me what you know and who you’re cooperating with. Be honest with me, and I’ll give you a painless death.”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha-ha-haaa! I am a walking dead! Kill me all you want; I’ll just resurrect myself and come back later to kill— <em>Ounngh?!</em>”</p>
<p>I punched him. Then again, and again and again, without a word. I also applied Mind Accelerate, speeding it up a million times for him. Raphael could influence not just my perspective but those of people around me.</p>
<p>In the real world, it lasted several seconds. But in Clayman’s mind, I was continually punching him, tormenting him with pain and terror, for several dozen days. So I could carve that pain and terror into his soul. And in those few seconds, the terror made Clayman’s hair fall out, transforming his visage into the ghastly, bony gaze of the actual dead.</p>
<p>“Clayman,” I quietly called out.</p>
<p>His body convulsed, then froze out of terror.</p>
<p>“I’m going to ask you one more time. Who are you getting your information from, and how is this person related to you? Tell me, and I’ll make it easy on you.”</p>
<p>But Clayman had more backbone than I thought.</p>
<p>“Don’t… Don’t treat me like a child. I would never betray my friends—and especially not my clients. That, and that alone, is the ironclad rule of the Moderate Jesters!”</p>
<p>Huh. So even villains had certain unbreakable rules.</p>
<p>“All right. Well, so be it.” I casually changed my tone. “Oh, right, I should probably tell you—you realize you aren’t gonna be resurrected, right?”</p>
<p>He had talked about doing that a few seconds—or days?—ago, but it wasn’t gonna happen. Being consumed by Belzebuth was an even more tragic fate than being caught in the inescapable Unlimited Imprisonment Veldora was locked in.</p>
<p>“Wh-what? What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Was he keeping up that macho act because he was counting on a new life later on, then? The moment he heard me, Clayman began to quiver.</p>
<p>“Look, um, what you told me earlier? About how walking dead can come alive again after they die? And that’s why you wanted me to focus on killing you, so you could pluck out your astral body and try to run away. Right?”</p>
<p>He was an underhanded sneak, but I had to applaud him for his single-minded devotion to his cause. But my observation made his face pale.</p>
<p>“Wh-what did you…?”</p>
<p>He tried to cover it, but I could tell I was right. Not even I needed Raphael to figure it out—but Raphael had even more amazing stuff for me.</p>
<p>“Ummm, so you can connect your astral body to the ley lines here to keep your consciousness and memories protected, yeah? So even if you lose your physical body, you’ll never truly die. That’s why you were pretending to die there?”</p>
<p>Ahhh. Now I see. And just parroting out what Raphael told me made Clayman convulse before me. I was absolutely correct.</p>
<p>“W-wait, wait…”</p>
<p>I knew his game. And now it was time to end it. I turned toward the demon lords surrounding us, ignoring the gibbering Clayman.</p>
<p>“Well! I guess I won’t extract anything else from Clayman, so I’m going to execute him shortly. Anyone have any objections? ’Cause if you do, I’ll be happy to take <em>you</em> on, too.”</p>
<p>It would <em>suck</em> if someone did, but I doubted it.</p>
<p>“Do as you please,” Guy answered, speaking for the Council like I thought he would. No one else voiced any complaint.</p>
<p>“Stop! Wait, stop it!!”</p>
<p>Now Clayman was loudly pleading for his life, finally realizing there was no escape.</p>
<p>“After all the grief you gave me, I’m absolutely sick of you. Don’t expect your death to be all sunshine and rainbows, all right?”</p>
<p>With that, I placed my hand on his head. I thought I’d make it quick ’n’ easy on him if he coughed up some info on his master, but Clayman never sang. I really wanted him to, considering what I’d have to deal with in the future, but hey, I’d probably manage without it. There might be some more leads in his castle to explore, and given the testimony I had that the Modest Jesters weren’t a monster ring, it was obvious that Clayman had worked with humans. I didn’t know if that meant the Eastern Empire or the Western Nations, but either way, if he knew about my own movements, he had to have connections in the west. Track those down, and I should find a trail to follow before long. In a way, relying on the not-too-credible Clayman’s testimony might just lead to more confusion.</p>
<p>So. Clayman.</p>
<p>“…I hope you’ll spend the last few moments before your soul vanishes regretting what you’ve done.”</p>
<p>“No! Wait, wait! Stop!! Stoooopppp!! Help, help me, Footman! Teare, help me! I can’t die yet. I can’t die heeeerrrreee!!”</p>
<p>It was pathetic, watching him try to flee. But I wasn’t about to allow it. No matter how much he carried on, none of it would ever touch my heart. Leaving someone like this alive would just be planting the seed of disaster.</p>
<p><em>Plus, thanks to you, the naïveté in me just died.</em> There was no way I could let that get one of my companions killed again.</p>
<p>“P-please, Lord Kazalim, help me—”</p>
<p>He reached out to his broken mask, clutching at it as if in prayer—</p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Crunch.</em></p>
<p class="space-break">In an instant, the wailing, howling, resisting Clayman disappeared from sight. Body, soul, and all were greedily consumed by Belzebuth. And now it was converted into pure magicules inside me, where he would get to experience the torments of hell.</p>
<p>And whether a dirtied soul like his—a tainted, evil soul—or a sensible, good soul, death treated them all equally.</p>
<p class="space-break">And for a moment, I thought I heard his voice:</p>
<p><em>—Ah, Laplace. You were exactly right. I think I went a little too far. I should have waited and bade my time, like you warned me to… You always were right…</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Was that regret? I suppose even a villain like him feels regret. Let’s hope that the “death” I gave him helps him get more familiar with that emotion.</em></p>
