<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">For Guy, who could adjust his gender at will, men and women were both targets of his sexual appetite. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.2">He—or she, depending—was Guy Crimson, demon lord, master of this castle, and the oldest and strongest of demon lords. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.3">As the Lord of Darkness, he was the sole and absolute ruler of this blindingly cold continent.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Guy pressed on ahead, not bothering to guide Leon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">Leon followed behind, as if this was normal to him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.3">No one else in the audience chamber moved until they were both gone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.4">It was forbidden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.5">They all bowed their heads to them, waiting for their ruler and his guest to leave.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Once all were sure they were gone, Mizeri and Raine stood before the rows of demons. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">And then, a single word from Raine:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">“Disperse.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Then the two Demon Peers left, setting off to prepare tea for their guest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">They were the highest-ranked among all the demons in this castle, but their sole occupation was to take care of Guy Crimson. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">This work was prioritized above all else in this domain—and so they quickly set off, not wanting to attract their master’s ire.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">………</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">……</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">Following Guy, Leon stepped into the ice terrace on the highest floor of the castle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">Despite being open to the elements, not a single snowflake made its way inside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">It was a comfortable, fully air-conditioned environment, and since Guy was wholly unaffected by the temperature around him, he had set this up exclusively for Leon’s sake. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.4">He might have been arrogant, but when it came to his friends or those who recognized his authority, he took care of them down to the last detail.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Musing about how little Guy had changed, Leon gruffly threw himself down in his seat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">It was made of ice but didn’t feel cold at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">That didn’t faze him, nor did the way the ice bent pliably under him, providing a soft cushion.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">“So,” he asked, “what did you call me here for?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">An ice table appeared out of nowhere. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">Raine lined up two cups of tea on it, as Mizeri soundlessly stood by the terrace entrance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.3">They were not to interfere with their masters’ speech, unable to speak themselves without permission. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.4">This was not at all an equal relationship. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.5">Until ordered, they could not even allow their emotions to be shown in public. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.6">If they ever acted on their own without their master’s orders, they would be provided with nothing but a quick death.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">Even Demon Peers as powerful as them both were mere tools before the demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">That was how strong Guy was, and that was why they wouldn’t move even if Leon attacked Guy right there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">His rule was absolute, and worrying for his safety was the height of disrespect. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.4">Their presences were thus ignored as the conversation continued.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">“Well, as you know, a Walpurgis Council is coming soon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">I thought I should implore you to attend, no matter how inconvenient it was.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">“Oh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">Rare of you to force anything upon me like that.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“I know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">Even if it means I owe you a favor, I want you to participate.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“…Why is that?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">“Ha!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">Guy smiled, enjoying this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">“Wary as always, I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.4">Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.5">Let me explain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.6">It was Clayman who proposed this one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.7">A little man. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.8">But for some reason, Milim’s name was among the cosigners. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.9">Milim is one of the oldest demon lords, up there with me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.10">She wouldn’t lift a finger for someone the likes of Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.11">So I believe…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“You believe that reports of Carillon’s death might not be entirely true?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“Oh, you know, do you?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">Guy resented having his thoughts guessed so easily.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">Leon paid it no mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">“Clayman went too far,” he continued. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">“He tried to harass me without leaving any evidence behind, but I’m not letting it pass this time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.4">Whether Carillon lives or not, if Milim is taking action, that is bad news.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">Guy gave this a relieved nod. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">“Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">I agree with you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.4">This might be just another game to Milim, but I don’t like to see anyone tipping the balance of power among the demon lords. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.5">It just gives me more work.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Waiting to make sure Guy was no longer peeved, Leon decided to tackle the question that interested him the most.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“So, Guy, do you think Milim is being controlled by Clayman?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">“Thinking about Milim is pointless,” came the blunt reply. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">“Someone like me is too intelligent to read the behavior of a moron. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">That is one of my very few weaknesses.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.4">He shrugged and gave Leon a broad grin, then went back to his first question. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.5">“But if you worry about it that much, Leon, should I assume you will be participating?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Leon could tell that dancing around each other like this would lead them nowhere. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">“Yes, I intend to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">I hate working with others, but this time, I suppose I have no choice.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">“Oh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Well, very good. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">Before then, I was hoping we could embrace each other in bed later this evening—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“I have no interest in men. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">Or</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1"> in women, unless they strike my fancy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">Besides, what benefit would embracing you, as you put it, have for me?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“You don’t have to start with </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">If you wish, I would happily take on a woman’s body for you…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Guy slithered in for a hug. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Leon, seeing it a mile away, dodged it beautifully. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">One saw this little exchange between them on regular occasions.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“By the way,” he said after it was clear Leon wasn’t putting up with it, “it’s rather rare for Ramiris to provide feedback to us one way or the other, but do you know anything about this ‘Rimuru’ person?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">This was another topic of the next Walpurgis, something everyone had an interest in since it’d mark the first new demon lord after Leon.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“The way Clayman puts it,” Leon replied, “he’s just a self-styled demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">Personally, if he has the strength to back it up, I have no problem with him.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“Ah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">So you think Rimuru is qualified to be a demon lord? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">I was just wondering, since Ramiris, of all people, is involved. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.4">If someone’s piqued her interest </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1"> much, it should be a lot of fun for me.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Although this Walpurgis was convened by Clayman, Ramiris had made the additional proposal of having Rimuru himself attend. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">By Guy’s estimate, Ramiris must’ve had something to say about Clayman’s actions here.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">“…Ramiris? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">I have trouble dealing with that fairy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">She makes fun of me every time we meet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.4">I’ve thought about strangling her to death countless times…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">…But if it was Ramiris making this request, Leon had to agree with it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">He couldn’t help but feel like he owed that much to her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“Ah-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">Better not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">If you kill her, you’d be making me your enemy, you realize.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“I’m sure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">I wasn’t being serious. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.3">Besides, there’s no way I’d win in a fight against you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">That was no lie. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">Leon was no fan of Ramiris and her big mouth, but he didn’t actually mean her harm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">And to be honest, he had no hope of beating Guy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.4">They were both equal in demon lord rank, but the difference in strength was like night and day. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.5">Leon was closer to Mizeri and Raine than Guy on that score. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.6">There was just no comparison.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“Mm? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">I wouldn’t be so sure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">Maybe you’d kill me one in a million times?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“Don’t be ridiculous. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">I’m not interested in a fight I’m not guaranteed to win.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“Quit being so modest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">There aren’t many people who could wound me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">The mere fact that you have a chance of killing me makes you more than strong enough, Leon.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“Pfft. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">The truth’s the truth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">You and Milim are on a different echelon from us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.4">And speaking of that…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">Leon was reminded of something—the reported resurrection of Veldora, the Storm Dragon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">And when he told that story, Leon managed to honestly shock Guy for the first time in his life.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Just then, an icy, shrill voice echoed across the terrace, cutting them off.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">“Oh my. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">I am </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">very</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1"> interested in that topic.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">The voice was a perfect match for the beautiful woman it belonged to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">Her skin was like porcelain, her eyes a fascinating sort of cold, glowing blue diamond in color. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">Her pearl-white hair cascaded past her cheeks, where the light-green shade of her lips drew the eye.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">She was allowed to move and speak without Guy’s permission, shining more beautifully than any crown jewel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">She was praised as the Ice Empress by some, but to the rest of the world, she was known as Velzard, the Ice Dragon—one of only four dragon types to exist, and the demon lord Guy Crimson’s friend and partner. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.3">Just like Leon, she was on equal footing with Guy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">“Ah, Velzard,” Leon said, dripping with sarcasm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">“I suppose there </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1"> a dragon type here, wasn’t there?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">“My, cold as always, aren’t we? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">But I’m glad to have the chance to see you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">“Are you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">Well, it’s a great honor to have a glimpse at your face.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">There was little real emotion behind this exchange.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">“You never did get along with each other,” Guy observed with a groan. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">Not that he had any interest in mediating. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.3">Normally, this would kick off a series of back-and-forth put-downs, but today Velzard changed the subject.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">“So the topic you were discussing? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">Sir Leon, my younger brother has awoken?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.3">Her blue eyes were shining as she asked for details on Leon’s big news. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.4">“You are sure of that, Leon?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">“I stopped feeling his presence two years ago, so I assumed he had met his end, but…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">If Veldora had resurrected himself, it would’ve been obvious. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">His massive, out-of-control aura would’ve changed the world’s weather patterns. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.3">But none of that happened. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.4">Guy and Velzard could be excused for their shock.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">“It’s no mistake. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">A spy I sent to the Western Nations reported as much to me.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">“Oh…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">So why is that evil dragon acting so obedient? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.3">Has he weakened to the point that he can no longer replenish his magicule stores?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">“And who would’ve undone the seal placed upon him? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">I don’t think he could’ve broken out by himself…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">The Hero had sealed Veldora away—and Velzard had done nothing to save him from it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">To her, this was a good way to teach Veldora a lesson for all that selfish rioting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">She figured she would spring him out before he disappeared for good, once he was a bit more mature. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.4">But then he really </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1"> disappear, which perplexed her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">It happened much quicker than she anticipated.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">“As the spy put it, Clayman’s scheming was the cause. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">He had impressed upon the Western Nations, and the larger kingdom of Farmus in particular, to defeat and destroy the Great Forest of Jura Alliance this Rimuru character has established. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">The results cost Farmus its entire military force and caused Rimuru to place his hat in the demon lord ring.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">“You know much about this, Leon.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">“Of course I do. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">I’m a former human, unlike you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.3">I’ve also just recently learned that Veldora was apparently sleeping right in the middle of the most intense combat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.4">Just before his soul disappeared for good, he was exposed to vast amounts of blood, and it awoke him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.5">That is the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">The Farmus troops were subsequently massacred by his rage, he went on to explain, although Rimuru escaped injury.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">“So </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">that’s</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1"> it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">The seal just undid itself?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">“That much, I can’t tell you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">Velzard nodded at this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">Leon could be right, but a single spy’s report wasn’t enough to make a policy decision from. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.3">The Hero’s unique skill Unlimited Imprisonment encased its target in a dimension of an imaginary number, shutting out any access or interaction with the real world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.4">But now Veldora was exercising his presence here, once more?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">“Perhaps the Hero’s seal wasn’t so complete after all…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">This made sense to her…before Leon corrected her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">“That’s possible, yes, but I have another theory. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">What if someone swallowed Veldora up, seal and all, and placed him in another subspace of their own making?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Guy smiled giddily at this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">“Ooh, I like that! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">So someone did undo the Hero’s seal, then! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.4">The seal’s too interwoven with the Hero’s own abilities to be undone by any normal skill. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.5">Perhaps you or I could do it…but if this person exists, then he must be as powerful as us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.6">How fun!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">“It is just a possibility, keep in mind.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">“And you think this person might be Rimuru, Leon?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">“…Exactly.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">“I see, I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">Then we definitely </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">do</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1"> need to size this person up.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Now it made sense to Guy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">No wonder Leon wasn’t showing his typical reluctance to attend a Council. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">Clayman was engaged in reckless violence; Milim was acting unusually strange; Rimuru undid Veldora’s seal and declared himself demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.4">What if all these events were actually connected? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.5">At the very least, it’d make this Walpurgis a hell of a lot of fun.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">A longing smile erupted across Guy’s face. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">“You know,” he whispered, “why Veldora is acting so obedient, then?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">“…I think he’s been weakened,” replied Velzard. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">“I’m receiving only the tiniest of reactions from his presence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.3">Nothing like before.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Even as a fellow dragon type, Velzard had to concentrate to receive even a weak blip from her younger brother. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">If his energy had been drained, that would explain that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">“Strange that he hasn’t acted out at all, though. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">With his personality, violence is practically what he lives for.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">Velzard was having trouble making sense of all this, too.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">“Well, be that as it may,” Leon matter-of-factly replied, “I’m not terribly interested in Veldora. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">If you want to try to drag an old friend of yours back here, be my guest.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">While Velzard was family, and Guy had torn his hair out figuring out what to do with Veldora in the past, Leon had no connection to Veldora. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">As long as this dragon didn’t mess with his domain, he had no intention of being involved. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.3">That’s how dangerous Veldora was to him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">“Are you leaving?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">“Yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">That’s all you needed from me, right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">“Well, one moment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">No need for all the rush. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.3">I wanted to ask: Have you made any progress in pursuing your real goal? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.4">You know, targeted summoning?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">Guy was referring to the experimentation Leon had spent much of his life working on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">He was just as interested in the subject as Leon.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">“…Not quite yet on that, no. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">I changed up my plan and tried having them perform summons at random, but that ended in failure as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.3">It just attracted too much attention, you see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.4">I brought the theory of ‘incomplete summons’ to the Western Nations, but the Free Guild interfered with me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.5">It’s already a horribly inefficient way of going about this business, and it’ll face another obstacle in the future. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.6">Once it does, I’ll just have to find another way.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">To put it in an extreme way, Leon really didn’t care about the Council or the new demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">He was simply trying to pick out young weeds before they grew and got in his way.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">“Obstacle?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">“Yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">This one apparently saved the lives of some kids who were just waiting to die. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.3">Before I could pick them up, no less.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">“Ah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">So they were forced into rescue before you saw any results? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.3">And you’re sure you’ll continue being interfered with?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">“Seems likely. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">He got angry about all these nations summoning children, so he may start applying pressure to each of them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.3">So it’s time to clear out that experiment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.4">If we go any further with it, he’ll find out that I’m there, behind the scenes.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">“Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">Could you perhaps rub out this hindrance?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">Guy hinted with his eyes that it’d be all too easy for Leon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">But his friend simply sighed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">“Well, this ‘hindrance’ is the exact Rimuru we were just discussing.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">“What?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">That’s no coincidence, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">“Funny, isn’t it?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">Leon nodded, face dead serious. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.3">“That’s why I wanted to meet him for myself sometime.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">Of course, he still could’ve afforded to ignore this Rimuru person, if only Ramiris hadn’t chosen to stick her nose in…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">This seems to be getting more curious all the time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.3">Perhaps Milim is thinking along similar lines, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.4">She may be a moron, but she’s got quite the instinct for this kind of thing.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">“Perhaps. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">Tonight’s Walpurgis could be a rather raucous occasion.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">“Hee-hee! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">No doubt about it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">Leon and Guy exchanged smiles as the gentle blue eyes of Velzard watched over them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">They proceeded to chitchat a little more before Guy changed the subject.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">“By the way, I had been wondering about something else. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">Who is this collaborator of yours providing your information?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">“I don’t know much about him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">He seems to be a human from the Empire, and he calls himself a merchant.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">Summoning an otherworlder required vast amounts of magical energy, exacting conditions, and convoluted rituals to work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">The pickier you were about who you summoned, the longer you had to wait before you could attempt the summon again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.3">To get around this, Leon did some business with this merchant, who then conducted the summons for him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">“And this merchant can be trusted?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">“It sure is. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">I’d put them ahead of well near everything else in this world.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">“Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">I’m starting to feel jealous.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">“Don’t give me that nonsense. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">But I will accept your warning. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.3">See you tonight.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">With that, Leon left the terrace. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">Guy refrained from stopping him this time, as Leon left a single shining crystal and used Spatial Motion to set off.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">A pair of eyes watched him go.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">“Talk about impatient. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.2">I know that’s how Leon is…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">Guy grinned a little as he spoke softly.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">“It feels to me that Leon is leaving himself uncharacteristically open to attack,” Velzard observed in her icy voice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">“He’s working with people without even knowing who they are. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.3">Should I investigate for him?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">“Nah,” Guy replied, unconcerned. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.2">“Meddling in Leon’s affairs would just offend him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.3">I don’t want my friends to hate me.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">To him, Leon was a trusted friend, someone whose personality he was keenly aware of by now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.2">He knew about Leon’s talent more than anyone else. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.3">If Leon wasn’t looking into his cohorts’ backgrounds, it must have been because he saw no great need to.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">“If he asks us for a favor, you can help him out then.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">“All right.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">And that was the end of their conversation.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">Now the attendees of tonight’s Walpurgis were set in stone.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">Clayman proposed the Council; Frey and Milim signed on to it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">Ramiris, with her additional proposal, was also attending, as was the homebody Leon.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">Speaking of homebodies, there was another demon lord whose location was a complete enigma. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.2">Guy had reached out via their specialized demon lord connection, all but demanding that one’s attendance.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">Beyond that, there was his old friend Daggrull, along with… Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.2">What about that other guy? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.3">He </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">should</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1"> be coming. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.2">Daggrull promised to bring him along. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.3">And that just left Guy himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.4">It’d mark the first Walpurgis in a while to have all the demon lords show up, except for the missing Carillon.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">“It should be a fun one, for sure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">You want to join me?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">“Hmm…” Velzard reflected on this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.2">“No, I think I won’t. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.3">Perhaps if my brother were there, but otherwise, I have no interest in demon lords.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">“No? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.2">All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.3">Keep the lights on for me.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">“I would be glad to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">Now, time to prepare.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">Velzard stood up, leaving Guy to brood over the upcoming Walpurgis as he gazed at the aurora covering the frigid land.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">A demon lord working behind the scenes, head full of schemes.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">A newer demon lord, but one that could crumble at any time.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">An old friend who was starting to get surprisingly active, considering he hardly left the house.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">And then the potential birth of a new demon lord.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">So exciting! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">His heart hadn’t sung like this for hundreds of years.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">He needed real change like this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.2">Demon lords weren’t friends; they were supposed to be competing with one another. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.3">There was no artificial limit placed on their number—there were times when a dozen existed at once, even more. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.4">Whether it’s ten or a hundred, anything was fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.5">If they weren’t strong enough, they’d get pushed out of the picture the next time a Temma War came around, every five hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">It’s just that each time that happened, this new crop would fight for a piece of the pie, and to combat this, the maximum number of demon lords was finally set at ten. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.2">The human world, once they became aware of this, started calling them the Ten Great Demon Lords. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.3">Guy was firmly against it, but it became a sort of tacit agreement among them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.4">The humans didn’t mind the demon lords picking one another off until they were a more manageable number. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.5">Ten was enough.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">But Guy figured it was time to put an end to that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">The weak didn’t deserve the title demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.3">Perhaps it was time for a new era of rule to unfold—one, he thought, where </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">real</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1"> demon lords held sway.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">Guy was one of the seven Primal Demons, and the first demon lord to be summoned to this world as an Arch Demon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.2">Each of these demons had a primary color associated with them, and his was Rouge.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">He was an unnamed demon unleashed upon the world, fulfilling the wishes of the powerless human who summoned him and destroying a nation that the human was apparently at war with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">He followed that up by destroying his human’s own nation as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.3">That earned him his name—Guy, pronounced “ghee.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.4">An unpleasant-sounding name, like the shrieks of the doomed and desperate as he crushed them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">Upon being named, Guy realized he had awakened into his new class of “true” demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.2">He thought it needless at first, given that he believed he was already the strongest out there—but this evolution also affected the Primal Demons Vert and Bleu, summoned alongside him as errand girls. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.3">They, too, were given physical bodies to work with, as well as the brand-new class of Demon Peer.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">On a whim, Guy decided to make them his servants and gave them names. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.2">For Vert, Mizeri, reflecting the misery of mankind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.3">For Bleu, Raine, the rains of blood that fell wherever he strode. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.4">They had been faithful to him ever since.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">Just after Guy awakened to demon lord-dom, another one did the same. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">That was Milim, a girl conceived by a human in this world and the first of the four dragon types that ever threatened it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.3">That dragon had paid for its strange dalliance by losing the majority of his power to his own child. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.4">The act had been reviled as taboo ever since.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">Upon losing his power, the dragon type dispersed his body, came to the surface to attain a physical form, and became the founder of the dragons as they existed in this world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">This led to dragon types as being defined as the self-sentient propagations of natural spirits, the prototypes, and all the dragons that existed and thrived in the world came from this first father—Veldanava, the Star-King Dragon.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">One day, the Star-King Dragon gave his daughter a pet, a young dragon that would serve as his next incarnation someday. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.2">This “pet” was killed by a certain foolish kingdom that ignited Milim’s rage, causing the very heavens to tremble as the nation was destroyed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.3">This made Milim awaken, and the resulting new force sent her wholly out of control, almost wiping all life away from the world.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">It was Guy who stopped her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.2">The battle took place over seven days and seven nights, the most severe anyone had ever seen, turning the bountiful fields of the west into an utter wasteland.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">In the end, no winner could be crowned. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">The battle ended once Milim regained her senses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.3">It was Ramiris who did this, back then a leader of spirits who sacrificed her own power to neutralize Milim’s rage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.4">She paid a heavy price for this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.5">Being exposed to the auras of demons and dragons sapped her force and made her fall to the world’s surface, becoming a continually self-resurrecting fairy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">But it did the trick. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.2">It prevented the end of the world and allowed Guy and Milim to come to an agreement.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">These were the first three demon lords, and each had their own goals.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">One wanted to find the farthest reaches of power.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">One wanted to live free from all barriers.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">One wanted to promote balance in the world.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">But that was fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.2">These differing goals were exactly why they could see one another as equals.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">The demon lord ranks were soon swelled by a giant protecting the gates to heaven, as well as a vampire from ancient times. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.2">A figure fallen from heaven became number six. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.3">This was the second generation—not as strong as the oldest but more than strong enough to rule over the world.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">The giant’s body was too imbued with the holy element to allow the seeds of demon lord-dom to take root, but he was still so blindingly strong that he got in anyway—an unusual path to take. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.2">The old vampire was shrewd, sly, and more conniving than any of the others—although someone else was currently occupying her seat at the Council for her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">The sixth one was interesting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.2">Definitely strong, but completely uninterested in the world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.3">Laziness was the watchword here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.4">No doubt had the ability to rule the land but probably still living just as “fallen” as ever somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">Four out of the six demon lords at this point had “awakened” to the job, apart from the giant and the fairy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">They had survived multiple Great Wars, polishing their skills with each one—enough so to earn ultimate skills, like Guy’s and Milim’s.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">In addition to them, there was Guy’s friend, Leon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.2">Leon was a human and a former Hero. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.3">A unique upbringing led to him picking up an ultimate skill, making him strong enough even to satisfy Guy’s strict standards.</span></p>
