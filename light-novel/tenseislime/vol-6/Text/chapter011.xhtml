<p class="cotx">The impossibly ornate door connected right to the meeting hall.</p>
<p>A large, round table was positioned in the center, with twelve evenly spaced chairs surrounding it. Ten demon lords were on the invite list (with Carillon absent), so two of these seats would be empty even if I took up one. Attendees sat in chronological order of their demon lord appointment, and so I was placed right in front of the door—not that I minded. My attention was focused in the room around me anyway.</p>
<p>On an occasion like this, I wanted to observe my new colleagues as much as possible. Of course, there were only two people here right now. One was Ramiris, at the seat of honor way on the other side. She was seated and kicking her legs around, having a whale of a time, like a kid on a car trip. I figured I could ignore her.</p>
<p class="space-break">No, my attention was on her right, at the seat directly facing me. There I saw a man with bewitchingly attractive red hair. A man, definitely, but there was more than a touch of femininity to his dashing good looks. His eyes were shut, but I doubted he was napping.</p>
<p>One look was all I needed to know: This dude was trouble. Analyze and Assess seemed to suggest that he wasn’t any big deal, but my sixth sense was giving me the eeriest vibes with him. At first glance, he seemed like an inexperienced kid, kind of magically strong but unable to control his aura. Without the Great Sage’s analytical skills, I might’ve been tricked—that was how crafty he was at hiding his true self, feeding the people around him misinformation and making them underestimate his true skills. We hadn’t even started fighting yet, and the battle was already under way.</p>
<p>It made me recall the mind-reading skills of Gazel, the dwarf king. Kind of like my Great Sage, nobody would know you had that skill unless you told them. It wouldn’t be until someone tried it on you that you’d notice it, I think, unless it was a mind reading that went really deep into your psyche to avoid that. As long as my latent resistance didn’t fail me, I was pretty sure I’d be okay.</p>
<p>As a result of this, hiding your skills was very important. You could also bluff people into thinking you had certain skills or deliberately mess up a skill to make them think you were inept to wield it. There were all kinds of ways to play with your opponents’ minds, and that was exactly what this pretty boy was doing—tricking other people’s Analyze and Assess skills to mess around with them.</p>
<p>My idea had always been to hide my powers, keep my aura turned down as long as possible, and give the enemy zero information to work with. This guy, meanwhile, was using his rivals’ data-gathering skills against them. It was a sort of screening process. He was, in effect, asking his foes “Do you have the power to read me?” If they didn’t, they were out of the picture; if they did, he’d gauge their response. If the fake info he planted into their minds was enough to scare them off, they weren’t worth dealing with in the first place—but if you <em>did</em> notice his trick, that glance at the sheer depths of his powers would make you unable to resist him.</p>
<p>But think of it like this. Even the data he <em>wanted</em> you to know about indicated that he had as much magical force as Carillon. There was no way to guess how much he actually had. Even if you understood his game, it was hard not to let it unnerve you a bit.</p>
<p>This was Guy, and he was clearly on a whole other level.</p>
<p class="space-break">By the time I was done examining Guy, a large man lumbered into the room, bringing only one guest with him. This was Daggrull, the demon lord giant whose overwhelming presence dominated any room he was in. He immediately walked up and slammed himself into a seat at Guy’s right, kicking back and putting his feet up. The empty space between them must’ve belonged to Milim, indicating that the table divided demon lords into two halves based on their order, with Guy on one end and me on the other.</p>
<p>I turned my eyes to him. Guy was a tall figure himself, but Daggrull was enormous, not to mention comfy-looking in his specially made chair. Even something like this chair was an opulent-looking magical item. This was Veldora’s favorite rival, and the magic with which he presented himself definitely signaled to me that he could take on a dragon type.</p>
<p>Plus, the amount of magicule energy on him was just ridiculous. Was that higher or lower than Veldora’s? It seemed bottomless to me, but it’d be hard to accurately measure unless I fought him for real. Still, quality beat quantity. Just because he had a bunch of magicules on hand didn’t make him seem that scary to me. The key was how well he used them. Differences in skill level were a vital aspect of any fight, of course, and a demon lord like Daggrull couldn’t be <em>that</em> unskilled. <em>I suppose I’ll need to watch out for him, too.</em></p>
<p class="space-break">Now another one came in, a handsome, muscle-bound man decked out in some real fancy-looking threads. He was tall, if not as tall as Daggrull, and his facial features looked like they’d been chiseled. His short, curly blond hair looked wild on his scalp, perhaps representing his violent personality. To put it simply, he had Hollywood good looks, and he knew how to charm people.</p>
<p>I suppose, of course, the thing that stuck out the most were the two fangs visible from his lips. He must’ve been the demon lord Valentine, the vampire. He sat to Ramiris’s left, so in terms of the seat order, he must’ve been about as old as Daggrull—that, or perhaps he just took over for whoever he replaced. Not that seat assignments mattered that much.</p>
<p>What struck me more were the pair Valentine brought with him. One was an elderly man, kind of a manservant type. Definitely well-trained, unmoving and statuesque. His aura was restrained, revealing nothing—the same strategy I used. The second one, meanwhile, was an eye-catchingly beautiful silver-haired girl who seemed to shine like the sun. Her skin was pale, and she had one red eye and one blue. There was something oddly eerie about this girl, who appeared to be on the cusp of adulthood and was clad in a maid-style dress. Maid dresses are like battle uniforms, as they say, and it wouldn’t be odd for this girl to be pretty strong.</p>
<p>And these two were both working for this guy? That’s a surprise. The girl, in particular, was just letting her gigantic aura out all over the place. <em>But—hang on.</em> When our eyes met, I was struck by the most uncomfortable feeling. Maybe I was imagining it, but it seemed like she was changing the nature of her aura at random.</p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1">Understood. Analyze and Assess indicates that the target likely bears more magicules than the demon lord Valentine.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Ah, I knew it. I couldn’t read her overall energy count, but it’s higher than Valentine’s, the guy she’s serving.</em> It was very cleverly concealed—if you didn’t have an ultimate skill like mine, you’d never spot it. But again, they weren’t really intent on hiding it—like Guy, they wanted to assess you, see whether you spotted it or not.</p>
<p>Could this girl be the <em>real</em> demon lord? Or perhaps the previous holder of this seat, the demon lord that retired out. Maybe this is that “Milus,” the vampiress that even Veldora had high praise for. The changeover happened more than 1,500 years ago, so perhaps not too many demon lords knew about that—or did but were keeping mum about it. Or didn’t care. Either way, better be careful.</p>
<p>Valentine, the current demon lord, was no pushover himself. He had a heroic sort of ambition, even more than an untransformed Carillon, so there was no reason to doubt his strength. And if that wasn’t enough, she had that freaky girl with her. If it was her domain that got burned to ash, it wouldn’t be strange for her to despise Veldora at all. I resisted the urge to yell “Why’d you have to piss <em>that</em> lady off?!”</p>
<p>At least there was one saving grace—who wouldn’t mind dying by the hand of such a beautiful figure? (Quite a few people, I imagine, but…) <em>I’ll just have to hope she doesn’t learn about Veldora and me—or if she does, that I don’t have to clean up the mess.</em></p>
<p class="space-break">After a little while, the fifth person showed up—this one a loner, almost sleepwalking to his post. He had two swords on his belt, but that’s it. Not much of an arsenal. I got a quick glance at his eyes; they were light blue. His hair was a very dark shade of purple with silver streaks in it. He still looked young to me, maybe even high-school age, and he had well-defined facial features, although they were spoiled by his sleepy eyes and general listlessness.</p>
<p>He stopped by Ramiris’s seat to say hello. “Yo. Man, you’re still, like, the size of a bug, huh?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you trying to start a fight with me? Like you could even handle me, Deeno.”</p>
<p>So person number five was Deeno. He definitely seemed cut from the same cloth as her. Neither was seriously riled; they seemed to just be screwing with each other.</p>
<p>“Why would I need to, dumbass? Like, it’s totally obvious who would win.”</p>
<p>“Pfft! I didn’t realize you were in <em>that</em> much of a hurry to die. I’m in perfect physical form today, I’ll have you know!”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh. Hey, haven’t you shrunk since last time I saw you?”</p>
<p>“What do you <em>want</em> from me?! I only just got reborn recently!”</p>
<p>When I asked her about it, Ramiris said she had been resurrected around five hundred years ago. It would apparently take her several centuries to fully mature. This seemed to convince Deeno.</p>
<p>“Ohhh, that’s why? That’s kinda a pain for you, isn’t it? But you kept all your memories, right?”</p>
<p>“My memories, yes. But my spirit’s degenerated along with my body… Ooh, but I’m still the strongest outta all of you! I need a handicap like this, or it’s no fun!”</p>
<p>“Guy, I think Ramiris is sayin’ something? Did you hear her just now?”</p>
<p>“Bahhh?! What are you, stupid? I know how to pick my enemies, all right? I’m not saying I could KO Guy in one punch or anything!”</p>
<p>A bigmouth like her changed her stripes all too quickly. I guess that red-haired guy really was Guy, too, and judging by Ramiris’s freak-out, he really was a menace. <em>I’ll just write “Guy = dangerous” in my internal notepad. It’s little notes like these that have saved me from peril more than once. You can’t underestimate the power of that.</em></p>
<p>The two kept on talking in hushed voices so as not to rile Guy. They were discussing Beretta and Treyni, Ramiris’s guests, and of course Ramiris was bragging up and down about them.</p>
<p>“Wha? Why’s a total loner like you got attendants here?” Deeno complained. “You’re making me look like a dweeb for showing up alone!”</p>
<p>“Hee-heeeee! Now I can get back at everyone for calling me a little shrimp and a loner, <em>you</em> in particular! Wait’ll you see how powerless you are against these guys!”</p>
<p>“Oh, you want us to fight? Is it okay if I rip ’em up?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Of <em>course</em> it’s not okay! If you break them, I’m seriously going to tell on you to Guy and make him make <em>you</em> pay for it!”</p>
<p>It’s like Guy was her big brother or something. It was breathtaking how quickly she let other people do the dirty work for her.</p>
<p>“…But really, <em>man</em>, these guys are the real deal. Like, I looked at ’em for real just now, and it’s like, <em>damn</em>!”</p>
<p>Beretta and Treyni silently nodded at Deeno. They were far too good for Ramiris, really.</p>
<p>“Right! You see? You see, you see? Now I’ve got some muscle to back up my words, know what I mean?” Ramiris stuck out her chest (not that she had much of one) to show up Deeno. Their upgrades were entirely <em>my</em> doing, but ah well.</p>
<p>Beretta and Treyni remained silent. They were the perfect attendants. They didn’t speak, and the dozing Shion behind me could definitely learn a thing or two from them.</p>
<p>Once he finished saying his hellos, Deeno stumbled over to his seat. It was next to Valentine’s, making him another member of the old guard. Deeno ignored Valentine entirely as he sat down…and immediately put his head on the table and started sleeping. <em>That</em> seemed kind of rude. Maybe demon lords didn’t make it a habit to say hi to one another, and all those put-downs with Ramiris were the exception to the rule.</p>
<p>Deeno couldn’t have acted less interested in being here. Showing up was enough for him, it seemed, but falling asleep without even bothering to read the room was, in a way, incredibly self-centered. Fearless, too.</p>
<p>I suppose that act had to be backed up with some actual ability. Hopefully. Let’s go with that. He <em>was</em> jamming my skills a bit, so I couldn’t be sure of what he had. He stared at me with his half-open eyes whenever I tried analyzing him, so he had to have noticed. That banter with Ramiris made me think he was pretty chill, but I definitely shouldn’t put my guard down. Given the rapport he seemed to have with Ramiris, though, I hoped I didn’t have to make him my enemy.</p>
<p class="space-break">The next one through the door was the empress of the harpies, the demon lord Frey. Milim told me about her, and let me tell you, she was <em>explosively</em> erotic. I wondered how she flew with those breasts; they must generate a ton of wind resistance.</p>
<p>…Oops. My mind’s going off track. But can you blame me? That was just the sheer impact of her appearance.</p>
<p>Once she stepped inside, her eyes turned first to Milim’s empty seat and then to me. Even the way she turned her head was mesmerizing. I mean, come on… And when she passed by, oh, what a wonderful aroma she had on her.</p>
<p>As I basked in this, I felt something sinister behind my back. Shion was clearly peeved. Must’ve noticed I was letting that perfume get the best of me. <em>Well spotted, Shion.</em> Riling her any further was too scary a concept to entertain, so I reset my mind and got back to business.</p>
<p>Her magicule count wasn’t anything to write home about—maybe smaller than Shion’s or Benimaru’s. Of course, Shion could probably line up well with Valentine at this point, so I’m not saying it was <em>that</em> tiny. Quality, not quantity. It’d be foolish to judge on this alone. In terms of chest size, meanwhile, it was really hard to pick a winner— <em>Oops. Better not think about that.</em></p>
<p>If I had to guess, maybe she had a lot of hidden skills? That was the kind of concerning vibe I got.</p>
<p>What <em>was</em> worth noting were her attendants. One was another big-breasted harpy, on the same level as Frey. She was young, and her body was about as lascivious as they come. The other was a large man, his magical energy on par with Frey’s. He had huge, eagle-like wings sprouting from his back, so he must’ve been a male harpy. He was a measure smaller than Daggrull but otherwise could give Valentine a run for his money in muscles and good looks, although the lion mask on his face made the latter part unclear.</p>
<p>Wait. Lion?</p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1">Report. According to my analysis and assessment—</span></p>
<p class="space-break">Yeah. No way, right? I mean, this guy felt totally different from Carillon. It had to be some other guy. I didn’t need Raphael to spell it out for me. I’m not <em>that</em> dumb.</p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1">……</span></p>
<p class="space-break">There was no way the AWOL Carillon would attend Walpurgis with such an obvious ploy. He’d be more careful with it, taking pains to act prudently. They say there are at least three people in the world who look exactly like you, and I’m sure that’s the story with this guy, too.</p>
<p class="space-break">As I observed them, I was struck by the odd feeling that a chilly wind was blowing over me. I turned to find a blond-haired beauty coming in, blessed with looks that only the gods themselves could have given her. She walked right up to me.</p>
<p>“…You are Rimuru?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but—”</p>
<p>I thought about saying “Yeah, but who’re you?” at first. I definitely didn’t know her—but then it dawned on me. There were four demon lords left. Carillon was missing, and that just left Clayman, Milim, and Leon. <em>Leon was blond-haired, I think, and beautiful enough that people called him the Platinum Devil… Hmm…</em></p>
<p>“…Oh, you’re Leon? Did you need something?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am Leon. And no, I need nothing from you. The sight of you brought back some memories, is all.”</p>
<p>It <em>was</em> him. He was beautiful, so much so that you could easily mistake him for a woman. In my past life, I probably would’ve been jealous enough to wish for him to get hit by a truck. He was formerly human, I was told, but kept a majestic presence about him—the majesty of a demon lord.</p>
<p>And I brought back “memories”? I suppose my face was essentially Shizu’s at a young age. So Leon must have—</p>
<p>“Shizu’s dead, Leon.”</p>
<p>Seeing me simply conjured up old memories of Shizu in his mind.</p>
<p>“I know,” he coldly stated. “And of course she would be. She took in Ifrit but refused to become a magic-born.”</p>
<p>“She asked me to punch you out for her. Mind letting me do that?”</p>
<p>I just kind of blurted it out. I wasn’t trying to start stuff; I just didn’t like how Leon was talking about her. It was maybe a little too direct, but Leon handled it with calm composure.</p>
<p>“No, thank you. I wanted her to live as a human being. I even gave her Ifrit as a farewell gift. I see no reason why I deserve a beating for it.”</p>
<p>What a disappointment. I figured he’d be enraged, but he just calmly fired back at me.</p>
<p>“…But I <em>do</em> have a bit of an interest in you. If you have an issue with me, I’ll happily invite you to come visit. You can turn down the offer, of course, if you think it’s a trap.”</p>
<p>Talk about a one-sided deal. He was basically daring me to chicken out. I had to accept it.</p>
<p>“All right. I’ll do that. Feel free to send an invitation, if you get around to it.”</p>
<p>I didn’t say anything more after that.</p>
<p>Leon nodded, looking a little annoyed. “I will. Assuming you walk out of this meeting hall alive, that is.”</p>
<p>With that blunt rejoinder, Leon settled down in the seat just to my left. It was his way of saying our conversation was over. For now, I was fine with that. I got to tell him about Shizu, and I now knew that Leon wasn’t out to antagonize me. At least not here at the Council. He wouldn’t have said yes to that invitation thing if he was.</p>
<p>Maybe it was just postponing the dispute for later, but right now, I wanted to focus on Clayman as my enemy.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">These proceedings all unfolded in the hour after we reached the meeting hall at midnight. It looked like the older demon lords had been guided in first, with me getting a head start because I happened to be traveling with Ramiris. It wasn’t any official rule, though, given that people like Leon could travel here themselves.</p>
<p>All that remained were Clayman and Milim. And just when I thought the Council was about to begin, Benimaru tossed a Thought Communication my way.</p>
<p>(Sir Rimuru, may I brief you for a moment?)</p>
<p>This hall seemed like it was in another dimension of sorts, but I guess this link with Benimaru still worked?</p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1">Understood. A soul circuit has been established with the monsters under your command. The link is using this to allow your conscious to interact with them.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em>Oh. That sort of thing?</em></p>
<p>I guess this soul circuit got hooked up with the gifts I handed out to everyone for my evolution. It didn’t seem as robust as the connection I had with Veldora, but it was good enough for talking, at least.</p>
<p>So I asked what was up. Apparently, the battle ended less than an hour after it began—incredibly lopsided and pretty much as we planned it. Our side had numerous casualties but no deaths. Clayman’s forces had at least a thousand killed in action and over three thousand wounded. That was fewer deaths than I expected, but in this world where you can always get healed as long as you stayed alive, that much was a given.</p>
<p>Still, that was a massive, overwhelming victory. We managed to take some prisoners as well, so I couldn’t ask for much more.</p>
<p class="space-break">Yamza, the enemy commander, had turned into Charybdis for some strange reason, but Benimaru was kind enough to vaporize the guy for me. Apparently. I’m not really sure what all that meant, so I just kind of glossed over it for now.</p>
<p>…Or I wanted to. But how did he deal with Charybdis’s Magic Interference?</p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1">Understood. A number of Arts and skills combined with the unique skill Born Leader allowed him full control over Hellflare.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">Aha. So he used control beyond what Magic Interference could handle to hit it with a direct, massive wave of heat. Easy for me to say, but that has to require a hell of a lot of talent. Benimaru’s gotten stronger than I even imagined. Pretty hot stuff.</p>
<p class="space-break">One factor we didn’t expect was the Dragon Faithful. They were reportedly a pretty formidable fighting force, as you’d expect from Milim’s followers. We didn’t lose anyone to them because they weren’t really out there seeking to kill…but I guess it was my bad for not thinking about them. I figured a force of a hundred-odd was no big deal, but I was wrong. Wars in this world depended more on the powers of a few than the many, but my conventional wisdom from my old world was making me forget that.</p>
<p>Lucky thing that didn’t result in any major breakdowns. I’d have to be more careful next time.</p>
<p class="space-break">Based on Benimaru’s report, we had a general idea of Clayman’s story.</p>
<p>The force led by Yamza was marching on the pretext of investigating Carillon’s betrayal. They wanted to collect evidence that he backstabbed the other demon lords, killed one of Clayman’s top leaders, and was connected to me. Well, not <em>collect</em>. More like <em>concoct</em>.</p>
<p>With our victory today, that line was cut off. I didn’t know what kind of excuses he would come up with here, but I didn’t imagine they would be well received by any other demon lord. Of course, I intended to kill off Clayman in the end, and I was prepared to do the same to anyone who got in my way. <em>Let’s just try to steer this so I’d secure victory here in the easiest way possible.</em></p>
<p><em>I’ll be counting on you, Raphael!</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1">……</span></p>
<p class="space-break">Raphael’s rarin’ to go, too. That’s a relief.</p>
<p class="space-break">Whoops, here’s another report from Soei. Sounds like they’ve captured Clayman’s headquarters. Man, there is just no mercy with that guy. Hakuro pitched in a hell of an effort, too, but apparently Shuna shined the brightest in the fight.</p>
<p>Also, it turns out that I now have an army of undead for some reason? I sort of missed the plot on that, and Soei was being oddly vague about the whole thing, simply stating “Lady Shuna will explain the details later.”</p>
<p>The most important thing, though, was that Carillon wasn’t being held in Clayman’s castle. Plus:</p>
<p>(—We discovered the castle’s treasury, so we’ve called upon Geld to begin the transport process. The room included some evidence linking Clayman to the Moderate Jesters, which I think should help your case.)</p>
<p><em>Wow. No mercy. We’re even pillaging Clayman’s treasure vault. That doesn’t count as theft, does it? Oh, well. No point sweating the small stuff. We’ll just call it collecting damages for all the trouble Clayman gave us. There’s reportedly a lot, which should help our own budget out greatly.</em></p>
<p>More important, however, was that dossier of evidence. Benimaru had sent some over for me, and Soei had discovered some more. All of it was now safely received in my Stomach, and with it, I should be able to shut down the basis for any excuse he comes up with. It’d be important to make myself look good around here.</p>
<p class="space-break">So, much quicker than I expected, we had thoroughly and completely crushed Clayman’s force. It’d remain to be seen how he’d approach this Council, but let’s try using these developments to my advantage.</p>
<p>…And then, just as I finished reading the reports, Clayman finally appeared before me.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw10">
<div class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">He was more handsome than I pictured him—and high-strung. His clothing looked expensive, and I suppose he placed a lot of importance on his appearance, because he was sporting a whole array of Unique equipment that would make him a more-than-decent fighter. It certainly befitted his image as a demon lord not to be trifled with.</p>
<p>What struck me the most, however, was the fox he was carrying in his arms. It was packed to the gills with magicules and mystical force, maybe even up to demon lord levels. That was one of his attendants, and I suppose a demon lord’s servants had to be pretty damn powerful, too.</p>
<p>That, and I tried running an Analyze and Assess on him, and something interesting caught my eye there. I didn’t want to coast on this just because we had occupied his HQ. It was important to finish him off <em>right</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway, Milim followed behind him, completing the night’s attendee list.</p>
<p>All were real monsters, ready to burn you at a moment’s notice. Doing the A and A once-over on Leon produced nothing useful, either. It was kind of funny, seeing Raphael say that it couldn’t analyze something. It meant he had an ultimate skill of his own, something on the same level as mine.</p>
<p>Then I made a realization. Guy had let me read fake info, but was that his way of fending off ultimate skills? If I couldn’t use my ultimate to analyze something, it meant the target had an ultimate, too. That may be why he was feeding me a bunch of nonsense instead—I just happened to know it was fake nonsense because Raphael was smart enough to see that. If it hadn’t noticed, I could easily have been tricked.</p>
<p>This meant, of course, that Guy had an ultimate skill as well. I suspected Milus (?) did, too, and Leon definitely did. An ultimate was several orders of magnitude more powerful than a unique skill requiring an intersection of one’s attributes, luck, and a plethora of incidental conditions. They were rare—uncommon enough that even a true, awakened demon lord may not have one, and all were great as a last-resort ace in the hole.</p>
<p>That was why I needed to be extra careful here. That, and—<em>ugh</em>—it was safe to assume Guy knew I possessed an ultimate now. Big mistake. My lack of experience playing this game screwed me there. I was dealing with some of the orneriest demon lords out there; I should’ve been more on the alert.</p>
<p>Still, what’s done is done. It wasn’t a lethal mistake, either. I just needed to figure out how to deal with it. It’s easy to hide mind-reading skills, just as Gazel did. Guy still didn’t know what <em>type</em> of skill I had, so I probably didn’t need to be too hung up about it. Hell, I could even use this to make them think I’m a fool. To be exact, I would direct Raphael to hide everything at all costs, but maybe show off one ultimate skill that was okay to reveal as my trump card. That way, I could still keep a few cards hidden at all times, right?</p>
<p>It was a gutsy bit of subterfuge, but I was safe in pulling it off with the four ultimate skills I enjoyed. I was planning on kicking up one hell of a storm in the upcoming battle against Clayman anyway, which would make the debut of—</p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1">Suggestion. Hiding Belzebuth, Lord of Gluttony would be difficult.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">Yeah, I think you’re right. It was a great offensive and defensive weapon, capable of consuming and destroying nearly any attack thrown at it. Predation was a pretty core battle tactic for me, so revealing Belzebuth seemed like a good idea. Let’s go with that as my main battle weapon, keeping my other skills hidden until otherwise needed.</p>
<p>I suppose I’m glad that I noticed the need for something like this early on. If I got out of here safely, I’d need to rethink my battle tactics a little. No point being reluctant to use my skills if it wound up killing me.</p>
<p class="space-break">After that moment of regret, I saw one of the most amazing sights of my life.</p>
<p>“Move it, you half-wit!”</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, Clayman closed-fist <em>punched</em> Milim. <em>That</em> Milim.</p>
<p>“Sit yourself down, you stupid dunce,” he said, ruthlessly bossing her around. I thought I’d explode in anger, but I held it in. <em>Not yet. Just a bit longer. I have to hold back until I have the chance to declare it all, following the rules.</em></p>
<p>But what on earth happened to Milim? Milim the Destroyer? If it was Clayman being punched, well, that’d just be Milim being Milim. But this? <em>Oh, man, I fear for his safety…</em></p>
<p>…and yet, despite this bout of violence, Clayman didn’t look like he’d be decapitated anytime soon. Milim did nothing to resist or complain about his treatment. She just followed his orders and sat at her seat.</p>
<p><em>This is</em> weird<em>. Is she under his control after all? I may have to consider the worst-case scenario here.</em> And to add insult to injury, some of the other demon lords, Daggrull and Deeno included, were looking similarly flummoxed at this. Guy was stone-faced; I don’t know what he was thinking.</p>
<p>Clayman, meanwhile, was looking like he was king of the world, his superiority complex written all over his face. It made my anger burn all over again… <em>Don’t expect your death to be an easy one, Clayman. You’ll pay for hitting my friend.</em></p>
<p>And with that oath to myself, Clayman’s death was now set in stone. I had no intention of forgiving him, no matter the excuse. But there was no need for panic. The Council had only just begun.</p>
<p class="space-break">The event was attended by a total of nine people, minus Carillon:</p>
<p class="ul_f">“Lord of Darkness” Guy Crimson (demon)</p>
<p class="ul_m">“Destroyer” Milim Nava (dragonoid)</p>
<p class="ul_m">“Labyrinth Master” Ramiris (pixie)</p>
<p class="ul_m">“Earthquake” Daggrull (giant)</p>
<p class="ul_m">“Bloody Lord” Roy Valentine (vampire)</p>
<p class="ul_m">“Sleeping Ruler” Deeno (fallen)</p>
<p class="ul_m">“Sky Queen” Frey (harpy)</p>
<p class="ul_m">“Marionette Master” Clayman (walking dead)</p>
<p class="ul_l">“Platinum Saber” Leon Cromwell (ex-human)</p>
<p class="space-break">…And then, me—the subject of this Council, the slime who’d dare call himself demon lord.</p>
<p class="space-break">Raine, the maid in Guy’s service, made all the above introductions in her clear, loud voice.</p>
<p>Leon was the one who piqued my interest the most. I seem to remember his nickname being the Platinum Devil, but now he was acting all cool and calling himself the Platinum Saber. He certainly looked more the part of a dashing swordsman, but who thought up these nicknames anyway? They didn’t make them up themselves, did they? <em>…Well, I probably shouldn’t comment, given my track record for naming things. Let’s let that topic die on the vine.</em></p>
<p class="space-break">After the intros ended, Clayman stood up as the host.</p>
<p>“All right. First, thanks to all of you for answering my invitation and coming here. It is now time to begin our festival! I hereby declare this Walpurgis Council convened!”</p>
<p>Thus, with the chance for cataclysmic events electrifying the air around us, the event kicked off.</p>

<p class="tx1">Taking advantage of his position as chairman, Clayman started things off by going into a speech, eyeing all of us in order and looking supremely satisfied with himself. His eyes stopped for just a moment when they reached Valentine, but maybe I imagined it—that’s got nothing to do with me anyway.</p>
<p>Leon was seated to my left; the chair on my right was empty, and to its right were Clayman’s and the absent Carillon’s seats.</p>
<p>Clayman went on for a while, explaining matters with an obvious sense of pride, and I diligently listened to all of it. Here’s the executive summary:</p>
<p class="bl_f">• The demon lord Carillon enticed me into declaring myself a demon lord. This allegation is backed up by the fact that Carillon’s armies are stationed in our town.</p>
<p class="bl_m">• He then incited the kingdom of Farmus into attacking the Great Forest of Jura, requesting my cooperation to fend them off and using that as an excuse to meddle with human nations.</p>
<p class="bl_l">• After defeating Farmus, I assumed the title of demon lord, enjoying Carillon’s support behind the scenes.</p>
<p class="space-break">This kind of unauthorized collusion violated the demon lords’ agreements.</p>
<p>He was better prepared to make this argument than I gave him credit for. It was all a bunch of nonsense, totally ignoring the actual timeline of events, but proving that would be difficult. All of this happened at the same time as the demon lords withdrew from their mutual nonaggression agreement for the Forest of Jura, and (as he bluntly put it) there was no excusing that. As if, you know, I cared about that.</p>
<p>“…That is the testimony I have received from Mjurran, one of my advisers. However, upon briefing me about this, she was murdered— by that fool over there, Rimuru. Thus, I decided to exact my revenge.”</p>
<p><em>What is he, a thespian? If not, he missed his calling. He almost convinced me, even… Almost. I mean, Mjurran’s pretty alive right now.</em></p>
<p>“Rimuru was conspiring with Carillon to make an attempt upon my life. And with her last gasps of breath, Mjurran sent me a magical missive to inform me of the plot.”</p>
<p>He paused a moment, pretending to be overcome with emotion. His handsome looks certainly made it a moving sight, but it mostly served to rankle my nerves.</p>
