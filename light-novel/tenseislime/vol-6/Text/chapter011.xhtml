<p class="cotx"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">The impossibly ornate door connected right to the meeting hall.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">A large, round table was positioned in the center, with twelve evenly spaced chairs surrounding it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">Ten demon lords were on the invite list (with Carillon absent), so two of these seats would be empty even if I took up one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">Attendees sat in chronological order of their demon lord appointment, and so I was placed right in front of the door—not that I minded. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.4">My attention was focused in the room around me anyway.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">On an occasion like this, I wanted to observe my new colleagues as much as possible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">Of course, there were only two people here right now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">One was Ramiris, at the seat of honor way on the other side. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">She was seated and kicking her legs around, having a whale of a time, like a kid on a car trip. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.5">I figured I could ignore her.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">No, my attention was on her right, at the seat directly facing me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">There I saw a man with bewitchingly attractive red hair. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">A man, definitely, but there was more than a touch of femininity to his dashing good looks. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">His eyes were shut, but I doubted he was napping.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">One look was all I needed to know: This dude was trouble. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">Analyze and Assess seemed to suggest that he wasn’t any big deal, but my sixth sense was giving me the eeriest vibes with him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">At first glance, he seemed like an inexperienced kid, kind of magically strong but unable to control his aura. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.4">Without the Great Sage’s analytical skills, I might’ve been tricked—that was how crafty he was at hiding his true self, feeding the people around him misinformation and making them underestimate his true skills. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.5">We hadn’t even started fighting yet, and the battle was already under way.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">It made me recall the mind-reading skills of Gazel, the dwarf king. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">Kind of like my Great Sage, nobody would know you had that skill unless you told them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">It wouldn’t be until someone tried it on you that you’d notice it, I think, unless it was a mind reading that went really deep into your psyche to avoid that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4">As long as my latent resistance didn’t fail me, I was pretty sure I’d be okay.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">As a result of this, hiding your skills was very important. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">You could also bluff people into thinking you had certain skills or deliberately mess up a skill to make them think you were inept to wield it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">There were all kinds of ways to play with your opponents’ minds, and that was exactly what this pretty boy was doing—tricking other people’s Analyze and Assess skills to mess around with them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">My idea had always been to hide my powers, keep my aura turned down as long as possible, and give the enemy zero information to work with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">This guy, meanwhile, was using his rivals’ data-gathering skills against them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">It was a sort of screening process. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.4">He was, in effect, asking his foes “Do you have the power to read me?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.5">If they didn’t, they were out of the picture; if they did, he’d gauge their response. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.6">If the fake info he planted into their minds was enough to scare them off, they weren’t worth dealing with in the first place—but if you </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1"> notice his trick, that glance at the sheer depths of his powers would make you unable to resist him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">But think of it like this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">Even the data he </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">wanted</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1"> you to know about indicated that he had as much magical force as Carillon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">There was no way to guess how much he actually had. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">Even if you understood his game, it was hard not to let it unnerve you a bit.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">This was Guy, and he was clearly on a whole other level.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">By the time I was done examining Guy, a large man lumbered into the room, bringing only one guest with him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">This was Daggrull, the demon lord giant whose overwhelming presence dominated any room he was in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">He immediately walked up and slammed himself into a seat at Guy’s right, kicking back and putting his feet up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.4">The empty space between them must’ve belonged to Milim, indicating that the table divided demon lords into two halves based on their order, with Guy on one end and me on the other.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">I turned my eyes to him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">Guy was a tall figure himself, but Daggrull was enormous, not to mention comfy-looking in his specially made chair. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">Even something like this chair was an opulent-looking magical item. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.4">This was Veldora’s favorite rival, and the magic with which he presented himself definitely signaled to me that he could take on a dragon type.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">Plus, the amount of magicule energy on him was just ridiculous. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">Was that higher or lower than Veldora’s? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">It seemed bottomless to me, but it’d be hard to accurately measure unless I fought him for real. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.4">Still, quality beat quantity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.5">Just because he had a bunch of magicules on hand didn’t make him seem that scary to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.6">The key was how well he used them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.7">Differences in skill level were a vital aspect of any fight, of course, and a demon lord like Daggrull couldn’t be </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1"> unskilled. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">I suppose I’ll need to watch out for him, too.</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Now another one came in, a handsome, muscle-bound man decked out in some real fancy-looking threads. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">He was tall, if not as tall as Daggrull, and his facial features looked like they’d been chiseled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">His short, curly blond hair looked wild on his scalp, perhaps representing his violent personality. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.4">To put it simply, he had Hollywood good looks, and he knew how to charm people.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">I suppose, of course, the thing that stuck out the most were the two fangs visible from his lips. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">He must’ve been the demon lord Valentine, the vampire. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">He sat to Ramiris’s left, so in terms of the seat order, he must’ve been about as old as Daggrull—that, or perhaps he just took over for whoever he replaced. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.4">Not that seat assignments mattered that much.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">What struck me more were the pair Valentine brought with him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">One was an elderly man, kind of a manservant type. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">Definitely well-trained, unmoving and statuesque. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.4">His aura was restrained, revealing nothing—the same strategy I used. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.5">The second one, meanwhile, was an eye-catchingly beautiful silver-haired girl who seemed to shine like the sun. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.6">Her skin was pale, and she had one red eye and one blue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.7">There was something oddly eerie about this girl, who appeared to be on the cusp of adulthood and was clad in a maid-style dress. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.8">Maid dresses are like battle uniforms, as they say, and it wouldn’t be odd for this girl to be pretty strong.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">And these two were both working for this guy? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">That’s a surprise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">The girl, in particular, was just letting her gigantic aura out all over the place. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">But—hang on.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1"> When our eyes met, I was struck by the most uncomfortable feeling. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">Maybe I was imagining it, but it seemed like she was changing the nature of her aura at random.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">Understood. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">Analyze and Assess indicates that the target likely bears more magicules than the demon lord Valentine.</span></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">Ah, I knew it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">I couldn’t read her overall energy count, but it’s higher than Valentine’s, the guy she’s serving.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1"> It was very cleverly concealed—if you didn’t have an ultimate skill like mine, you’d never spot it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">But again, they weren’t really intent on hiding it—like Guy, they wanted to assess you, see whether you spotted it or not.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">Could this girl be the </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">real</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1"> demon lord? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Or perhaps the previous holder of this seat, the demon lord that retired out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">Maybe this is that “Milus,” the vampiress that even Veldora had high praise for. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.4">The changeover happened more than 1,500 years ago, so perhaps not too many demon lords knew about that—or did but were keeping mum about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.5">Or didn’t care. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.6">Either way, better be careful.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Valentine, the current demon lord, was no pushover himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">He had a heroic sort of ambition, even more than an untransformed Carillon, so there was no reason to doubt his strength. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">And if that wasn’t enough, she had that freaky girl with her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.4">If it was her domain that got burned to ash, it wouldn’t be strange for her to despise Veldora at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.5">I resisted the urge to yell “Why’d you have to piss </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1"> lady off?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">At least there was one saving grace—who wouldn’t mind dying by the hand of such a beautiful figure? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">(Quite a few people, I imagine, but…) </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">I’ll just have to hope she doesn’t learn about Veldora and me—or if she does, that I don’t have to clean up the mess.</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">After a little while, the fifth person showed up—this one a loner, almost sleepwalking to his post. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">He had two swords on his belt, but that’s it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">Not much of an arsenal. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.4">I got a quick glance at his eyes; they were light blue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.5">His hair was a very dark shade of purple with silver streaks in it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.6">He still looked young to me, maybe even high-school age, and he had well-defined facial features, although they were spoiled by his sleepy eyes and general listlessness.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">He stopped by Ramiris’s seat to say hello. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">“Yo. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">Man, you’re still, like, the size of a bug, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">“Oh, you trying to start a fight with me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">Like you could even handle me, Deeno.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">So person number five was Deeno. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">He definitely seemed cut from the same cloth as her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">Neither was seriously riled; they seemed to just be screwing with each other.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“Why would I need to, dumbass? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">Like, it’s totally obvious who would win.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“Pfft! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">I didn’t realize you were in </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1"> much of a hurry to die. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">I’m in perfect physical form today, I’ll have you know!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“Uh-huh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">Hey, haven’t you shrunk since last time I saw you?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“What do you </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">want</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1"> from me?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">I only just got reborn recently!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">“I know,” he coldly stated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">“And of course she would be. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.3">She took in Ifrit but refused to become a magic-born.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">“She asked me to punch you out for her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">Mind letting me do that?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">I just kind of blurted it out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">I wasn’t trying to start stuff; I just didn’t like how Leon was talking about her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.3">It was maybe a little too direct, but Leon handled it with calm composure.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">“No, thank you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">I wanted her to live as a human being. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.3">I even gave her Ifrit as a farewell gift. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.4">I see no reason why I deserve a beating for it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">What a disappointment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">I figured he’d be enraged, but he just calmly fired back at me.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">Talk about a one-sided deal. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">He was basically daring me to chicken out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.3">I had to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">I’ll do that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.3">Feel free to send an invitation, if you get around to it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">I didn’t say anything more after that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">Leon nodded, looking a little annoyed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">“I will. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.3">Assuming you walk out of this meeting hall alive, that is.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">With that blunt rejoinder, Leon settled down in the seat just to my left. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">It was his way of saying our conversation was over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.3">For now, I was fine with that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.4">I got to tell him about Shizu, and I now knew that Leon wasn’t out to antagonize me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.5">At least not here at the Council. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.6">He wouldn’t have said yes to that invitation thing if he was.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">Maybe it was just postponing the dispute for later, but right now, I wanted to focus on Clayman as my enemy.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">This hall seemed like it was in another dimension of sorts, but I guess this link with Benimaru still worked?</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">I guess this soul circuit got hooked up with the gifts I handed out to everyone for my evolution. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.2">It didn’t seem as robust as the connection I had with Veldora, but it was good enough for talking, at least.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">So I asked what was up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">Apparently, the battle ended less than an hour after it began—incredibly lopsided and pretty much as we planned it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.3">Our side had numerous casualties but no deaths. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.4">Clayman’s forces had at least a thousand killed in action and over three thousand wounded. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.5">That was fewer deaths than I expected, but in this world where you can always get healed as long as you stayed alive, that much was a given.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">Still, that was a massive, overwhelming victory. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.2">We managed to take some prisoners as well, so I couldn’t ask for much more.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">Yamza, the enemy commander, had turned into Charybdis for some strange reason, but Benimaru was kind enough to vaporize the guy for me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">Apparently. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.3">I’m not really sure what all that meant, so I just kind of glossed over it for now.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">Understood. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.2">A number of Arts and skills combined with the unique skill Born Leader allowed him full control over Hellflare.</span></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">Aha. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">So he used control beyond what Magic Interference could handle to hit it with a direct, massive wave of heat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.3">Easy for me to say, but that has to require a hell of a lot of talent. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.4">Benimaru’s gotten stronger than I even imagined. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.5">Pretty hot stuff.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">One factor we didn’t expect was the Dragon Faithful. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.2">They were reportedly a pretty formidable fighting force, as you’d expect from Milim’s followers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.3">We didn’t lose anyone to them because they weren’t really out there seeking to kill…but I guess it was my bad for not thinking about them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.4">I figured a force of a hundred-odd was no big deal, but I was wrong. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.5">Wars in this world depended more on the powers of a few than the many, but my conventional wisdom from my old world was making me forget that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">Lucky thing that didn’t result in any major breakdowns. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.2">I’d have to be more careful next time.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">Based on Benimaru’s report, we had a general idea of Clayman’s story.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">The most important thing, though, was that Carillon wasn’t being held in Clayman’s castle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">Plus:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">(—We discovered the castle’s treasury, so we’ve called upon Geld to begin the transport process. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">The room included some evidence linking Clayman to the Moderate Jesters, which I think should help your case.)</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">More important, however, was that dossier of evidence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.2">Benimaru had sent some over for me, and Soei had discovered some more. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.3">All of it was now safely received in my Stomach, and with it, I should be able to shut down the basis for any excuse he comes up with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.4">It’d be important to make myself look good around here.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">Then I made a realization. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">Guy had let me read fake info, but was that his way of fending off ultimate skills? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.3">If I couldn’t use my ultimate to analyze something, it meant the target had an ultimate, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.4">That may be why he was feeding me a bunch of nonsense instead—I just happened to know it was fake nonsense because Raphael was smart enough to see that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.5">If it hadn’t noticed, I could easily have been tricked.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">This meant, of course, that Guy had an ultimate skill as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.2">I suspected Milus (?) did, too, and Leon definitely did. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.3">An ultimate was several orders of magnitude more powerful than a unique skill requiring an intersection of one’s attributes, luck, and a plethora of incidental conditions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.4">They were rare—uncommon enough that even a true, awakened demon lord may not have one, and all were great as a last-resort ace in the hole.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">That was why I needed to be extra careful here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.2">That, and—</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">ugh</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">—it was safe to assume Guy knew I possessed an ultimate now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.2">Big mistake. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.3">My lack of experience playing this game screwed me there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.4">I was dealing with some of the orneriest demon lords out there; I should’ve been more on the alert.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">It was a gutsy bit of subterfuge, but I was safe in pulling it off with the four ultimate skills I enjoyed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.2">I was planning on kicking up one hell of a storm in the upcoming battle against Clayman anyway, which would make the debut of—</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">I suppose I’m glad that I noticed the need for something like this early on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.2">If I got out of here safely, I’d need to rethink my battle tactics a little. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.3">No point being reluctant to use my skills if it wound up killing me.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">Clayman went on for a while, explaining matters with an obvious sense of pride, and I diligently listened to all of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.2">Here’s the executive summary:</span></p>
<p class="bl_f"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">• The demon lord Carillon enticed me into declaring myself a demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.2">This allegation is backed up by the fact that Carillon’s armies are stationed in our town.</span></p>
<p class="bl_m"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">• He then incited the kingdom of Farmus into attacking the Great Forest of Jura, requesting my cooperation to fend them off and using that as an excuse to meddle with human nations.</span></p>
<p class="bl_l"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">• After defeating Farmus, I assumed the title of demon lord, enjoying Carillon’s support behind the scenes.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">This kind of unauthorized collusion violated the demon lords’ agreements.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">He was better prepared to make this argument than I gave him credit for. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.2">It was all a bunch of nonsense, totally ignoring the actual timeline of events, but proving that would be difficult. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.3">All of this happened at the same time as the demon lords withdrew from their mutual nonaggression agreement for the Forest of Jura, and (as he bluntly put it) there was no excusing that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.4">As if, you know, I cared about that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">“…That is the testimony I have received from Mjurran, one of my advisers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.2">However, upon briefing me about this, she was murdered— by that fool over there, Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.3">Thus, I decided to exact my revenge.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">“Rimuru was conspiring with Carillon to make an attempt upon my life. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.2">And with her last gasps of breath, Mjurran sent me a magical missive to inform me of the plot.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">He paused a moment, pretending to be overcome with emotion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.2">His handsome looks certainly made it a moving sight, but it mostly served to rankle my nerves.</span></p>
