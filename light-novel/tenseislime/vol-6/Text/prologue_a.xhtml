<p class="cotx"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“Hoo dear, nearly bit it for good back there…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Laplace was muttering to himself as he appeared before his master. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">He clearly had the injuries to back that assessment up.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">“Tough, huh?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">casually replied his lord, a boy with black hair and a powerful presence.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">“Well, hang on there, lad,” Laplace whined. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">“</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Tough</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1"> hardly even begins to describe what I had to wade through back there, yeah? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">Getting inside was painful enough, but getting </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">out</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">—oh, dear, who can say how many times I toed the line?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">“Oh, I think someone like you would work it out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">Even if someone killed you, I’m not sure you’d even know </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">how</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1"> to die.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">“Oof. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">You’re a mean one, you know that?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">“So,” the boy aloofly continued as Laplace cried the best fake tears he could, “did you find out what lies behind the Western Holy Church?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“…Um. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">I know this ain’t the kind of report I should be giving, but… Well, no. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">Nobody can. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.4">It’s bloody impossible, is what it is.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">This stone-faced admission didn’t faze the boy at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">He gave a soft smile, as if he expected that reply the whole time.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">“Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">Ever the liar, aren’t you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">You had to have uncovered a hint or two, at least?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">Laplace shrugged and sighed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">“Sheesh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">After all I went through for my info, I figured I could name my price with ya. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.4">But you just see right through me, don’tcha? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.5">There’s no beating ya.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“Hee-hee-hee. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">Thanks for the compliment, but my prices remain firm, all right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“There’s no beating ya,” Laplace repeated.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“Oh, no need for complaints. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">I’ll pay your full asking price. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">And in fact, our demon lord friend’s consciousness has taken root for a while now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.4">He’s done a wonderful job transferring over to his homunculus.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">The boy gave Laplace an amused smile as he rang a small bell to call for the woman stationed outside the door.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“Yes, sir?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Into the room strode a beautiful woman—graceful, polite, the epitome of the classic executive secretary. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">Her skin was smooth, light in color, and her well-defined facial features suited the bun her blond hair was tied back in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">She had blue eyes that shined like a pair of mystical lapis lazuli—but no matter how mesmerizing the light from them was, they still couldn’t hide a vague sense of evil lurking inside.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“Huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">Ah, you don’t mean…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">The sight of the woman startled Laplace, but he could spot a familiar glint in her eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Then he erupted into laughter, realizing who she truly was.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“Well, what’s with </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1"> getup, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">Didja make a gender swap while I didn’t notice? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">It looks good on you, I ain’t gonna lie, but it couldn’t be much </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">more</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1"> different from before, eh?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">“Enough from you,” countered the woman, ignoring Laplace’s bait. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">“It took me ten years to obtain a body I could freely move around in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">I am not going to complain about minor grievances.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“Polite” was no longer the way to describe her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">She stood boldly, sporting an undefeatable grin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">She gave Laplace a friendly pat on the shoulder before sitting down.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“So if you’re introducing me to this man, I suppose there’s not much need to keep the act going?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“No,” replied the boy, “but I’d like you to maintain the facade in public, please. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">If it’s just between us, I suppose there’s no great need, no.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“Oh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">Well, if that’s what you want, boss, I’ll do it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">Is it all right if I ask why?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“Because you’re weak, Kazalim. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Your powers still aren’t complete yet, are they? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">Just watch over Clayman until your full Curse Lord force is back with you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">Kazalim, the woman posing as his secretary, gave this reply a sullen nod. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">She had the name of a very old demon lord—the one who attempted to punish a human named Leon for declaring himself a demon lord of some faraway backwater area and paid for it with his life. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3">Once, he was head of the Moderate Jesters; now, she was a lord both Clayman and Laplace were attempting to resurrect.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Her overpowering strength was long gone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">All that remained was a prim, graceful young woman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">Just before she could be obliterated from existence, Kazalim experienced a rather unlikely series of coincidences that caused her to possess the body of this boy—and just the other day, they had finally managed to transfer her astral body into a replacement homunculus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.4">The boy was her “boss” for now, the power from her glory days long gone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.5">That was the way their pact worked, and Kazalim had no quarrel with it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.6">Over the past ten years of dealing with this acquaintance, she had fully accepted her place in the power hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“Fair enough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">My power </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">is</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1"> incomplete. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">I let that demon lord Leon defeat me, and I lost my body in the most unsightly of fashions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">I know my soul’s settled in this homunculus, but it’s so fragile, I’d tear it apart if I unleashed my full force. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.4">I can’t really call this a </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">complete</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1"> resurrection…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“Ah, is </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1"> the issue with ya? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">Well, if our president is callin’ this guy boss, then I guess you’re </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">my</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1"> boss, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Sure ain’t just another client by this point, no! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">So hopefully you don’t mind if I clear the air with you guys a bit.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“You never change,” the boy said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">“After all this time, and after you helped us revive our fallen president, you still don’t trust me?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">“Ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">Nah, nah, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">that’s</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1"> a different story. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">But I gotta laugh at how you look now, sir. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">You’re this crazy beautiful woman now!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">“…Am I? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">What do my looks matter?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">“Nah, I mean, the dichotomy between your speech and your looks… It’s funny, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">“I </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">know</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1"> that, you… Or ‘I am aware of that,’ perhaps? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">If I am going to keep up the charade, I had best sound more like the lady I am.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">“Uh, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">that’s</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1"> what you’re concerned about? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">Because, I mean… Ba-ha-ha-ha!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">“Silence,” Kazalim spat at the guffawing Laplace. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">“I’ll have you know this body wasn’t my choice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.3">The boss here provided a homunculus modified with special technology from the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">“Yeah, I sure did. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">And that didn’t come cheap, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.3">We needed a vessel without any soul at all, or else they’d get all mixed up, and the transplant probably wouldn’t have worked.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.4">The boy sneered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.5">“For that matter, if you had fled into anyone besides me, Kazalim, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">you’d</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1"> probably be too tangled up to split off at all, I don’t think. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">All right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.3">So I really don’t want to hear any complaints about how you look.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">“I appreciate it, boss,” said Kazalim.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">The boy still didn’t seem pleased, not until Laplace offered his own thanks.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">“Sure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">So can we move this along? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.3">I know it’s great we’re all back together again, but I want to get down to business. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.4">Tell me what you’ve found, Laplace.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">The smile disappeared from Kazalim’s face as she turned her eyes toward Laplace. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">He nodded, taking a more serious demeanor.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">“Yeah, you kept yer promise and made my dream come true. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">I better show you a little sincerity, too, eh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">So I infiltrated the Western Holy Church to find out what’s behind it, but I tell you, I just don’t have any idea.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">He then began to describe his findings.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Laplace’s mission was to find out what made the Holy Church tick. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">It remained an independent religion, headquartered in the Holy Empire of Lubelius, but much of its internal workings remained a mystery. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.3">It positioned itself as an advocate for justice and for the weak, enjoying tremendous influence on the Western Nations—a very inconvenient truth for the boy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.4">That was why he employed Laplace from the fixer team of the Moderate Jesters to find who they </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">really</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1"> were—and exploit any potential weaknesses for later.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">The boy was fairly convinced there was another side to them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">If the Western Holy Church was </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">really</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1"> an advocate for truth, he’d have to undertake whatever scheme it took to rip them away from that pedestal, but that was strictly a last resort. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">Now simply wasn’t the time for it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">The Church, after all, enjoyed the services of Hinata Sakaguchi, head of the Western Nation’s crusaders and the most powerful paladin the world knew.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">“So,” Laplace continued, “thanks to Hinata’s absence, I managed to make it into the Church all right, but there was nothin’ suspicious about anything I saw inside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">So I headed over to Lubelius’s holy lands—to be exact, the Inner Cloister, at the peak of their holiest mountain.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">He began to gesture excitedly as he spoke. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">It was there, after all, where he saw the fearsome truth.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">“And the most amazing thing, you know… The entire land was just filled with this kind of sacred presence!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">“Why wouldn’t it be?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">the boy asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.3">“It’s a holy land.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">“What’re you, stupid?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">Kazalim added. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.3">“Did someone erase your brain since last we met?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">“No, no, listen to me! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">And you’re falling back in to non-lady mode again, President.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">“I don’t need your— I mean, don’t worry about little old me! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">Just keep going.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">So Laplace kept going, a little resentful at this treatment.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">………</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">……</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">A little ways from Western Holy Church headquarters was the religion’s Holy Temple. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">This was where the Papacy was located, the political arm of the Church that worked at the behest of the Holy Emperor, spokesperson for the heavens.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">It wasn’t until he entered this Temple that Laplace began to feel something was off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">Within its chambers, he could detect a faint amount of magic that applied itself to his nervous system. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.3">It was a very ingenious spell, one he noticed only because it was automatically blocked by Falsifier, his unique skill.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">There’s a surprise, ain’t it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">Must mean somebody here can wield spiritual magic as strong as mine…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Laplace braced himself as he walked toward the cathedral.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">He already had some knowledge of the enemy’s organizational structure—and from what he could see, the relationship between the Church and Lubelius was very tangled indeed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">The Church was built to worship Luminus, the one and only god in the world (as they defined it). </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">Lubelius was the same way, which meant one could say they were allies when it came to religious issues. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.3">In terms of the balance of power, however, the Church held nearly all the cards.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">The reason? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">Simple: Hinata. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.3">The Church had its knights deployed at points across the Western Nations, providing an effective bulwark to protect the weak—and it was Hinata Sakaguchi who built them, and by extension the Church, into the powerful group it was today. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.4">Technically speaking, the Church worked under the patronage of Lubelius, charged exclusively with spreading the good word about Luminism. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.5">Now that their mission had extended out into “doing good” for the weak at large, the relationship was no longer as simple as that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">More than anything, though, the real problem lay with the knights Hinata herself had trained. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">Even Laplace couldn’t help but fear them a little, for their allegiance was not at all with Lubelius but solely with the one god, Luminus—and with Hinata, who devoted herself fully to Luminism. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.3">That was what enabled the Western Holy Church to exist independently from Lubelius.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">And this brought up another problem—Lubelius’s war power resided in more than just its crusaders. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">Even the Holy Emperor kept an official Lubelian force, the Imperial Guard that answered to nothing but the Papacy below it, and this was another group to be reckoned with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.3">Founded on the ideal that everyone is equal under the name of Luminus, it was a motley collection of soldiers in assorted clothing and equipment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.4">The qualifications for joining were straightforward—be a devoted follower of Luminism and be at least an A-ranked fighter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.5">Thanks to these clear but fiendishly difficult requirements, the Imperial Guard was small and exclusive, packed with the best of the best in warriors and magicians, along with their servants. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.6">This force was underestimated at one’s own peril.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">Hinata was listed as head knight in this Guard as well, and the Papacy listed Cardinal Nicolaus Speltus, a dedicated admirer of Hinata, as its chief counsel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">Hinata could almost claim the whole of the Church for herself, and this was the main reason why. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.3">She had control over both wings of the Holy Emperor’s main force and yet was exempt from having to swear her allegiance to that leader. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.4">It was thanks to this inscrutable woman, Hinata, that relations between the Holy Church and Holy Empire were as twisted as they had become.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">And simply recalling all this advance knowledge he had procured made Laplace sigh in frustration.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">What a crazy lady…</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">The cathedral was full of spiritual force, more than enough to call forth the greatest of holy spirits. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">To a magic-born like Laplace, this spiritual presence was supremely difficult to deal with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.3">It dulled his senses, making him want to flee the site as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">He took a moment to gather himself before deciding which way to go. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">Heading toward the peak of this holy mount would reportedly lead him to the Inner Cloister, where one could communicate with Luminus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.3">His senses were telling him there was something to be found here in the cathedral as well.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">“So, ah, now what…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">He wavered, but for only a moment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">Then he strode out of the cathedral and straight for the Cloister. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.3">Spend too much time in this building, and Hinata could come back at any moment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.4">Now, while she was gone, was his best chance to find a hint as to what Luminus, the central doctrine of the Western Holy Church, really </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">I’ll just hop on up</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">, he thought as he traversed the mountain path, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">and take a quick li’l peek around.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">It was his choice—and it was a mistake. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">No, it wasn’t fruitless; he certainly learned much from the experience. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.3">But to Laplace, the danger that resulted proved far beyond his comfort level.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">Proceeding up the stone steps, Laplace finally reached the shrine at the peak of the mountain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">This was notably smaller than the cathedral down below, but in terms of grandeur, the two were incomparable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.3">This small structure was, in the true meaning of the term, the god’s domain.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">Now, it was divine in its silence, putting pressure upon Laplace’s mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">But even amid that solemnity, he could detect the familiar feel of magic.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">…The heck? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">Magic, in this supposedly holiest of places? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.3">That’s weird. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.4">Don’t like that too much, no…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">He could tell that Hinata, the most formidable obstacle in his way, was not here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">If the magic belonged to someone else, that someone couldn’t be ignored, but—in Laplace’s mind—it was no threat to him, either.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">But was that the right appraisal to make? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">Now Laplace, deep down in his heart, wasn’t so sure. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">Come on, man. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">You know you’re completely hiding your presence here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.3">Everything’s perfect. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.4">If some ruffian shows up, just run.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">Bracing himself, Laplace reactivated his Stealth Mode and attempted to slip into the shrine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">Then he rolled right back out, barely maintaining his balance, stymied by the vision of a beam of light piercing straight through his body.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">All of a sudden, the shrine was filled with an overwhelming presence, dressed in luxuriant garb that covered a chiseled, muscular figure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">His short, curly blond hair shined brightly, exhibiting the full force of his will. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.3">This was a ruler—an absolute ruler—and what Laplace couldn’t help but notice first about him were the two large fangs jutting out from his lips.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">“A-a vampire…?!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">The next moment, beams of crimson light danced across the peak. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">His path of escape cut off, Laplace stood there helplessly as his body was torn to shreds.</span></p>
