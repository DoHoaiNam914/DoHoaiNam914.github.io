<p class="cotx"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Clayman was never one to place too much trust in his strength.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">He was the demon lord who took over all of Kazalim’s lands. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">Once Kazalim was defeated at the hands of the demon lord Leon, all the people who served him came to rely upon Clayman for guidance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">The domains of the two lords wound up being merged under Clayman’s rule, something none of the other demon lords voiced any complaint over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.4">It all happened fairly quickly, thanks to the ever-careful Kazalim’s preparations in case the worst came to pass.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">This resulted in a large war chest for Clayman to work with, allowing him to build a first-class force despite being a relatively new member of the club. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">Financially speaking, he was number one in the group—or to put it another way, Clayman was the demon lord who best knew how to manage his money. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">He engaged in under-the-table trade with the Eastern Empire and had a roaring business going with the Dwarven Kingdom as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">Taking advantage of both trade connections allowed him access to the newest weapons and armor from both east and west.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">He took advantage of his access to past relics and magical armor to boost his war power. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">It proved to be useful bait to make power-hungry magic-born do his bidding. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">His riches attracted them right to him, ripe for using and abusing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">That was how Clayman preferred to do business, and it didn’t mean he was stingy with his earnings. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.5">He lavished his forces with gifts, carefully meting them out so he could establish a vast network of coconspirators in nations across the world—none of whom even knew one another’s faces.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Everything was going the way he planned it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">His ultimate mission, to gain access to every piece of information and place the entire world under his rule, was already halfway complete.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">The only thing Clayman lacked, he knew, was power. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">War, in the end, was ultimately a game of numbers—that was his reasoning and also the rationale for why he never overestimated his capabilities. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">No matter how much power he had built up, he knew all too well that he could still falter in the end. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4">That was how much of a shock the demon lord Kazalim’s defeat was to him, although Clayman </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1"> feel he was a little too unprepared for it.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">So he established roots at the core of each geopolitical force and gradually, carefully, expanded on them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">And now, Clayman had new strength to tap, truly decisive strength. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">That was the demon lord Milim—capable of enough overwhelming violence to stand head and shoulders above the other nine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.4">Carillon, whom Clayman appraised as stronger than him, barely put up a fight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.5">She destroyed his nation completely by herself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">And now that he had the power he lacked within himself, Clayman could feel his mood soaring to the skies. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">He had always wanted to defeat Leon, and now he believed that desire was within sight.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">Before that, however…</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Heh-heh-heh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">How nice to see that boy came to the same conclusion that I did. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.3">Have the hated Holy Church fight against the magic-born Rimuru—that’s the best way to sap the strength of both sides.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">Have them crush each other. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">No need to go through any pain themselves.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">To make that happen, we need more information on the Holy Church’s internal workings. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">Could they truly be connected with the demon lord Valentine…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">If we can convene Walpurgis right when we send Laplace back in, there’s little doubt that security will be lighter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.4">A fine plan of action!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">He brought a glass of wine to his lips, savoring the taste and basking in euphoria.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">The wine was a hundred-year-old vintage, old enough that one could almost taste the time and labor put into it, to say nothing of the aroma. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">Only the most carefully picked examples reached his cellar, carefully stored to ensure only the highest of quality, waiting ever so patiently to be served—all this, just for the sake of Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">To him, all of this was a given. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.4">It was perfectly natural for him to believe that, for a mighty king like him, only the best would be appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">He let the aroma settle in his nose as he began to think.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“So what should be the pretext of this Walpurgis…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">It was set for one week from now, at night. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">It would be a new moon that night, the time of the month when the power of vampires was at its weakest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">Every measure had to be taken to ensure Valentine couldn’t flex his full muscle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.4">The main question to figure out was the motivation—the reason why all these demon lords were coming together. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.5">He squinted, staring into thin air.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“…If we are going to attack,” he whispered lightly, “now is the time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">We could take this chance to seize Carillon’s territory as well.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">“Sure, Clayman, but ya just got ordered to sit tight for a spell, didn’tcha?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">Clayman smirked at the voice that apparently came from nowhere. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">“You’re here, Laplace? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">Just as rude as always, I see.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">“Don’t tell me you didn’t notice me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">You were </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1"> lost in thought?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“Heh-heh-heh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">Can you blame me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">I have been granted the opportunity twice to awaken to my full demon lord self, and I lost it both times out of my failures.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“Ah, no need to stew over it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">The way the president sees it, the Eastern Empire’s gonna go on the move soon enough either way.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">“I’m sure they will. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">But you see, Laplace, I’ve come up with a wonderful idea. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">The Beast Kingdom’s capital might be gone, but there are still a plethora of weaker races residing in its hinterlands. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.4">Perhaps I could swallow up Carillon’s territory before the other demon lords can, gather the survivors together, and kill them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.5">That should be enough to trigger my awakening. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.6">A smart plan of action, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“Whoa, whoa, kinda pushing it a bit too far, eh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">I mean, killing innocent people when we still don’t really know what sets off the whole thing?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">Clayman winced. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">It was not the enthusiastic agreement he was expecting.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">“That’s rather out of character for you, Laplace. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">Do you sympathize for them? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">The weak are there to be exploited. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.4">What could make them happier than dying for my sake?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“Maybe, but you already killed thousands of human slaves, and </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1"> didn’t amount to nothin’, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">How’s this gonna be any different? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">I tell ya, it’s not a good idea to push it right now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.4">You needa think a little more and take your time with this!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Laplace was right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">Clayman had a history of purchasing slaves, then murdering them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">The number had indeed grown to several thousand, but the effort had yet to make Clayman a true demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.4">Having this pointed out to him did little to change Clayman’s mind.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“Don’t be silly, Laplace. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">I was their owner, and I am free to handle my purchases any way I like. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">If killing a thousand isn’t enough, we’ll go with ten thousand next. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.4">We know that human souls are required for the awakening. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.5">There is no need to restrain ourselves with the weak!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">He paused, letting his arrogant theory sink in Laplace’s mind.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“Besides, this plan of action is good for </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">him</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">I’m planning to launch this Walpurgis on the pretext that there’s a new force in the Forest of Jura whose leader has declared himself a demon lord.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">“Right, that’s fine and all, but that ain’t gonna be any reason to invade the Beast Kingdom, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“Oh, but it will be, Laplace. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">One of my agents, Mjurran, was killed by someone while on a covert mission. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">I plan to declare that it was then when I realized the demon lord Carillon had turned on me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.4">No one should have any complaint about me taking over Carillon’s territory to gather the evidence I need to prove it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.5">After all, I was the one who suffered the loss.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">Laplace scrutinized Clayman’s words. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">Eurazania was adjacent to the lands ruled by Milim—hardly a ruler who cared much about things like “gathering evidence.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.3">The fact that Milim had defeated Carillon was really all Clayman needed to back up his alibi. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.4">He could even say he sent Milim over to investigate, for that matter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.5">That way, Clayman’s forces could go through Milim’s land to reach the Beast Kingdom, and no one would have any reason to object. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.6">And once things were at </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1"> point, fabricating some evidence would be the easy part.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">There was nothing unnatural about any of this plan. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">But Laplace still didn’t think now was the time to act.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">Aren’tcha panicking a little too much, Clayman? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">Not that I’m gonna change your mind anytime soon, but…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“Yeah, what you’re saying all makes sense…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">Then Laplace recalled something that had nearly slipped past him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">“…but hang on, she’s been </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">killed</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">He knew full well that Clayman thought extremely little of Mjurran, but Laplace thought of her as a decent, trustworthy magic-born. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">In Clayman’s bureaucracy, she was one of the five fingers, the highest echelons of leadership. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">She wasn’t too good in a fight, but as a wizard who could handle almost any situation, she was highly valued as rearguard support. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.4">Plus, she often had handy advice for Laplace and the rest of the Moderate Jesters, even if she acted like she hated it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">More than anything, though, Mjurran had common sense. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">Laplace gave her top marks for that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">“Ah yes,” the unmoved Clayman replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">“I don’t know what that disappointed tone in your voice is, but yes, she’s dead.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">The flatness of Clayman’s report saddened Laplace a little. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">“C’mon, Clayman,” he chided, “would it really hurt ya to be a little sadder when one of yer best people passes away?”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">He used to be a better man that that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">Ever since he reached the demon lord ranks, it’s like he’s grown more and more twisted…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">And this wasn’t a phenomenon limited to Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">Well near everyone in the Moderate Jesters—the group that Laplace called home—seemed to begin warping a bit personality-wise, as he saw it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.3">Laplace himself was the same. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.4">He certainly had no business criticizing Clayman for it, but he still couldn’t shake the feeling that Clayman had fundamentally changed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">“Ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">Oh, you’re too kind, Laplace. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.3">Did you know that Teare said the same thing earlier? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.4">‘You need to treat your tools right,’ she told me, ‘or else they’ll fall apart.’ </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.5">I believe she learned that from you, Laplace? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.6">But that is exactly why, if a tool falls apart on you, you have to make the perpetrator pay for it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.7">I can atone for the tool as well, then, can’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">The sight of Clayman’s artificial smile made Laplace give up pursuing the question any further. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">“…Yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.3">I’d like to keep her death from going to waste, at least.”</span></p>

<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Not quite how I meant it, Clayman…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">It generated a wealth of mixed emotions in Laplace’s mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">He shook it off, wondering if there were any cracks in Clayman’s plan he had failed to notice.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">“But y’know, Clayman, about that Walpurgis… Isn’t anyone else gonna complain atcha about it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">“Oh, they may.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">The smile disappeared from Clayman’s face. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.3">Now it was twisted in unwavering confidence and warped desire. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.4">“But now that I have Milim at my beck and call, I can just toss her in their direction, and that’s it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">Laplace turned pale. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">“Now wait a minute! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">That’s dangerous talk, there! </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">He</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1"> said there’s a chance Milim could go berserk, too, didn’t he? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">Just because the president built that Artifact doesn’t mean you can get away with relying on it for everything.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">“It’s going to be all right, Laplace. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">Milim fully followed my orders.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">“So I heard. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">But she also went off script and made that crazy war declaration, didn’t she? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">She’s ancient by demon lord standards; she’s got to have a hell of a lot of resistance against outside influence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.4">If you come to rely on that lady too much, I think it’s your neck on the line, y’know?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">But Clayman had little interest in the impassioned warning. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">“Are you envious, Laplace, that Milim is under my full control?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">“No! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">I’m saying that they call it a ‘trump card’ ’cause you save it until the final deal!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">That was enough to fully shut down Laplace’s desperate protests.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">In the end, Laplace was unable to stop Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">They were in agreement on some things, and it wasn’t that Clayman was wildly diverging from his orders. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">But Laplace just couldn’t shake the premonition that something was up with the demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.4">So he spoke once more.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">He was right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">If Clayman saw nothing wrong with his scheme, Laplace had no authority to intervene. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">He had his own work to do, infiltrating the Western Holy Church a second time.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">With that final warning, Laplace took his leave, allowing Clayman to refocus on his own thoughts.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Clayman never overestimated his own strength. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">The self-confidence that controlling Milim gave him, however, had emboldened him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">And now, it had made him take the words of Laplace, his most trustworthy of confidants, and dismiss them as mere jealousy against him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">It was with some disappointment in his friend that he took another sip of his wine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">Now, however, it was bitter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.3">The mellow sweetness from before was nowhere to be found.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Suddenly, Clayman threw the glass in his hand against the wall. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">His anger was making him act out, following orders given from emotions not even he could understand.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">“Don’t you worry, Laplace. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">I’m going to make this awakening work, and then I will have the world in my grasp. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.3">All right, Laplace? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.4">I’m not going to lose this again! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.5">So this time, at least, let’s all be one happy family together…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">There, by himself in that room, Clayman reminded himself of the hopes hidden in his heart—rubbing the mask softly, as if running his hand over a precious treasure.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">Fuze was wholeheartedly devoted to us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">Almost to the point where I wondered if he </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">should</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1"> be, really.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">“Still,” he confidently concluded, “it gladdens my heart to be able to fight alongside the beasts and creatures who call this forest home.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">Now it was even harder to tell him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">The Tempest leaders around me were stone silent, and the contingent from Eurazania was visibly confused. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.3">This stuff was already in the past for us all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.4">Like, I wasn’t expecting them to actually lend us support! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.5">I know we had that treaty, but it had more than enough loopholes in its interpretation to let them weasel out of this stuff. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.6">But, however few, Fuze still got a bunch of fighters together and zoomed right over here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.7">I was kinda happy to see that, but—</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">“…Ah, what a fine town this is. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">Beautiful buildings, well-designed houses, paved roads… It pains me to admit it, but it is far more splendid than anything one could find in Blumund. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.3">I can understand your reluctance against turning it into a battlefield. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.4">But we must hold out and await reinforcements! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.5">Our king has promised to deploy our knights, and while it will take them time to prepare—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">“Ahhh, Fuzie, one moment?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">I hated to do it, but I had to stop him, or else we were gonna be here all day.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">“Um, yeah, our, our strategy… Like, if you wanna call it that…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">“Is this something to be kept secret from us? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">Certainly, I can understand your suspicion, but I hope you can place your trust in—”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">“…Um? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.2">Them all? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.3">Them all, who? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.4">What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">I could understand his confusion.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">“I mean, um, the army from Farmus you were talking about? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.2">I killed ’em all!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">That was about all the utterly shocked Fuze could choke out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">Yohm stepped up to give him a pat on the shoulder, while Kabal offered a few condolences of his own.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">“No, I bet he wouldn’t believe it,” commented Elen.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">“Nope,” Gido added.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">Nope, indeed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">It hadn’t even been two weeks since that war declaration. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.3">I suppose Fuze figured their main force would reach Tempest in a week, so we’d buy two or three days of time in open-field combat and prepare for a siege in the worst case. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.4">Considering how the war should’ve started days ago, and we were totally serene about it, I figured he had to think it was at least a </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">bit</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1"> weird by now—but seeing all of us assembled like this, he must’ve assumed we were about to sally forth and attack, or something.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">In his eyes, we went from dealing with a delayed Farmus force to the war being in the books. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.2">That </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1"> a lot to take in at once, wasn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">“The other day,” Rigurd finally began, “we sent my son Rigur out to you to give the news. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.2">You two must have missed each other along the way, I fear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.3">But it is just as Sir Rimuru says. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.4">The war is already over.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">Between his and Kabal’s and Elen’s supplemental commentary, we managed in a little over a few minutes to convince Fuze that we weren’t pulling an elaborate prank.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">“You must be joking,” I heard him whisper under his breath, but time heals all wounds and all that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">The fifty fighters accompanying him weren’t too enthused about it, either, so I ordered our soldiers to take them to our barracks and let them rest up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">They looked exhausted enough to collapse on the spot, limp and lifeless. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">Hearing that there wasn’t any war to fight would cut the tension in pretty short order</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">, I thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">They had apparently been relying on natural trails in the forest instead of the highway, in order to avoid encountering Farmus forces, and all that bushwhacking in full armor couldn’t have been fun.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">So the fighters all muttered their thanks to us as they marched off to their quarters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.2">All that remained was the hangdog-looking Fuze.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">“Why don’t you get some rest, too, Fuzie?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">“Yes…” He nodded at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">“Yes, this has put my mind in quite a state of disorder. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.3">If I could lie down for a bit…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">But just as he was about to walk toward the barracks, another guest interrupted him with (im)perfect timing.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">“Oops. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.2">Here’s someone else. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.3">And who could it be but…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">“But?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.2">Fuze asked, stopping as he heard me mutter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.3">He should’ve kept going. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.4">Once he saw who it was, resting was the last thing on his mind—because standing right there was Gazel Dwargo, king of the dwarves himself.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">Oh, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.2">I thought he’d want a word about that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.3">Didn’t expect him to fly on over himself, though.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">“Ah, yeah, kinda. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.2">There’s been a lot of stuff going on around here, Gazel, so I figured I’d become a demon lord.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.3">I gave him an awkward grin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.4">“Not to make you feel unwelcome or anything, but we were just about to all meet up and discuss our future strategy.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">“Well, perfect! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">I would be happy to join this conference,” he declared, like it was his god-given right.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">It was right about then that Fuze, exhausted and ready to cry, came up to me.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">He had heard our conversation from the side, and I could tell he wasn’t about to let it slide. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.2">Yeah, I didn’t really talk about </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">, either… Going in depth right now would just be a pain in the ass, but Fuze wasn’t going to accept a polite no, I could tell.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">“Sir Rimuru, I find it hard to ignore what you just said! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.2">Because it sounded very much to me that you have become a demon lord—or something to that effect…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">He was shaking from head to toe, about ready to pee his pants.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">“Um, if you needed a bathroom, it’s down this street and—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">“I do </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">not</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1"> need a bathroom! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.2">I never said anything about a bathroom! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.3">This ‘demon lord’ business… Tell me what you mean by it!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">I suppose that feint didn’t work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.2">Fuze was clearly starting to lose his temper, and his real personality was starting to show itself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">“Oh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.2">Um, yeah, demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.3">Well,” I replied as breezily as possible, “I’m one of ’em now.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">This, sadly, didn’t end the topic.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">“Ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.2">Rather poor taste for a joke, wouldn’t you think? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.3">I was hoping for a more serious answer from you…”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">Ugghh, this is such a pain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">Do I have to start from the very beginning before you’ll get off my back?</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1"> And now I could see Gazel looking curiously at me, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">So as much as I hated going through all this in the middle of the street, I gave them both a quick recap.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">Once I wrapped up, I noticed Fuze was muttering to nobody in particular, eyes glazed over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.2">His mind must’ve shut off in an attempt to avoid the reality of it all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.3">At least he wasn’t lecturing me or anything. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.4">Leaving him to his own ranting, I turned to King Gazel again.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">“By the way, Gazel, are you sure it’s all right for a king to slip out of his own kingdom that easily?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">It was a sincere concern of mine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.2">Not that I’m one to talk, but the king was being allowed </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">way</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1"> too long a leash, wasn’t he? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.2">The Armed Nation of Dwargon, in terms of national power, had to be several dozen times stronger a nation than ours. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.3">Wasn’t the king going out on trips whenever he pleased kind of a problem?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">“Pfft. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.2">What is the issue? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.3">I have a decoy fully serving for me!”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">Huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.2">I thought decoys were meant for, like, drawing the attention of assassins away from the real thing or something?</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1"> Or were they meant for playing hooky like this? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.2">I wasn’t too sure either way, but whatever. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.3">Gazel had Pegasus Knight captain Dolph with him, along with quite a number of his trusted companions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.4">For a security detail, it was almost too extensive.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">“Regardless, Rimuru…” He turned his now-kingly eyes toward me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.2">“The report Vester sent me three days ago—that was no mistake, then?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">“Oh, you mean the twenty thousand—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">“Wait, Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.2">I had heard the Farmus force had gone missing under mysterious circumstances. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.3">Do you know something about that?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">“Uh, missing?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">Huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.2">What was he talking about?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">“The way Vester phrased it,” he slowly continued, “a force of some twenty thousand troops simply vanished before they could reach this town. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.2">Do you have any idea what may have happened to them?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">He gave Vester a sidelong glance out the corner of his eye, the silent pressure he emitted almost making his subject collapse to the ground. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.2">I joined his gaze. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.3">Vester vigorously shook his head at me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">“I received the report as well, Vester.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">This was Vaughn speaking, admiral paladin for the dwarven army and sworn friend to King Gazel; and to Vester right now, a source of terror.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">“At the time, I believe you told us that the Farmus force had disappeared, and you were investigating why. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.2">The report was curious enough to us that we decided to venture over ourselves, but is </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1"> the explanation?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">His annoyance might be understandable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.2">I had just brutally massacred a force of twenty thousand, and Gazel and Vester were trying to kind of gloss over it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">“Well, yes, um, the cause still isn’t quite known yet…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">Vester began choosing his words carefully, trying to guess at the intentions of his dwarven friends. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.2">He was a quick thinker like that, already trying to bury the lede on what I had done.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">“Fool!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.2">I heard Gazel whisper to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.3">“If you tell the truth here, you’ll become an enemy to all humanity—or if not the enemy, a symbol of terror worldwide.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">Yeah, I guess so, come to think of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.2">Someone who can kill in the five figures on one go was scarier than a nuclear bomb, really. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.3">The fewer people who knew about this, the better—and certainly, nations and people who weren’t directly involved at all didn’t need to hear the story. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.4">The Kingdom of Farmus attempted to invade monster lands, only to go completely missing due to an unknown incident or incidents. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.5">That much was the truth, decent enough to spread across the land.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">There’s Gazel for you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.2">Far more shrewd than I would ever be. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.3">Which means I now have to walk back what I just said a moment ago. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.4">Ugh.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">I didn’t mind if the townspeople knew; that wasn’t the problem, and it was too late now anyway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.2">Nobody was about to go blabbing it to the general public regardless. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.3">The main issue was Fuze. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.4">I gave him a glance; he was still in a state of panicked confusion.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">“Ummm, Fuzie?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">“Sir Rimuruuu…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">So now what? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.2">I just declared to him that I wiped out the entire Farmus military by myself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.3">Should I laugh it off as a lie?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">But as I thought about it, Fuze sighed and raised his arms up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.2">“I heard nothing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.3">And of course, I don’t think my fighters in the barracks will remember anything by tomorrow morning. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.4">We’re all so exhausted right now, we must be hearing voices in our heads.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">Guess he’s staying mum for me.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1"> He seemed remarkably more aged to me now, sorrowful. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.2">I suppose he found this the most convenient way to solve the problem—and certainly, the best way to tie up all the strings here right now.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">“Hee-hee-hee-hee… In that case, allow me to visit them to make sure,” Diablo offered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.2">He had sidled up next to me out of nowhere with that smile on his face again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.3">Funny guy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.4">The perfect butler. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.5">You could ask pretty much anything of him, and he’d do it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.6">At the moment, he was gleefully taking care of the assorted errands I asked him to do. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.7">I think I might have heard him whisper “I am quite gifted at altering memories” to me just now, but let’s pretend I didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">Fuze had mixed feelings about it, I could tell, but he was willing to deal with it as long as his people were safe. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.2">He understood King Gazel’s take—the fewer people who knew, the better. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.3">When politics get involved like this, governments might not be afraid to shut witnesses up permanently, after all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.4">Maybe it’s smarter to shut your eyes now and again.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">Still…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">“I will not question how my fighters are handled, but I insist on joining this conference of yours.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">It sounded to me like this was one point Fuze refused to negotiate on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.2">His eyes were resolute—he must’ve figured the topic of our meeting wasn’t something he could afford to be in the dark on.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">“All right.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.2">I shrugged. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.3">“I want you to believe that I’m not hostile to humanity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.4">I won’t keep you out.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">Based on the knowledge I gathered, a flame spell on such a high level was one of the most difficult pieces of magic to pull off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.2">The whole family of fire magic occupied its own branch in the tree of aspectual magic, starting with your garden-variety puff of Fire and moving on from there to Fireball and the more difficult Fire Wall and Fire Storm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.3">The harder it is to pull off, the more of a boom it makes.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">At the very peak of this scale lies what, for the sake of simplicity, I call “compounding” magic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.2">Combining the burning nature of flame spells with the shock-wave effects of explosive spells, for example, can provide magic on a scale beyond either of the original two types. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.3">That was just the type of compounding Shizu was gifted at, come to think of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.4">The main difference was that she relied on an elemental spirit to power her casting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.5">That’s not easy, not unless you’re as talented a caster as Shizu was, but once you have that relationship in place, the elemental will do most of the fine-tuning for you.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">Compounded spells on the very tippy top of the scale like this were quite hazardous, because they required you to control the magic manually. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.2">But since they were not a part of any “official” magic family, they offered a great deal of freedom. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.3">You had full control, juggling aspects of the spell like launch speed, targeting accuracy, size and scope of the effect, and duration. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.4">If brute strength was all you wanted, you could level a town easily enough with one.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">This, of course, came at some danger to the caster. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.2">You needed enough spiritual force to gather the required magicules together to keep the spell under control, or else it wouldn’t work, letting that energy run amok instead of being consumed—and potentially raze the entire area around you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.3">It goes without saying that this sort of magic wasn’t something the general public saw much of—we’re talking literally military-grade stuff. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.4">You had to be at least an accredited wizard to be allowed to touch it.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1">So this guy’s an archduke in the Sorcerous Dynasty? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.2">That’s pretty high up there, isn’t it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.3">Dwargon isn’t the only kingdom sending their big guns over to see us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.4">I would later learn that he was closely related to the Thalion royal family—the current emperor’s uncle, in fact. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.5">That explained why he was acting so familiar and casual around Gazel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.6">To put it simply, he was one of three most powerful people from his native country.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">I could hardly hide my surprise. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">Does that mean…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.2">Wow, is Elen some kind of crazy-influential fairy-tale princess?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.3">I knew she was of noble blood, but not that much! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.4">She’s not far from the throne at all, lineage-wise, and she’s working as an adventurer? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.5">Talk about being given a lot of freedom! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.6">And I can’t be the only one to think it’d be better to put a stop to that, not that Elen herself would likely care. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.7">I imagined she probably had people keeping an eye on her, given how sure she was that the advice she gave me on becoming a demon lord would come back to haunt her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.8">And all that trouble she gives Kabal and Gido, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.9">I really ought to reward them for that next time.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">But for now…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">“So did you travel here just to inquire about Elen?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">I doubted it, as I sized up Erald.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1">“Hee-hee-hee! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.2">No, of course not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.3">As we consider how we should interact with your nation, I wanted a chance to see you with my own eyes—this leader that my daughter seems so fond of. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.4">Given the sense of authority you appear to bring to your people, I find it hard to believe you are a slime at all… But still, I feel I have a much more complete picture of your strengths now.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">He accentuated this with a nefarious-sounding laugh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.2">I suppose that overpowered flame strike was his way of testing me as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.3">Me—and Benimaru, Shuna, and Shion adjacent; none demonstrated a hint of panic—it wouldn’t have; they had already seen he had no intention of actually launching it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.4">Given how hotheaded they all were not long ago, that was some palpable growth.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1">“It was clear,” Shuna explained, “that you had far less than the required energy needed for the spell you were casting, once I read what it was.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">Erald grinned at this, a bit ashamed that his act was spotted for what it was.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1">“Well, I suppose I have quite a while to go, if you can see through me </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1"> clearly!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">“Not at all,” she calmly replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.2">“Between the speed at which you deployed it and the skill you showed at making it look real, it was an impressive sight to see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.3">Considering the artificial body you possess, that level of accuracy is remarkable.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.1">“Oh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.2">You noticed I was using a homunculus? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.3">Color me surprised.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.2">It seemed to me you had fused your spiritual body into it. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.1">Very</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1"> impressive. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.2">It would certainly take a nation of magic-users such as yours to pull that off.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1">I used Analyze and Assess at Shuna’s suggestion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.2">She was right; Erald had borrowed this body from somewhere else. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.3">His officers were all “real,” but once you reach the higher ranks of nobility, I suppose it paid to be careful. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.4">I had </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1">thought</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1"> he was rather lightly outfitted for a summit with a self-styled demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.2">Maybe the dwarven King Gazel over there was the crazy one.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1">Still, it was really something. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.2">An elaborately fine-tuned homunculus, indistinguishable from a human being. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.1">Once things calm down, I’d love to learn how that works.</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.1">So Erald was here to size up our nation and its leaders. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.2">That and a few other things, too, I’m sure, but we can tackle that later. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.3">No need to force it out of him right this moment.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1">Since he’s here and all, I figured I might as well have him join the conference, so he’d have more stuff to judge us with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.2">I wanted his take on our future direction as well, and this would be a good opportunity for that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.3">It might result in us and the Sorcerous Dynasty becoming enemies, of course, but we’d just have to cross that bridge when we came to it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">Gobta ran up to inform me that the meeting hall was ready.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">I was planning to have this be a more informal confab between Jura buddies, but things had changed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.2">This really </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1"> a summit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.2">Usually, with things like these, you’d have lower-level diplomats meet up first and agree in advance on questions to ask and topics to tackle, figuring out where there was room for compromise once both sides were aware of each other’s stakes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.3">Here, though, there was no greasing the gears in advance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.4">We’d be giving frank opinions to each other, and in the end, we’d pin down our federation’s future. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.5">It wouldn’t be going too far to call it a war of words.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">Steeling my resolve, I headed for the meeting hall, ready to emcee one of the most important gatherings I—and Tempest—had ever experienced.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">In later years, the event would come to be known as the Monster-and-Man Summit.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">In the hall, I found everyone standing upright, awaiting our arrival. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.2">All the main powerbrokers in the event—the Three Lycanthropeers, Fuze, King Gazel, and Archduke Erald—were shown to their guest seats. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.3">Once I took my own at the far end of the hall, everyone else sat down.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.1">The air was heavy when the talks began.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.1">We began by having each side introduce themselves, given the multiple large nations now involved. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.2">Some already knew one another, but I thought it best for politeness’ sake that everybody was on the same page.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.1">“So. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.2">Let’s begin by having our guests introduced.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.1">I turned to Shuna, who promptly began reading off names.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.1">The Beast Kingdom of Eurazania, represented by the Three Lycanthropeers from the Beast Master’s Warrior Alliance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.2">Given that Phobio and Sufia had a slight—all right, serious—tendency to think with their sword-swingin’ muscles instead of their brains, I figured we’d mostly be focused on Alvis’s feedback.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.1">The Armed Nation of Dwargon, land of the dwarves, represented by their kin himself, Gazel Dwargo. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.2">He seemed perfectly content with me trying to cover up the whole twenty-thousand-dead thing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.3">He undoubtedly had his own motivations for it, so I suppose I ought to keep that under consideration. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.4">It seemed like I’d be able to rely on him quite a bit going forward.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.1">The kingdom of Blumund, represented by…no one, officially, although having the nation’s guild master in Fuze wasn’t a bad substitute. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.2">Fuze was intimately connected with Baron Veryard, one of the kingdom’s top ministers, so he did have enough authority to be here and provide some valuable advice.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.1">The Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion, very suddenly represented by Archduke Erald—a sharp-minded, noble-looking, powerful figure, even if he was near powerless to defy his beloved daughter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.2">If he was here to gauge the worth of our nation, I presumed he wasn’t foolish enough to let Elen sway his judgment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.3">He wasn’t someone to neglect—and definitely not someone to drop my guard around.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">Besides…Thalion was powerful enough to take on the entire Council by itself, on the same level as Dwargon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.2">If all went well, we could establish formal ties with them, perhaps. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.3">I didn’t want to be greedy, though, so baby steps would be key in dealing with him.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.1">Sizing them all up like this, we had a fairly prestigious lineup here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.2">In a way, I was glad all these humans were here for it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.3">If it was just us Forest of Jura denizens, our deliberations might’ve drifted off the rails entirely.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">Once every department in town checked in, we next heard from Treyni, dryad and caretaker of the forest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.2">Having such a lofty local presence around seemed to surprise Erald at first, but he bottled it up and nodded a greeting to her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.3">Gazel found this more than a little amusing, even though I’m sure he and his crew were just as surprised about the whole damn thing when </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">they</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1"> first met her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.2">Ah well.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">Finally, there was the contingent from Farmus—Yohm, Mjurran, and Gruecith as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.2">I wanted to have them build a new nation for me, something I was planning to suggest at this summit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.3">Would people be open to it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.4">That was a vital part of the whole thing, something that’d augur the ultimate success of this event.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1">Once Shion and Diablo behind me gave a couple of quick hellos, the meet-and-greet part of the summit was over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.2">Oh, wait. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.3">Forgot someone.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1">“Shuna, do we have a change of clothes for Veldora?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.1">“I have one more friend to introduce, one whose name should be familiar to you all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.2">I know this may sound surprising, but…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.1">The Tempestians in the audience nervously gulped. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.2">They already knew Veldora well enough, but having a legendary, villainous dragon in their presence still unnerved them more than a little bit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.3">I could feel the electricity in the air as silence began to take hold.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">Pompous as always, I could see, although it suited him well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.2">But could I really trust him to behave at a summit like this? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.3">All I could picture was him growing bored in five minutes and attempting to butt in.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1">“For today’s summit, I was kinda hoping you could join in as an adviser and maybe try to stay on good behavior. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.2">Or you can leave, if you want?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1">“Gah-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.2">Why the cold shoulder, Rimuru? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.3">Don’t leave me out of the party!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">“Well, look, we’re trying to have a serious conversation here, so just try not to get in the way, all right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">“Trust me! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.2">There is no way I would ever interfere with you!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">If that’s how he saw it, I had to be content with that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.2">If worse came to worst, I could give him some of that beloved manga he took from my mind to keep him quiet.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1">The hall remained quiet as Veldora and I spoke, nobody moving an inch.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1">There was panic in the aisles, a lot more than I was expecting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.2">You would think the apocalypse was here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.3">Man… That Veldora. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.4">Guess that Storm Dragon stuff wasn’t just a nickname after all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.5">I suppose I should’ve expected it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.6">Having a catastrophe-rated monster, the highest level of danger there was, stroll into the meeting hall without warning was bound to lead to chaos. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.7">They were treated as stronger than demon lords, even.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">But think about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.2">If that guy’s gonna sow chaos sooner or later, might as well get his intro out of the way quickly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.3">Considering my plans, I couldn’t leave Veldora and his motivations out of the picture. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.4">So I wanted him here, even if it left the other guests limp and pale with terror.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">As much as Veldora was keeping his aura bottled up, some of it might’ve been hitting them all anyway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.2">Benimaru, Shion, and my other leaders shut off their auras as a habit, something we were all used to now that weaker monsters and humans were frequent visitors. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.3">Diablo, despite being the new guy, could fully switch it off without me having to ask. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.4">I was honestly impressed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.5">He was a good model for the others to follow.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">So Veldora was still a problem in that aspect, but thanks to our intensive training, he could now adjust his aura on the fly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.2">He proudly proclaimed it was like child’s play to him, but it was really more thanks to the ultimate skill Faust, Lord of Investigation.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">With that, I figured he’d be fine to bring out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.2">Was that too optimistic, maybe? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.3">After all, even when sealed away, his aura was still daunting enough to keep any monster ranked B or below at bay. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.4">I ran Analyze and Assess on the magicules that filled the hall. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.5">No problems there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.6">So the cause would have to be—</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1">“Rimuru? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.2">We need to talk.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">Gazel was there, giving me a pat on the shoulder and a threatening smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.2">“Let’s delay this summit, so I may have some time.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1">He must have been serious about it, given his shouting earlier. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.2">My instincts told me not to defy him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.3">So I declared recess and stood up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.4">I didn’t hear any complaints from the gallery (not that all of them were conscious enough to voice them).</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1">Leaving the hall to my assistants, we moved into the reception area. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.2">I left Veldora behind at Gazel’s request, which I figured wouldn’t be a problem. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.3">Some of the attendees, the Three Lycanthropeers included, were so keen on currying favor with the Storm Dragon that I was sure he’d be occupied for a least a little while.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">………</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1">……</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1">I was alone in the room with Gazel and Erald. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.2">Shuna was off brewing tea for the whole conference while Benimaru and Shion fought to calm things down.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1">“Let me just say this first,” Erald began. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.2">“I have been given full freedom of action by Her Excellency, the Heavenly Emperor. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.3">It is my word that will decide the position of the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion, and I would advise you to keep that in mind as you explain all this to me.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.1">The doting-father Erald was a distant memory. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.2">Here was the Thalion statesman, the face of an all-powerful nobility, and even I had to admire the dignity he held himself with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.3">So Thalion wouldn’t be willing to sweep this incident under the rug? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.4">He didn’t voice any intention of hostilities against us, but depending on what I decided to do, we might become foes regardless. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.5">At the same time, I figured, he also had to clean up after Elen, what with everything she’s been doing around here.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.1">Which meant, hey, if we aren’t enemies, it couldn’t be a problem to ask for an alliance.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.2">I promise I’ll be honest with you as well.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.1">He seemed to be speaking frankly with me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.2">I should be just as serious with him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.3">So our confidential talks began.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.1">We kicked off with Gazel.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.1">“So what did you want to talk about?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.1">“Certainly not the weather, you fool!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.2">Not even the dwarven king could hide his shock as he excitedly half shouted at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.3">“Why has the Storm Dragon been resurrected?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">That was a rare sight from the normally coolheaded Gazel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.2">He must’ve really flipped his lid. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.3">I thought about talking my way out of this, but there was no point to it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.4">So I decided to summarize things—at least, the part about how I ran into Veldora in the cave and agreed to help him out of his prison.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1">Once I wrapped up, Gazel groaned, a hand covering his face. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.2">“This is beyond all expectation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.3">You becoming a demon lord is a problem in itself without this to contend with…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.1">I thought about lightening the mood by saying “Oh, no need to compliment me </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.1"> much” but opted against it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.2">If I was wrong, it’d send Gazel flying into a rage.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.409.1">“So, Sir Rimuru, is that really, truly…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.1">I nodded at Erald. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.2">Veldora was in human form and hiding his aura, perhaps making it a tad hard to swallow.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.1">“…I suppose it would have to be,” he observed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.2">“No one, man or monster, would be foolish enough to pretend to be that terrible dragon.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.1">I suppose not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.2">That must be why Elen and Fuze were so readily accepting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.3">Names held particular importance for monsters, but even a human would earn no advantage whatsoever from pretending to be the Storm Dragon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.4">And Gazel never doubted it from the start. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.5">I asked him why later, and his reply was simple: “Because I couldn’t read him.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.6">Which implied that Gazel has some kind of intrinsic mind-reading ability. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.7">Strong in more ways than one, I guess. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.8">But I digress.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.1">“What should we do with this, though…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.1">“Indeed,” Erald said to his fellow king. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.2">“And here I am, already frantic enough attempting to clean up after all my daughter’s misdeeds…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.1">I suppose the two were much closer friends than they seemed at first glance.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1">“Do we announce this, or do we cover it up? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.2">There’s the problem.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1">“The Western Nations are not a concern,” Erald said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.2">“Even in Thalion, I see no issue with reporting this to Her Excellency the Emperor and no one else. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.3">But…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">“But the Western Holy Church, yes? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.2">Secrecy will earn us nothing with them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.3">The Church has made it clear the Storm Dragon is the one dragon type they are most hostile to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.4">If it’s resurrected, they would know immediately.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.1">“And if we tried to hide it, we would need to feign ignorance, which would be impossible to back up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.2">Either way, he would be branded an ‘enemy of god’ in short order.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.1">The two pondered what to do. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.2">Me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.3">Oh, I was just saying “mm-hmm” or “yeah” now and then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.4">Not a bad gig.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.1">“Are you listening, Rimuru?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.2">You’re the one who roped us into this crisis, one that puts a great deal of trouble upon all of us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.3">We need you to think more seriously about matters, or…or I don’t know </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">what</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1"> we’ll do!”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">Oops. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.2">Guess they’re pissed off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.3">Let’s just be a bit more apologetic and give my side of the story.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.1">“Well, there’s no way to fully hide Veldora, so my intention’s to let the word out to the public. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.2">There’s no way my nation’s going to avoid the Church’s eyes anyway, so…you know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.3">I’ll figure something out.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1">“Hmm.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.2">Gazel nodded at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.3">“If that is your decision, I have no qualms with it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1">“A demon lord and dragon joining hands is not at all a laughing matter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.2">This has become a more pressing issue than even I had thought at first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.3">But looking at it another way, this is also a stroke of good luck, being able to participate in this summit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.4">I have obtained exactly the information we need to decide how our country will stand…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.1">Erald, meanwhile, was discussing his country’s standpoint more than his own, with another one of his eerie smiles. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.2">His take: It would be foolish to pick a fight against a nation with both a disaster-class demon lord and a catastrophe-class dragon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.3">Gazel agreed with him, solemnly nodding. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.4">In terms of international pedigree, Tempest couldn’t hold a candle to superpowers like Dwargon and Thalion, but if you focused solely on military strength, we didn’t just match these guys; we surpassed them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.5">Gazel and Erald, in their own ways, were admitting to that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.1">“Should I take that to mean,” I ventured, “that should hostilities break out between us and the Western Church, you will take our side?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.1">“</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.1">That</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.1"> is what you ask?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.2">Gazel bitterly countered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.3">“Rimuru, you truly must learn how to express these things better. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.4">Thank heavens this is a confidential talk…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.1">As he explained, just because he had no reason for Dwargon to see Tempest as a foe didn’t mean he was obligated to expose his own nation to danger. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.2">That was doubly true in the case of the Western Holy Church, which the Dwarven Kingdom was not particularly connected to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.3">Instead, all he could promise was that we could retain current relations, with neutrality being the word of the day.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.1">That left Erald, archduke of a nation I hadn’t even begun to try establishing relations with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.2">Despite the circumstances, he seemed oddly willing to see things my way…so far, at least.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.1">“I’m glad to have your support, Gazel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.2">So, um, mister…um, Sir Erald, could I ask why you are being so kind to me with this…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.1">Erald looked similarly reluctant to put it into words. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.2">“…You know you can call me whatever you like here, ‘sir’ or not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.3">Just please be sure to include my name and appellation in public, Sir Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.4">As the leader of a nation, there is absolutely no reason to place yourself below other leaders on the record—not unless you are eager to become the vassal territory of another nation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.5">But to answer your question…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.1">Funny how he’s taking pains to save me from embarrassment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.2">I guess he’s got a kinder side as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.3">I thanked him for that, only to be greeted with a stare and a long sigh before he began to explain why he was here and what he wanted.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.1">It all started with Elen, his daughter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.2">Her leaking info about how to awaken as a demon lord had led to an investigation as to who should be held responsible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.3">It </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.1"> kind of like she had created a new one, I suppose, and no nation could afford to ignore that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.2">But then the archduke sprang into action. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.3">Someone like Erald had enough strength to kill the whole affair, and he did, making sure only the emperor knew the truth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.4">All that remained was for him to gauge the situation and take action as necessary.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.1">Keeping tabs on us magically was apparently quite a strenuous feat for him, but he still managed to confirm that I had indeed become a demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.2">He could’ve just played dumb if I had failed, but once I did, I could no longer be ignored. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.3">So he was here to size me up and potentially send a force over to suppress me should things go awry.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.1">“So,” he said in closing, “I wanted as few people to be aware of those facts as possible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.2">Thus, I came out here myself.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.1">In other words, I supposed, if he thought I was an evil presence, he would’ve destroyed us all and pretended nothing had ever happened.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1">“And what’s your decision, then?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1">“Well, as I said before, my decision for today is friendship over hostility.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.1">Aha. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.2">That makes sense. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.3">And being seen as non-evil made me kind of happy, too.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.1">“A fairly obvious choice,” Gazel retorted.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.1">“Of course. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.2">Our nation enjoys freedom of religion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.3">Our people adhere to more than only the monotheistic Luminus faith. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.4">I seek to prioritize the fortunes of our nation, rather than sacrifice myself for the sake of religion.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.1">“Pfft. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.2">I never did like you, Erald, but we keep agreeing on these matters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.3">My nation and the Western Holy Church do not share a common motive, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.4">From the very beginning, I intended to support our friends in Tempest.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.1">They shared a smile.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.1">“But this doesn’t mean we’re without problems of our own. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.2">For example, the Farmus force that Sir Rimuru destroyed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.3">Whether it was war or not, the death toll is simply too high.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.4">Erald scowled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.5">“And to think it was my daughter who planted that seed…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.1">So that was his real motivation, then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.2">The problem wasn’t whether I was evil or not—it lay in whether the circumstances of the battle was known to the Western Holy Church. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.3">A demon lord who killed twenty thousand was going to look pretty damn evil to just about any sane person. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.4">It would lend valuable credence to the Church’s declarations, and I’d be named an enemy of god in short order.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.1">Now I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.2">The fallout from forging friendly ties with such an evil presence—i.e., me—could be uncomfortable for any nation to deal with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.3">Sounded rough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.4">I began wondering what we could do about that, before Gazel grinned at me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.1">“Don’t worry. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.2">I’ve got an idea.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.1">Oh, could it be…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.2">The way Gazel went on about how the Farmus army went “missing” earlier?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.1">“All the bodies are gone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.2">There is no evidence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.3">And scarily enough, there are no survivors, either, are there?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.4">He smiled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.5">“Then why not change the plot to whatever we damn well want it to be?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.1">The common people, along with the rest of the world? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.2">They didn’t need the truth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.3">Just give ’em a nice-sounding story, and everyone will be happy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.1">“Hohh, a fascinating offer,” Erald said, eyes shining as he went back into statesman mode. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.2">“Would you mind if I contributed to that, Gazel?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.1">He must’ve intended to fabricate a convenient story, one that ensured none of our hands were dirty. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.2">That’d help out Elen, he no doubt believed, and somewhere down the line, it’d even help Thalion’s fortunes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.3">Better go all in on this, then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.4">Besides, I had already decided to keep my nation safe, even if it meant massacring twenty thousand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.5">Even if I have to shoulder heavier crimes, that faith of mine wasn’t going anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.1">“I suppose you have the broadness of mind to deal with whatever may come, Rimuru? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.2">Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.3">A king must never live with regrets.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.1">Yeah, no point ruing the past. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.2">That was part of the Initiation, and I needed it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.1">“I’m ready for anything. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.2">But what’s the story you have in mind, Gazel?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.1">“Heh-heh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.2">Well said.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.1">Gazel’s eyes on me softened. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.2">We had little time left and a great number of details to work out.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.466.1">………</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.1">The chaos had subsided by the time we were back in the meeting hall. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.2">Cooler heads had prevailed, and the unconscious had been attended to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.3">I wasn’t expecting this kind of furor, but ah well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.4">What’s past is past. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.5">Gotta focus on what’s ahead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.6">I got to discuss things with Gazel and Erald, too, and if you think about it, that was a golden opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.1">Fuze and Elen and the others were sprawled out on their chairs, all but lifeless.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.1">They had a lot of, shall we say, negative feedback. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.2">I mean, what do you want from me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.3">I couldn’t really say “Well, I had swallowed him into my Stomach” and even if I did, they’d never believe me.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.1">“Yeah, she’s right, pal!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.1">“This has been hard on the ol’ ticker,” commented Gido.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.1">Respect seemed like a distant dream at the moment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.2">Of course, it’s totally in character for them all.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.1">Fuze hadn’t changed, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.2">“Ah, I just… How am I going to report this to my boss…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.3">Wait! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.4">I’m a guild master, aren’t I?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.5">He had already accepted the situation, just as bold and brazen as before. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.6">I couldn’t believe this was the guy who let Veldora freak him out a moment ago. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.7">If I hadn’t advised him to use the bathroom earlier, I’m sure he would’ve peed his pants.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.1">I congratulated him on that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.2">He glared back at me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.1">“As if none of this is </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.489.1">your</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.1"> fault… I’m going to report this in detail to my bosses, then bill you for the mental distress you’re putting me through!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.491.1">And here I was expecting him to thank me for my timely advice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.491.2">Now he’s angrier than ever. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.491.3">Well, whatever. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.491.4">At least my joking around helped Fuze find his voice again.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.492.1">So everyone had now accepted Veldora, more or less. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.492.2">It was another hour before we finally got the summit rolling again.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.1">Now we were starting for real.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.495.1">Our conflict with Clayman remained an internal affair for the moment; that could wait. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.495.2">Soei gave me a quick report, but apparently, they couldn’t discover Clayman’s main base of operations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.495.3">The fact that he had an army on the move was concerning, but Soei was keeping up his watch.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.496.1">Nothing new was going to happen with that immediately, so I decided to get this summit wrapped up first.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.1">I decided to begin with a recap, as annoying as it was to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.2">We had all been through a lot, but laying out everything in detail to everyone at once should save us time later. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.3">I wanted everyone to be on the same page.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.1">So I began by relating how I met Veldora, dropping in my status as an otherworlder along the way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.2">Hiding my origins seemed meaningless at this point. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.3">All of my people in Tempest knew, and I had no vested interest in keeping it from Gazel or Erald. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.4">It’s not like a demon lord also being an ex-otherworlder would give them anything new to work with against me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.5">Leon was one himself, after all.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.1">I gave a quick summary of the orc lord fight and how it led to us building the town here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.2">Sharing information was important, even if doing so led people to react in different ways.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.1">Moving on, I shifted to my voluntary journeys in Englesia. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.2">This involved a lot of glossing over of my life there, along with the request I received from Yuuki, but I did go into detail about my fight with Hinata. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.1">Man</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.1">, she was rough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.2">If it had been anyone besides me, they probably would’ve been killed—Benimaru or Soei, even. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.3">Her skills were on par with or beyond Hakuro’s, and she could cast magic the likes of which I never saw before. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.4">That Holy Field one was particularly nasty. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.5">I used Thought Communication to let everyone else experience my memory and recognition of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.6">She might have a smaller version of that in her pocket, ready to spring on single targets. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.7">I didn’t think anyone in the room could do much against it, but it was better than going on nothing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.8">The more they knew about the threat Hinata posed, the better. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.9">They might be able to escape, at least.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.1">“Hinata Sakaguchi?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.1">It was Fuze who reacted first.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.1">“She may seem cruel at first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.2">I suppose she gives the impression of a crazed murderer to most. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.3">But according to the information we have, she’s actually a little different from all that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.4">For one thing, she’s always willing to extend a helping hand to anyone who depends on her, and anyone willing to accept her help is sure to receive it—but if you </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.506.1">don’t</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.1"> listen to her advice, she’ll never deal with you again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.2">Whatever her motivations, though, I am assured she is a rational leader.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.1">He seemed to know a lot about her—and was willing to come to her defense, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.2">I didn’t want to fight her, either… It’s just that she didn’t want to listen to my story one bit, you know? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.3">If she refuses to help people who ignore her own background and situation, that describes my interactions with her pretty well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.4">She must have a ton of people seeking favors from her, and I can see how she’d want to ignore them after a while. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.5">Pragmatic would be the way to describe it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.6">Yuuki described her as a realist, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.7">I’m sure Fuze’s intelligence was valid. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.8">He sure seems well-informed, doesn’t he?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.1">Gazel nodded at this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.2">“Mm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.3">The guild master of Blumund clearly has a finger in every pie, as they say. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.4">The accuracy of your information is equal only to that of my own dark agents. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.5">I will gladly testify that what you heard is exactly what we have heard.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.1">Nice to have the confirmation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.2">But:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.1">“Maybe so, but she didn’t listen to </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.1">me</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.1"> at all.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.1">She didn’t. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.2">From the get-go, I was her target. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.3">Even if someone was feeding her a line about me beforehand, it was like she was deaf to me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.1">“Well,” Erald said, “that would be because one core tenet of Luminism is that you are never allowed to bargain with monsters.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.2">I was surprised to hear that from him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.3">Hinata was enough of a celebrity to even be known in Thalion, it seemed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.4">She had a rep in places I never dreamed of… Although, I suppose any nation’s intelligence agency would keep tabs on the most powerful knight in the Western Holy Church. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.1">Is she famous because she’s beautiful?</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.1"> I thought for a moment but decided it best to keep that secret.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.1">Following their guidance, I began to build a picture of Hinata in my mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.2">She was notorious for her cruel words and coldhearted actions, but apparently she had never actually broken a single tenet of her religion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.3">She was the model soldier in every way, an unblemished guardian of law and order. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.4">So why didn’t she put an end to the summoning rituals taking place worldwide? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.5">The kind of rapid-fire summons favored by certain lands bore a very high chance of bringing children over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.6">It was evil, really, on a national level.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.1">“On the other hand,” Fuze countered, “do we really know for sure Hinata is aware of all of this summoning and willfully ignoring it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.1">A fair point, but…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.1">“Summoning magic powerful enough to produce an otherworlder is a forbidden, secret Art, not the kind of magic you’ll see in public. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.2">The Council of the West has criminalized it, and I’m sure you won’t find a lot of nations who’ll voluntarily admit to it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.3">They’ll just say ‘No, we don’t do that’ and then make it impossibly difficult to pursue the issue any further. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.4">The Western Holy Church holds a lot of sway in their region, yes, but if we’re talking about getting to the point of freely meddling in internal government politics, then no, it’s not </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.1"> deep.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.1">Even if a kingdom like Farmus used otherworlders as military weapons, I’m sure they’d just explain it away as, you know, discovering an otherworlder on their doorstep and giving them shelter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.2">Without solid evidence, not even the Church could investigate. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.3">You couldn’t really complain that Hinata was negligent, per se.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.1">And that brought to mind something else Yuuki had mentioned:</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.1">“If something seems the most effective way to her, she’ll do it, I guess you could say, but…but it makes no sense to me, no.”</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.1">Maybe Hinata really </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.1"> working to stop this, in her own way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.2">If so, there was no point stewing about it here.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.1">“The point is,” I reflected, “Hinata’s a serious threat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.2">If I could at least get her to talk to me, we could set something up where we don’t have to be dueling to the death…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.1">But if the Church labeled me a foe of all divinity, a duel would be unavoidable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.2">I wanted to avoid that if possible, but if it happens, it happens.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.1">“Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.2">Perhaps I could go out and take care of her, then? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.3">There is no better way to quell your anxieties for the future than eliminating the problem from the start, no?”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.1">Wow, Diablo. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.2">Confident much? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.3">Being the new guy on the team must’ve made him hungry for work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.4">I really wish he would think more before he opened his mouth.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.1">“Whoa, man, you realize that even I lost to— Um, I mean, fought to an even tie with Hinata, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.2">Just because </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.1">you’re</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.536.1"> on the scene won’t make it some open-and-shut case!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.537.1">“He’s right, Diablo,” Shion added. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.537.2">“If someone like </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.538.1">you</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.539.1"> wants to face him down, then I’ll go over and finish her off first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.539.2">I await your order, Sir Rimuru!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.540.1">See? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.540.2">First Diablo starts mouthing off, then Shion joins the fray and goes all battle crazy again.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.1">“Now, now, Lady Shion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.2">I do owe you a debt for teaching me the ins and outs of assisting Sir Rimuru, so I hardly wish to berate you…but I sadly cannot believe that you could defeat Hinata.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.1">“Oh, really? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.2">So you think you’re stronger than I am? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.3">Well, fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.4">Let’s go out and settle this for—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.1">“We will settle </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.544.1">nothing</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.1">!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.2">I shouted to distract them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.1">Diablo might have acted all calm and collected, but I guess he enjoyed egging people into a fight, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.2">He was polite to me, but that didn’t seem to extend to the rest of his superiors. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.3">Pretty brazen for a new guy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.4">And the way he provoked potential opponents was downright dangerous with the hyper-impulsive Shion.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.547.1">“Gwah-ha-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.547.2">So it’s time for </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.1">me</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.1"> to take action, is it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.2">Very well! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.3">Allow me to just step out for a moment—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.1">“You’re not going anywhere, Veldora! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.2">If she targets us, we’ll deal with it then, but there’s no need to take a fight to her right now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.3">Let me just repeat, I don’t want to antagonize the Western Holy Church!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.1">I had forgotten Veldora was seated next to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.2">He was ready to fly out the door before I stopped him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.1">Man, all these problem children… They’re growing fast, but still, education’s so important for them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.2">Come to think of it, Benimaru and Soei weren’t itching to start fights at all anymore, and Geld had enough common sense that I could rely on him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.3">Gabil got carried away a lot, but he still knew his place, so he never caused me many headaches. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.4">Plus, the way Ranga practically resided in my shadow, ears perked up for my command—he was almost cute compared to the others.</span></p>
