<p class="cotx"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">The demon lord Clayman awaited the appointed hour, a glass of wine in his hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">The Walpurgis Council was tonight, and as a mixture of anger and happiness danced across his face, he thought over a few things.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">First, the bad news.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Ignoring the warnings of his friend Laplace, he had advanced his forces into the Beast Kingdom of Eurazania. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">But they had failed to discover even a single citizen left there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">The effort had gone to waste.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">The briefing from his commander Yamza drove him into a fit of rage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">But until they knew why this happened, giving further orders would be careless. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">Instead, Clayman decided to gather his forces together and carefully continue the search.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">What they found was a group of stragglers, frantically attempting to flee the kingdom. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">Upon being advised of them, Clayman immediately ordered an attack, sending scouts to the area to search for anyone else hidden nearby. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">They eventually found several hundred civilians in hiding, but as they attempted to dispatch them all, they immediately ran away.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Finding this suspect, the army conducted further investigation, only to discover that a larger group of some several thousand refugees was fleeing toward the Forest of Jura. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">The small group of several hundred was just bait to help the rest of them flee.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">Those insolent…!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Now Clayman knew why there was nobody left living in the Beast Kingdom. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">They had undergone a mass emigration to Tempest, relying upon Rimuru for their continued survival. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">The stragglers were also on to the Clayman force’s activity, fleeing the area once the bait was taken.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">He wanted to have those souls safely hunted and collected before Walpurgis, but it just wasn’t going to happen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">He had to admit that now, and it made him deeply unhappy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">“Yamza, the Council is about to begin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">I want your entire force to chase them down before I return. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.3">Kill every last one of them and bring the survivors before me!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">“I swear to you it shall happen, sir!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">He nodded, but it did nothing to overturn the fact that he wouldn’t be awakening tonight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">It annoyed Clayman terribly as he closed the magical link.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">Meanwhile, there was good news to be had.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">Using his feelers in the ground—electric signals and natural geomagnetism—he was constantly gathering information. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">Nobody had been fully aware of this power yet, giving Clayman free rein over a vast array of data. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">It was what allowed him to enjoy the alias of Marionette Master.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">At the time he gained this skill, it permitted him to interact only with people or things within his line of vision. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">Now, however, thanks to ceaseless training and effort, it had become the keystone force of his entire empire. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">This unique skill—Manipulator, it was called—converted information into encrypted communications as it conducted surveillance over a wide area. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.4">Deploying a member of his team to an area allowed them to function as his eyes and ears to gather intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">It was this vast network that informed him that Veldora, the Storm Dragon, had revived. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">This, in itself, was not welcome news—but the human beings who had spoken with the Storm Dragon and apparently survived the experience had some very fascinating things to say.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">According to conversations surreptitiously heard from adventurer types leaving the monster town, Rimuru, self-styled leader of the forest, hadn’t defeated the Farmus force at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">The missing army was the result of the Storm Dragon’s resurrection—and since he had only just been reborn, the dragon’s stores of magicules were largely lost, emptied out as it raged upon Farmus’s army. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">That explained why there was no massive onrush of magicules around the Forest of Jura, as one would expect from such a cataclysmic event. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.4">That these adventurers lived to tell the tale was another sure indicator.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">If the Storm Dragon Veldora was alive once more, there was no way Clayman, a demon lord, wouldn’t have picked up on that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">The rumors must have been true, then—he lost his magic force during the battle with Farmus.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">These two pieces of news conflicted Clayman.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">It would be a simple matter to slay that dragon right now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">I may even be able to add him to my cache of pawns…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">A tantalizing fantasy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">The dragon has been using the town the monsters built as his personal den, it seemed, and it was hard to gather information in that area…but he felt no need for concern. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">Those empty stores of magicules wouldn’t rebuild themselves in two or three days. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.4">After Walpurgis, he’d have all the time in the world to snare him.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">And if all else fails, I can simply send Milim after him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">For now, though…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">It was time to concentrate on the Council.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Or perhaps, if Clayman hadn’t been over-reliant upon Milim’s strength…he might have noticed all the points that didn’t quite add up.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">The fact that there wasn’t a single enemy casualty yet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">The force, reportedly scattered all across the Beast Kingdom, was now gathered together. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">Both pieces of information were too important for someone as careful as Clayman to overlook. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.4">But it wasn’t Clayman on the ground—it was Yamza. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.5">And Clayman’s mind was too full of the upcoming Council to notice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.6">That was how vital this Walpurgis was.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Out of nowhere, Ramiris—a demon lord who preferred to remain incognito, cooped up in her labyrinth, most of the time—asked for Rimuru, the subject of the meeting, to be extended an invite as a supplementary condition. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">Clayman hadn’t accounted for that possibility; it prevented him from making a snap judgment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">But as he groused over it, the others quickly agreed to the suggestion, making it impossible to stage any resistance.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">Still, this could lead to good things for him.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">It’s better this way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">Now we’ve unmasked Rimuru’s true nature. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">I was almost fooled into believing that he leveled the Farmus military by himself…but there’s no hiding the truth.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">Clayman grinned. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">If Rimuru was joining the Council, he should consider himself welcome. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">There, before all the other demon lords, he’d know exactly how powerless he really is.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">A mere slime, borrowing the majesty of a dragon for his boasts! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">I hope you consider it an honor to be crushed by my own hands!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">He went back to fantasizing about his own future glories. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">And that was why he missed it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">Those small yet glaring inconsistencies out on the battlefield.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“…You be careful, too, okay, Clayman? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Now’s not the time to be too reckless.”</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">His friend’s words flashed across his mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">Now, a small sense of unease was taking root. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">The nagging feeling that he had missed something. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.4">But he laughed it off.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">Don’t you worry, Laplace. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">I will win this…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">He drained his wineglass, as if to wash the anxiety away.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">It was with a somber gloom that Frey prepared for the Council. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">Things were in a constant state of flux. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3">The original plan had all but gone by the wayside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.4">She didn’t expect any of this, and now it was all too unclear how things would shake out.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">But she wasn’t nervous. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">She was aware of her limits, and she always made decisions based on cold, hard facts. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">That was how the Sky Queen always acted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.4">If all went well, then fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.5">If not…she would have to prepare to make the right move herself.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">It all began with a certain promise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">In order to defeat Charybdis, she had accepted an offer from Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">In exchange, she agreed to take one request from him.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Frey didn’t bat an eye. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">Milim always acted like this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">When she felt that massive aura—one Milim never bothered to hide—she knew it had to be her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“Hey, Frey! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">Beautiful day out, huh?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">She beamed at her, playing around with her beautiful platinum-pink hair to show it off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Was Frey busy at the moment? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">Who cares?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">On Milim’s hand, however, was something new. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">Not a ring—a brass knuckle covering her four fingers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.3">It was something far too boorish for most young women, but on Milim, it couldn’t have been more perfect. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.4">It had a relief of a dragon carved into it, half aglow in magical aura, and it fit snugly in her clenched little hand.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">“Mmmm, maybe a little too hot, though?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">she said as she fanned her face with one hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">It was obvious what she was doing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.4">She never gave a crap about the weather.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">“Oh, Milim. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Haven’t seen you in a while. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">You look like you’re doing well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.4">Did something nice happen to you?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">Frey had to take the bait. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">Otherwise, she’d have to put up with this act for the next hour.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">She thrust her Dragon Knuckle–equipped hand in front of Frey’s face, giving her a proud little </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">eh-hem!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Frey glumly sighed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">“Oh, wow,” she said, giving Milim what she thought the girl wanted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">“It looks great on you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.4">Where’d it come from?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">“Oh, you wanna know?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">came the bashful reply. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.3">“Oooh, I dunno if I can tell you or not… Hmm, ohhh, what should I doooo?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">This I’m-the-best act was grating on Frey. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">Despite all the years they had known each other, it still rankled her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">“Well, aren’t we </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">friends</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">, Milim? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">It’s all right to tell me, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">Milim’s eyes sparkled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">“Ooh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.3">Oh yeah, we sure are friends, huh?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.4">Okay, I’ll tell you! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.5">To tell the truth—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">Now that Milim finally had the invitation she wanted, she burst into a long story about the town of monsters she visited. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">The self-aggrandizing tale went on for a while, accompanied by several wardrobe changes from the new clothes she picked up there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.3">It gave Frey some pause. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.4">Milim loved carrying on about herself all the time, but rarely to </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1"> level.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">Once the conversation died down a little, Frey realized that now was the time to do the favor she promised Clayman.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">“Oh, right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">You know, Milim, I actually have a present for you, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.3">From friend to friend. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.4">Would you like to see it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">She signaled to her attendants. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">They quickly brought over a tray bearing a beautiful, shining pendant, perched on top of purple satin cloth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.3">An orb had been installed on the pendant, a jewel that even someone who knew nothing about precious stones could tell was worth a fabulous amount of money.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">“Mm? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">A pendant, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">Can I have it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.4">But that doesn’t mean you can have my knuckle, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">Frey chuckled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">“That’s fine, Milim. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.3">Consider it a symbol of our friendship. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.4">And as a friend, I hope you won’t be too shy to wear it around.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Milim gave a bright nod to Frey’s soft smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">“You got it!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.3">she chirped as she attached it to her clothing.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">At that instant, the expression on Milim’s face changed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">Her eyes glazed over; the light of consciousness faded away from them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">With the magic in the pendant released, a forbidden spell wormed its way into her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">This jewel was the Orb of Domination provided by Clayman to Frey—and having Milim put it on was the promised favor Clayman asked of her.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">So there’s my promise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">That takes care of my duty, but what will Milim do…?</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Frey observed the girl. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">She stood there motionless, face a total blank. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">Then, for just a single moment, she felt like Milim’s blue eyes looked at her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">There, at that moment, Milim knew something weird was happening. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">Maybe… Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">Indeed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.3">I suppose it is, Milim…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">The Dragon Knuckle fell out of her fingers, clunking on the ground. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">Frey looked at her and sighed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">“I’m done, Clayman,” she called out to an empty corner of the room. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">“Are you happy?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">“I am,” the Marionette Master replied, emerging from the corner. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">“Well done, Frey. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.3">Now I’ve obtained the strongest puppet there is! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.4">Ha-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.5">This is what she gets for picking on me, calling me a young upstart. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.6">Pathetic, isn’t it, Milim?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">He punched her as he laughed his nasal laugh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">Her face reddened, a cut appearing on her lips. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">The multiple layers of Barrier protecting her were gone, meaning that even she could be hurt now—especially if it was a demon lord like Clayman doing the hurting.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">“Shouldn’t you stop that?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">Frey coldly commented as the half-giggling Clayman prepared to land another blow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.3">It wasn’t a pretty sight to see, and besides—</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">“It’s not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">I just fulfilled my promise to you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">“No need to lie to her face like that, you know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">This girl is nothing more than a doll to us now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.3">A pointlessly sturdily made doll, I should add. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.4">We can just fix her before she falls completely apart.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">The veins were visible in his eyes as he kicked Milim away, Frey coldly watching the whole time. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">Such an impertinent man. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">This is how you really are…?</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">It was at that moment when Frey abandoned Clayman for good. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">Thus, she decided to act on her own instincts for a change.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">“Listen, Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">Maybe you don’t know, but Milim comes with a self-defense mechanism, all right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.3">The way she described it, at least, it’s called Stampede, and it puts her in an uncontrollable state. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.4">You’re free to trigger that and die if you like, but try not to take me with you.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">Thinking it all over again, Frey sighed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">With Milim under his wing, Clayman was using her overwhelming potential violence as a cudgel to coerce her with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">Now Frey was simply following orders, forced to do his bidding.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">She couldn’t help but laugh at how much she deserved this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">She felt like such a fool for believing him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.3">But she also had another thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.4">Clayman was a sly, conniving demon lord, never one to play down, but he also tended to overestimate his own powers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.5">That’s why he never had a perspective on the true essence of things. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.6">Frey, luckily, was blessed with exactly those observational skills—not a “skill” like breathing fire, but something she naturally picked up in her relations with other people. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.7">The ability to see the kind of truth that someone like Clayman, who treated people as nothing more than useful tools, could never notice.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">So, trusting her instincts, she made a bet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">And no matter how it turned out:</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">I don’t think you’ll be alive for much longer, Clayman.</span></em></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">In the middle of it all stood a tall, looming castle, a beautiful, fantastical palace. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">A demon castle, one materialized from an unimaginable amount of magical force. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.3">It was called Icefayr Castle, and it was the domain of the demon lord Guy Crimson.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">A calm, collected man strode along a corridor inside the castle, his hair of platinum blond, eyes long and narrow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">Those blue eyes were a prominent feature of his chiseled visage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.3">His skin was fair, practically translucent, and his beauty would almost make some assume he was female.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">This was the demon lord Leon Cromwell, known alternately as either the Platinum Devil or the Platinum Saber, and he stalked the halls of this castle like he owned them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">Ahead of him was a large door, decorated ornately by a master woodsmith. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">It led to the audience chamber where the master of this domain awaited. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.3">Leon was here to see Guy Crimson, and as he stood before the door, two large, heavy magic-born grunted and strained to open it up.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">“The demon lord Leon Cromwell has arrived!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">A beautiful female magic-born beyond the door shouted Leon’s name as he entered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">There, he saw two lines of powerful Greater Demons lining the way ahead on both sides. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.3">Each one was a named demon, and each had been granted physical corpuses for use in this world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.4">All of them were powerful beyond the definition of a Greater Demon, easily surpassing what a high-level magic-born could manage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.5">They were also bedecked in a fine array of magical equipment, each having evolved in their own unique ways. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.6">They numbered two hundred or more in all, and some were even calamity-class threats, rated Special A on the scale.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">But not even these demons could defy the figures beyond—the sheer overpowering awe exuded by the six demons that surrounded the throne in the chamber’s midpoint, under the watchful eye of Guy Crimson.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">These were named Arch Demons, capable of subduing even calamity-class monsters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">If anything, they could be defined as demon lords themselves.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">Amazingly, not even </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">these</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1"> demon kings were allowed to speak freely in this chamber—for there was a wall, an impregnable force, that none of them could ever conquer.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">The green-haired demon that heralded Leon’s arrival was soon joined by a demon with blue hair that guided him down the aisle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">She was gorgeous, the personification of all human desires. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.3">Her graceful, wispy arms were hidden in the sleeves of a dark-red maid’s dress.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">The green-haired one was Mizeri, the blue-haired one Raine, and they were the two pillars who stood on both sides of the absolute ruler Guy Crimson, doing the speaking for him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.2">They were both Demon Peers, superpowered creatures that each rated a disaster classification—the equal of a demon lord.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">Now Leon was at the throne. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.2">Mizeri and Raine nodded at him, then took their posts beside Guy as the man on the throne stood up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.3">The only people in this room allowed to move a muscle were the two demon lords.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">“It gladdens me to see you, Leon,” he said in a clear voice that carried across the chamber. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.2">“Doing well, I hope? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.3">I appreciate your answering my invitation.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">His bloodred eyes had stars of gold and silver dancing in them, and his wavy, burning hair was a deep shade of rouge. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">He was about as tall as Leon, and while Leon was feminine in his beauty, Guy’s was more prideful and distant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.3">He had an alluring sort of attractiveness, the look of one born to lead—and conquer.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">He walked down the steps from his throne as he greeted Leon, bringing an arm to his chest and embracing him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">Then, without hesitation, he placed his hand upon Leon’s face and kissed his lips.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">Leon pushed him away, wincing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.2">“Leave me,” he complained, like he always did. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.3">He glared at Guy, looking genuinely peeved. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.4">“I am not interested in other men. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.5">How many times have I told you?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">“Ah-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">Oh, you never were any fun like that,” Guy gleefully replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.3">“I’d be happy to become a woman for you, if you like. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.4">But very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.5">Let us change locations.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">He walked off, without waiting for a response. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.2">This, too, was how it happened every time.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">Considering the arctic region he lived in, Guy’s clothing was quite unusual. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.2">He mostly had his clothes draped over him, revealing a great deal of bare skin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.3">To Guy, who never felt the cold anyway, that was never an issue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.4">He wore a near-mystical smile to complement his bewitching beauty, perhaps recalling the sensation of Leon’s lips against his—and then a snakelike tongue licked his bright-red lips, creating an eerie sort of irresistible allure.</span></p>
