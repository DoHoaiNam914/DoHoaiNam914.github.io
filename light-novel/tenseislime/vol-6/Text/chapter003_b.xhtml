<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">“Sir Rimuru,” Diablo said, walking back to me, “I have captured an intruder. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.2">What should we do with her? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.3">She raved about this town falling to ruin, but how should we address this insolence?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">I looked at Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">She was batting her wings helplessly, trying to escape Diablo’s grasp. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.3">“Gehhh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.4">I’m using my full magic force, and I still can’t escape him?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.5">This, this can’t be any kind of regular bodyguard! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.6">Who </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">are</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1"> you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">What did I ever do to you?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">She never was very quiet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">And no offense, but given the incomparable difference in power, I didn’t think Diablo would lose her anytime soon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">And this was a demon lord? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">See, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1"> is why I sometimes wonder if being a demon lord is anything special at all.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">“Do you know this fairy, Sir Rimuru?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">Fuze asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">Oh, right, we were in the middle of a summit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4">Right toward the end, in fact. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.5">If she had only come in a couple minutes later… She never was good at taking social cues like that, either.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“Yeah, I do. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">This is Ramiris, and she might not show it, but I guess she’s a demon lord, too?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“Hey! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">What d’you </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">mean</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">, I don’t show it?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">I am feared as the strongest out of all ten demon lords, I’ll have you know!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">She flashed me the most arrogant smile possible, still stuck in Diablo’s grasp and oblivious to how nonthreatening she looked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">The audience was nonplussed, a few giving comments like “Huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">A demon lord…?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.4">and “Someone like </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“…What? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">Like, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">whaaaat</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">Come on, what’s your problem? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">You’re supposed to act more surprised! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.4">I’m kind of a demon lord, guys! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.5">Ramiris of the Labyrinth, in the flesh, all right?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.6">Why is everyone acting so uninterested?”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">I mean, demon lord or not, you’re kind of caught between two fingers right now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">If I had to guess, everyone thinks you must be some kind of poseur, you know? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">I’m too kind to actually voice this, of course, but…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“…Well, as a demon lord himself, it’s only fair that Sir Rimuru would be acquainted with other demon lords, I suppose…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“If anything, the Storm Dragon’s resurrection was such a shock, I don’t think anything could surprise me at this point…” </span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">Our audience was nodding at one another. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">I suppose that makes sense, actually.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Ramiris, on the other hand, was less than satisfied with that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“Huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">The Storm Dragon? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">Veldora’s been revived? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.4">You guys are being tricked! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.5">I beat Veldora into the ground with a single punch! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.6">That guy was all roar and no bite. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.7">Besides, his era’s over now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.8">If you want someone to fear, you can start being horrified around </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">my</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1"> presence today!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">She punctuated this with a high, haughty laugh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">If anything, she had an even bigger mouth than Veldora. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">I had Diablo hand her over to me and took her to see him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“Veldora, you mind entertaining this girl for me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">She’s a demon lord, too, more or less, so maybe she’ll wanna be friends with you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“Mm? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">I am busy unraveling a grand riddle at the moment.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">I didn’t have time for his sulking.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“Oh, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1"> manga? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">The murderer was [REDACTED]. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">You’re good now, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.4">Thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">With that bout of mercilessness, I returned to my seat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Veldora looked shocked, eyes wide open. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">Maybe it wasn’t the nicest thing to do, but we’re in the middle of a summit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.4">I wanted him to think about his actions a little, not let him do whatever he wants.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Besides, the sight of Veldora had already made Ramiris faint on the spot. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">Two problem children taken care of in one stroke.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">So wrapping up, I wanted to go over everything we had to do.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“Benimaru, our next target is Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">I want him taken down!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“Just what I’ve been waiting to hear!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">Benimaru gave me a fearless smile, flames dancing eerily in his eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3">The rest of the Tempestians in the audience were similarly elated; I guess they’d all become would-be warriors over time. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Didn’t they all just have a huge battle in town a few days ago? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">Ah well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">High morale’s never a bad thing.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“As for the Three Lycanthropeers and the beastmen under them…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">“No need to say it,” Alvis growled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">“We are under your command, Sir Rimuru.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">Phobio and Sufia seemed just as enthused. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.4">I shouldn’t have bothered asking.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">“And you think you can beat him with this team, Rimuru?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“I will. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">He’s riled me.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“I see…” Gazel gave me a wry grin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">“I will trust you in your word, then.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.3">And in a smaller voice that I figured only I could hear: “Here I thought you were my junior training partner. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.4">You’ve grown far too much…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“But I do not believe you can afford to think lightly of Clayman,” observed a concerned Erald. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">“He holds sway over a vast army of magic-born, and rumors tell of close connections with the Eastern Empire…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“That doesn’t matter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">War is about quality, not quantity!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“Heavens, I think I can hear my common sense collapsing as we speak…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">It was, indeed, totally lacking in common sense, but it was enough to quiet him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">I could tell he was interested in what I had now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">I knew it was crazy, too, but I also knew I was right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.4">The larger army usually wins the battle, but that didn’t apply to this world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.5">The orc lord was a good example of that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.6">As long as you can decapitate the leader, it was always the more adept fighters that dictated the results.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Besides, this time, we didn’t lose out in numbers, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">I had cut it out from the summit for brevity, but Soei had already briefed me on Clayman’s movements. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">Soei was still pinning down an exact number, but they were moving sluggishly and still stuck inside Milim’s domain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.4">His Replication would be back here soon, though, and I could save my final decision for then.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">That</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1"> strategic meeting could come later, but for now, we needed to make sure we had the script down for conquering Farmus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">We’d release the king, then have the Marquis of Muller and Count Hellman pursue his blame, beseeching him to take responsibility for his failure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">Depending on how he reacted, Yohm would then spring into action.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">“Regarding any actual war with them, that will be our issue to tackle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">For now, I want all of you to trust in me and leave Farmus for us to worry about. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">It shouldn’t be long before I’ll ask you to help us make Yohm into the champion king of a new generation.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">The audience nodded their approval. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">When it came to human affairs, we’d make a lot fewer mistakes relying on them instead of trying to go it alone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">I was looking forward to their support.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">“Now, Fuze, I want you to contact Muller and Hellman confidentially.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">“Sure thing,” he replied.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">Again, we’d likely work out the details in a later meeting, but we had a plan of action now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">First, we’d portray things so it was Yohm and his forces reclaiming the king from us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.3">We’d then have the Marquis of Muller put the king under his protection, providing backup for Yohm the whole way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.4">And about those three POWs, actually:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">“By the way, Shion, how are those three dealing with your questioning? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">Did they give us anything useful?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">I had forgotten about that—it didn’t really matter, in the grand scheme of things—but I had left our prisoners in the care of Shion this whole time.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">“Heh-heh-heh… Of course they did, Sir Rimuru!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">“Um,” Yohm began. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">“Yeah, um, questioning? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.3">Interrogation? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.4">Either way, they talked a lot, pal.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">“That they did,” agreed Mjurran. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">“But that was no questioning. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.3">It was something surreal. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.4">I’m not sure you could even call it interrogation.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">I really don’t want to hear anything else, thanks.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1"> Shion overdid it, no doubt about it—but then, I let her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">It’d be unreasonable for me to complain about it, and I had no intention to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.3">Even if I wanted to stop her violent rage, I guess I was cooped up in the cave and beyond contact range anyway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.4">In a way, it’s my fault for not being there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.5">Let’s just assume I never noticed.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">Sorry, people of Farmus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">But then again, you guys struck first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.3">Hopefully, you’ll consider yourselves lucky for surviving at all.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Either way, we had three prisoners in custody, and following Shion’s interro—um, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">questioning</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">, they seemed fairly willing to talk.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">“First off,” Shion began, “Ed, Ednoyol? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">Ed…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">“…King Edmaris?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">whispered Shuna into her ear. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">Thanks for that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">But really, Shion? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.3">You couldn’t even come up with the king’s name? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.4">I know it’s kind of a weird one, but…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">“King Edmaris had apparently made contact with a merchant, one who brought him silken fabrics from our nation and whetted his appetite for conquest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">The king also feared that trade would drift over to our nation in the future, which also led to those moves on his part…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">Shion’s rundown continued, the content of which didn’t surprise me much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">The only thing it made me wonder about was whether that merchant deliberately spurred Edmaris to action.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">“Do we know who this merchant is? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">Some black-market dealer?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">“I apologize, my lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">That much we do not know.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">She looked so sad about it that I felt the need to hurriedly console her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">The question wasn’t that important anyway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">Let’s switch subjects to Archbishop Reyhiem.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">“That’s fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">What about the Church?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">“Ah yes! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">He revealed who was pushing him behind the scenes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.3">The name was—”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">It’s a long one, Shion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">You think you got that one remembered at all?</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">“…The core of it all was Cardinal Nicolaus Speltus,” Mjurran said after Shion shot her a pleading look. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">Shion was great at extracting information from people, but anything else? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.3">Forget it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.4">She had some kind of mental block keeping her from remembering proper names. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.5">Better give her some other assignment next time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.6">Good thing Mjurran was around. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.7">I can’t really expect much in the critical-analysis department from Yohm, either, so she no doubt provided some handy backup.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">According to her, Nicolaus stated that they planned to take us all down, as a nation clearly against the will of their god. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Planned</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1"> to anyway.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">“I see,” Fuze muttered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">“So Archbishop Reyhiem wanted all the glory of defeating a godless enemy, so he could earn extra clout with the central authorities?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Everyone seemed to agree with this.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">“Either way, we still have some wiggle room. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">The Western Holy Church hasn’t made a definitive decision yet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.3">Perhaps there’s a way to negotiate ourselves out of being designated hostile.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">“In that case,” Fuze said, “let me handle that.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">His approach involved taking advantage of the Council’s presence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">They would release a statement declaring that the nation of Tempest should be recognized, putting pressure on the Church to act. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">Appealing to the Council would also place the spotlight further on Tempest as a waypoint along a series of new trade routes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.4">The fact that monsters lived there was an issue, but they were all both kind to strangers and fully capable of speech. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.5">If anything, they’d gladly be your friend.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">That much, of course, we had already proven. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">Or really, we’d made it happen through all this astonishing evolution. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.3">In so many words, our aim was to earn treatment from the humans similar to what dwarves, elves, and other demi-human races enjoyed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.4">King Gazel would back us up as well, keeping up a lively trade relationship with us and advertising the benefits of Tempest with more energy than ever.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">This, I imagined, would likely not be enough to make the Western Holy Church abandon their core tenets. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">But Dwargon and Blumund already had formal trade relations with Tempest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.3">Not even the Church had the kind of power to annul those agreements. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.4">And with us having such deep ties with a small group of human nations like this, other countries were bound to grow curious soon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.5">Plus, we now had the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion declaring their allegiance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.6">That put even more pressure on the Church to settle matters.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">“Not that this is for me to say,” Fuze added, “but recognizing Tempest is a double-edged sword. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">We all need to be careful to make sure we don’t accidentally stab ourselves in the process.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">He was right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">Blumund was in the tightest spot out of them all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">Dwargon and Thalion were essentially beyond the range of Holy Church influence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.4">Both were powerful enough that they could give the united Western Nations a run for their money. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.5">Blumund, meanwhile, was a blip, all too susceptible to pressure from outside its borders.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">—Except all that was a thing of the past.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">“Heh-heh… Fuze, was it? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">No need to fret. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.3">We dwarves can make runs through Tempest to access your markets as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.4">And with the stronger position that will put your nation in, the Council will find it prudent to tread lightly with you.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Gazel’s right</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">, I thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">Two nations, Dwargon and Thalion, both with different cultures and technical expertise, were interacting with each other through Tempest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.3">This town was going to grow exponentially, I was sure of it—and then, a new culture would bloom. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.4">Culture and technology. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.5">The sorcerous science Thalion boasted and the spirit engineering Dwargon cultivated would connect on our doorstep, two different families of tech rolled into one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.6">It could create an industrial revolution straight out of fantasy, and the kingdom of Blumund would have dibs on enjoying it first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.7">Even in terms of pure accounting numbers, the potential profits were enormous.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">Meanwhile, the new kingdom of Farmus created by Yohm would be reborn as a breadbasket to the entire region, filling the people’s stomachs and planting the seeds for an entirely new food culture. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">We’d need to spread the wealth around, to make sure none of us was competing with another member of the alliance in each specialty—but I was planning to attend to that anyway, on the sly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.3">Raphael, Lord of Wisdom, had calculation skills that went beyond what even quantum computing could manage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.4">Calculating global economic effects was no sweat—and at accuracies far greater than even the Earth Simulator supercomputer in Japan could manage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.5">That kind of made me sound like the “man behind the curtain” ruling the world, but I </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">am</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1"> a demon lord, so at least it’d be in character.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">I could understand Fuze’s concern, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.2">Blumund was so tiny, it might wind up being exploited by its bigger neighbors without any recourse to turn to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.3">That’s why it was so hard for them turn away from the Council, as friendly as that alliance was to smaller nations like theirs. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.4">Of course he’s worried.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">Maybe, in the short term, it would’ve been better for them to keep dealing with the Council. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">Pool all their intelligence skills together, and Blumund might’ve even been able to force the Western Holy Church into all-out war against us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.3">If that was the choice they made when they first met us, I might’ve been slain by now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.4">But the Blumundians didn’t opt for that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.5">They trusted me and decided to walk down the same path.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">You do the deed, and then you get rewarded for it.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">Blumund had already picked me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">I didn’t see any reason not to take the hint. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.3">Living together in harmony was right at the crux of my ideal, besides.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">“Fuze, when you return home, I want you to tell the king that I have a favor to ask.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">“Kinda rude, wouldn’t you say? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">It’ll take a while to explain, and I’ll probably fail to get the point across to you, so I’ll visit later to go over it in detail with him.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">What we knew for sure is that our captive was a young man, an otherworlder, who had participated in the attack. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">Everyone was in agreement on that.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">That’s true. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">Diablo wanted me to know he was a good servant, but he didn’t say anything about his opponent being tough at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.3">He was dissing the guy every chance he had. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.4">So…</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">Now Diablo was looking panicked at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">I could see Shion sneer back at him, but that order wasn’t for her sake. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.3">This was the result of more serious thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.4">I was just thinking about who I could have help out Yohm’s team, assuming I left Veldora to keep the town safe. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.5">Someone who was reasonably intelligent, strong enough to handle anything that came his way, and could move fast if needed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">Soei would’ve been the best choice, but I needed him on the battlefield. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.2">Benimaru was my general field commander. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.3">Shion was out of the question. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.4">Hakuro couldn’t use Shadow or Spatial Motion, so it’d take time for him to travel anywhere. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.5">Geld and Gabil would stand out too much in human society.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">Meaning Diablo fulfilled all my conditions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.2">He said he’d lend a hand when it came time to take Farmus down, so I doubted he’d have any complaints. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.3">He’d have no problem guarding someone as potentially harmful as Razen, either.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">“I will leave this to you, Diablo!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">“Ah, I understand, Sir Rimuru!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">He gave me a delighted smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.2">Something didn’t seem quite right about it to me, but if he said yes, then no complaints. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.3">Right now, Diablo was probably third in strength after Veldora and me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.4">No matter what happened, he’d have it handled in a flash.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">“This job might take several years, so I hope you’ll be patient with it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.2">Contact me with Thought Communication if anything comes up.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">“Not a problem, sir. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.2">I will be happy to handle this mission well before the allotted time.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">He sure had a lot of confidence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.2">This was an entire nation I was asking ’em to take down…but again, that’s another reason I felt safe giving him this assignment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.3">Now, with all the plans settled, we could end this summit between nations—and now I could focus my full attention on all-out war with Clayman without any regrets.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">To finish off, I asked if anyone else had something to say.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">A hand shot up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.2">It belonged to Erald, who was looking expectantly at me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">“Yes?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.2">I asked.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">Erald had been waiting for this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">“Our nation and yours are separated from each other by extremely treacherous forests and mountains. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.3">If we could connect ourselves directly through that region, that would allow us to cut the travel distance by quite a margin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.4">A highway, in particular, would make the trek far easier…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">He shot me a glance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.2">Ah-</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">ha</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.2">I knew what he was getting at. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.3">If we were gonna be building a formal relationship with Thalion, of course we’d want a direct link between us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.4">We’d have to do that, of course. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.5">Products that used to require long detours to deliver would naturally be more attractive once we had a better road. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.6">That was a part of my plan from the start.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">Of course, it’d also mean we’d have a lot of civil engineering to do—cutting down trees, building tunnels, paving the roads. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">The budget would be huge, and maybe they were a superpower, but it wouldn’t be </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1"> easy to procure a budget like that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">No doubt Erald already had some ballpark figures he composed himself, in hopes of forcing the whole job upon us.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">“Erald,” Gazel commented, “you are asking for too much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">Not even Rimuru can accept such a massive undertaking so lightly.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">Well, hang on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.2">I’m pretty sure we covered all the work and expenses for the highway to the Dwarven Kingdom, didn’t we?!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">“Don’t be ridiculous, Gazel! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.2">If it was Sir Rimuru saying that, I would accept it, but not from </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">you</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1"> of all people!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">Ah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.2">Guess Erald knew, too.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">So if I’d already accepted the job from Gazel, would it be wrong to say no to Thalion? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.2">In my honest opinion, I had no problem being left to the task. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.3">A highway was a small price to pay for their recognition, really. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.4">But if I kept taking these low-paying jobs, so to speak, every country we ran into going forward might expect a similar handout. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.5">Humans are sly like that, something I was sure reminded of by my experience in Blumund. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.6">They had me right where they wanted me.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">Let’s get a thing or two straight before we go any further.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">“I understand your suggestion, Duke Erald. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.2">We would be willing to accept your request for a highway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.3">However…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">“However?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.2">Erald nervously swallowed as he looked at me. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">Don’t worry, man. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.2">I’m not gonna ask for much.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">“However, I want you to let us handle the highway’s security and lodging facilities. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.2">Of course, we would take payment for this, in the form of a small transport tax on top of operating expenses for those services.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">It would be like running a toll road. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.2">We’d set up stops at decently sized regular intervals where people would have to pay fees to advance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.3">That would provide us with permanent funding. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.4">We might start in the red, but over the long term, it’d probably lead to profit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.5">Our special interests at work, you could say. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.6">On top of all that, we’d keep the highway maintained for them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.7">A bargain, really.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">“…I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.2">Impressive. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.3">And only natural to demand that much. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.4">However, I would like to have the right to negotiate this transport tax, perhaps once every few years.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">Hohh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.2">Erald’s pretty impressive himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.3">He immediately saw what I was trying to accomplish. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.4">Of course, none of this would happen without both sides coming to an agreement. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.5">No point setting that tax too high. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">I’ll take the offer.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.2">Let’s go with that!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">“That’s </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">it</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">Fuze seemed flabbergasted, but I let it slide. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.2">In diplomacy, the power to make a decision trumps all else.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">“Geld! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.2">We got a new job for you!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">“Yes sir! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.2">It gladdens me to hear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.3">We have the teamwork to handle every step of the operation, the supply lines to transport the needed materials, and people with skills that knead and control the earth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.4">The work you provide us is our very nourishment, Sir Rimuru, the best military training ground we could ever hope for!”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">Huh?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.2">Oh, uh, yeah… That’s the motivation they go with, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.3">And here I thought Geld had some common sense. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.4">Maybe not so much?</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1"> It was so surprising, I didn’t know how to react for a moment.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">I turned toward Beretta.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">“Congratulations on your evolution to demon lord,” it said with a polite bow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.2">“Allow me to thank you, grand master, for letting me share in the benefits of said evolution. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.3">Thanks to you, I have transformed from an arch-golem into a chaos golem.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">This evolution had imparted elements of both holy and demonic force into it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.2">That was mainly thanks to the skill Reverser, which allowed the user to obtain two diametrically opposed essences at once—in Beretta’s case, aspects of both demonic and angelic power, I suppose. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.3">A new spirit core was born inside it, fusing with its older, demonic one to create a new chaos core. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.4">This let it handle holy-element attacks, something it was weaker against before.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">I couldn’t have been the only one who saw that as incredibly unfair. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.2">That rock-solid magisteel body, already impervious to most physical attacks and magic, and now it was even covered for what few weaknesses it had. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.3">You couldn’t ask for a better upgrade than that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">This unique skill Reverser was something involved with me, it seemed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.2">A lot of the panic I felt at the time must’ve come across to Beretta. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.3">When I was encased in that Holy Field, my emotions when I was left powerless by the sealed-off magicules must’ve affected how this power manifested itself, I think. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.4">Given that an arch-golem runs on magicules, it must’ve feared that it, too, would stop in its tracks. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.5">So it came up with this countermeasure.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">Between Reverser and that chaos chore, Beretta was turning into one extremely interesting research subject.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">I tried my best to avoid all her little jabs at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.2">Giving them attention would just prolong the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">“So why’re we falling to ruin?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">“Well, before I tell you…” She stopped, turning serious as she looked around to size up the dignitaries around her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.2">Then she nodded to herself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.3">“Ah, I suppose this has a lot to do with you humans, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.4">All right—listen up, all of you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.5">Clayman’s just proposed that we launch a Walpurgis Council!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">“A Walpurgis what?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">“Right, a Walpurgis Council. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.2">A special meeting of all the demon lords!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">Oh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">She said “launch,” so I thought it was some kinda huge magic spell at first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.3">I was planning to storm Clayman’s domain, so if she told me that Clayman was attacking first, I would’ve freaked out.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">Pressing her for more details, Ramiris stated that staging Walpurgis required the consent of at least three demon lords, and once convened, attendance was very much mandatory. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.2">Absence was never forgiven. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.3">It was one of the very few things the capricious, self-serving demon lords had agreed to on paper (although this still didn’t prevent some extremely lazy demon lords from sending a representative with full rights to the Council instead).</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">“…I think I have read about this,” Erald said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.2">“Once, all the demon lords came together to wage an epic battle, one that the Western Holy Church named Walpurgis, or the feast of demons.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">This was something he had apparently read in some records dating back a thousand years ago. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.2">The war was a costly one, causing serious damage and disasters across the land. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">Walpurgis</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">, the term coined by the Holy Church for it, had the connotation of not just a demonic feast but one attended by those who spread chaos and destruction worldwide. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.2">These were worldwide affairs, I supposed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">So if demon lords gathered together like this, did it mean war among themselves, or them teaming up against some other enemy?</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">As he put it, these Temma Wars (or Great Wars) were triggered every five hundred years. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.2">There was a reason for that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.3">It was because the forces of heaven—in other words, the angels—came down to earth at around that cycle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.4">These angels were kind of natural enemies to demons, I suppose, but oddly enough, they would attack pretty much everyone indiscriminately. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.5">Developed cities and towns, for some reason, were a particularly favored target. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.6">Nobody knew why, but there you go.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">I appreciated her bringing the news, but this came right out of nowhere.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1">I held my ground, refusing to let her get her way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.2">Any “entrance to the labyrinth” built around here could never possibly bode well for us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.3">And Beretta’s fate wasn’t just in my hands—it had a lot to do with the golem, as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.4">It wasn’t something she had any right to dictate. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.5">A simple question on my part led to what I could only call an outrageous proposal.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.1">We argued vehemently about it for a while, to no effect, before the crowd finally broke up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.2">I was too busy to deal with her any longer, and Ramiris, her business apparently done, went back to her manga.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.1">As they left, I promised all the attendees that I’d inform them of whatever new information I found. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.2">They all agreed to this before they went their separate ways.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.1">Fuze planned to stay the night at the inn before heading home. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.2">“I hope you’re prepared for what lies ahead,” he warned. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.3">“It’s your country being targeted this time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.4">A demon lord is a very dangerous thing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.5">I think I know how strong you are, Sir Rimuru, but…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.1">I understood what he meant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.2">At worst, I could wind up making enemies out of several demon lords at once. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.3">Out of the ten of ’em, who could I count on as nonhostile? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.4">Carillon was AWOL. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.1">Ramiris promised to back me up, so there’s one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.2">Milim… Milim’s my biggest worry. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.3">I’m pretty sure she’s just being tricked, but I’d still need to prepare myself for the worst.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.1">So if I managed to completely screw up everything, I could have eight demon lords wanting me dead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.2">Of course, if it looked like I was gonna lose Milim before that, it was probably best to run for the hills immediately at that point.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.1">“Oh, I’ll figure something out,” I reassured Fuze.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">Erald and Elen also whined at me about wanting some time to talk to each other. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.2">I agreed to have them stay for several nights before leaving—not at the inn but at our luxury </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1">ryokan</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.1">-style hotel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.2">All of Tempest was proud of that place, and if we could earn the duke’s praise for it, he was welcome anytime.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.1">It was funny, though, seeing how different Erald the statesman was from Erald the person. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.2">He was so preoccupied with his daughter that I was worried she’d run off on him—I just had to pray he wouldn’t do anything to make her even angrier.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.1">Gazel also opted to stay a few extra days, so I lodged him in the </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.409.1">ryokan</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.1"> as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.2">As I guessed from seeing them speak, they had known each other for ages, even fighting in battles together. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.3">Erald must’ve really been a hell of a wizard. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.4">And now, funnily enough, they were using Tempest as a new channel to build geopolitical ties with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.5">It’s always better to get along, of course.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.1">We really enjoyed a celebrity lineup at this summit, though, didn’t we? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.2">Leaders who’d hold major sway over human nations in the future. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.3">And—if you think about it—I was standing on equal footing with them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.4">Having that selfish fairy crash it at the very end made for a less-than-snappy ending, but I think it’s safe to say I gained a lot from it all.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.1">With Ramiris suitably placated, it was time to start the conference.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.1">“Right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.2">I know it’s tough, having all these discussions at once, but bear with me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.3">We have two items on the agenda here: fighting Clayman and the Walpurgis Council. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.4">Ramiris here has just informed me that I am being targeted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.5">First, I’d like you all to hear Soei’s report and discuss our strategy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.6">Soei, give us your briefing on Clayman’s forces.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.1">“Sir!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.1">He began right after my introduction.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.1">While we were holding our summits, Clayman’s army had been busy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.2">They had stopped in Milim’s domain to rest and organize their troops.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1">“They do not appear to be led by Clayman himself,” Soei stated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.2">“Their leader is accompanied by a slew of magic-born and boasts a great deal more magicule energy than the rest of them, but even then, his force is along the lines of the Three Lycanthropeers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.3">If </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.1"> is the demon lord Clayman, he is far too feeble a threat.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.1">Man, he’s brimming with confidence, too, huh?</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.1">“In terms of Lycanthropeer-level strength, I can think of three magic-born serving Clayman who would fit that description…”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.1">That many, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.2">Yep. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.3">He’s sure a demon lord, I gotta admit.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.1"> These three were three of Clayman’s five fingers, his most favored of assistants: Yamza, the middle finger; Adalmann, the pointer finger; and Nine-Head, the thumb. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.2">Mjurran, by the way, was the ring finger. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.3">The final little finger was named Pironé but was mostly involved in intelligence gathering and rarely appeared in public.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.1">I had been wondering about the Moderate Jesters group and their relation to Clayman, but Mjurran apparently knew nothing about them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.2">“Clayman was never one to trust in his underlings,” she explained, “so it wouldn’t be strange at all for him to put observers in place to keep tabs on us during missions.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.1">You could call them the audience for his puppet shows, I suppose. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.2">They might’ve been active without any of Clayman’s forces knowing, like in the orc lord battle. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.1">Better make sure I don’t forget that.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.1">“So who’s their commander, Mjurran?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.1">The leader Soei had spotted was a thin, frail-looking magic-born. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.2">His Thought Communication broadcast a perfect image of him to all of us.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.1">“This is Yamza. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.2">Yamza, the Frozen Swordmage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.3">He is a cruel, unfair, merciless lowlife but a regrettably talented one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.4">He willingly swore his loyalty to Clayman, and we never did get on well after that.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.1">So the army was led by Yamza, a magic-born and (according to Mjurran) the strongest of the five fingers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.2">Clayman had granted him an ornate, expensive magic sword with the power to freeze its targets, earning him the nickname. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.3">In other words, there was no guessing what his latent skills were without that weapon.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.1">Yamza was commanding an army of some thirty thousand magic-born, all with varying levels of power. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.2">By Soei’s estimation, around four-fifths were a solid B rank, the rest mostly an A-minus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.3">There were a few solid A’s at the top, but we’re still talking Gelmud level at best. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.4">That made them stronger and dicier than the Farmus army I annihilated but still nothing to really break a sweat over.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.1">“A little too weak, aren’t they?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.1">Right now, the number of refugees we had taken in from the Beast Kingdom of Eurazania had surpassed twenty thousand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.2">Around half, ten thousand, were in fighting shape, each averaging a B rank—which went up to A-minus after their beast transformation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.3">It was a surprisingly powerful force. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.4">Even Farmus’s most elite knight corps were lucky to average a B, and that was with assorted magical enhancements placed on them, so it said a lot about how strong Eurazania’s fighters were.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.1">Humans and beastmen were just different, down to the foundation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.2">We had a big force of them, but Carillon’s domain still had more on reserves. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.3">These were beastmen that the army recruited from nearby villages during the capital evacuation, only to have them spread out across the countryside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.4">The most powerful officers of the Beast Master’s Warrior Alliance had brought them back together, regrouped them, and sent them off to hide out at strategic points. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.5">Add their numbers up, and they, conservatively, amounted to over ten thousand themselves.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.1">Thus, we had a total of twenty thousand A-minus fighters on hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.2">Carillon really </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.1"> a demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.2">What a force he’d had on him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.466.1">“It is strange, yes,” Alvis said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.466.2">“Yamza is undoubtedly a powerful magic-born, but we Three Lycanthropeers would never lose to him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.466.3">And while his force outnumbers ours, we hold an overwhelming advantage in training and fighting ability.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.467.1">“Yeah,” agreed Phobio, “if you want leadership, we’ve got loads of it!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.468.1">“Do they think that Lord Carillon died, and we’ll just fall over like trees to them?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.468.2">Sufia sniffed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.468.3">“No, Clayman can’t be that much of a fool…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.1">All seemed to believe that Clayman’s force wasn’t much of a threat.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.1">Benimaru wasn’t as sure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.2">“One moment, though… Could Clayman be aiming at something besides this town?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.1">Ah yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.2">Maybe we had the wrong idea. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.3">Everyone was always trying to hit this town first, so Ramiris sort of assumed Clayman was after me once more and flew on over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.4">And here I was hoping we’d get to strike them from both sides once the army left Eurazania. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.5">The best-laid plans and all that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.1">“So are they marching for the Beast Kingdom?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.2">There are nothing but refugees left there, plus over ten thousand fighters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.3">They may be better in combat, but Clayman’s numbers could overwhelm them!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.1">Right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.2">Soei reported that they were camped in Milim’s domain for now, but they had already reorganized and were ready to head into Eurazania territory tomorrow or the next day. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.3">I didn’t think they’d attempt a night march, but we’d need to factor that possibility into the equation, too.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.1">“I wonder if they are aware at all that we are on the lookout for Clayman,” Geld gravely stated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.2">I wasn’t so optimistic about that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.3">Better to assume the worst; then we can take action when it happens.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.1">“But even if they are marching for this town,” observed Mjurran, “Clayman would never ignore danger from the rear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.2">He would snuff out the source of that first before proceeding.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.1">Yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.2">So would I, actually. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.3">But…“snuff it out”?!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.1">“Wait, so you mean…Clayman’s intending to kill off all the fighters in the Beast Kingdom?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.478.1">And who can say if it was </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.1">just</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.1"> the fighters…</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.1">Understood. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.2">I have predicted the actions of the demon lord Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.3">There is a 100 percent likelihood that he seeks to awaken himself to become a “true” demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.4">I do not believe this town factors into his plans. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.5">However, to achieve this, he is likely taking the crude and uncertain tactic of hunting down all remaining life in the Beast Kingdom of Eurazania.</span></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.1">Ah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.2">So genocide, then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.3">I’m a total hypocrite for saying this, but I can’t say I’m a fan of his any-means-necessary approach.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.506.1">“Why not send the goblin riders and Gabil’s force in first to stage a guerrilla resistance?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.506.2">Hakuro suggested.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.1">“No, it would mean nothing,” Benimaru calmly stated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.2">“I’ve examined the geography of the Beast Kingdom, and much of it is either flat or features low hills. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.3">There are few natural elements to conceal oneself in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.4">A surprise attack from the air would be effective, but a guerrilla force of a hundred or so simply wouldn’t be adequate.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.1">The best place to hide a force like this would be the fruit orchards lining rivers, but these were spread out across hilly areas with good drainage, so not as subtle as we’d want. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.2">The terrain wasn’t suitable for concealing large numbers of troops.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.1">“Since when were you looking into our geography?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.2">Sufia quietly groused. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.3">I was actually kind of wondering that myself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.4">Benimaru probably did some research when I sent him to lead our first envoy team into the Beast Kingdom. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.5">I guess I really </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.1">can</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.1"> rely on him to be thorough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.2">Sufia didn’t seem genuinely offended, at least.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.1">“We have a team of approximately four hundred beastmen who are geared for speed,” Alvis advised. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.2">“Bird types are rare among us—no more than a hundred. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.3">Sending them out in advance would be a death sentence.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.1">Simply being able to fly didn’t shield them from fatigue, after all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.2">If they plus Gabil’s team couldn’t even reach two hundred, there was little point deploying them first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.3">With the high visibility of the terrain, too, small squadrons couldn’t accomplish much.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.1">So for our strategy, we would have to go back to basics. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.2">Plow everything into doing what we could, as accurately as possible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.3">That’s it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.4">We’d send messages out to the fighters across the land, gather up as many civilians as we could, and evacuate them out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.5">Once they were in Tempest, the dryads’ protection should do a lot for their survival rate. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.6">We’d then have our speedier forces to use guerrilla tactics to aid in their escape. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.7">The slower armies would march as well, swallowing up the refugees as they prepared to face off against Clayman’s force.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.1">That was the basic wrap-up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.2">It was a battle against time and relied a fair bit on luck, but we didn’t have any better ideas. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.3">Thus, to prevent the worst, we decided that all of us should go out on the field to fight as well.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.1">Our top leaders—Benimaru, Shuna, Soei, Shion, Geld, and Ranga—had all learned the Spatial Motion extra skill, giving them control over “transport gates” linking two locations together. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.2">Diablo was “born” with that ability, too, but he was with Yohm’s team at the moment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.3">I could call him back if things got bad, but I wanted to handle this with us seven if possible, myself included. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.4">Each of us may’ve had the power of a whole army, but we couldn’t afford to push ourselves too far. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.5">Shuna, in particular, wasn’t too suited for on-the-ground combat; I wanted to have Gabil and Hakuro covering for her, if possible.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.1">“Guess it’s the only way,” I reasoned. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.2">“If we can help earn our forces some time, I think we can pull this off with a minimum of casualties. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.3">Would’ve been nice if we could just bring ’em all over there with regular transport magic, but…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.1">I brought up that idea mainly so I could publicly shoot it down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.2">Our problems would be solved if we had magic that could instantly transport an entire army from one point to another, but not even my Spatial Motion worked on ten thousand troops at once.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.1">But:</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.1">Understood. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.2">Transportation magic allows for the transferal of materials at a low cost. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.3">It works by using a separate dimension to link two points together, but it is not effective for handling organic matter, due to heavy magicule irradiation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.4">However, anyone protected by a Barrier would not be affected by the transport. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.5">Those are the fundamental rules of transportation magic.</span></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.1">Ummm… So that’s the difference between teleport and transport magic? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.2">It’s just that teleport costs more magicules to cast, since it includes spells to protect who you’re teleporting? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.3">Wait, so…</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.1">In other words, since magic-born and monsters have natural magicule resistance, anyone capable of erecting a Barrier over themselves can be transported successfully without issue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.2">A full-transportation spell that included measures to protect the target would also be possible.</span></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.1">So if you’re strong enough not to die when exposed to a ton of magicules, you can go across this “separate dimension” or whatever. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.2">I guess that’s the way the Spatial Motion skill works. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.3">I should’ve noticed that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.4">What’s more, if you can fully protect whoever you’re transporting, it’s no problem to send ’em over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.5">I suppose that’s a sort of teleportation, really, but wouldn’t that just waste a lot of magical energy? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.6">Besides, trying to adapt that into a legion magic you could deploy on tens of thousands of troops is far beyond what I could do right now…</span></em></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.537.1">The Lycanthropeers joined them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.537.2">“You got my trust,” Sufia declared. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.537.3">“We can’t start getting suspicious of someone whose help we’re askin’ for.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.538.1">“He’s already saved me once. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.538.2">Our fighters know that, so I ain’t about to start whining now.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.539.1">“Oh dear, Phobio, you’re making it sound like I have no choice but to agree. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.539.2">But we’re the slowest force, and as long as we are, I’ll want to rely on Sir Rimuru’s power to help us out.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.539.3">Alvis seemed a tad dubious still but not enough to turn us down.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.540.1">I nodded at them all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.540.2">“I hear you loud and clear! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.540.3">Time to turn the tables on Clayman’s schemes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.540.4">It’s all up to you men and women now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.540.5">Let me see some victory!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.1">I was starting to see some wild, ferocious smiles. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.1">If we can all make it in time, we’re sure to win. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.2">Plus, no matter how closely Clayman’s surveilling the highways, he’ll never notice our troops get transported in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.3">It’s practically in the bag.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.544.1"> No wonder everyone seemed so confident again.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.1">So I left reworking our strategy to Benimaru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.2">While he was doing that, Soei gave another report—that a group of one hundred “Dragon Faithful” had merged with Clayman’s force.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.547.1">Did Benimaru know about this group already, or…?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.1">“Soei,” I meekly asked, “what are these Dragon Faithful?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.1">“The name for those who worship the dragon—in other words, Lady Milim, the Dragon Princess.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.1">Soei didn’t have any more information yet, so we dropped the subject. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.2">For now, I ordered him to continue monitoring the Clayman army, as well as search for a suitable area to deploy our own forces.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.1">This meant it was just the usual Tempest gang and me, which put me quite a bit at ease. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.2">There was no need to hold anything back for politeness’ sake now.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.1">“I apologize,” Soei said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.2">“There is an area in the region surrounded by a thick fog of magicules. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.3">I found it too dangerous to proceed inside.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.1">No need for him to be sorry. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.2">He needed to be careful in everything he does, even with a Replication of himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.3">It’d be a lot worse if he screwed up and the enemy found out what we were up to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.4">Clayman’s HQ ought to be beyond that cloud—this was already enough of a lead to go on.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.1">“Isn’t Clayman holding Walpurgis shortly?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.2">Shuna coldly countered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.3">“I fear we may miss him entirely.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.1">“True, true,” added Hakuro as Benimaru winced. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.2">“It would reflect quite poorly on us if we underestimated the enemy force and tasted defeat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.3">We need Sir Benimaru to keep our forces together.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.2">Any other suggestions?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.1">Shion’s hand shot up.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.1">Her eyes were gleaming as she said it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.2">It was my fault for letting that idiot talk in the first place. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.3">I could feel the veins throbbing around my temples, but I held it all back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.4">This wasn’t the first time I had to deal with something like this.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.1">“Shion, how are you going to ‘slash them up’? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.2">Can you give me something more realistic to work with?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.1">Clayman solo was one thing, but picking a fight with yet more demon lords would never work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.2">We needed to handle them one at a time, something Shion would have to learn sooner rather than later.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.572.1">My scolding made her visibly depressed. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.573.1">Eesh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.573.2">Let’s try to soften the blow a bit.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.574.1"> I may not act it all the time, but I like being kind to her.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.1">“Listen, Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.2">You have experience with them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.3">Do you think I could join in this thing, too?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.579.1">“No, I just wanted to ask. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.579.2">Clayman’s gonna be there, so I thought it would be interesting if I paid a visit as well.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.1">If I’m being targeted, showing up somewhere Clayman didn’t expect me ought to rock him a little bit.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.581.1"> Resorting to violence during a Council might not be too apropos, but I could consider my options once I’m there.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.582.1">“Hmm… I think it’s probably okay. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.582.2">But you can only have two attendants along with you!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.583.1">Any more than that would lead to trouble that all the demon lords preferred to avoid. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.583.2">Once, one of the newer demon lords brought along a hundred or so warriors to the Council as a show of force. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.583.3">This stoked the ire of another demon lord whose nation had just been razed and was looking for someone—anyone—to serve as a little stress relief. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.583.4">That newer lord wound up killed, along with all the magic-born for dessert. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.583.5">Ever since, it was forbidden for relatively powerless magic-born to participate, and only two guests per demon lord were allowed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.584.1">In other words, Walpurgis Councils </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.585.1">had</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.586.1"> ended in violence before. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.586.2">Which meant it wouldn’t be, you know, unprecedented if I did it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.586.3">Maybe I should seriously consider trying to rile Clayman into a fight over there.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.587.1">“Well, what do you think, guys? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.587.2">Think it’d be fun to join in?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.588.1">“Heh-heh-heh-heh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.588.2">A wonderful suggestion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.588.3">I would be happy to join you at—”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.1">There they go. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.2">Shion and Diablo, back at it again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.3">Bringing those two along would be suicide, so I crossed them off the list from the start…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.591.1">“…But either way,” Diablo said, “if we go into battle with the demon lords, as long as we can defeat them, all is well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.591.2">What need do we have for a demon lord besides yourself, Sir Rimuru?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.1">Shion briskly nodded her total agreement. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.2">“Exactly! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.3">I had thought you were an idiot, but for a new recruit, you seem to have much potential! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.4">You stated exactly what I was trying to say!”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.1">Are they friends, or foes, or what?</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.594.1"> Whatever they were, I used to think Shion was the only one who didn’t think. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.594.2">But no, they both agreed that killing all the other demon lords was a fine idea.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.1">Why’d it turn out like this?</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.1"> Looking around the room, I could see a few other people nodding their agreement. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.2">A few were more conservative, but a lot of them seemed more interested in spilling blood than securing a victory. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.3">The flock of war hawks in my leadership seemed to be growing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.4">But that was just way too reckless. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.5">Better hit the brakes on this conversation.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.1">That seemed reasonable, at first glance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.2">But I could tell Ramiris just wanted Beretta and Veldora by her side so she could look supercool around her colleagues. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.3">Veldora probably thought along the same lines, too.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.1">“…Hmm? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.2">No, I wasn’t interested in coming so I could serve as </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.669.1">your</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.670.1"> guardian, no.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.1">“Uwehh?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.2">Oh, you’re so cold, wise teacher!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.672.1">What’s with that </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.673.1">teacher</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.674.1"> stuff? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.674.2">Ramiris and Veldora had become manga buddies in record time, I guess. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.674.3">They definitely got along, but in terms of the power balance between them, I’d say this was all Ramiris trying to curry Veldora’s favor.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.1">…Well, fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.2">The most important thing was that my presence at Walpurgis had been recognized. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.3">That was helpful for me, although it probably had more to do with how the other demon lords didn’t want to venture near human lands just to deal with me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.676.1">“We’re actually planning to start spreading rumors about you, Veldora. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.676.2">We discussed that at the summit earlier, but you knew that, right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.1">Having him be Ramiris’s attendant </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.678.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.1"> an idea. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.2">Personally, though, I wanted the other lords to think he wasn’t coming, since it’d put them off guard for me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.680.1">“Mm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.680.2">Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.680.3">Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.1">Nope. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.2">Sounds like he wasn’t paying attention. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.3">He was way too enthralled in his manga to notice any of our proceedings. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.4">In that case, it’d be easy to trick him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.1">“Well, it’s like this: If I brought you along, it’d probably make Clayman think, like, ‘Oh, that Rimuru, he’s a wimp just bringing Veldora along as a ringer.’”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.1">“What?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.2">Curse that Clayman! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.3">I’ll make him pay for that!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.4">Shion cried.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.1">“Heh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.2">That insect doesn’t know what he’s waded into,” added Diablo. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.3">“Perhaps I should come over and kill him after all.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.685.1">“Shion, Diablo, calm </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.686.1">down</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.687.1"> already,” Benimaru chided, looking a little angered himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.687.2">“That was just an example.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.1">Man, it’s </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.689.1">so</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.690.1"> easy to tick those two guys off.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.1">“Yeah, like Benimaru said, that’s just what I’m picturing him saying. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.2">So I mean, if we bring Veldora to the Council, people will be so wary of us that it’d mess up the whole point of us being there, right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.1">Veldora blinked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.2">“Hohh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.3">Ah, I see.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.1">Shion beamed, though I wasn’t sure she had thought about my words at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.2">“A fine idea! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.3">Well said, Sir Rimuru!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.1">“Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh… Still, he will pay for making light of you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.2">I’d love to make him atone with my own two hands, but perhaps I should let Shion do the honors?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.695.1">“So you’ll throw the enemy off their guard in order to make your negotiations easier?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.696.1">Benimaru, at least, had the right idea.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.1">“But shouldn’t we be avoiding danger as much as possible?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.2">asked Shuna. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.3">She had a point, and Geld and Gabil nodded their agreement.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.1">“If the enemy is going to be wary of us anyway,” added Hakuro, “would it not be best to focus more on our own safety?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.699.1">Soei gave this a silent nod of his own.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.1">I could understand everyone’s worries, sure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.2">But I could cover for that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.701.1">“It’s all right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.701.2">I can actually call for Veldora anytime I want with the Summon Storm Dragon skill. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.701.3">That doesn’t count as an attendant, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.701.4">So if things go bad, I can ask for his help then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.701.5">Until that happens, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.702.1">if</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.703.1"> it does, I want him protecting this town.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.704.1">I smiled triumphantly at the audience, asking them to defy me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.1">My leadership seemed impressed, at least, as did Veldora: “Gwaaaaahhhh-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.2">I see! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.3">I’ll be the great hero who swoops in to the rescue at the last moment!”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.706.1">Great. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.706.2">If you’re fine with that, so am I.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.707.1">“Isn’t that kinda unfair…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.708.1">“Don’t be stupid, Ramiris. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.708.2">I was hoping you’d call it smart.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.1">Ramiris may not have liked it much, but Veldora was already murmuring his agreement. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.2">Just one more push…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.710.1">“Besides, that gives you one more slot to fill for Walpurgis, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.711.1">This visibly excited her, as it did the rest of my government.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.712.1">“Oh, that totally makes sense, Rimuru! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.712.2">So who’re you gonna match me with?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.1">I guess she had no complaints. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.2">Really, I think all she wanted was a chance to show off to the other demon lords. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.3">But at least she was on my side.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.714.1">Now for that last one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.714.2">I could feel all the unpicked holding their breath, but sadly for them, I needed someone strong in that position. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.714.3">Benimaru would’ve been great, but he’d kinda be handling a war in my absence, so I went with someone else:</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.715.1">“Sorry to disappoint you all, but I’d like Haku—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.716.1">“A moment, please!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.1">I was stopped by the woman standing behind Ramiris—Treyni.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.718.1">“Sir Rimuru, I hope you will give me this assignment!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.719.1">“Oh, Treyni! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.719.2">Just look at you!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.720.1">Ramiris was already tearfully accepting the offer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.720.2">Well, so be it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.721.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.721.2">I’ll let you go along, Treyni.”</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.722.1">Now we had our member assignments for the Walpurgis Council. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.722.2">Me, with Shion and Ranga as my attendants, and Ramiris, with Beretta and Treyni under her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.722.3">Then, if we needed it, Veldora was a quick summon away.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.723.1">Lucky thing, indeed, that I was accepted.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.1">Me and Leon Cromwell also kind of had some issues to tackle, but I’d settle with just meeting him in person this time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.2">I had Shizu’s request to fulfill, and I didn’t want to ignore that forever, but my target right now was Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.3">I hadn’t forgotten about the orc lord chaos or about Mjurran.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.725.1">But most of all, I was concerned about Milim. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.725.2">One slipup, and I might be forced to fight her next. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.725.3">I was prepared to face down Clayman, but the idea of a life-and-death struggle with Milim made me singularly unenthusiastic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.725.4">It’d be great if I could get all that worked out at Walpurgis. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.725.5">If not, I’ll think of something then.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.726.1">Clayman, you’ve made an enemy out of me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.726.2">And I’m not lenient enough to easily forgive someone I’ve identified as such. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.726.3">You better be ready for me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.726.4">And if you lay a hand on any of my people, you can expect to pay for everything you dish out.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.727.1">Dahh… Now I’m starting to adopt Shion’s way of thinking.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.728.1"> Still, I couldn’t help but feel a little happy about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.728.2">The time for fretting in darkened rooms was over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.728.3">Now we had a clear, concrete goal to reach out to.</span></p>
