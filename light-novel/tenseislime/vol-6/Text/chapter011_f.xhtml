<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">“You, you have to be kidding me! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.2">All, all of you… You’ll pay; I’ll make you all pay for this!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">The scream of the pitiful clown echoed across the field, and…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“Shion, do it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">“You got it!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Like a hungry dog released from the command to stay, Shion bounded off, using both hands to swing down her blade as quickly as she possibly could. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">It was a single blow from her sword, a judging strike. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">Clayman did his best to block it, but his three pairs of arms were all sliced off, his body slashed diagonally down from head to toe. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">It was unsurvivable—and that one stroke from Shion’s spirit-crushing blade made Clayman fall wordlessly to the ground.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">It was over for Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">Carillon was alive, and we had all the testimony in order. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">I’m pretty sure I could avoid being branded the enemy of the demon lords now.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Clayman was barely clinging to life. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">He was no longer a threat; there was no way left for him to turn the tables. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">Things were already set in stone, and there would be no more excuses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4">So, before the demon lords, he had revealed everything. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.5">And each of them might take the news differently, but regardless, their trust in him had vanished, none willing to cover for him.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">The barrier covering us was removed, and Frey quickly ran up and approached Milim.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“I believed you were still of sound mind, but I truly had my doubts at times, Milim! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">And you kept our promise anyway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">I appreciate that.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">“Wah-ha-ha-ha-sha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">Of course I did. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">We’re friends. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.4">But you’ve been taking care of that for me, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.5">Didja bring it over?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">“Yes, yes, you mean this, right? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">I have to say, though, withstanding the Orb of Domination was simply amazing…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">As they spoke, Frey took something out of her pocket and handed it to Milim. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">It was the Dragon Knuckle I gave her as a present. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">Milim accepted it like a kid on her birthday and immediately put it on, beaming ear to ear.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">The rest of the demon lords, seeing this, finally put two and two together, and I could hear whispers all around the room.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">“Such a cheap performance.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“I—I saw through it the whole time!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">“Yes, I assumed as much.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">“Yeah, I figured…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">I don’t think I was the only one Milim tricked, but everyone else found the results just as plausible as I did.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Then I heard a groan from below, like the sound of blood being coughed up.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“…When? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Since when were you deceiving me…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">It was Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">He was still breathing, still incapable of grasping the unbelievable reality before him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">And it was Milim who revealed the cruel truth.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">“Y’know, I had a real hard time doing it! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">With that promise I made with Frey, I had to pretend you tricked me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">Then I put on that pendant and made you think it was working on me.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“You… You couldn’t… I put my full power into it, with the Orb of Domination… The perfect…ultimate Demon Dominate…?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">And you…you…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">“Uh-huh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">Most magic like that bounces off me pretty easily, so… First I had to remove all my barriers, then hold back my force so I didn’t passively resist it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">I had to convince you that the curse was working before your own eyes, or else you’d be far too wary to believe me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.4">So I had to work really hard!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“Wh…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">What…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">You… You accepted it on purpose?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.4">My most valuable Artifact… My hidden gem, the ability to control demon lords…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">“Oh, was that what it was? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Well, too bad you could never control me!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">She stuck her chest out, looking relentlessly proud of herself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“Yeah, really,” I commented. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">“I feel stupid for worrying about you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">And between that two-fisted sports pose and the smile you had on your face, your acting abilities really suck.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">“What do you want from me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">I was just glad to see you were all angry for me, Rimuru.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">Frey just shrugged at this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">“Still,” she said, “when Clayman punched you, I thought I was going to lose my composure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">If you decided to fight back against him, you would’ve destroyed my home. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.4">Great job putting up with him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.5">That, at least, I have to compliment you for.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">An interesting revelation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">So that wasn’t the first time Clayman physically abused her? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">What a nutcase. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.4">Was he actively trying to get himself killed?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">“Mm-hmm! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">I’m all grown up now, too, y’know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">So I can deal with stuff like that!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">That obsession with being grown up indicated all too well how childish she still was.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“Oh, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">how</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">Frey protested. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">“…Well, that’s fine, but you couldn’t have dealt with all that just because of our promise, could you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.4">What did you really want?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“Hmm? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Well, you know, I remember Clayman talking to me about some weird stuff before. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">Like, about making Rimuru into an enemy of mankind and triggering a war between humans and monsters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.4">If he did that, that wouldn’t be too fun for me, so I thought I’d meddle a bit!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“Heavens. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">Imagine, you lifting a finger for somebody else.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">I told you—I’m all grown up now!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“Yes, yes, let’s just call it that.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Well, huh… I suppose Milim was sharp enough to realize Clayman was doing someone else’s bidding. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">So she pretended to be brainwashed in order to find out who it was? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">She had some kind of promise or deal with Frey, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.4">Let’s just ignore the fact that she totally tricked me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">The thing to focus on was: That orb didn’t hypnotize her at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">She didn’t struggle out of it midway; it never worked once. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">It was all an award-winning performance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.4">As she later explained to me, she had been consuming bell peppers to maintain her poker face. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.5">The blank expression that resulted from eating this detested food of hers made everyone think her mind had been erased. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.6">It wasn’t enough to trick Veldora, but he played along, enjoying the combat session as a way to get limber in his new body. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.7">Maybe he was a lot more adaptable to things than I thought.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">Like, seriously, Raphael, you never saw it?</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">……</span></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">Oh, um, okay. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">Guess you did try to tell me something.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">I suppose it telling me “No results” should’ve been pretty bleedingly obvious, looking back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">Of course it couldn’t find any curse effects on her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">I was just jumping to conclusions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.4">I should really adopt the habit of listening more carefully to people—that and hearing them out until the end.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">I wasn’t about to tell anyone about it, but, yes, I had my personal regrets.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“By the way,” Carillon asked as he strode up to Milim, “if I could ask you something?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">She smiled back with the Dragon Knuckle eased into her fingers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">“Mm? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">Sure! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.4">Anything!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“I just wanted to be sure… You weren’t under anyone’s control? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">So that was all </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">you</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1"> when you were whipping the life out of me?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">Carillon was smiling, too, but I could see the veins on his forehead bulging. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">Yeah, I’d be wondering about that, too.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">“Huh?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">That, um…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">“It’s fine, it’s fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">It just means I’m weaker than you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">But,” he added, no longer hiding his anger, “you willfully blew up my entire nation, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">Milim was caught off guard for a moment—before immediately raging back at him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">“Oh, come on, Carillon! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">That’s the kind of small stuff you’re preoccupied with? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">What’s it matter?!”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">Yep, that’s the real Milim, all right.</span></em></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">Kazalim was alive and well, and he had no way to congratulate him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.2">More just deserts for him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.3">He had been ordered to sit tight and watch how things unfolded, and he ignored those orders for his own petty reasons.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">Yes, it was Clayman’s mistake, made in the worst possible fashion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.2">And just like Kazalim, he was defeated in the most shameful way—by a freshly born demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.3">Karma in action, one could say—but to Clayman, it hurt more than anything else.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">If it had come to this, he at least wanted to pass on what he knew. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">The thought kindled the light of life in Clayman before he could completely resign himself to his fate.</span></p>

<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">So heaven hasn’t forsaken me yet!</span></em></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">He was weak, too weak to even use his voice, but Clayman’s soul was burning bright—his life was a raging flame. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.2">And now, with a coolness that was quite the opposite of what was in his heart, Clayman resolved to retreat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.3">The older demon lords—Guy, Milim, and Daggrull, in particular—were too much to handle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.4">Simply awakening wouldn’t give him the winning edge against them, and now was no time for recklessness.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">First, he would report back to the boy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">That took precedence over everything. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.3">The despicable slime he looked down upon was still a question mark, but even the magic-born that served him were stronger than Clayman—and he was on good terms with a revived Veldora, a point he couldn’t afford to ignore. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.4">Anyone who survived a confrontation with Hinata couldn’t have done so out of sheer luck.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">He needed to abandon his rose-colored glasses and analyze things for what they were. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.2">And that was why he had to take the information he learned here and bring it back.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">Quickly, he assembled a plan. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.2">His idea: to release a massive ball of magical force, as much as he could manage, and slip out of this chamber in the chaos.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">I will need to watch out for Guy…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">Guy had no time to deal with weaklings. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">He probably wasn’t even paying attention to Clayman any longer.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">…It’s all right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">I’ll get out of here, I promise</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">And if he could take out a few demon lords along the way, he thought as he scrambled to his feet, all the better.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">When I first laid eyes on Clayman earlier, I could see a large number of rifts in the air around him, as if they were attached to his soul. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">It was malice personified, the remains of the souls from the people he had killed up to now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.3">But I couldn’t just take them from him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.4">They couldn’t go on to the afterlife, and they couldn’t dissolve into the air. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.5">If I killed Clayman, they’d go down with him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">As I thought over what I could do about this, Raphael suggested a plan of action: force Clayman into a corner and make him awaken to a “true” demon lord.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">Suggestion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.2">If you use Belzebuth to consume the energy Clayman releases upon awakening, it will be possible to restore your magicules.</span></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">It was easy for Raphael to say, but there was a litany of problems with that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.2">I didn’t know if Clayman would awaken, and if he did, he’d undoubtedly be powered up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.3">But hey, um, wouldn’t he just fall asleep, like with my Harvest Festival?</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">Understood. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.2">Since Clayman’s evolution did not follow the standard procedure, the process will not be fully complete. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.3">As a result, it is believed that he will not require sleep.</span></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">So sort of a limited power-up, then. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">I guess I’ll just have to defeat an awakened Clayman, then.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">According to Raphael’s predictive calculations, defeating him would be a breeze no matter how much he was enhanced. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.2">That was based on everything from his core strength to the power he could earn and the skills he was likely to acquire. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.3">Even at the maximum threat level, its answers indicated I was still on top of him.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">Besides, it was kind of true that my magical energy was just about ready to bottom out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.2">I could replenish it really fast, so it’d bounce right back after deploying a large-scale spell, but restoring it to full actually took a while. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.3">Although I had more energy than my awakening took, I was also using Veldora this whole time as a fuel tank to restore it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.4">With him no longer part of me, it was natural to want to keep my own magicules topped off.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">It’d also earn me some street cred with the other demon lords. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">As the new recruit, I needed to seize a seat at the round table with my own power. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.3">Showing off my battlefield skill was the best way to earn their acceptance without stirring up trouble in the future. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.4">If I didn’t want ’em wheedling me later, I wanted them to think that </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">I</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1"> shouldn’t be messed with.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">So I walked toward Clayman, now fully on his feet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.2">The other demon lords were content with watching, seemingly all right with me fighting alone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.3">I was sure they wanted to gauge what I had, so I assumed they wouldn’t complain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.4">Milim was brightly smiling at me, and Ramiris was happily humming to herself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.5">Nobody was doubting my chances—which I took as them believing in me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">“Shion, Ranga, step back.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">“But…!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">“I’ve got this.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">“Y-yes sir!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">“Good luck, Sir Rimuru.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">The other lords gave them enough distance to retreat away so that I wouldn’t unwittingly hurt anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">Now I was alone, and Clayman gave me his sickly little laugh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.2">“Heh-heh-heh, ha-ha-ha-ha-haaaah! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.3">Look at me! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.4">I’ve obtained the power! </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">You</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1"> thought I was finished, you worm! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">Now prepare to be crushed!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">The laughter grew louder as he looked down at me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.2">But it was all an act. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.3">It was sad, how well Raphael had predicted all his moves.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">As it described matters, there were two potential strategies Clayman could take. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">One was a desperate bull rush to kill me; the other was to sneer at me, make me lose my cool, and search for a path of escape. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.3">Evidently, he chose the latter, and that meant I knew what he’d do next.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">I grimaced at him, keeping my eyes firmly on every move he made. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">Clayman was looking for an opening. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.3">So I played along with his performance.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">“I told you, you’re cornered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.2">I’m stronger than you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.3">Give it up and tell me whose bidding you’re doing.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">Of course, in my case, it wasn’t a performance—it was what I really wanted from him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.2">Perhaps that was why Clayman so easily took the bait.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">“Heh-heh-heh… Impertinent to the end, I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.2">Once I release my—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">He kept up the act as he suddenly took action. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.2">He must’ve figured I was off my guard, because he fired a massive ball of magical energy from out of nowhere. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.3">Must’ve been building it up as we talked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.4">It was a huge, superpowered blast, one that contained all the energy he had just awakened into, and it was hurtling straight my way.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">Clayman assumed I would dodge it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.2">That or maybe fire off a blast of my own to neutralize it, although a spur-of-the-moment spell like that from me wouldn’t be enough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.3">If I jumped away, it’d explode in midair; if I tried blowing it up, he’d be able to escape in the resulting gigantic explosion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.4">That, I imagine, were his thoughts.</span></p>
