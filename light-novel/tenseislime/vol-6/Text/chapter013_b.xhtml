<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">“But Lady Valentine—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">“If I’ve been unmasked in front of </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1"> many people, there’s no point keeping up the charade.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">She glared at Veldora yet again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">“It…it’s not my fault—I didn’t know,” he stammered, feeling out of sorts and trying to avoid her gaze. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">To Milim, meanwhile, it was already someone else’s problem. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">The topic was over in her mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.5">Selfish as always, I could see.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Perhaps understanding that more than most, Valentine seemed ready to drop the subject, as peeved as she was about all this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">Shaking off her anger, she stood before Roy, now comfortably back in the servant role.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">“Anyway,” she intoned, “there is something that concerns me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">When Clayman looked at you, his eyes stopped for a moment, did they not? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">He might be involved with those cockroaches that invaded my domain earlier. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.4">I want you to return home and inform my people to step up our security.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Guess Carillon and I weren’t the only guys Clayman picked a fight with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">No wonder everybody hated him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">Maybe he was just trying to discover where Valentine’s domain was—it was still a secret—but even for a data-gathering fiend like him, sometimes it was all too easy to step over the line.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“…Yes, my lady.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Roy left the chamber alone, not questioning Valentine’s order for a moment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">No, he had no business being on the throne at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">He really </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1"> just a political stand-in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">It was, I suppose, a sign of Valentine’s power and influence.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Time to switch gears. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">I plucked the round table out from my Stomach and set it back in place. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.3">Good thing I thought about storing it before I smashed it up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.4">If battle had broken out before the barrier was in place, I’m sure it would’ve been a mess. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.5">The thing looked </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">far</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1"> too fancy for restitution to be cheap.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">All the demon lords sat back down at the table, while Guy’s two maids prepared some tea for us.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">“Ah,” Leon suddenly said next to me, “I just remembered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">I thought I had heard the name Kazalim somewhere before, but that’s the demon lord I killed, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">I thought I was gonna spit the tea out right there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">How could he be so nonchalant with that?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“You know him, Leon?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">And how could Milim not know that? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">The other demon lords seemed similarly unfazed, many apparently clueless about the guy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">Even Ramiris had completely forgotten. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.4">I thought she kept her memories whenever she was reborn? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.5">I wanted to poke fun at her about it, but that’d just be mean.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">…So what’s Kazalim got to do with this?</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">…Understood. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">The word Kazalim was uttered by Clayman as he called for help.</span></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">Oh, right, right! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">Now I remember. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">He </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">did</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1"> scream something like that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">I totally remember that, so hopefully nobody’s putting me on the same boat with Milim and Ramiris.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">“So how is this Kazalim related to Clayman?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">I asked.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“Kazalim is the Curse Lord,” Carillon explained. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">“You and he recommended me to this post, didn’t you, Milim?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“Ohhhh, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">him</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">The Curse Lord, I remember. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">Huh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.4">So that’s the demon lord Leon killed?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">So she knew him by his nickname? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">That made a little sense. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">But really, it’s not like Leon killed any </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">other</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1"> demon lords. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">If I had to guess, she probably almost forgot since it was just all too boring to her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“Right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">Kazalim was a walking dead like Clayman,” said Carillon, his voice a tad nostalgic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">“A unique monster, he said, evolved by himself from an elf. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.4">I was kinda friendly with him, so that’s what he told me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.5">The two of them must’ve been connected behind the scenes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.6">Clayman took over Kazalim’s old seat, besides.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">Unlike Clayman, Carillon didn’t seem to have any bad blood for this guy. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">But hang on a minute. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">I almost let it pass, but if Kazalim’s a walking dead, too…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“Is Kazalim still alive? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Maybe he just pretended Leon killed him, and he’s hiding out somewhere?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“Yeah,” agreed Carillon, “that might be the case. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">He was a really sharp guy, you know? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3">You had to be even more careful with him than Clayman.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">So maybe I was right.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“Well,” Leon naturally objected, “I don’t much like you phrasing it like I let him get away. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">He invited me to join his force, claiming he would help me become a demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">Turning him down would have led to assorted annoyances, so I decided to defeat him and seize his position. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.4">Whether he’s alive or dead, it doesn’t matter to me.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Certainly, I could see it if Leon just wanted to stage a display of power without actually wanting to kill him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">“Whoa there, Leon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">That’s exactly why Clayman hated you, you realize.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“Hmph. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">Do you think I care?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">Yeah, to Leon, the whole subject was just an annoyance, no doubt. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">I didn’t realize Clayman was trying to put the screws to Leon, too, though. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.3">He was just trying to hit everyone up, wasn’t he? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.4">I was starting to wonder just how smart he really was.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">Still, I was starting to gain a picture of what Kazalim and Clayman were up to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">Leon had taken his seat here around two centuries ago, so maybe Kazalim got Carillon and Clayman into the club, then tried to earn a few more friends for himself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">Clayman’s earlier scheme to turn an orc lord into a demon lord seemed like kind of a rehash of that—he wanted more people friendly to him, so he could wield more power at Walpurgis. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.4">Trying to build blocs of voters, like in an Earth government, was a surprisingly sneaky and non-demon-lord-like move, I thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.5">A pretty powerful one, too.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“Among Clayman’s allies were a group called the Moderate Jesters,” I said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">“Those Jesters hinted that they had connections among the human world, so perhaps the resurrected Kazalim has taken human form, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">According to Leon, Kazalim’s body disappeared after he was defeated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">If he was alive again, it’d be in his spiritual-body form at first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">It made sense that he’d then install himself into the physical body of something else. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.4">Reviving himself within the realm of a demon lord would lead to being instantly discovered, and considering nobody had found him yet, that theory could be safely discounted.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“You might be correct,” Guy unexpectedly stated. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">“Leon’s attacks have the power to destroy your spirit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">If anything, I would mightily praise Kazalim for surviving. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.4">Plus, even for demons like ourselves, a full resurrection from our souls alone takes hundreds of years. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.5">I doubt a walking dead could ever perform it alone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.6">Not without assistance.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Walking dead, unlike demons, were dependent on their physical bodies. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Full resurrection from the astral body took time, and if anything, Kazalim being alive would be a small miracle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">So did Guy mean to imply that Kazalim had help? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.4">It all seemed connected, but for now, we had no further evidence to go on.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“Well, either way, I’ll just assume he’s alive and stay on my guard for him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">If I just killed Clayman, he might be out for revenge.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">Why worry, Rimuru? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">You’re a lot stronger than him now!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">“Milim,” I shouted, “that’s the exact kind of cockiness that leads to getting killed!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">Thanks to my victory today, Clayman’s forces were out of the picture. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">I didn’t think our foes would make any moves for a while, but we still had to keep a sharp watch out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">Me alone was one thing, but I now had legions of friends to keep safe. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.4">We’d have to devote more resources to our defense and think up ways to handle the threats ahead.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">After some more chatting, the Council continued. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">With the one who called it out of the meeting, Guy took over in his place.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">“The main subject of this Council was Carillon’s betrayal and the rise of Rimuru over there, but those issues have been settled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">Carillon has betrayed no one, and Rimuru has demonstrated ample power to join our ranks. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.3">Personally, I’d be happy to adjourn this session here, but an opportunity like this doesn’t come along every day. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.4">Does anyone have something they’d like to say to the other demon lords?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">“Could I, perhaps? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">Since we’re in the middle of this Council, I have a suggestion to give, or really, more a request,” Frey said.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">Frey nodded at Guy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">“Starting today, I’ve decided to serve Milim. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.3">As a result, I want to abdicate from my seat as a demon lord.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">“Wait, Frey! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">I didn’t hear anything about that!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">“No, because I didn’t say anything about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">But I’ve been thinking about it for a while, do you see?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">She squinted, as if looking at some faraway point. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">Then she laughed, like she was recalling something amusing.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Frey had no trust in Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">That was why she believed in Milim, putting her own safety in the balance as she pretended to accept his terms.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">“But, Frey,” Daggrull interrupted, “you specialize in high-speed aerial combat, do you not? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">I see no reason to depreciate yourself like this.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">“You’re right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">If it was in the air, I would have the advantage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.3">But demon lords don’t have the right to make excuses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.4">Besides, I know quite well how having an advantage doesn’t mean anything, at times.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">She paused to give me a look, her voice resolute.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">“So I’ve decided to become one of Milim’s followers instead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">Plus, Milim can’t afford to be as selfish as she is forever, can she? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.3">She needs to think about managing her domain, sooner or later.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">In other words, Frey wasn’t just thinking for herself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">Milim was a wild child, and you couldn’t just let her off the leash. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">Someone to both support and keep an eye on her was definitely needed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">Despite Frey’s own admission, I really couldn’t see her as being that weak. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">If anything, she was a strategist in a different way from Clayman, a strange, eerie leader who never let you see what she thought about you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.3">The type that reminded you just how formidable her sex could be.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">What would happen, though, if this actually happened? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">Thinking of Frey in terms of a servant, not as a demon lord, she definitely had enough power to be an aid to Milim. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.3">She didn’t really have a nation of her own, but if Frey joined her, they’d no doubt have a formal territory in place before long. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.4">We’d have to think about building political relations soon after, and with Frey handling them, I bet the negotiations would get pretty thorny. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.5">Thorny, but still fun.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">Frey turned toward Milim. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">“What do you think? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">Will you accept my suggestion?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">“Ooh, I don’t really like to keep a citizenry to rule over—”</span></p>

<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">He</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1"> wasn’t asking for feedback.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">I could understand the logic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">With these guys, might always makes right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.3">Still, though… I mean, Milim didn’t have anyone under her, no advisers or officers to go out against this, but was it really okay for two demon lords to step down and join her side?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">“Wait a minute, Carillon! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">That one-on-one was all Clayman’s fault! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.3">I was under mind control. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.4">I don’t know anything about it!”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Eesh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">I really don’t think that excuse is gonna work, Milim.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1"> I could see the other demon lords rolling their eyes at her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">“Don’t play dumb with me, you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">You just declared a minute ago that ‘Oooh, nobody can take over </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">my</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1"> mind, no!’”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">It was a remarkably good impression on Carillon’s part. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.2">He had quite a talent for acting.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">“Mgh?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">I, um, that…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">“Well, that muscle-bound idiot can wait. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">What about me, Milim?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">“You—you aren’t all saying this to trick me, are you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">If you start ‘serving’ me, that means we can’t talk all casually any longer, yeah? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.3">You won’t play with me, and we won’t come up with any more fun schemes, yeah?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">Frey shook her head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">“No. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.3">I’ll get to be together with you all the time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.4">We’ll get to have more fun than ever.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">I could see the brainwashing— Er, the </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">temptation</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1"> take hold. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">See? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.3">This is why you gotta watch out for her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">Carillon, meanwhile, was taking the fastball-down-the-middle approach. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">“Besides,” he complained, “you’re the one who blew my entire damn country away! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.3">Rimuru said he’ll help me out with that, but </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">you’ve</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1"> got a duty to support us, too!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">I didn’t think she did, really, but Milim was always weak with complicated concepts like this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">Man, he was smarter than I thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.3">Milim’s eyes were bouncing to and fro; he almost had her—and then, growing weary of thinking at all, she exploded.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">“Daaahhhh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">All right! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.3">Just do whatever you guys feel like!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">Smoke flew from her head like an erupting volcano as she abandoned all sentient thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">That’s Milim for you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.3">She acted all smart, but she really sucked at critical thinking.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">“Are you really sure about this, Carillon?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">Guy asked.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">“I am. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">I’ve been thinking, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.3">Not about abdicating the throne of the Beast Kingdom, but about maybe building some kind of new structure with Milim at the top of it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">Guy scoffed at this, looking disappointed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">“I liked you, though. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.3">In another hundred years, I was expecting </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">you</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1"> to awaken, too.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">Then he grinned at him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.3">“But very well! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.4">From this moment, Frey and Carillon are no longer demon lords. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.5">You are free to serve Milim in any manner you please.”</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">Now the abdication was official, and nobody voiced any further complaint. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">Myself included, of course.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">So now I was officially deemed a demon lord, one had dropped out due to brutal death, and two had stepped down to become vassals answering directly to Milim. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">The Ten Great Demon Lords were now eight.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">Clayman’s old domain was also something of a buffer zone bordering the Eastern Empire. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.2">We’d have to investigate how he administrated it and build defense lines as needed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.3">Kind of a pain in the ass; someone would need to devote a lot of detail-oriented work to it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.4">But that was something for Milim and her new government to think about. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.5">I had my own priorities to manage.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">These demon lords tended not to sweat the details, no, but they did have ways of keeping in touch. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.2">That was the function of the ring granted to each one, as a symbol of their post. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.3">Not only did they identify the wearer; they also provided for interdimensional calls between demon lords, either secret ones between two people or party lines with multiple participants.</span></p>
