<p>“They’re pointing their greatest force toward our main army?! What are the lookouts doing?!”</p>
<p>“Allow me to interrupt, sir! We can’t make contact with our lookouts. Someone has killed them all!”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>The enemy was moving so fast, they were completely behind on dealing with them. By the time Yamza noticed that, they were already lethally late. The realization made the blood drain from his head. There would be no regrouping now—even escape would be fiendishly difficult.</p>
<p><em>No. No, no, no, no, no!! I may not even be able to escape here with my life!</em></p>
<p>Yamza began to panic. If this was one-on-one, he might be able to deal with that, but he wasn’t self-absorbed enough to think he stood a chance against a squadron like this.</p>
<p>“Buy me some time! I will return to our homeland and bring Adalmann back here. He can summon the dead to restore our forces!”</p>
<p>It was just a pretext. He already knew all was lost, and he had decided to run away, as fast as possible. Luckily, he had only volunteered his fealty to Clayman, so his behavior was not restricted the way it was with the other four fingers. Following him any farther would be suicide, and that made it easy for Yamza to sever all ties.</p>
<p>“Yes sir!”</p>
<p>“We can give you three hours, sir!”</p>
<p>His men each gave him stern, resolved looks that did nothing to move his heart. All he could think about was how stupid they were. The next moment, he chanted a teleportation spell. But something was off.</p>
<p>“It’s…not working? Is this a…Spatial Blockade?!”</p>
<p>Yes. He was already too late. The moment Yamza and his men saw Alvis, Alvis’s gaze landed on them as well, thanks to the power of her skill Snake Eyes. It was an extra skill, one that applied a large variety of ailments—paralysis, poison, insanity, and so forth—and worked on anyone caught in her line of vision. A tremendously useful skill, the only way to escape it was by either successfully resisting it or simply weathering it out.</p>
<p>And Alvis had another card up her sleeve—the unique skill Oppressor. This spatial skill gave her the effects of Mind Accelerate, Spatial Control, and Spatial Motion, letting her impede enemy movement and give her allies superior positioning.</p>
<p class="space-break">A single motion from her was enough to neutralize all the masses surrounding Yamza. The more weakhearted of them were instantly driven mad; the stronger ones were still paralyzed long enough for the poison to kill them off. Some had even been turned to stone. Less than a hundred managed to emerge unscathed. Before they could put up any resistance, the unworthy had been denied even the right to stand before Alvis.</p>
<p>Her Spatial Control had snuffed out Yamza’s magic, having the power to both obstruct spells and fix their spatial coordinates in place to prevent them from affecting the air around the caster at all. No magical escape from this area was possible now—“this area” being the range of Alvis’s vision. The entire battlefield was now in her total control. Such was the power of the Golden Snakehorn.</p>
<p class="space-break">Realizing escape was impossible, Yamza gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>He still had a last resort. But it was a forbidden one, one that he’d prefer not to use. Beyond that, the only path to survival involved winning this.</p>
<p>“…So be it. Let’s show them what we’ve got.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Sir Yamza!”</p>
<p>“Sir Yamza at his finest could overwhelm even the Three Lycanthropeers!”</p>
<p>“Let me join you, sir! Our fighting will surely please Sir Clayman!”</p>
<p>His men were elated for the fight. Yamza found it boundlessly foolish. The demon lord Clayman sought only two things: victory and profit. He would never accept this performance—wasteful attrition, followed up by total defeat.</p>
<p><em>The only thing he believes in is pure, unadulterated power…</em></p>
<p>No matter how faithful Yamza was to him, Clayman never saw him as one of his own. He was just a useful pawn, a talented minion; that was as far as the lord’s affection went. The Ice Blade had been a gift, yes, but it was simply provided in an effort to strengthen him. It was all for Clayman’s sake.</p>
<p>Still, Yamza provided him with respect and reverence, and the gifts he received in return helped. They both had a common interest. But Yamza had no intention of offering his life to Clayman.</p>
<p><em>…About time to head out. I have to survive this and bounce back!</em></p>
<p>This failure would force him to go into hiding for a while. But a Special-A talent like him, a giant among high-level magic-born, would no doubt be picked up by another demon lord before long, he thought.</p>
<p>(I like this,) he Thought Communicated to Alvis. (One of the greatest magic-born under the Beast Master’s command, part of the valorous Three Lycanthropeers. Are you willing to duel with me?)</p>
<p>It was a risky bet. He wanted to defeat Alvis, the strongest figure in the group, and crush the enemy’s will to fight. Perhaps that would be enough to change the script—and even if it didn’t end well, he thought it could give him a chance to escape.</p>
<p>(Very well, Sir Yamza—head of the five fingers beneath the demon lord Clayman. I will show you how far out of your element you are!)</p>
<p>This, Alvis thought, would prove once and for all where Clayman and Lord Carillon stood with each other. She promptly transported herself before him with Spatial Motion, and in an instant, Clayman’s surviving servants swarmed over her.</p>
<p>It was not what one would normally call a strategy. Beastmen are mostly simple folk, easily provoked, and this cowardly approach took full advantage of that. If they can exhaust Alvis, even a little bit, that’ll make it easier for Yamza to win—such was the reasoning behind this kamikaze strike.</p>
<p>“You think those tricks will work?!” Alvis shouted as she turned up the intensity on her Snake Eyes. To Yamza, though, they had already done more than enough. That single instant, when Alvis used her power, was the exact thing Yamza needed for his assured victory.</p>
<p>“…Got you!!”</p>
<p>In a flash, he was upon her, slashing his sword at her exposed back. And just before the tip of his blade reached her body—</p>
<p>“Nuh-uh! Backstabbing someone like that’s not manly at all!”</p>
<p>Someone had leaped straight out from Alvis’s shadow, babbling to himself as he deflected Yamza’s sword.</p>
<p>“Dehh! Who’re you?!”</p>
<p>“I’m Gobta! We were hiding out just in case this happened!”</p>
<p>As he explained that, more and more figures popped out from the shadow. They were, of course, the Unified, four-legged goblin riders, tapping their physical agility to attack the magic-born that were still moving.</p>
<p>“And you didn’t tell me?” Alvis said. “I was wondering why something didn’t feel quite right.”</p>
<p>She had actually noticed them all along. That was why she was unafraid to go plunging in like this.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh! Benimaru ordered us to,” Gobta casually replied as he fired off a Case Cannon bolt at Yamza. He could tell the moment he crossed blades with him that this wasn’t a battle for him to win. So while the commander was distracted by his short sword, he thought now would be his best chance. Gobta’s definition of <em>fair and square</em> differed a bit from the norm—it was something he asked of his foes but never followed himself.</p>
<p>Still, Yamza managed to deflect the blast with his sword.</p>
<p>“Out of my way, weakling!”</p>
<p>He pointed the tip of his blade at Gobta and cast a spell, sending an Icicle Lance hurtling his way. Gobta simply used his dagger to fire an Icicle Lance of his own—not to fire back, but because he had planned for this follow-up strike from the start. It wound up saving Gobta’s life, as the two magic bolts met in the air and dissipated.</p>
<p>“That… That had as much force as this magic sword?! And without casting? Cheeky little weakling, are we…?”</p>
<p>Now Yamza recognized Gobta as his foe—but Gobta had already pretty well exhausted his arsenal. <em>Uh-oh. I couldn’t follow that counter of his at all. That ice just happened to save me, but if he stabs me with that thing, I’m a goner. Probably oughtta start runnin’, huh?</em></p>
<p>Fortunately, the goblin riders had already made their contribution to this fight. No one would complain if they retreated now. Gobta made up his mind.</p>
<p>“All right, let’s pull—”</p>
<p>But just as he began to make the order, Yamza’s sword sailed right past his nose.</p>
<p>“Pyah?!”</p>
<p>In another stroke of luck, he had taken a timid step back just in the nick of time. It made Yamza almost lose his nerve. <em>This little sneak made it past my attack three times?</em> Three in a row couldn’t be any coincidence, as he saw it—that supersonic swipe he just made proved that the hobgoblin before him was no also-ran.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… Oh, how the Lycanthropeers have fallen! Sneaking their minions into a one-on-one duel!”</p>
<p>The boast, made with wide-open, bloodshot eyes, was part of Yamza’s strategy. By his estimation, dealing with both a Lycanthropeer and this mystery intruder at once was dangerous.</p>
<p>Gobta seized the opportunity. <em>Woo-hoo! That means I don’t have to fight this crazy-dangerous magic-born, right?</em></p>
<p>He suppressed his joy just long enough to declare “All right, I’ll serve as an observer for this duel, then!” Yep. Definitely an observer. With all his tactics exhausted, that beat just standing there and getting in the way. Rimuru could accept defeat, but he could never accept his people getting killed in action. Gobta wasn’t stupid enough to volunteer to be war casualty number one for Tempest.</p>
<p>“Oh, you can have him if you want,” Alvis playfully said.</p>
<p>“If I take your prey,” Gobta wittily replied, “wouldn’t that hurt your honor as a beastman, ma’am? I don’t need it that bad, so go ahead and fight all you want! Sorry I got in the way!”</p>
<p>Alvis accepted the inane excuse without a word. If anything, it was the luckiest thing to happen to Gobta all day. He had dodged a bullet with this total unknown before him. Alvis had no intention of letting anyone else score this kill anyway, and he had wriggled out of a battle against a foe that completely outclassed him.</p>
<p><em>Whew. That’s the end of</em> my <em>work!</em></p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">At the very far end of the rear guard, the group of priests led by Middray was clashing with Gabil’s Team Hiryu.</p>
<p>Of course, only a few were standing by now. Nearly two hundred fighters on both sides were lying on the ground. But Middray was unhurt, his white robes free of dirt and grime, and it was clear he was still going strong.</p>
<p>“Waaah-ha-ha-ha! Not too shabby, you guys. I see you <em>are</em> the descendants of dragons!”</p>
<p>Middray flashed a contented smile, surveying the fallen and pretending the panting and exhausted Sufia in front of him didn’t exist.</p>
<p>“Don’t you ignore me!”</p>
<p>Sufia, half Transformed into her beast form, had used her vastly strengthened physical skills to attack Middray. But the head priest, perhaps sensing this, had simply leaned over to one side, preventing her from landing a lethal blow. The effort had left her wide open.</p>
<p>“Hyah!”</p>
<p>Taking the clawed arm extended out to him, he tripped up Sufia’s legs, picked up her body, and sharply slammed her against the ground. The judo-like throw was unique to the Dragon Faithful.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t ignoring you at all,” Middray happily explained. “I don’t have much opportunity to use this against monsters, so this is rather fun for me. It’s been ages since I had a foe so worthy of that throw.”</p>
<p>This was more than Sufia was willing to bear.</p>
<p>“D-dammit! You, you made me…”</p>
<p>She was being treated like a plaything, her face red with humiliation. But she had to admit it. Middray, this man standing before her, was more powerful than she ever imagined. Now he was surveying the landscape once again, waiting for her to stand up and ignoring her until that happened.</p>
<p><em>Curse him, he’s treating me like a second-class fighter! And how could my Self-Regeneration fail me like this…?</em></p>
<p>It was true. Sufia’s skill was not healing any damage, because her physical body hadn’t sustained any wounds. She was exhausted simply because her stamina was tapping out on her, and the force of each slam added to the burden. He was wounding her internally, where the damage wouldn’t be visible.</p>
<p>But Sufia stood up anyway. As the Snowy Tigerclaw, she could not let this affront continue to stand.</p>
<p>“Imagine, a bastard like you serving Clayman. I thought Yamza was the best around here, but I suppose my instincts were correct all along.”</p>
<p>“Yamza? Ah yes, sir. Yamza. He is rather capable, I’ll admit, but not enough to serve as a playmate for me. I may not look it, but I’ve sparred with Lady Milim on regular occasions, you see.”</p>
<p>“Milim… The demon lord Milim?! So you’re the Dragon Faithful?!”</p>
<p><em>No wonder</em>, Sufia thought. They seemed so different in disposition from the rest of Clayman’s troops. They seemed to enjoy fighting for the sake of fighting, not at all concerned with actually killing their enemies. And compared to the other magic-born, they were all overwhelmingly strong—and enjoying every minute of it.</p>
<p>“Ooh? Say, that dragonewt just felled Hermes! Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha, that was quite a performance!”</p>
<p>Hermes was tangling with Gabil, and Gabil had just knocked him down with his spear.</p>
<p>“F-Father, stop laughing and help me, please!”</p>
<p>“You lost, fool! Just sit there and think about what you could’ve done better!”</p>
<p>He laughed at his associate, lying there on his back and pleading for assistance. He could tell that Hermes wasn’t as bad off as he claimed and that Gabil had no intention of taking his life.</p>
<p>“All right. Counting me, that leaves three remaining. You command a truly wonderful set of fighters, given how evenly we are matched. It proves you’ve honed your bodies <em>and</em> your minds, instead of relying on skills.”</p>
<p>“I suppose I should appreciate the compliment. My name is Gabil. And you are with Lady Milim…?”</p>
<p>“Indeed! I am Middray of the Dragon Faithful.”</p>
<p>“And I am Sufia. Sufia of the Three Lycanthropeers! I have no ear to lend to the servants of Clayman, but if you worship Lady Milim, that is another story.”</p>
<p>“Mm. Lady Sufia, is it? I will make sure to remember that. So what’ll it be now? I could take on the both of you at once, if you like?”</p>
<p>Middray calmly folded his arms, implying that he liked his chances.</p>
<p>“Can I ask you a question before that?”</p>
<p>“Mm? What is it?”</p>
<p>“I… I just mean, how can a mere human be so strong? Or are the Dragon Faithful human at all? Something seems strange about you.”</p>
<p>Middray nodded at this, his curiosity piqued. “What do you mean by human?” he asked. “That’s the crux of it. If you are inquiring about our species, however, the answer is simple. We are dragonewts, like Sir Gabil over there.”</p>
<p>“What?! The same as us?”</p>
<p>“Yes, precisely. The difference is that instead of evolving from lizardmen, we are the descendants of dragons that ‘humanized’ themselves and mated with the human race. But in essence,” he closed with a smile, “we are the same.”</p>
<p>“Ah… And come to think of it, my sister Soka turned wholly human in appearance.”</p>
<p>“Yes. But almost none of us can bring ourselves back to our original shape. The priests you see strewn around us don’t have any skills like Dragon Change or Dragon Body. There is hardly any difference between them and human beings.”</p>
<p>Middray turned his eyes toward Sufia.</p>
<p>“But that power is still handed down. Our worship of the dragon does not allow us to forget the blood within us. Any more questions, Lady Sufia?”</p>
<p>“No. Human, monster, it doesn’t matter. I just wanted to know if your skills were the result of a weak human building himself up to perfection. You say you are little different from humans, and if so, I must pay respect to your efforts.”</p>
<p>“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! You think the same way I do. One may be born with strength, or one may acquire it. Magic-born are so weak because they rely too much on the strength they’ve always had. That’s why they compare their strengths based on magicule capacity and so on. True strength can’t be seen with the eye. The level of your skills is the only solid, trustworthy index there is.”</p>
<p>Sufia was born strong. She had more fighting skill than most monsters, through no special effort of her own. Her massive well of energy, and the surging aura it created, made even magic-born go out of their way to avoid her. Her battle senses made full use of this, and her instincts alone had brought her to where she was. Now, Middray’s words made her realize how little time she had spent polishing her Arts, her learned skills.</p>
<p>“So you mean I can become stronger?”</p>
<p>“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Precisely. There is no such thing as an experience that can win over being in actual battle. Here, come at me! I’d be happy to spar with you.”</p>
<p>He remained where he stood, arms crossed and standing high.</p>
<p>“Lady Sufia and me at the same time?” a dubious Gabil asked. “Are you sure you aren’t being a little too conceited?”</p>
<p>Middray just grinned at him. “Hmph! I could take you on without even using my arms, little man!”</p>
<p>Gabil wasn’t about to take that sitting down.</p>
<p>“Lady Sufia…”</p>
<p>“We’ll tackle him together. We have to admit it. He’s a strong one!”</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">The battle between Alvis and Yamza was about to reach its raging climax.</p>
<p class="space-break">The two were evenly matched, but Yamza had finally used his ace in the hole.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha! Well performed, Lycanthropeer! Your ability to keep up with me is astounding. But now, my victory is assured!!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Pfft! Did you think this magic sword was my only secret weapon? Yes, you may be strong—strong enough to hold me back. I will freely admit that. However! What if there were two of me?”</p>
<p>With that shouted question, he unleashed the magic inside the bracelet on his left wrist. This was a Doppelganger Bracelet, an incredibly valuable Artifact capable of producing a perfect copy of the wearer, right down to their clothing and equipment. Now Alvis had to fend off two Yamzas at the same time—and if one was an even fight for her, she would have to be at a severe disadvantage.</p>
<p>“Well? If you capitulate to me now, I could be convinced to spare you—”</p>
<p>“So what?”</p>
<p>“…What did you say?”</p>
<p>“You think that parlor trick will outclass me? You really are nothing more than a lackey of Clayman’s. Quite the would-be finisher, there.”</p>
<p>Alvis didn’t give an inch, openly ridiculing her foe.</p>
<p>“Then die!”</p>
<p>And even before Yamza could scream that at her, Alvis played her own final card.</p>
<p class="space-break">Now the top half of her body was a beautiful woman, the bottom half that of a large, black snake. This was Alvis’s true, Animalized form, and now she was ready to use its full force.</p>
<p>Unlike Phobio and Sufia with their focus on close-quarters fighting, Alvis was usually thought to be a long-range specialist, lobbing her magic attacks from afar. In truth, however, she was a dyed-in-the-wool fighter, masterful at short range in the way anyone serving the Beast Master needed to be.</p>
<p>Her fighting style, however, ventured from the beaten path. Alvis brought her staff up to her forehead—and in the next instant, it disappeared, as she grew a golden horn from above her eyes. Finally free, her aura surged outward from her, greatly amplifying her power. This was her second Transformation and her most secret of abilities.</p>
<p>She stood there, her entire body protected by dragon scales. The whole space around them belonged to her, her aura producing streaks of lightning in the air.</p>
<p>“Wha?!” Gobta spat out, sensing danger. There was no way Alvis could remain coolheaded enough to tell friend from foe like that.</p>
<p>“You said your name was Gobta? You have my permission to move out immediately.”</p>
<p>“Ohhh, you don’t need to tell me twice, ma’am! Riders, retreat!”</p>
<p>One shout from him was all it took to make the goblin riders flee the scene. The surviving magic-born took the opportunity to quickly surround Alvis.</p>
<p>“You fool! You intend to take us on alone?”</p>
<p>It was nothing for her to worry about.</p>
<p>“Is that how little you think of me? Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Die, you mob of idiots!!”</p>
<p>By the time Yamza saw it unfolding, it was already too late. One magic-born before him fell to the ground, spewing blood. One turned to stone and shattered against the earth. One had his body literally rot away on the spot, until nothing but a pile of dust remained. His army was being killed, struck by ailments by one degree or another, and Yamza had no way to stop it.</p>
<p>“Yoouuuuuu!!”</p>
<p>Alvis was, in the end, best suited for close-quarters combat. The Golden Snakehorn’s lone horn on her forehead became a symbol of the death that permeated the atmosphere—and then Yamza realized that his defeat was total.</p>
<p>“Surrender, and I will take you prisoner and guarantee you your life.”</p>
<p>Her offer was the only method of survival he had. A quick stare with her Snake Eyes had completely shattered his Doppelganger’s body. It even had the power to destroy equipment, apparently, leaving Yamza’s partner to fade away before battle even began.</p>
<p><em>…My limbs are starting to go numb. I won’t be able to defend myself before long… What kind of sheer strength do these Lycanthropeers enjoy?!</em></p>
<p>It was bad luck that Yamza had to be paired with the strongest of that trio. He chose the wrong woman to pick a fight with, and he had no idea. Alvis rarely had the chance to fully exercise her power, since she was often picked to serve a commanding role. As a result, she was seen as the de facto manager of the Lycanthropeers, not as a formidable warrior in her own right.</p>
<p>That was Yamza’s appraisal as well, and he had totally underrated her.</p>
<p class="space-break">The war was won. But it was not over. Clayman was a sly demon lord, one who would never forgive betrayal among his own armies. And just when Yamza prepared to nod his agreement to Alvis’s offer:</p>
<p class="space-break">(—You know I would never permit that, yes?)</p>
<p class="space-break">It was Clayman’s voice, booming within Yamza’s mind. “Uh?” he instinctively grunted. Then his body began moving, beyond his own control.</p>
<p>“S-stop! Stop that! Please, Sir Clayman, stop this at once!”</p>
<p>A hand took a bluish-purple orb out from his pocket, then brought it to his mouth.</p>
<p>“Mmghh!!”</p>
<p>He locked his jaw as tightly as he could, trying to scramble away from it. It was a pointless act of resistance, and it didn’t last long. Struck by Clayman’s Marionette takeover, Yamza’s body was no longer his own to control.</p>
<p>“…What are you doing?” a suspicious Alvis asked. But by the time she did, Yamza was busy swallowing the orb in his hand—a section from Charybdis’s body.</p>
<p>“Hah? Harbhh, nnhhh… Graghaghaaaahhh!!”</p>
<p>“What on—?!”</p>
<p>Alvis tensed up, confused—as long, thin tendrils shot out from his body toward the dead lying around him, taking in the corpses. He ballooned in size, turning into a vast, grotesque ball of flesh. Uncontrollable magical energy flowed within the Alvis-dominated air, forming a hurricane-class blizzard.</p>
<p>The creature before her consumed, expanded, and burst. Having no monster core of its own, it was a self-destructing being, rampaging across the land before meeting its demise. But its temporary power was every bit as strong as Yamza’s—and the nature of it was deadly. Its insatiable desire to eat everything in its path was just the same as well.</p>
<p>This was the “forbidden” tactic Yamza was reluctant to use, the intricate trap Clayman had laid. Charybdis had now appeared once more.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
<p class="tx1">Alvis’s face tightened as she threw her full force into an attack. It didn’t work. No regular strike would ever pierce this constantly expanding Charybdis. Its Ultraspeed Regeneration took in the corpses around it, rapidly reforming it into a temporary body for itself.</p>
<p>“Ngh! This monster…!”</p>
<p>All Alvis could do was gnash her teeth, her Snake Eyes and lightning having no effect. This monster was disaster-class, on a level far, far above her. Even the strongest of the Three Lycanthropeers could do little about it by herself. The only saving grace was that this was a distance away from the main battlefield; there was time before this could start to affect her allies but only until Charybdis could finish creating its body.</p>
<p>Desperation flew in like a violent storm. The worst part was how this monster wasn’t satisfied enough using Yamza as its substitute core—it had taken in his Ice Blade as well, sucking up all the heat around it and making the local temperature plummet. The monster was destroying all in its path, turning its aura into an Ice Blizzard, pummeling the area with icy snow and intense wind. That was scary enough, but what Alvis feared even more was the moment when it released all the heat energy it had taken in.</p>
<p><em>Those who can teleport out might be fine, but everyone else…</em></p>
<p>…would die.</p>
<p>“I hate this! May all the gods curse that bastard Clayman!!”</p>
<p>Letting her true nature take hold, Alvis screamed as she continually attacked—again and again, no time in between to breathe. It was all in vain. Even if she scarred Charybdis’s exterior, any damage to the monster itself was light. It just healed itself too quickly.</p>
<p>“Dammit! I’ve just got to get everyone out that I can—”</p>
<p>Even through the desperation, Alvis tried to take the best measures she could. To her, this meant trying to relay a plea to Benimaru to retreat everyone from the battlefield.</p>
<p>In the end, however, this never happened. It didn’t need to.</p>
<p>“You’re ignoring orders, Alvis. I told you to get out if you faced a battle you cannot win.”</p>
<p>There, with no previous warning, Benimaru himself appeared.</p>
<p>“…Sir Benimaru?!”</p>
<p>“Oh, Charybdis, eh? My offense did little against it last time, but how about now?”</p>
<p>He gave her a defiant smile.</p>
<p>“Sir Benimaru, this monster is just too—”</p>
<p>“I know. It’s perfect for testing my current powers.”</p>
<p>Benimaru raised his right hand and grasped it—both Charybdis and his own strength. The fight was over in an instant. His feet planted on the ground, his sword, covered in jet-black flames, slashed the monster’s flesh, although it did not fully slice through its freshly constructed body. But something was different from before. Unlike with Alvis’s efforts, the Self-Regeneration never started. Dark flames were dancing across the gash, rapidly engulfing its entire body.</p>
<p>“Tch. Not quite there yet. We have no time to play with here, so I’ll sadly have to end this.”</p>
<p>He turned back toward Alvis, leaning his sword against his shoulder, seemingly unconcerned with Charybdis.</p>
<p>“My apologies. I was hoping we could spar once it had achieved its complete form, but…”</p>
<p>The gigantic beast had not taken to the air yet, but its body was already nearly the length of half a football field. Now, however, it had been fully encased in a black dome.</p>
<p>“Away with you,” he whispered, and then a percussive <em>boom!</em> shook the land.</p>
<p class="space-break">It was Hellflare, his wide-range razing attack, this time far more powerful than ever before.</p>
<p class="space-break">Benimaru’s Dominate Flame gave him a full grasp of the flow of magical energy, stabbing right through Charybdis’s Magic Interference and rendering its body into ash. It proved to the world that Benimaru’s control over magicules completely overpowered this monster’s.</p>
<p>“You’re kidding me!”</p>
<p>Alvis’s surprise was understandable. If his attacks worked on Charybdis, it meant Benimaru’s magic force surpassed the monster’s. This meant that Benimaru himself was disaster class, on the same level as Alvis’s master, the demon lord Carillon.</p>
<p>“I have some business to take care of, Alvis. Effective immediately, I hereby appoint you as my aide to command our entire force.”</p>
<p>“…Yes, Sir Benimaru.”</p>
<p>She undid her Transformation to kneel down and take the post. She had more than a few questions for Benimaru, but now was not the time for them. Calming her frenzied mind, she meekly accepted her orders.</p>
<p class="space-break">Charybdis was an unprecedented, unexpected threat, but when faced with that irresistible force, it fell without a moment’s delay.</p>

<p class="tx1">“Hoh, hoh-hoh-hoh… This is quite a surprise. I was expecting Yamza to turn tail and flee. But imagine, dispatching Charybdis that easily…”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm! I kind of have an affinity for it, but not even we could pull off a kill like that.”</p>
<p>“Clayman’s forces are destroyed. The mission’s a failure—the losses immense. He should have just sat there and played nice, the way our fellow jester told him to.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. Well, Laplace warned him. Clayman can’t blame anyone for it but himself.”</p>
<p>Footman and Teare exchanged looks as they spoke. Before them was a heavily wounded Phobio, kept on his feet by the attending Geld.</p>
<p>“We’ll need to brief <em>him</em> about this, so I’m afraid playtime is over.”</p>
<p>Footman himself was unhurt. Teare wasn’t, but she was still healthy enough to fight. Judging by their injuries, Geld and Phobio appeared to have lost the day.</p>
<p>“You think you can leave?” Phobio groaned, staggering as he tried to keep himself up. “I knew you guys were bad news. If we can keep you here, Alvis and Sufia will show up before long. Plus, we’ve got Sir Benimaru. It’ll be the end for you.”</p>
<p>He was scarred from head to toe, but his wounds had already closed up. The speed at which they healed was mind-boggling, going well beyond the Self-Regeneration most beastmen had and almost reaching the realm of Ultraspeed Regeneration. Phobio had inherited that skill to some extent after the previous Charybdis swallowed him up.</p>
<p>“Just give it up already, kitty!” Teare shouted as she gave Phobio a punch that sent him reeling. It didn’t leave Phobio down for long. In a few moments, he was back on his feet.</p>
<p>Teare was the quicker of the two, but she could never quite land a lethal blow. Phobio, on the other hand, was slowly but surely damaging Teare’s body. He might have appeared defeated at first glance, but the longer the fight lasted, the more likely it was that it’d end otherwise.</p>
<p>Footman, meanwhile, was rolled up like a meatball, bounding around at hyper-speed and trying to run Geld down. Geld used his great shield to deflect his trajectory, swinging his Meat Cleaver to try to smash him up. His attempts were blocked by Footman’s thickened skin, preventing him from dealing decisive damage.</p>
<p>On offense and defense, it was safe to call them perfectly even—but only because Footman hadn’t begun seriously fighting yet. And now, with Charybdis defeated, Footman’s recess time was over.</p>
<p>“Mgh?!”</p>
<p>Geld, realizing this, positioned himself in front of Phobio.</p>
<p>“What is it, Geld?”</p>
<p>Before he could answer, Footman began raining attacks on the both of them. These were balls of magic, each one enormous and stuffed with energy—a simple attack but one with enough force to alter the landscape around them. One of the magic orbs was enough to shatter Geld’s shield and even smash up the armor covering his body. It damaged Phobio in the process, and he no doubt had Ultraspeed Regeneration to thank for still being alive.</p>
<p>(Hooooooh-hoh-hoh-hoh! We weren’t tasked with taking care of you two, so we’ll extend you the honor of letting you go.)</p>
<p>(I hope you’re grateful! If we were serious about this, neither of you would be in this world any longer!)</p>
<p>Neither Geld nor Phobio could stand up any longer to contest them. When the dust from the explosions finally settled, Footman and Teare were gone.</p>
<p>“…This was a total defeat,” Geld groused. “I thought I had some strength, but I suppose there’s always someone better than you.”</p>
<p>“No, Geld. If you hadn’t been here, I’d probably be dead right now. Sorry to drag you down…”</p>
<p>“Not at all. We may have lost the battle, but we’re still alive. As long as we win next time, we’re good.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Yeah, you’re right!”</p>
<p>Phobio was not a weak beastman. Footman and Teare were just too strong. Strong enough that you could even call them demon lords. Perhaps Geld had more magical energy at his fingertips, but without the ability to use it shrewdly, that power meant nothing. Geld focused entirely on defense against Footman, but even he knew that he’d never win in a serious fight opposite him. For now, though, that was fine.</p>
<p>(Sir Benimaru, the jesters have fled.)</p>
<p>(I saw,) came the Thought Communication reply. (They might think they’re letting us live. How naïve of them.)</p>
<p>Benimaru’s orders for Geld were to discover what the enemy was capable of and keep Phobio safe. <em>I couldn’t just sit there and watch things unfold</em>, he thought, <em>but not killing me was a bad mistake. Sir Benimaru has recorded how that battle worked out—and then Rimuru will analyze it and break open the secret to their strength.</em></p>
<p>Thus, this was a defeat with some benefits to them. Mission accomplished. And if he can’t win now, he can close the gap with his future training. He had hoped to settle the score with these guys for using and abusing him, but Geld simply didn’t have what it took.</p>
<p><em>But next time, I’m winning</em>, he silently resolved.</p>
<p>(I’ll go back to my command, then.)</p>
<p>(Please do. There’s one more dangerous element on the field right now, so I’d better tackle that.)</p>
<p><em>Sir Benimaru sure has it tough</em>, Geld thought as he closed the link. This battlefield was full of dangerous elements, and since they had to deal with them all at once, he was forced to divvy up his army’s assets and scatter them around. Benimaru intended to sort these conflicts by priority and step in himself to handle any rescues needed, but one misstep along the line could lead to serious danger. He seemed to be handling his post well, however. One would think he’d focus on finding and killing Footman first, but he successfully managed to put overall victory above his own vendettas.</p>
<p><em>This isn’t some general with a thirst for blood, I suppose. Compared to when we fought him, the growth he’s shown has been amazing…</em></p>
<p>It made Geld trust in Benimaru all the more.</p>

<p class="tx1">It was several minutes into the battle—minutes that, to Gabil and Sufia, felt like hours. But it ended unceremoniously.</p>
<p class="space-break">“Mgh?!”</p>
<p>“What on…?!”</p>
<p>“Huff…huff… What…what is the matter…?”</p>
<p>After the second or third repetition, Sufia had learned how to roll with Middray’s throws, helping recover her energy. Gabil, meanwhile, had flung his spear wildly around at this attack he wasn’t used to, completely exhausting him. Middray, dealing with them both, appeared completely unhindered by fatigue—compared to sparring with Milim, this wouldn’t even make him break a sweat.</p>
<p>And Middray was the first to notice it.</p>
<p>“All forces, use your healing magics!” he shouted, the casual ease disappearing from his face. “Stand up! Stand up and rouse everyone around here!”</p>
<p>“This is bad, Father Middray,” Hermes said, apparently feeling much better now. “This guy… The reading I’m getting is huge.”</p>
<p>“I know that! This is Charybdis, the beast Lady Milim dispatched just the other day. Or is it its remains?”</p>
<p>“Yeah… It looks unstable to me. I imagine it’ll disintegrate before the day is through…”</p>
<p>“But this is a battlefield. If things go wrong, it could rapidly evolve. Better not to give a monster like that the food it craves.”</p>
<p>The fallen priests around him cast healing spells to revive both themselves and Team Hiryu under Gabil’s command.</p>
<p>“Charybdis?” Sufia asked. “The monster that used Phobio as a core to revive itself with?! I thought Lady Milim had already destroyed it!”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Gabil added, realizing this current match was over. “If it was Charybdis, Lady Milim definitely killed it…”</p>
<p>“Calm down. It’s not the real thing; just a fragment of its force. I think it used Yamza as its replacement core…”</p>
<p>Middray was using Dragon’s Glance to analyze the innards of the creature. It was not as strong as Milim’s own Dragon’s Eye, but it still provided him with ample enough vision and analysis skills.</p>
<p>Hermes, meanwhile, was surveying the area for any other potential threats. “Looks like you’re right, sir. That ass Yamza was trying to kill us, but his soul’s already been consumed. With how he is now, we’ll just have to keep damage to a minimum and wait for him to fall apart,” he coldly concluded.</p>
<p>“Did you hear that? Keep your weapons at the ready, people. And don’t get greedy! If buying time is all we need, that won’t be a tall order.”</p>
<p>“Let us help you out,” Gabil added, in sync with Middray as if they were old friends. “We are more used to high-altitude flight since last time. If we can catch those scale attacks before they strike, they cannot hurt us.”</p>
<p>Even a crazed, twisting beast like Charybdis had a tendency to chase after anything moving. A flying target, Gabil reasoned, would make the perfect lure. Sufia was also thinking unusually lucidly, trying to execute on what she could do here.</p>
<p>“Right,” Middray began, “I’ll aid in the retreat so it can’t feed off any of our ground forces and—”</p>
<p>But before he could finish, things took an abrupt turn as Benimaru all but vaporized Charybdis.</p>
<p>“What…on…?! He just pulled off the most unbelievable thing!”</p>
<p>“…Who is that guy? A demon lord? Unless you’re Lady Milim, how could some regular magic-born do <em>that</em>? He has to be some kind of monster…”</p>
<p>Only Middray and Hermes had an accurate bead on the situation. Sufia and Gabil saw it at the same time but couldn’t parse what just happened. All they could see was that the evil aura of Charybdis had been snuffed in an instant.</p>
<p>“Hey, what’s going on? Tell me!”</p>
<p>“Yes. We seek an explanation as well.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, um, I’d want to explain,” Hermes said, “but…”</p>
<p>“I don’t think we need to,” Middray finished.</p>
<p>Before either of them could, the air in front of them twisted and warped, revealing a magic-born with hair as red as roaring flames. It was Benimaru, sword rested on his shoulder, and he was here to take on Middray, the last threat on the battlefield.</p>
<p>“Well,” he said with a sneer, “I see you’ve been entertaining my friends?” Then he realized something wasn’t quite right about this picture. There was evidence of combat around him, but there were no injuries—and by the looks of things, no hard feelings on either side.</p>
<p>“Sir Benimaru, wait! These are Lady Milim’s fighters, the priests of the Dragon Faithful!”</p>
<p>“What? Lady Milim’s?! In that case…”</p>
<p>“Yes! They healed our wounds with magic!”</p>
<p>“…I see. It seems I’ve jumped to conclusions. You seemed like such a threat in this theater, I couldn’t help but be alarmed.”</p>
<p>“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! You didn’t jump to conclusions at all. We <em>were</em> actually fighting, yes. And we did perform some healing, but that was to prepare for what we thought was an oncoming disaster. Now I suppose all that wasn’t necessary.”</p>
<p>“…Ah. So what now? Are you taking us on?”</p>
<p>“Well, what <em>should</em> we do…?”</p>
<p>“Because personally speaking, I would prefer not to engage in combat with Lady Milim’s forces.”</p>
<p>“No, I suppose not. I can understand wanting to try it, but there is no quarrel between us. I would simply want to compare our powers.”</p>
<p>“Yes… I can see that.”</p>
<p>The two gave each other knowing grins.</p>
<p>“Whoooa!” Hermes interjected. “Not good, Father!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir Benimaru! If you hurt one of the Dragon Faithful, there’s no telling what kind of calamity that would bring upon us!”</p>
<p>“You heard her, Father Middray! Sir Rimuru is Lady Milim’s friend. It would all end in tragedy, I am sure of it!”</p>
<p>Sufia silently resented Hermes and Gabil for stepping in.</p>
<p>“Fair enough,” Benimaru said. “Besides, if I don’t come at him trying to kill him, I expect it’ll result in nothing but defeat for me—and I don’t like engaging in losing battles.”</p>
<p>“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Quite so. And I’m not sure even I could withstand a blow like the one that buried Charybdis!”</p>
<p>Middray might have laughed the concept off, but he had a suspicion that he could win the battle before Benimaru had a chance to bust that out. That would result in a life-and-death duel, however, going well beyond the boundaries of a friendly sparring session. A battlefield was the wrong place for this, and it no longer meant anything anyway.</p>
<p>Thus ended the battle in the former kingdom of Orbic, while the unified forces enjoyed a near-total victory. But this wasn’t the only battlefield.</p>

<p class="tx1">At the stroke of midnight, Shuna, Soei, and Hakuro sprang into action. They quickly discovered Clayman’s headquarters within the wetlands covered by the mysterious mist and began to stealthily make their way there.</p>
<p>Beyond these wetlands were several murky swamps, gas bubbling out from the surface. This was what created the cloud of mist, making things seem eerier than they already were. The moment they waded in, visibility plummeted to nearly nothing.</p>
<p>“Uh-oh. This mist is blocking our Magic Sense.”</p>
<p>“It is,” confirmed Soei. “That was why we called off our investigation. With this poor visibility, anyone inside would have to rely on their own five senses to ‘see’ around them. That’s what the enemy must use to keep track of what goes on in here.”</p>
<p>“Mm, I see. So we face a brutal disadvantage.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, Sir Hakuro. You and I can use Covert Agent to hide our presences, but Lady Shuna…”</p>
<p>“I should be fine.”</p>
<p>It was true. Hakuro could use his Haze concealing skill to all but disappear to the external observer, as could Soei. You could be standing right next to them and never realize it. Shuna, despite not having this exact Art, could still perfectly heal herself.</p>
<p>“Hmm… A combination of illusory and mystical magic? It doesn’t work like Haze, but it has the same effect. Well done, Lady Shuna.”</p>
<p>Hakuro was right—this approach was Shuna’s original creation. While she wasn’t quite as gifted at it as Rimuru, her Creator unique skill allowed her to conjure up her own magic spells without a recipe.</p>
<p>“Then we should be fine,” Soei said. “But I want you all to remember that Thought Communication won’t work in this fog. Visibility is low, it is hard to stay in contact, and we all need to proceed carefully and cautiously. Also…”</p>
<p>Even with Soei’s Replications, Thought Communication–based conversation would be impossible. Instead, he provided a length of Sticky Steel Thread around each of their wrists for emergency contacts. Focusing on this thread would allow them to maintain at least a modicum of communication, but if the string broke, that would be the end of the contact. Using it required a great deal of caution.</p>
<p>Shuna and Hakuro nodded and wrapped it around their wrists. They were ready now. “Let’s get going,” Shuna said, and the three ran off.</p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tx1">Then, after several minutes of walking, Shuna stopped.</p>
<p>“…Oh no,” she whispered. “We seem to have fallen into a trap.”</p>
<p>“A trap?”</p>
<p>“I can feel my senses going haywire on me, yes, but I don’t feel any enemies around the— <em>What?!</em>”</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, Soei felt multiple presences nearby appear from out of nowhere, virtually surrounding them.</p>
<p>“How on…? Where were so many of these enemies hiding, such that we couldn’t notice them?”</p>
<p>“No, Hakuro! They weren’t hiding. We were lured right to them!”</p>
<p>“Ah… This fog. The cloud’s doing more than confusing our sense of direction. It’s concealing the enemy and inviting us right to the middle of their circle…”</p>
<p>“I see. That explains the odd feeling I had just now.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. The mist is triggering Spatial Interference to lure intruders from any direction to a specific place—”</p>
<p>Before Shuna finished explaining this, one of the presences appeared. Soei and Hakuro steeled themselves toward it, keeping a watchful eye out for the still-unseen monsters in the mist, as Shuna closed her mouth and focused on it—a skeleton dressed in a vestment of pure white.</p>
<p>“Such massive magical force,” she whispered, beads of sweat on her forehead. For a moment, she thought it might have been Clayman himself, although she banished the thought quickly. It was past midnight; the demon lord should be over at the Walpurgis Council. Perhaps it was one of Clayman’s five fingers, then—but the figure before them exuded pure presence, beyond that of the Lycanthropeers and approaching demon lord level. The power of this magic-born was overwhelming; it was a wonder that it was subservient to anyone else.</p>
<p>She recalled what Mjurran told her about Clayman’s most senior leaders—and that one of them was geared strictly toward defending their base.</p>

<p>“…You must be Adalmann, then. The ruler of this land—the wight king with power over countless undead…”</p>
<p>Hakuro had just used Heavengaze to reach the same conclusion. But this figure was more ominous than how Mjurran described it, its force far more massive. The guardian of this wetland was a wight king on the level of a demon lord.</p>
<p>Soei accepted Shuna and Hakuro’s appraisal, finding no reason to doubt it. Then, quietly, he sharpened his bladelike mind. No matter who the enemy is, he <em>will</em> kill him—that was his credo.</p>
<p>But just as Soei was about to move, the wight king spoke.</p>
<p>“Indeed, I am Adalmann. I have been ordered to protect this land by the great demon lord Clayman. Lowly intruders like you may do nothing but humbly submit your lives to me. Do it, and I will kill you without pain.”</p>
<p>This was the command of a kingly figure, not the words of a foe who saw Shuna and her companions as equals. Considering the massive, overwhelming amount of Adalmann’s magic energy, anything else would almost seem improper.</p>
<p>Now, all around the area, a legion of over ten thousand undead were writhing, as if attracted to the seemingly inexhaustible supply of magicules. Cracking, wrenching sounds filled the air as they moved to encircle the trio.</p>
<p>“We are fully surrounded,” Shuna breathlessly reported. “This mist is working alongside a directional barrier to prevent teleportation outside. All our means of communication are blocked. The only way to get out of here is to defeat this Adalmann foe.”</p>
<p>“Then we must strike their leader at once.”</p>
<p>“No disagreement here. A blow from me can even kill the dead.”</p>
<p>Hakuro and Soei had no interest in following Adalmann’s advice. As Shuna explained the situation, they both went on the attack. But Adalmann simply laughed in their faces.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh… You appear not to know your place. I generously provided you mercy, and yet, you remain foolish to the end. You will regret refusing that offer shortly.”</p>
<p>He breezily swung an arm. The next moment, the most surprising thing happened—the white blade of Hakuro, instantly zooming within range of Adalmann, was blocked by the knight who had appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>Hakuro stepped back in shock, failing to believe that this killer blow could be parried. This was a death knight, ranked A-minus in the Guild system, but from that clash, Hakuro could sense something was off. It was a powerful monster, yes, but no garden-variety death knight could ever block a slash from him.</p>
<p>“You are no normal adversary. Very well. Let me give you my full attention.”</p>
<p>He had an accurate bead on this death knight and the threat it carried for him. Its strength relied not on physical toughness but on the built-up level of its skills—which meant Heavengaze would tell him nothing about it. So he used his own physical might to confront it.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>The death knight was silent; the corpse serving as the shell of its body was incapable of speech. But there was a blistering blue flame in its sunken eyes. The light of consciousness was in there, the pride of a former human being, and it told Hakuro that his challenge was accepted.</p>
<p>Even after abandoning life, this death knight was a proud, noble warrior. The difference in magical energy between the two was negligible, as was their physical muscle. It marked the beginning of a clash between built-up skills, one that quickly made sparks fly.</p>
<p class="space-break">Before Soei, meanwhile, was Adalmann himself, an enormous shadow from out of nowhere blocking all attempts to attack him.</p>
<p>“Deh!” Soei glared at the towering shade. “No… A dragon zombie?”</p>
<p>“No, Soei!” Shuna could see it more fully, through the muck. “Nothing that weak! Its magicules outnumber yours; it stands at the peak of the undead—it’s a death dragon!”</p>
<p>Soei’s face tensed upon hearing this. He could manage this solo, but fighting this foe while guarding Shuna was a different story. The usually reliable Hakuro was too busy with the death knight. He had to dispatch this death dragon as soon as possible, or else Shuna would be overrun by the thousands of undead lumbering their way in from all sides. Now, Soei realized, was no time to hold back.</p>
<p>“Then, die! Mystic Thread Strike!”</p>
<p>Without delay, Soei dealt out the most powerful attack he could, a killer move that fricasseed the enemy with thousands of branching strings of Sticky Steel Thread, each granted the Insta-Kill effect from his Shadow Striker unique skill. They created a virtual garden of beautiful, bloody blooms, like a kaleidoscope. Even a half-spiritual life-form like an undead would be snuffed out by this spiritual body-slicing move—or so it should have.</p>
<p>“No! It’s regenerating?!”</p>
<p>Soei could feel himself begin to sweat. The sixty-foot-long beast’s body was ripped apart, seemingly ending the battle. But then, as if nothing was amiss, the death dragon’s body reassembled itself. It went so fast, even faster than Ultraspeed Regeneration, that it seemed like nothing less than immortality.</p>
<p>“Then let me destroy you, soul and all…”</p>
<p>“Soei,” Shuna shouted out as he steeled himself, “calm down! You know how to analyze your foe’s strengths. You should know that you can’t beat a death dragon!”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“That dragon’s soul is within the magic-born Adalmann,” she quietly declared. “Don’t worry about me; just work on keeping that dragon where it is. I’ll defeat Adalmann!”</p>
<p>“That’s too dangerous!”</p>
<p>“No, Soei. Listen to me. I’m angry.”</p>
<p>A cold smile stretched across Shuna’s face to dispel Soei’s worries. They shined a piercing light, exhibiting her raging emotions. The sight made Soei clam up, unable to speak.</p>
<p>As the former princess of the ogre tribe, Shuna’s words had the power to make others do her bidding—and now, that power was stronger than even the otherworlder Kirara Mizutani’s Bewilder unique skill. Besides, Shuna wasn’t some precious cargo that required constant protection. Soei knew that. So there was only one answer.</p>
<p>“Yes, Lady Shuna. Best of luck.”</p>
<p>She contentedly smiled. “You too, Soei. That dragon’s all yours.”</p>
<p>Soei nodded back, giving Shuna his full trust, then threw himself back into his own fight.</p>

</div>
<p class="tx1">Shuna, left alone, didn’t waver at all as she confronted Adalmann. The wight king rewarded this by glaring at her.</p>
<p>“Hoh? And what do you intend to do, little girl? What could <em>you</em> do without anyone to defend you? How are you going to engage ten thousand foes at once?”</p>
<p>There was an odd sort of joy in Adalmann’s voice. He <em>was</em> enjoying this, in fact. The demon lord Clayman’s orders were absolute, but Adalmann was still afforded his own sense of free will, although his activities were limited in every other way. The only thing he was allowed full rein to do was wipe out intruders.</p>
<p>Clayman’s other minions derided him for having so much power but so little brains to back that up—and it was only because he was not allowed to leave this land or do anything on his own volition. And it was perhaps the way that he wasn’t even allowed to provide excuses to them that made people fail to realize it.</p>
<p>Adalmann was less a magic-born and more a weapon, a base-defense mechanism bound to this land. His soul remained unbound, but his behavior was now automatic, following the orders input into him. He spoke of his loyalty to Clayman, but that was just an act. He had been preset to pay his formal respects to the owner of this device.</p>
<p>In his heart of hearts, Adalmann wanted to be released from these bonds. That was why he enjoyed talking with Shuna. The defense mechanisms worked automatically; he had no authority to alter them in any way. The chats he had with intruders were his only hobby to speak of, the only thing no one else could interfere with. The demon lord Kazalim, creator of this structure, offered him that much mercy. Or maybe not. But Adalmann wanted to think so. That gesture, after all, was what had allowed him to live all this time, a thousand years or so, without succumbing to insanity.</p>
<p><em>Even if it was just a measure to keep this system running longer, I have to thank him for that, at least.</em></p>
<p>And he meant it. That was why he never spared any effort to hammer down intruders, regardless of what he thought about it. But at least he prayed, as he imagined an army of ten thousand undead preying upon Shuna, that it could be done painlessly.</p>
<p>But then her voice rang out sharply once more.</p>
<p>“No need to worry about me. Alignment Field!!”</p>
<p>At that instant, the area within a three-hundred-foot radius of Shuna became holy ground, where nothing of evil alignment could tread. It was another original product of Shuna’s mind, using her experience to Analyze the Anti-Magic Area and Holy Field, then Fuse them together. This barrier obstructed all magicules, but it could also be set to block fire, wind, or any one of the other four major elements, making it a shockingly formidable defensive spell.</p>
<p>“Now we won’t be distracted. If I defeat you, that will destroy the defense system with you at its core, right?”</p>
<p>“…Hmm. Impressive. And you’ve seen through my secret as well. What is your name, girl?”</p>
<p>Shuna was absolutely right. If Adalmann died, the whole base-defense system would crumble. It was structured to bind Adalmann’s soul down, using it to circulate the large amounts of magicules it required. That would no doubt free the death dragon serving him—as well as the death knight, Alberto, who was once Adalmann’s friend and confidant. Shuna had seen all that at a glance, and Adalmann offered her his honest respect for that. Respect and the ever-so-slight hope that she might be able to release him from this pain.</p>
<p>“My name is Shuna.”</p>
<p>“Shuna… Lady Shuna. Then let us settle this for good. If you can defeat me, I will follow your wishes.”</p>
<p>“My, thank you for the polite request. However, all I seek is the destruction of the demon lord Clayman. If you stay out of my way, I could leave you alone to live on this land, perhaps?”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh. I’m not sure that’s possible, I’m afraid.”</p>
<p>“No? I thought you might be capable of conquering the ties that bind you, but perhaps I was wrong. Oh, well. In that case,” she said without a moment’s hesitation, “I will kill you as I intended to.”</p>
<p><em>If I could conquer them</em>, thought Adalmann, <em>I would have done it eons ago. Kazalim is a man to be feared, a foe no one can hold a candle to. The nickname Curse Lord is not just bravado. And she makes it all sound so easy…</em></p>
<p>“Then the time for talk is over,” he declared, still having no ill will toward her. “Try to resist me with everything you’ve got!”</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Adalmann was born a prince in one of the small nations under the jurisdiction of the Holy Empire of Lubelius. These lands were all too weak to have their own standing militaries, instead relying on the Temple Knights sent from the Church’s central headquarters. In exchange, they were required to adopt Luminism as the state religion and provide money and qualified personnel for their knight corps.</p>
<p>The Western Holy Church of the time didn’t enjoy the influence they wielded now; this was before the advent of their Crusader groups. Practitioners who showed talent could be granted the name of “acolyte,” a nonhereditary title, but that was it. In the midst of that, Adalmann was an exceptional performer—and with his elder brother taking over the country and quickly giving birth to an heir, he was free to devote himself deeply to spreading the faith, joining the Church’s missionary corps and quickly making a name for himself.</p>
<p>He was devout to the faith, constantly fascinated by the divine works of Luminus. Never once did he doubt the existence of this lone, true, powerful goddess. That devotion eventually led him to learn the “divine miracles” of the Church’s archbishop class, making him the greatest master of holy magic in his era.</p>
<p>In time, he advanced to the rank of cardinal, the loftiest in the Western Holy Church. In the Lubelius noble hierarchy, he was no one particularly special. But he redoubled his efforts, extending his interests to magic beyond the holy spells he was familiar with. He would hold long discussions about magic with Gadora, one of his best friends at the time, as he incessantly polished his skills. The effort eventually paid off—he became an Enlightened, transcending the bounds of humanity itself.</p>
<p>An Enlightened was a person who retained their human form but on the inside was a demi-spiritual being, similar to a higher-level elemental. Their powers were leaps and bounds above those of a regular human, and they were often seen as defenders of the human cause. This power quickly put Adalmann in a position of immense central authority.</p>
<p>Time passed. Adalmann’s intensive study continued. And eventually, he took the next step forward, to the highest peak of mankind—a Sage. As he did, he was greeted with wondrous news: He would be called to the Inner Cloister, at the top of the Church’s holy mountain.</p>
<p>The offer filled him with joy.</p>
<p><em>Finally, an audience with Luminus herself!</em></p>
<p>He always believed that Luminus was real, an unwavering belief that served as the source for all his faith. So he promptly set off for the holy mount, not believing for a moment that it would lead to tragedy. That belief, sadly, would ultimately betray him.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The intense magical battle continued.</p>
<p>“Melt all and wear it away—Acid Shell!”</p>
<p>The aspectual spell Adalmann had just cast conjured balls of liquid in the air, each capable of melting flesh to the bone. They rained down upon Shuna.</p>
<p>She didn’t miss a beat.</p>
<p>“Flame Wall.”</p>
<p>The barrier of fire deflected and vaporized all the magic-infused droplets. Between accelerating her mind to a thousand times normal, possessing superior Analyze and Assess skills, and changing the rules with Cast Cancel and Control Laws, Shuna’s unique skill Parser was made for a clash of magic like this. From the moment Adalmann began constructing a spell, she had a way to deal with it.</p>
<p>“Then how about this? Malicious dead, accept this sacrifice—Curse Bind!!”</p>
<p>This was necromancy, an offshoot of elemental magic that took advantage of the negative energies from ghouls and the undead. Curse Bind was a particularly nasty one, summoning zombies that latched on to anything living—human or magic-born—and drained away their life energy.</p>
<p>Even that wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>“Holy Bell.”</p>
<p>Shuna’s refreshingly clear voice reached Adalmann’s ears, and right after came the tolling of bells he was once well used to hearing. That was all it took to send the grudgeful zombies to the afterlife.</p>
<p>“…It can’t be! Why? Why is a monster wielding elemental magic?!”</p>
<p>Adalmann’s eyes shot open at the divine miracle playing out before him. The magic was deployed all too beautifully, reminding him of his youthful days spent studying.</p>
<p>This was holy magic in the air, something a monster girl should never be able to weave. The unbelievable sight made him scream without thinking.</p>
<p>Shuna smiled as she decided to answer Adalmann’s question, even though she had no obligation to. “Do you find it strange? Perhaps you need a little more imagination. Holy magic is not the exclusive domain of humans; it will work with anyone who believes in the power of miracles, based on the strength of their belief.”</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom in this world stated that holy magic worked by forging a pact with an elemental spirit. This was both right and wrong. The fact that magic-born could cast healing spells indicated that “holy” magic was possible for them without any pact with a holy being. Most humans, and even monsters, didn’t understand that.</p>
<p>The sole condition for acquiring holy magic was having faith—believing in miracles, to put it another way. Good, or evil, didn’t factor into it; the strength of one’s emotions was directly converted into power. That was how this family of magic worked. (This was also the reason why the Dragon Faithful that worshipped Milim could access holy magic.)</p>
