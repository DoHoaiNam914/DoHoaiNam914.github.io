<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">“They’re pointing their greatest force toward our main army?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.2">What are the lookouts doing?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">“Allow me to interrupt, sir! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">We can’t make contact with our lookouts. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.3">Someone has killed them all!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“What?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">The enemy was moving so fast, they were completely behind on dealing with them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">By the time Yamza noticed that, they were already lethally late. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">The realization made the blood drain from his head. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.4">There would be no regrouping now—even escape would be fiendishly difficult.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">No. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">No, no, no, no, no!! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">I may not even be able to escape here with my life!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Yamza began to panic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">If this was one-on-one, he might be able to deal with that, but he wasn’t self-absorbed enough to think he stood a chance against a squadron like this.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">“Buy me some time! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">I will return to our homeland and bring Adalmann back here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">He can summon the dead to restore our forces!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">It was just a pretext. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">He already knew all was lost, and he had decided to run away, as fast as possible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">Luckily, he had only volunteered his fealty to Clayman, so his behavior was not restricted the way it was with the other four fingers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4">Following him any farther would be suicide, and that made it easy for Yamza to sever all ties.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“Yes sir!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“We can give you three hours, sir!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">His men each gave him stern, resolved looks that did nothing to move his heart. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">All he could think about was how stupid they were. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">The next moment, he chanted a teleportation spell. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.4">But something was off.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">“It’s…not working? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">Is this a…Spatial Blockade?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">He was already too late. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">The moment Yamza and his men saw Alvis, Alvis’s gaze landed on them as well, thanks to the power of her skill Snake Eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.4">It was an extra skill, one that applied a large variety of ailments—paralysis, poison, insanity, and so forth—and worked on anyone caught in her line of vision. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.5">A tremendously useful skill, the only way to escape it was by either successfully resisting it or simply weathering it out.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">And Alvis had another card up her sleeve—the unique skill Oppressor. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">This spatial skill gave her the effects of Mind Accelerate, Spatial Control, and Spatial Motion, letting her impede enemy movement and give her allies superior positioning.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">A single motion from her was enough to neutralize all the masses surrounding Yamza. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">The more weakhearted of them were instantly driven mad; the stronger ones were still paralyzed long enough for the poison to kill them off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">Some had even been turned to stone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.4">Less than a hundred managed to emerge unscathed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.5">Before they could put up any resistance, the unworthy had been denied even the right to stand before Alvis.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">Her Spatial Control had snuffed out Yamza’s magic, having the power to both obstruct spells and fix their spatial coordinates in place to prevent them from affecting the air around the caster at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">No magical escape from this area was possible now—“this area” being the range of Alvis’s vision. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">The entire battlefield was now in her total control. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.4">Such was the power of the Golden Snakehorn.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Realizing escape was impossible, Yamza gritted his teeth.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">He still had a last resort. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">But it was a forbidden one, one that he’d prefer not to use. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">Beyond that, the only path to survival involved winning this.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“…So be it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">Let’s show them what we’ve got.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“Ah, Sir Yamza!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">“Sir Yamza at his finest could overwhelm even the Three Lycanthropeers!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">“Let me join you, sir! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">Our fighting will surely please Sir Clayman!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">His men were elated for the fight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">Yamza found it boundlessly foolish. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">The demon lord Clayman sought only two things: victory and profit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.4">He would never accept this performance—wasteful attrition, followed up by total defeat.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">The only thing he believes in is pure, unadulterated power…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">No matter how faithful Yamza was to him, Clayman never saw him as one of his own. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">He was just a useful pawn, a talented minion; that was as far as the lord’s affection went. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">The Ice Blade had been a gift, yes, but it was simply provided in an effort to strengthen him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.4">It was all for Clayman’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Still, Yamza provided him with respect and reverence, and the gifts he received in return helped. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">They both had a common interest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">But Yamza had no intention of offering his life to Clayman.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">…About time to head out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">I have to survive this and bounce back!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">This failure would force him to go into hiding for a while. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">But a Special-A talent like him, a giant among high-level magic-born, would no doubt be picked up by another demon lord before long, he thought.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">(I like this,) he Thought Communicated to Alvis. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">(One of the greatest magic-born under the Beast Master’s command, part of the valorous Three Lycanthropeers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">Are you willing to duel with me?)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">It was a risky bet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">He wanted to defeat Alvis, the strongest figure in the group, and crush the enemy’s will to fight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">Perhaps that would be enough to change the script—and even if it didn’t end well, he thought it could give him a chance to escape.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">(Very well, Sir Yamza—head of the five fingers beneath the demon lord Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">I will show you how far out of your element you are!)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">This, Alvis thought, would prove once and for all where Clayman and Lord Carillon stood with each other. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">She promptly transported herself before him with Spatial Motion, and in an instant, Clayman’s surviving servants swarmed over her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">It was not what one would normally call a strategy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">Beastmen are mostly simple folk, easily provoked, and this cowardly approach took full advantage of that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">If they can exhaust Alvis, even a little bit, that’ll make it easier for Yamza to win—such was the reasoning behind this kamikaze strike.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">“You think those tricks will work?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Alvis shouted as she turned up the intensity on her Snake Eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">To Yamza, though, they had already done more than enough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.4">That single instant, when Alvis used her power, was the exact thing Yamza needed for his assured victory.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“…Got you!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">In a flash, he was upon her, slashing his sword at her exposed back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">And just before the tip of his blade reached her body—</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“Nuh-uh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">Backstabbing someone like that’s not manly at all!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">Someone had leaped straight out from Alvis’s shadow, babbling to himself as he deflected Yamza’s sword.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“Dehh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">Who’re you?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“I’m Gobta! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">We were hiding out just in case this happened!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">As he explained that, more and more figures popped out from the shadow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">They were, of course, the Unified, four-legged goblin riders, tapping their physical agility to attack the magic-born that were still moving.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">“And you didn’t tell me?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">Alvis said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">“I was wondering why something didn’t feel quite right.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">She had actually noticed them all along. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">That was why she was unafraid to go plunging in like this.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“Heh-heh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">Benimaru ordered us to,” Gobta casually replied as he fired off a Case Cannon bolt at Yamza. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">He could tell the moment he crossed blades with him that this wasn’t a battle for him to win. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.4">So while the commander was distracted by his short sword, he thought now would be his best chance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.5">Gobta’s definition of </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">fair and square</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1"> differed a bit from the norm—it was something he asked of his foes but never followed himself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">Still, Yamza managed to deflect the blast with his sword.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">“Out of my way, weakling!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">He pointed the tip of his blade at Gobta and cast a spell, sending an Icicle Lance hurtling his way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">Gobta simply used his dagger to fire an Icicle Lance of his own—not to fire back, but because he had planned for this follow-up strike from the start. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">It wound up saving Gobta’s life, as the two magic bolts met in the air and dissipated.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“That… That had as much force as this magic sword?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">And without casting? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">Cheeky little weakling, are we…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">Now Yamza recognized Gobta as his foe—but Gobta had already pretty well exhausted his arsenal. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Uh-oh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">I couldn’t follow that counter of his at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">That ice just happened to save me, but if he stabs me with that thing, I’m a goner. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.4">Probably oughtta start runnin’, huh?</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">Fortunately, the goblin riders had already made their contribution to this fight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">No one would complain if they retreated now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">Gobta made up his mind.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">“All right, let’s pull—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">But just as he began to make the order, Yamza’s sword sailed right past his nose.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">“Pyah?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">In another stroke of luck, he had taken a timid step back just in the nick of time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">It made Yamza almost lose his nerve. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">This little sneak made it past my attack three times?</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1"> Three in a row couldn’t be any coincidence, as he saw it—that supersonic swipe he just made proved that the hobgoblin before him was no also-ran.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">“Heh-heh-heh… Oh, how the Lycanthropeers have fallen! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">Sneaking their minions into a one-on-one duel!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">The boast, made with wide-open, bloodshot eyes, was part of Yamza’s strategy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">By his estimation, dealing with both a Lycanthropeer and this mystery intruder at once was dangerous.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">He suppressed his joy just long enough to declare “All right, I’ll serve as an observer for this duel, then!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">Yep. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.3">Definitely an observer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.4">With all his tactics exhausted, that beat just standing there and getting in the way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.5">Rimuru could accept defeat, but he could never accept his people getting killed in action. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.6">Gobta wasn’t stupid enough to volunteer to be war casualty number one for Tempest.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Of course, only a few were standing by now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">Nearly two hundred fighters on both sides were lying on the ground. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.3">But Middray was unhurt, his white robes free of dirt and grime, and it was clear he was still going strong.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">“Waaah-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">Not too shabby, you guys. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">I see you </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">are</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1"> the descendants of dragons!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Middray flashed a contented smile, surveying the fallen and pretending the panting and exhausted Sufia in front of him didn’t exist.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">“Don’t you ignore me!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Sufia, half Transformed into her beast form, had used her vastly strengthened physical skills to attack Middray. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">But the head priest, perhaps sensing this, had simply leaned over to one side, preventing her from landing a lethal blow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.3">The effort had left her wide open.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">“Hyah!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Taking the clawed arm extended out to him, he tripped up Sufia’s legs, picked up her body, and sharply slammed her against the ground. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">The judo-like throw was unique to the Dragon Faithful.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">“I wasn’t ignoring you at all,” Middray happily explained. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">“I don’t have much opportunity to use this against monsters, so this is rather fun for me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.3">It’s been ages since I had a foe so worthy of that throw.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">This was more than Sufia was willing to bear.</span></p>

<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Curse him, he’s treating me like a second-class fighter! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">And how could my Self-Regeneration fail me like this…?</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">It was true. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">Sufia’s skill was not healing any damage, because her physical body hadn’t sustained any wounds. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.3">She was exhausted simply because her stamina was tapping out on her, and the force of each slam added to the burden. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.4">He was wounding her internally, where the damage wouldn’t be visible.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">But Sufia stood up anyway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">As the Snowy Tigerclaw, she could not let this affront continue to stand.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">“Imagine, a bastard like you serving Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">I thought Yamza was the best around here, but I suppose my instincts were correct all along.”</span></p>

<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">No wonder</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">, Sufia thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">They seemed so different in disposition from the rest of Clayman’s troops. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">They seemed to enjoy fighting for the sake of fighting, not at all concerned with actually killing their enemies. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.4">And compared to the other magic-born, they were all overwhelmingly strong—and enjoying every minute of it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">“Ooh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">Say, that dragonewt just felled Hermes! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.3">Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha, that was quite a performance!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">Hermes was tangling with Gabil, and Gabil had just knocked him down with his spear.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">“You lost, fool! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">Just sit there and think about what you could’ve done better!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">He laughed at his associate, lying there on his back and pleading for assistance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">He could tell that Hermes wasn’t as bad off as he claimed and that Gabil had no intention of taking his life.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">Counting me, that leaves three remaining. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.3">You command a truly wonderful set of fighters, given how evenly we are matched. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.4">It proves you’ve honed your bodies </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">and</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1"> your minds, instead of relying on skills.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">Middray calmly folded his arms, implying that he liked his chances.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">“Can I ask you a question before that?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">“I… I just mean, how can a mere human be so strong? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">Or are the Dragon Faithful human at all? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.3">Something seems strange about you.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">Middray nodded at this, his curiosity piqued. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">“What do you mean by human?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.3">he asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.4">“That’s the crux of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.5">If you are inquiring about our species, however, the answer is simple. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.6">We are dragonewts, like Sir Gabil over there.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">“What?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">The same as us?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">“Yes, precisely. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">The difference is that instead of evolving from lizardmen, we are the descendants of dragons that ‘humanized’ themselves and mated with the human race. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.3">But in essence,” he closed with a smile, “we are the same.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">“Ah… And come to think of it, my sister Soka turned wholly human in appearance.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">But almost none of us can bring ourselves back to our original shape. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.3">The priests you see strewn around us don’t have any skills like Dragon Change or Dragon Body. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.4">There is hardly any difference between them and human beings.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">Middray turned his eyes toward Sufia.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">“But that power is still handed down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">Our worship of the dragon does not allow us to forget the blood within us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.3">Any more questions, Lady Sufia?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">Sufia was born strong. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">She had more fighting skill than most monsters, through no special effort of her own. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.3">Her massive well of energy, and the surging aura it created, made even magic-born go out of their way to avoid her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.4">Her battle senses made full use of this, and her instincts alone had brought her to where she was. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.5">Now, Middray’s words made her realize how little time she had spent polishing her Arts, her learned skills.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">Middray just grinned at him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">“Hmph! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.3">I could take you on without even using my arms, little man!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">Gabil wasn’t about to take that sitting down.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">The battle between Alvis and Yamza was about to reach its raging climax.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">The two were evenly matched, but Yamza had finally used his ace in the hole.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">“Ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">Well performed, Lycanthropeer! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.3">Your ability to keep up with me is astounding. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.4">But now, my victory is assured!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">“Pfft! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">Did you think this magic sword was my only secret weapon? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.3">Yes, you may be strong—strong enough to hold me back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.4">I will freely admit that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.5">However! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.6">What if there were two of me?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">With that shouted question, he unleashed the magic inside the bracelet on his left wrist. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.2">This was a Doppelganger Bracelet, an incredibly valuable Artifact capable of producing a perfect copy of the wearer, right down to their clothing and equipment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.3">Now Alvis had to fend off two Yamzas at the same time—and if one was an even fight for her, she would have to be at a severe disadvantage.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">“Well? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">If you capitulate to me now, I could be convinced to spare you—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">“So what?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">“…What did you say?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">“You think that parlor trick will outclass me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.2">You really are nothing more than a lackey of Clayman’s. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.3">Quite the would-be finisher, there.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">Alvis didn’t give an inch, openly ridiculing her foe.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">“Then die!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">And even before Yamza could scream that at her, Alvis played her own final card.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">Now the top half of her body was a beautiful woman, the bottom half that of a large, black snake. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.2">This was Alvis’s true, Animalized form, and now she was ready to use its full force.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">Unlike Phobio and Sufia with their focus on close-quarters fighting, Alvis was usually thought to be a long-range specialist, lobbing her magic attacks from afar. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">In truth, however, she was a dyed-in-the-wool fighter, masterful at short range in the way anyone serving the Beast Master needed to be.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">Her fighting style, however, ventured from the beaten path. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.2">Alvis brought her staff up to her forehead—and in the next instant, it disappeared, as she grew a golden horn from above her eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.3">Finally free, her aura surged outward from her, greatly amplifying her power. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.4">This was her second Transformation and her most secret of abilities.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">She stood there, her entire body protected by dragon scales. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.2">The whole space around them belonged to her, her aura producing streaks of lightning in the air.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">“Wha?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">Gobta spat out, sensing danger. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.3">There was no way Alvis could remain coolheaded enough to tell friend from foe like that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">“You said your name was Gobta? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.2">You have my permission to move out immediately.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">“Ohhh, you don’t need to tell me twice, ma’am! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">Riders, retreat!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">One shout from him was all it took to make the goblin riders flee the scene. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.2">The surviving magic-born took the opportunity to quickly surround Alvis.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">“You fool! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.2">You intend to take us on alone?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">It was nothing for her to worry about.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">“Is that how little you think of me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.2">Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.3">Die, you mob of idiots!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">By the time Yamza saw it unfolding, it was already too late. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.2">One magic-born before him fell to the ground, spewing blood. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.3">One turned to stone and shattered against the earth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.4">One had his body literally rot away on the spot, until nothing but a pile of dust remained. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.5">His army was being killed, struck by ailments by one degree or another, and Yamza had no way to stop it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">“Yoouuuuuu!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">Alvis was, in the end, best suited for close-quarters combat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">The Golden Snakehorn’s lone horn on her forehead became a symbol of the death that permeated the atmosphere—and then Yamza realized that his defeat was total.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">“Surrender, and I will take you prisoner and guarantee you your life.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">Her offer was the only method of survival he had. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">A quick stare with her Snake Eyes had completely shattered his Doppelganger’s body. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.3">It even had the power to destroy equipment, apparently, leaving Yamza’s partner to fade away before battle even began.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">…My limbs are starting to go numb. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.2">I won’t be able to defend myself before long… What kind of sheer strength do these Lycanthropeers enjoy?!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">It was bad luck that Yamza had to be paired with the strongest of that trio. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.2">He chose the wrong woman to pick a fight with, and he had no idea. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.3">Alvis rarely had the chance to fully exercise her power, since she was often picked to serve a commanding role. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.4">As a result, she was seen as the de facto manager of the Lycanthropeers, not as a formidable warrior in her own right.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">That was Yamza’s appraisal as well, and he had totally underrated her.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">The war was won. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.2">But it was not over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.3">Clayman was a sly demon lord, one who would never forgive betrayal among his own armies. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.4">And just when Yamza prepared to nod his agreement to Alvis’s offer:</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">(—You know I would never permit that, yes?)</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">It was Clayman’s voice, booming within Yamza’s mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.2">“Uh?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.3">he instinctively grunted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.4">Then his body began moving, beyond his own control.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">“S-stop! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">Stop that! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.3">Please, Sir Clayman, stop this at once!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">A hand took a bluish-purple orb out from his pocket, then brought it to his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">“Mmghh!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">He locked his jaw as tightly as he could, trying to scramble away from it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">It was a pointless act of resistance, and it didn’t last long. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.3">Struck by Clayman’s Marionette takeover, Yamza’s body was no longer his own to control.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">“…What are you doing?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">a suspicious Alvis asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.3">But by the time she did, Yamza was busy swallowing the orb in his hand—a section from Charybdis’s body.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">“Hah? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.2">Harbhh, nnhhh… Graghaghaaaahhh!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">“What on—?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">Alvis tensed up, confused—as long, thin tendrils shot out from his body toward the dead lying around him, taking in the corpses. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">He ballooned in size, turning into a vast, grotesque ball of flesh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.3">Uncontrollable magical energy flowed within the Alvis-dominated air, forming a hurricane-class blizzard.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">The creature before her consumed, expanded, and burst. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.2">Having no monster core of its own, it was a self-destructing being, rampaging across the land before meeting its demise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.3">But its temporary power was every bit as strong as Yamza’s—and the nature of it was deadly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.4">Its insatiable desire to eat everything in its path was just the same as well.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">This was the “forbidden” tactic Yamza was reluctant to use, the intricate trap Clayman had laid. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.2">Charybdis had now appeared once more.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">Alvis’s face tightened as she threw her full force into an attack. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.2">It didn’t work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.3">No regular strike would ever pierce this constantly expanding Charybdis. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.4">Its Ultraspeed Regeneration took in the corpses around it, rapidly reforming it into a temporary body for itself.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">All Alvis could do was gnash her teeth, her Snake Eyes and lightning having no effect. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.2">This monster was disaster-class, on a level far, far above her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.3">Even the strongest of the Three Lycanthropeers could do little about it by herself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.4">The only saving grace was that this was a distance away from the main battlefield; there was time before this could start to affect her allies but only until Charybdis could finish creating its body.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">Desperation flew in like a violent storm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.2">The worst part was how this monster wasn’t satisfied enough using Yamza as its substitute core—it had taken in his Ice Blade as well, sucking up all the heat around it and making the local temperature plummet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.3">The monster was destroying all in its path, turning its aura into an Ice Blizzard, pummeling the area with icy snow and intense wind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.4">That was scary enough, but what Alvis feared even more was the moment when it released all the heat energy it had taken in.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">Those who can teleport out might be fine, but everyone else…</span></em></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">Even through the desperation, Alvis tried to take the best measures she could. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.2">To her, this meant trying to relay a plea to Benimaru to retreat everyone from the battlefield.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">There, with no previous warning, Benimaru himself appeared.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">“Oh, Charybdis, eh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.2">My offense did little against it last time, but how about now?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">Benimaru raised his right hand and grasped it—both Charybdis and his own strength. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">The fight was over in an instant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.3">His feet planted on the ground, his sword, covered in jet-black flames, slashed the monster’s flesh, although it did not fully slice through its freshly constructed body. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.4">But something was different from before. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.5">Unlike with Alvis’s efforts, the Self-Regeneration never started. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.6">Dark flames were dancing across the gash, rapidly engulfing its entire body.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">He turned back toward Alvis, leaning his sword against his shoulder, seemingly unconcerned with Charybdis.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">Alvis’s surprise was understandable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.2">If his attacks worked on Charybdis, it meant Benimaru’s magic force surpassed the monster’s. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.3">This meant that Benimaru himself was disaster class, on the same level as Alvis’s master, the demon lord Carillon.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">“I have some business to take care of, Alvis. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.2">Effective immediately, I hereby appoint you as my aide to command our entire force.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">He was scarred from head to toe, but his wounds had already closed up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.2">The speed at which they healed was mind-boggling, going well beyond the Self-Regeneration most beastmen had and almost reaching the realm of Ultraspeed Regeneration. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.3">Phobio had inherited that skill to some extent after the previous Charybdis swallowed him up.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">Teare was the quicker of the two, but she could never quite land a lethal blow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.2">Phobio, on the other hand, was slowly but surely damaging Teare’s body. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.3">He might have appeared defeated at first glance, but the longer the fight lasted, the more likely it was that it’d end otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">Footman, meanwhile, was rolled up like a meatball, bounding around at hyper-speed and trying to run Geld down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.2">Geld used his great shield to deflect his trajectory, swinging his Meat Cleaver to try to smash him up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.3">His attempts were blocked by Footman’s thickened skin, preventing him from dealing decisive damage.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">On offense and defense, it was safe to call them perfectly even—but only because Footman hadn’t begun seriously fighting yet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.2">And now, with Charybdis defeated, Footman’s recess time was over.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">Geld, realizing this, positioned himself in front of Phobio.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">Before he could answer, Footman began raining attacks on the both of them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.2">These were balls of magic, each one enormous and stuffed with energy—a simple attack but one with enough force to alter the landscape around them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.3">One of the magic orbs was enough to shatter Geld’s shield and even smash up the armor covering his body. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.4">It damaged Phobio in the process, and he no doubt had Ultraspeed Regeneration to thank for still being alive.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">It was several minutes into the battle—minutes that, to Gabil and Sufia, felt like hours. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.2">But it ended unceremoniously.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">“Mgh?!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">“Huff…huff… What…what is the matter…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">After the second or third repetition, Sufia had learned how to roll with Middray’s throws, helping recover her energy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.2">Gabil, meanwhile, had flung his spear wildly around at this attack he wasn’t used to, completely exhausting him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.3">Middray, dealing with them both, appeared completely unhindered by fatigue—compared to sparring with Milim, this wouldn’t even make him break a sweat.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">And Middray was the first to notice it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1">“All forces, use your healing magics!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.2">he shouted, the casual ease disappearing from his face. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.3">“Stand up! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.4">Stand up and rouse everyone around here!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1">“This is bad, Father Middray,” Hermes said, apparently feeling much better now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.2">“This guy… The reading I’m getting is huge.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">“I know that! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.2">This is Charybdis, the beast Lady Milim dispatched just the other day. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.3">Or is it its remains?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">“Yeah… It looks unstable to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.2">I imagine it’ll disintegrate before the day is through…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">“But this is a battlefield. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.2">If things go wrong, it could rapidly evolve. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.3">Better not to give a monster like that the food it craves.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">The fallen priests around him cast healing spells to revive both themselves and Team Hiryu under Gabil’s command.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">“Charybdis?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.2">Sufia asked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.3">“The monster that used Phobio as a core to revive itself with?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.4">I thought Lady Milim had already destroyed it!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">“Yes,” Gabil added, realizing this current match was over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.2">“If it was Charybdis, Lady Milim definitely killed it…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">“Calm down. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.2">It’s not the real thing; just a fragment of its force. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.3">I think it used Yamza as its replacement core…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">Middray was using Dragon’s Glance to analyze the innards of the creature. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.2">It was not as strong as Milim’s own Dragon’s Eye, but it still provided him with ample enough vision and analysis skills.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">Hermes, meanwhile, was surveying the area for any other potential threats. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.2">“Looks like you’re right, sir. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.3">That ass Yamza was trying to kill us, but his soul’s already been consumed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.4">With how he is now, we’ll just have to keep damage to a minimum and wait for him to fall apart,” he coldly concluded.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">“Did you hear that? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.2">Keep your weapons at the ready, people. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.3">And don’t get greedy! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.4">If buying time is all we need, that won’t be a tall order.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">“Let us help you out,” Gabil added, in sync with Middray as if they were old friends. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.2">“We are more used to high-altitude flight since last time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.3">If we can catch those scale attacks before they strike, they cannot hurt us.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">Even a crazed, twisting beast like Charybdis had a tendency to chase after anything moving. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.2">A flying target, Gabil reasoned, would make the perfect lure. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.3">Sufia was also thinking unusually lucidly, trying to execute on what she could do here.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">“Right,” Middray began, “I’ll aid in the retreat so it can’t feed off any of our ground forces and—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">But before he could finish, things took an abrupt turn as Benimaru all but vaporized Charybdis.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">“What…on…?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.2">He just pulled off the most unbelievable thing!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">“…Who is that guy? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.2">A demon lord? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.3">Unless you’re Lady Milim, how could some regular magic-born do </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.2">He has to be some kind of monster…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">Only Middray and Hermes had an accurate bead on the situation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.2">Sufia and Gabil saw it at the same time but couldn’t parse what just happened. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.3">All they could see was that the evil aura of Charybdis had been snuffed in an instant.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">“Hey, what’s going on? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.2">Tell me!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">“Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.2">We seek an explanation as well.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">“Yeah, um, I’d want to explain,” Hermes said, “but…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">“I don’t think we need to,” Middray finished.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">Before either of them could, the air in front of them twisted and warped, revealing a magic-born with hair as red as roaring flames. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.2">It was Benimaru, sword rested on his shoulder, and he was here to take on Middray, the last threat on the battlefield.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">“Well,” he said with a sneer, “I see you’ve been entertaining my friends?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">Then he realized something wasn’t quite right about this picture. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.3">There was evidence of combat around him, but there were no injuries—and by the looks of things, no hard feelings on either side.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">“Sir Benimaru, wait! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.2">These are Lady Milim’s fighters, the priests of the Dragon Faithful!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">“What? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.2">Lady Milim’s?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.3">In that case…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">“Yes! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.2">They healed our wounds with magic!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">“…I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.2">It seems I’ve jumped to conclusions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.3">You seemed like such a threat in this theater, I couldn’t help but be alarmed.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.2">You didn’t jump to conclusions at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.3">We </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">were</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1"> actually fighting, yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.2">And we did perform some healing, but that was to prepare for what we thought was an oncoming disaster. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.3">Now I suppose all that wasn’t necessary.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">“…Ah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.2">So what now? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.3">Are you taking us on?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.1">“Well, what </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">should</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1"> we do…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">“Because personally speaking, I would prefer not to engage in combat with Lady Milim’s forces.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">“No, I suppose not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.2">I can understand wanting to try it, but there is no quarrel between us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.3">I would simply want to compare our powers.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">“Yes… I can see that.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">The two gave each other knowing grins.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">“Whoooa!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.2">Hermes interjected. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.3">“Not good, Father!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">“Yes, Sir Benimaru! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.2">If you hurt one of the Dragon Faithful, there’s no telling what kind of calamity that would bring upon us!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1">“You heard her, Father Middray! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.2">Sir Rimuru is Lady Milim’s friend. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.3">It would all end in tragedy, I am sure of it!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">Sufia silently resented Hermes and Gabil for stepping in.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">“Fair enough,” Benimaru said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.2">“Besides, if I don’t come at him trying to kill him, I expect it’ll result in nothing but defeat for me—and I don’t like engaging in losing battles.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">“Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.2">Quite so. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.3">And I’m not sure even I could withstand a blow like the one that buried Charybdis!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">Middray might have laughed the concept off, but he had a suspicion that he could win the battle before Benimaru had a chance to bust that out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.2">That would result in a life-and-death duel, however, going well beyond the boundaries of a friendly sparring session. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.3">A battlefield was the wrong place for this, and it no longer meant anything anyway.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">Thus ended the battle in the former kingdom of Orbic, while the unified forces enjoyed a near-total victory. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.2">But this wasn’t the only battlefield.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1">Beyond these wetlands were several murky swamps, gas bubbling out from the surface. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.2">This was what created the cloud of mist, making things seem eerier than they already were. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.3">The moment they waded in, visibility plummeted to nearly nothing.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.1">“It is,” confirmed Soei. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.2">“That was why we called off our investigation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.3">With this poor visibility, anyone inside would have to rely on their own five senses to ‘see’ around them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.4">That’s what the enemy must use to keep track of what goes on in here.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1">“Mm, I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.2">So we face a brutal disadvantage.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">“Indeed, Sir Hakuro. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.2">You and I can use Covert Agent to hide our presences, but Lady Shuna…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">“I should be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">It was true. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.2">Hakuro could use his Haze concealing skill to all but disappear to the external observer, as could Soei. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.3">You could be standing right next to them and never realize it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.4">Shuna, despite not having this exact Art, could still perfectly heal herself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">“Hmm… A combination of illusory and mystical magic? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.2">It doesn’t work like Haze, but it has the same effect. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.3">Well done, Lady Shuna.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">Hakuro was right—this approach was Shuna’s original creation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.2">While she wasn’t quite as gifted at it as Rimuru, her Creator unique skill allowed her to conjure up her own magic spells without a recipe.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1">“Then we should be fine,” Soei said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.2">“But I want you all to remember that Thought Communication won’t work in this fog. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.3">Visibility is low, it is hard to stay in contact, and we all need to proceed carefully and cautiously. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.4">Also…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">Even with Soei’s Replications, Thought Communication–based conversation would be impossible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.2">Instead, he provided a length of Sticky Steel Thread around each of their wrists for emergency contacts. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.3">Focusing on this thread would allow them to maintain at least a modicum of communication, but if the string broke, that would be the end of the contact. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.4">Using it required a great deal of caution.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1">Shuna and Hakuro nodded and wrapped it around their wrists. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.2">They were ready now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.3">“Let’s get going,” Shuna said, and the three ran off.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1">Then, after several minutes of walking, Shuna stopped.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">“…Oh no,” she whispered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.2">“We seem to have fallen into a trap.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">“A trap?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">“I can feel my senses going haywire on me, yes, but I don’t feel any enemies around the— </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.1">What?!</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.1">”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.1">Before he could finish speaking, Soei felt multiple presences nearby appear from out of nowhere, virtually surrounding them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">“How on…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.2">Where were so many of these enemies hiding, such that we couldn’t notice them?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1">“No, Hakuro! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.2">They weren’t hiding. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.3">We were lured right to them!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1">“Ah… This fog. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.2">The cloud’s doing more than confusing our sense of direction. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.3">It’s concealing the enemy and inviting us right to the middle of their circle…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1">“I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.2">That explains the odd feeling I had just now.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1">“You’re right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.2">The mist is triggering Spatial Interference to lure intruders from any direction to a specific place—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.1">Before Shuna finished explaining this, one of the presences appeared. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.2">Soei and Hakuro steeled themselves toward it, keeping a watchful eye out for the still-unseen monsters in the mist, as Shuna closed her mouth and focused on it—a skeleton dressed in a vestment of pure white.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.1">“Such massive magical force,” she whispered, beads of sweat on her forehead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.2">For a moment, she thought it might have been Clayman himself, although she banished the thought quickly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.3">It was past midnight; the demon lord should be over at the Walpurgis Council. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.4">Perhaps it was one of Clayman’s five fingers, then—but the figure before them exuded pure presence, beyond that of the Lycanthropeers and approaching demon lord level. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.5">The power of this magic-born was overwhelming; it was a wonder that it was subservient to anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1">She recalled what Mjurran told her about Clayman’s most senior leaders—and that one of them was geared strictly toward defending their base.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">“…You must be Adalmann, then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.2">The ruler of this land—the wight king with power over countless undead…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">Hakuro had just used Heavengaze to reach the same conclusion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.2">But this figure was more ominous than how Mjurran described it, its force far more massive. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.3">The guardian of this wetland was a wight king on the level of a demon lord.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">Soei accepted Shuna and Hakuro’s appraisal, finding no reason to doubt it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.2">Then, quietly, he sharpened his bladelike mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.3">No matter who the enemy is, he </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">will</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1"> kill him—that was his credo.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">But just as Soei was about to move, the wight king spoke.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1">“Indeed, I am Adalmann. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.2">I have been ordered to protect this land by the great demon lord Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.3">Lowly intruders like you may do nothing but humbly submit your lives to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.4">Do it, and I will kill you without pain.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">This was the command of a kingly figure, not the words of a foe who saw Shuna and her companions as equals. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.2">Considering the massive, overwhelming amount of Adalmann’s magic energy, anything else would almost seem improper.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.1">Now, all around the area, a legion of over ten thousand undead were writhing, as if attracted to the seemingly inexhaustible supply of magicules. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.2">Cracking, wrenching sounds filled the air as they moved to encircle the trio.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.1">“We are fully surrounded,” Shuna breathlessly reported. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.2">“This mist is working alongside a directional barrier to prevent teleportation outside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.3">All our means of communication are blocked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.4">The only way to get out of here is to defeat this Adalmann foe.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.1">“Then we must strike their leader at once.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.1">“No disagreement here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.2">A blow from me can even kill the dead.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.1">Hakuro and Soei had no interest in following Adalmann’s advice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.2">As Shuna explained the situation, they both went on the attack. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.3">But Adalmann simply laughed in their faces.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.1">“Heh-heh-heh… You appear not to know your place. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.2">I generously provided you mercy, and yet, you remain foolish to the end. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.3">You will regret refusing that offer shortly.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.1">He breezily swung an arm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.2">The next moment, the most surprising thing happened—the white blade of Hakuro, instantly zooming within range of Adalmann, was blocked by the knight who had appeared in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.1">Hakuro stepped back in shock, failing to believe that this killer blow could be parried. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.2">This was a death knight, ranked A-minus in the Guild system, but from that clash, Hakuro could sense something was off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.3">It was a powerful monster, yes, but no garden-variety death knight could ever block a slash from him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">“You are no normal adversary. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.2">Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.3">Let me give you my full attention.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.1">He had an accurate bead on this death knight and the threat it carried for him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.2">Its strength relied not on physical toughness but on the built-up level of its skills—which meant Heavengaze would tell him nothing about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.3">So he used his own physical might to confront it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1">“……”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">The death knight was silent; the corpse serving as the shell of its body was incapable of speech. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.2">But there was a blistering blue flame in its sunken eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.3">The light of consciousness was in there, the pride of a former human being, and it told Hakuro that his challenge was accepted.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">Even after abandoning life, this death knight was a proud, noble warrior. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.2">The difference in magical energy between the two was negligible, as was their physical muscle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.3">It marked the beginning of a clash between built-up skills, one that quickly made sparks fly.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1">Before Soei, meanwhile, was Adalmann himself, an enormous shadow from out of nowhere blocking all attempts to attack him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">“Deh!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.2">Soei glared at the towering shade. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.3">“No… A dragon zombie?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1">“No, Soei!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.2">Shuna could see it more fully, through the muck. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.3">“Nothing that weak! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.4">Its magicules outnumber yours; it stands at the peak of the undead—it’s a death dragon!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1">Soei’s face tensed upon hearing this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.2">He could manage this solo, but fighting this foe while guarding Shuna was a different story. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.3">The usually reliable Hakuro was too busy with the death knight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.4">He had to dispatch this death dragon as soon as possible, or else Shuna would be overrun by the thousands of undead lumbering their way in from all sides. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.5">Now, Soei realized, was no time to hold back.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1">“Then, die! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.2">Mystic Thread Strike!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.1">Without delay, Soei dealt out the most powerful attack he could, a killer move that fricasseed the enemy with thousands of branching strings of Sticky Steel Thread, each granted the Insta-Kill effect from his Shadow Striker unique skill. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.2">They created a virtual garden of beautiful, bloody blooms, like a kaleidoscope. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.3">Even a half-spiritual life-form like an undead would be snuffed out by this spiritual body-slicing move—or so it should have.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.1">“No! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.2">It’s regenerating?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.1">Soei could feel himself begin to sweat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.2">The sixty-foot-long beast’s body was ripped apart, seemingly ending the battle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.3">But then, as if nothing was amiss, the death dragon’s body reassembled itself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.4">It went so fast, even faster than Ultraspeed Regeneration, that it seemed like nothing less than immortality.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.1">“Then let me destroy you, soul and all…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.1">“Soei,” Shuna shouted out as he steeled himself, “calm down! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.2">You know how to analyze your foe’s strengths. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.3">You should know that you can’t beat a death dragon!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.1">“That dragon’s soul is within the magic-born Adalmann,” she quietly declared. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.2">“Don’t worry about me; just work on keeping that dragon where it is. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.3">I’ll defeat Adalmann!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.1">“That’s too dangerous!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.1">“No, Soei. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.2">Listen to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.3">I’m angry.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">A cold smile stretched across Shuna’s face to dispel Soei’s worries. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.2">They shined a piercing light, exhibiting her raging emotions. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.3">The sight made Soei clam up, unable to speak.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1">As the former princess of the ogre tribe, Shuna’s words had the power to make others do her bidding—and now, that power was stronger than even the otherworlder Kirara Mizutani’s Bewilder unique skill. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.2">Besides, Shuna wasn’t some precious cargo that required constant protection. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.3">Soei knew that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.4">So there was only one answer.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1">“Yes, Lady Shuna. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.2">Best of luck.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">She contentedly smiled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.2">“You too, Soei. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.3">That dragon’s all yours.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">Soei nodded back, giving Shuna his full trust, then threw himself back into his own fight.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">“Hoh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.2">And what do you intend to do, little girl? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.3">What could </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">you</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1"> do without anyone to defend you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.2">How are you going to engage ten thousand foes at once?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">There was an odd sort of joy in Adalmann’s voice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.2">He </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1"> enjoying this, in fact. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.2">The demon lord Clayman’s orders were absolute, but Adalmann was still afforded his own sense of free will, although his activities were limited in every other way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.3">The only thing he was allowed full rein to do was wipe out intruders.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">Clayman’s other minions derided him for having so much power but so little brains to back that up—and it was only because he was not allowed to leave this land or do anything on his own volition. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.2">And it was perhaps the way that he wasn’t even allowed to provide excuses to them that made people fail to realize it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1">Adalmann was less a magic-born and more a weapon, a base-defense mechanism bound to this land. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.2">His soul remained unbound, but his behavior was now automatic, following the orders input into him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.3">He spoke of his loyalty to Clayman, but that was just an act. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.4">He had been preset to pay his formal respects to the owner of this device.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">In his heart of hearts, Adalmann wanted to be released from these bonds. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.2">That was why he enjoyed talking with Shuna. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.3">The defense mechanisms worked automatically; he had no authority to alter them in any way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.4">The chats he had with intruders were his only hobby to speak of, the only thing no one else could interfere with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.5">The demon lord Kazalim, creator of this structure, offered him that much mercy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.6">Or maybe not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.7">But Adalmann wanted to think so. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.8">That gesture, after all, was what had allowed him to live all this time, a thousand years or so, without succumbing to insanity.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1">Even if it was just a measure to keep this system running longer, I have to thank him for that, at least.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1">And he meant it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.2">That was why he never spared any effort to hammer down intruders, regardless of what he thought about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.3">But at least he prayed, as he imagined an army of ten thousand undead preying upon Shuna, that it could be done painlessly.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">But then her voice rang out sharply once more.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1">“No need to worry about me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.2">Alignment Field!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">At that instant, the area within a three-hundred-foot radius of Shuna became holy ground, where nothing of evil alignment could tread. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.2">It was another original product of Shuna’s mind, using her experience to Analyze the Anti-Magic Area and Holy Field, then Fuse them together. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.3">This barrier obstructed all magicules, but it could also be set to block fire, wind, or any one of the other four major elements, making it a shockingly formidable defensive spell.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1">“Now we won’t be distracted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.2">If I defeat you, that will destroy the defense system with you at its core, right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1">“…Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.2">Impressive. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.3">And you’ve seen through my secret as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.4">What is your name, girl?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.1">Shuna was absolutely right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.2">If Adalmann died, the whole base-defense system would crumble. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.3">It was structured to bind Adalmann’s soul down, using it to circulate the large amounts of magicules it required. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.4">That would no doubt free the death dragon serving him—as well as the death knight, Alberto, who was once Adalmann’s friend and confidant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.5">Shuna had seen all that at a glance, and Adalmann offered her his honest respect for that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.6">Respect and the ever-so-slight hope that she might be able to release him from this pain.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.1">“My name is Shuna.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.1">“Shuna… Lady Shuna. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.2">Then let us settle this for good. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.3">If you can defeat me, I will follow your wishes.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.1">“My, thank you for the polite request. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.2">However, all I seek is the destruction of the demon lord Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.3">If you stay out of my way, I could leave you alone to live on this land, perhaps?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.1">“Heh-heh-heh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.2">I’m not sure that’s possible, I’m afraid.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.1">“No? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.2">I thought you might be capable of conquering the ties that bind you, but perhaps I was wrong. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.3">Oh, well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.4">In that case,” she said without a moment’s hesitation, “I will kill you as I intended to.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.1">If I could conquer them</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">, thought Adalmann, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1">I would have done it eons ago. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.2">Kazalim is a man to be feared, a foe no one can hold a candle to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.3">The nickname Curse Lord is not just bravado. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.4">And she makes it all sound so easy…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.1">“Then the time for talk is over,” he declared, still having no ill will toward her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.2">“Try to resist me with everything you’ve got!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.1">Adalmann was born a prince in one of the small nations under the jurisdiction of the Holy Empire of Lubelius. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.2">These lands were all too weak to have their own standing militaries, instead relying on the Temple Knights sent from the Church’s central headquarters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.3">In exchange, they were required to adopt Luminism as the state religion and provide money and qualified personnel for their knight corps.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.1">The Western Holy Church of the time didn’t enjoy the influence they wielded now; this was before the advent of their Crusader groups. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.2">Practitioners who showed talent could be granted the name of “acolyte,” a nonhereditary title, but that was it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.3">In the midst of that, Adalmann was an exceptional performer—and with his elder brother taking over the country and quickly giving birth to an heir, he was free to devote himself deeply to spreading the faith, joining the Church’s missionary corps and quickly making a name for himself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.1">He was devout to the faith, constantly fascinated by the divine works of Luminus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.2">Never once did he doubt the existence of this lone, true, powerful goddess. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.3">That devotion eventually led him to learn the “divine miracles” of the Church’s archbishop class, making him the greatest master of holy magic in his era.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.1">In time, he advanced to the rank of cardinal, the loftiest in the Western Holy Church. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.2">In the Lubelius noble hierarchy, he was no one particularly special. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.3">But he redoubled his efforts, extending his interests to magic beyond the holy spells he was familiar with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.4">He would hold long discussions about magic with Gadora, one of his best friends at the time, as he incessantly polished his skills. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.5">The effort eventually paid off—he became an Enlightened, transcending the bounds of humanity itself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.1">An Enlightened was a person who retained their human form but on the inside was a demi-spiritual being, similar to a higher-level elemental. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.2">Their powers were leaps and bounds above those of a regular human, and they were often seen as defenders of the human cause. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.3">This power quickly put Adalmann in a position of immense central authority.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.1">Time passed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.2">Adalmann’s intensive study continued. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.3">And eventually, he took the next step forward, to the highest peak of mankind—a Sage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.4">As he did, he was greeted with wondrous news: He would be called to the Inner Cloister, at the top of the Church’s holy mountain.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1">The offer filled him with joy.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1">Finally, an audience with Luminus herself!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">He always believed that Luminus was real, an unwavering belief that served as the source for all his faith. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.2">So he promptly set off for the holy mount, not believing for a moment that it would lead to tragedy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.3">That belief, sadly, would ultimately betray him.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">She didn’t miss a beat.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1">The barrier of fire deflected and vaporized all the magic-infused droplets. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.2">Between accelerating her mind to a thousand times normal, possessing superior Analyze and Assess skills, and changing the rules with Cast Cancel and Control Laws, Shuna’s unique skill Parser was made for a clash of magic like this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.3">From the moment Adalmann began constructing a spell, she had a way to deal with it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1">“Then how about this? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.2">Malicious dead, accept this sacrifice—Curse Bind!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.1">This was necromancy, an offshoot of elemental magic that took advantage of the negative energies from ghouls and the undead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.2">Curse Bind was a particularly nasty one, summoning zombies that latched on to anything living—human or magic-born—and drained away their life energy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.1">Even that wasn’t enough.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.1">Shuna’s refreshingly clear voice reached Adalmann’s ears, and right after came the tolling of bells he was once well used to hearing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.2">That was all it took to send the grudgeful zombies to the afterlife.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.1">“…It can’t be! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.2">Why? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.3">Why is a monster wielding elemental magic?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.1">Adalmann’s eyes shot open at the divine miracle playing out before him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.2">The magic was deployed all too beautifully, reminding him of his youthful days spent studying.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.1">This was holy magic in the air, something a monster girl should never be able to weave. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.2">The unbelievable sight made him scream without thinking.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.1">Shuna smiled as she decided to answer Adalmann’s question, even though she had no obligation to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.2">“Do you find it strange? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.3">Perhaps you need a little more imagination. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.4">Holy magic is not the exclusive domain of humans; it will work with anyone who believes in the power of miracles, based on the strength of their belief.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.1">Conventional wisdom in this world stated that holy magic worked by forging a pact with an elemental spirit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.2">This was both right and wrong. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.3">The fact that magic-born could cast healing spells indicated that “holy” magic was possible for them without any pact with a holy being. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.4">Most humans, and even monsters, didn’t understand that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.1">The sole condition for acquiring holy magic was having faith—believing in miracles, to put it another way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.2">Good, or evil, didn’t factor into it; the strength of one’s emotions was directly converted into power. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.3">That was how this family of magic worked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.4">(This was also the reason why the Dragon Faithful that worshipped Milim could access holy magic.)</span></p>
