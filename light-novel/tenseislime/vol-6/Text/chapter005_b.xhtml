<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">“We prepared this wonderful meal for her… I hope Lady Milim is not hungry somewhere out there, you see…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">“I doubt it,” Hermes countered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">In fact, he was sure about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.3">The wonderful meal Middray mentioned was a “plate of nature’s bounties,” which in fact was a bunch of raw vegetables on a plate. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.4">The last time he had a meal with Milim, Hermes stole a glance at her, only to find her lamely chewing away, all expression drained from her face.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">I could tell she wasn’t enjoying it</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">, he thought. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">She was just trying her best to power through it.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1"> Judging by her joy when some roasted meat was brought out, there was no doubt in his mind.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">He had suggested to Middray that actually cooking the food might please Lady Milim more, but that fell on deaf ears. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">It was the head priest’s firm belief that providing all the glories of nature, in their most natural form, was the best possible way to pamper her. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">That’s exactly why Lady Milim hardly comes around any longer</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">, he wanted to say, but it’d be his neck on the line if he did.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Hermes had traveled extensively across the land, giving him insight into the cuisines of many nations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">The other priests, meanwhile, didn’t have that experience. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">They were too closed-minded to think that anything apart from “pure nature” would be right, so Hermes just gave up eventually.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">“Perhaps, perhaps not,” mused Middray. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">“But just imagine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">That villain Clayman, thinking he’s king of the world, making Lady Milim write that edict…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">It was definitely written in Milim’s sloppy— Er, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">unique</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1"> handwriting. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">They had no choice but to carry it out, but they could only go so far with it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">“Yeah, true. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">We can’t do much if it’s Lady Milim’s orders…but they’ve emptied out Food Storehouse Number Three, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">We’ve only got seven left. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.4">That’s going to make things lean until the next harvest…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“Dammit all!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Veins swelled across Middray’s bald head like the skin of a melon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">It was rather clear just how angry he was. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">And given how he had to work hard to keep from laughing at it, Hermes was a pretty shameless priest, too.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">As they spoke, the very source of all their troubles came walking up—the general manager of the Clayman force.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“Feh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">Keep your cool, Hermes.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“I hear you.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">You first</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">, Hermes thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">He was hoping the man would walk on past, but sadly, he was headed straight toward them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">They closed their mouths and waited for the man, Yamza, to arrive.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Yamza was the general commander of Clayman’s forces, a man seen as one of the demon lord’s most trusted confidants. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">Slender in size and build, he looked light enough to float into the air, making him a fighter built for speed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">Or perhaps, not a fighter so much as a swordsman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.4">A first-class swordsman with arms as fast as a passing gale. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.5">The Ice Blade, a Unique weapon gifted to him by Clayman, allowed him to use the aspectual magic Ice Blizzard. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.6">Between that and his latent sword skills, the Frozen Swordmage was an A-plus magic-born in rank.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“Well, hello there, Father Middray. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">We do appreciate the provisions you’re supporting us with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">With an army of thirty thousand, there’s just never enough to go around.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">He flashed a friendly grin at them, but his eyes weren’t smiling. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">He silently, carefully gauged Middray’s response. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">He didn’t give Hermes a glance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.4">It was a common thing to see, magic-born treating humans like second-class citizens. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.5">Hermes wasn’t a fan, but he sucked it up, just as Middray told him to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.6">There was no point starting a fight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.7">He saw it as just a temporary affront.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“Ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">It’s an honor to be in your service. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">However, sadly, it is difficult to provide you with much more than we already have. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.4">Lady Milim would be saddened if our people don’t have enough to eat.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">“What are you saying?!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Even that little retort was enough to set Yamza off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">“</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Your</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1"> Milim was the one who stepped out of line. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">We’re trying to clean up the mess she made, so the least you could do is show us all the respect you can!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">It was an act, of course. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">He was pretending to be mad so that he could see how Middray reacted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">If the head priest retaliated, he clearly intended to use that as a pretext to sack the city.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“Ah, my pardons,” Middray modestly began. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">“We were thinking only about ourselves there, for a moment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">We will provide you with all the cooperation we can, so please feel free to ask.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">Hermes was thoroughly impressed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">All that haughty elitism, and Middray didn’t let any of his anger reach his face. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">He kept the smile going the whole time.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Well done, Father Middray. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">Your head didn’t go all melon-like at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">I would’ve snapped at him long ago.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Yamza returned his smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">“I see, I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">I was hoping to hear that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.4">We have enough people to sweep up the Beast Kingdom, but allow me to give you the opportunity to help us out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.5">You should be able to support us with material transport, shouldn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“W-wait just a minute! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">First you take our food, then you take our people from—”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">Hermes hadn’t intended to resist him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">He just let his mouth run off. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">The next instant, Hermes felt an intense pain in what used to be his left arm.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“Ah?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“Silence, you piece of trash!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">The slitted eyes of Yamza, placed upon Hermes for the first time, were cold as ice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">Holding his severed arm in place, Hermes gritted his teeth and glared at him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“…So you don’t know your place. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">You appear in a hurry to die.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Now his smile was brutal in its chill, as Yamza pointed his bloodstained sword at Hermes.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Bastard. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">Thinks he can tell me what to do—</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">Just as Hermes was about to lose his temper, he was thrown back by a force like a wild animal butting against him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">This was a kick, from Middray, hard enough to nearly break the skin.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“Ah, no, my apologies for all of this, Sir Yamza. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">I’ll teach this fool how to behave correctly, so please, by my name, I hope you will forgive him.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">Middray bowed his head toward the magic-born.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“Pfft. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">Always a pain, isn’t it, when the people below you are such idiots? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">I will forgive him just this once. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.4">We will depart tomorrow morning, so I want all of you priests to prepare immediately!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">Middray’s mediation was enough to make Yamza sheathe his sword. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">But it came at a heavy price. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">The Dragon Faithful’s priests, the leaders of their people, had just been forcibly conscripted.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Yamza promptly left with nothing more to say. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">He wasn’t expecting fighters among the Faithful; he just wanted the priests and their healing magic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">And thanks to Hermes’s needless meddling, Yamza had everything he wanted.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">After he left, Middray sighed and healed Hermes’s wound.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“You utter fool. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">I warned you about that.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“I’m sorry—I just couldn’t help myself…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Hermes held his arm in place as Middray began his work, casting the holy magic Recovery on it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">In a few moments, the amputated limb was good as new. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">The blood loss made him a little light-headed, but he could use his own Healing skill to tackle that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Well, even if the priests are gone, our people won’t be affected right away. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">But that man…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">The anger he held back was now clear on his face as Middray glared in the direction Yamza walked off to.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">“…He is damaging Lady Milim’s own assets.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">He was referring to his attack on Hermes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">It was an unforgivable act of aggression, although he was now trying to sweep that kick he landed under the rug.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">That kick hurt like hell, too, y’know…</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">But Hermes didn’t bring it up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">He knew Middray didn’t mean ill of him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">As befitting someone who worshiped Milim, Middray tended to fly into violent rages all too easily. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.4">Something you could say about everyone in this domain, really…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">“No, but really… Do you mind if I kill him?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">“Fool,” the head priest promptly replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">“You don’t stand a chance.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">He wasn’t wrong. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">Hermes probably couldn’t even scratch him.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">Last night, after our conference, Soei contacted me again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">He participated in the meeting in the flesh, but one of his Replications reported in this time, after collecting information from across the Beast Kingdom. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">Soka, and the other four people on his team, were contributing as well, providing a few more solid leads.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">The Clayman force, ever on the lookout, still had not moved.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">In the midst of this, they all searched for someplace to deploy our own forces, but a problem arose. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">The fleeing residents of the Beast Kingdom were spread out all over the place. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.3">If we wanted to rescue them, then no matter where we transported our army to, we might have some areas left unevacuated before time ran out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.4">Thanks to the Clayman force’s invasion route, we were lagging behind schedule.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">Suggestion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">It would be more effective to transport the citizens to a single location.</span></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">Yeah, I suppose it would be. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.4">No reason why that kind of transport is military only.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1"> Dominate Space allowed me to smoothly travel wherever I wanted, including to Soei, his Replications, or Soka and the others. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">I could then use the new type of transport spell we devised to collect all the evacuees together.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Thanks to that, things got very busy after the conference. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">First, I had Geld’s army go on ahead to build a field base that could accept these refugees. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">I transported them over to the former location of Eurazania’s capital, which Milim had turned into a vacant lot. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.4">Being a wide-open field, it stuck out like a sore thumb, but there’d be no better place to deploy a large force in.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Then I personally went from village to village, transporting the refugees out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">This we wrapped up before the end of last night, which was why I was so exhausted—mentally speaking, that is.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Phobio was with me, which thankfully kept us from dealing with any resistance, although it exhausted him as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">“Performing all this teleportation,” he marveled before he left, looking at me like I was some kind of fiend. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.3">“How can you keep yourself together…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.4">And such elaborate transport magic, over and over again… It seems absurd.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">By now, Phobio should have been asleep in a room inside one of the field tents Geld’s force built. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">But that didn’t matter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.3">Our main force would be ready soon, so I needed to perform one really </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">big</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1"> transport shortly.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">I headed for an empty field just outside town. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">Rigurd was there, having spent the night preparing for this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">Unlike me, he was running and hopping around, a bottomless well of energy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.4">Rigur was called back as well, and he was pitching in all he could to help Rigurd. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.5">Once they were done, it was my job to transport all the people gathered here to our Beast Kingdom field camp. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.6">Once that was over, I planned to start preparing for the Walpurgis Council two days from now.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">Upon reaching the field, I found lines of Tempestian soldiers waiting for me—including ten thousand beastmen, led by Sufia and Alvis. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">Their armor was piecemeal, nothing unified about it, but that was unavoidable. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.3">We had simply provided them whatever armor we didn’t need, and since many were capable of transformation anyway, this was better than confining them in full uniform.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Next to them were my leaders, ready to serve as reinforcements. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">Even compared to the Charybdis battle, our size—and our power to wage war—had grown tremendously.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">Benimaru, noticing, stood next to me and took this opportunity to explain the evolutions that had taken place.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">Following my own demon lord evolution, everyone else in Tempest had some change of their own. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">The World Language said something about everyone in my “genealogy” receiving “gifts,” and I assumed that meant everyone I had named.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">“Based on what we heard from the townspeople,” he said as we faced the ranks of soldiers, “the men now enjoy enhanced stamina. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">The women report that their skin is glossier and more beautiful than before. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">None of that mattered to me—or I should say, it was beyond my comprehension, but I suppose you could say their spiritual strength has risen.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">Some, he reported, looked like they turned back the clock a few years. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">Everyone appreciated it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.3">But these were the townspeople. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.4">They were holding down the fort back home. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.5">Let’s see what our fighters are packing.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">Among our platoons, as well, there was a litany of changes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">Some soldiers learned new skills for themselves; others gained the same skill in groups, based on the unique nature of their squad. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.3">I couldn’t wait to dive in and see for myself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">We first visited a group that had been with me almost from the start—Gobta’s goblin riders, a legion of hobgoblins led by starwolves that almost never naturally appeared unless the right conditions were in place. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">But were they really hobgoblins? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.3">That’s their species, perhaps, but their essence was something wholly different now.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Astoundingly, they had all learned the extra skill Unify. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">This was a rare one that let man and mount quite literally become one, turning them into mobile, high-speed, four-legged warriors. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">They were awarded an A-minus rank in this form—they didn’t manage a solid A since they were geared mainly for one-on-one combat, but they were killers in battle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.4">A few working together could probably beat an A-ranked magic-born.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">That was the whole gimmick with them, of course. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">The goblin riders were a team, guaranteed to work rapidly with one another’s thoughts and remain steadily in formation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.3">They were keeping up with Hakuro’s training, after all—and if you imagine a hundred moving in tandem, you can see what made these Riders so fearsome.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">I definitely felt like the human-invented ranking system was doing these guys a disservice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">I could expect a lot more from them than that, even.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Next, we visited some of Benimaru’s personal trainees.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">Once I became leader of the Forest of Jura, we started enjoying a lot more combat-ready monsters in our midst. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">This included three hundred ogres, the most powerful of which were young men and women from the village that sought my help early on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.3">They looked up to Benimaru a lot, which affected the “gifts” they received.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">It was really a crazy sight to see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">Some had volunteered for the force, making them named warriors from the start. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.3">They were strong enough to be considered low-level magic-born, which made them a tremendously reliable asset. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.4">Even a wild, non-sentient ogre ranked a B—and these guys were both fully equipped and had learned some Arts. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.5">These were never gonna be wimpy kids.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">These ogres had formed a sort of elite personal guard for Benimaru, and each was A-minus in rank. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">I named them Team Kurenai, or </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">red flame</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">Now, for the fighters assigned to Benimaru’s main force.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">This was around four thousand hobgoblins, and their evolution was really fascinating to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">They had more or less taken on the flame element, learning skills like Control Flame and Resist Temperature Change. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.3">Kind of a surprise. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.4">Each soldier ranked a B equivalent, and you could call them a specialized assault team.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">By the way, these hobgoblins all had a reference to the color “green” in their names, since their skin was green. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">I don’t know who named them, but I really wish he thought a little more about the long-term effect with that.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">Report. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">They were named by you, Master.</span></span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">Since everybody was named “green” something, I named this army the Green Numbers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">Might as well go with it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.3">I wanted to go with “red” something since these were Benimaru’s forces, but I kinda liked the feel of this, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.4">It’d be a nice little surprise, this green force unleashing all these flame attacks. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.5">I think I’ll have their equipment repainted green for the battlefield sometime.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">Next up was Geld’s force, a sort of complement to the Green Numbers.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">The high orcs all evolved in the same way, earning power-up skills like Steel Strength and Iron Wall. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">Their officer class also had the extra skill Control Earth, letting them mold and sculpt the land around them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.3">Good for digging trenches in a hurry, as Geld put it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">In addition, everyone in the army had earned the extra skill Armorize Body, making them into much more of a defense-oriented tank unit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">They had also taken on a lot of my personal resistances—Resist Melee Attack to start with, followed by Pain, Rot, Electricity, and Paralysis. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.3">Kabal’s Charus Shield, the completed version of the one I gave him as a present, was now a Unique piece of equipment that boosted his magic resistance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.4">Basically, whether it was melee or magic, they could deal with it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.5">I gave half a thought to exposing them to Shion’s cuisine so they could gain poison resistance but quickly banished the thought.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">Still, obtaining all those shield-like scales from Charybdis was really a stroke of luck. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">Kurobe had made lots of copies of the items Garm had created from them, and I really have those craftsmen to thank for that.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">Now, this unit was sturdy enough that each member ranked a solid B. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">That, plus the Unique equipment on each one, made them impervious to any normal force. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.3">It was almost unfair how defensively able they were, and they numbered five thousand, their ranks beefed up by a constant stream of volunteers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.4">Normally, they were involved in construction work, but when they received the call, they transformed into a powerhouse, an iron wall that no attack could pierce.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">Still, in a way, it was almost like this squad’s talents were going to waste with Gabil. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">They could fly; they could breathe fire and lightning from the air… It’s nuts. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.3">And thanks to their intrinsic species aspects, they were resistant to pretty much everything—scales of steel, breastplate armor of magisteel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.4">Whether by sword or by magic, no halfhearted strike was going to break their skin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.5">Flight alone was enough to give them an overwhelming advantage, but look at that defense! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.6">Speed, offense, defense—the complete surprise-assault package, all in one.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">Last but not least, we had a brand-new unit, one positioned as my personal elite guard. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">Led by Shion, they were also a hundred strong, composed of the victims I revived after the battle in Tempest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.3">There were some children, age-wise, among them, but apparently they had grown up to—and beyond—the point of maturity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.4">I guess their frustration at not being able to fight encouraged that kind of evolution? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.5">Who knows?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">As far as skills go, they all earned the extra skills Complete Memory and Self-Regeneration. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">Those two complemented each other. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.3">Complete Memory meant that even if their heads were blown off, their memories remained in their astral bodies. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.4">They could then use Self-Regeneration to recover fully instead of dying instantly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.5">This meant they had basically gained the astonishing healing skills of the Orc Disaster of yore.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">If Self-Regeneration ever evolved into Ultraspeed Regeneration, they’d be pretty much immortal. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.2">And I had a hundred of these guys. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.3">I couldn’t even deal. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.4">And thanks to that regeneration, they were durable enough to take Shion’s ultra-intense training and deal with it just fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.5">As a female member put it, one who was just a little girl not long ago: “We don’t die or anything!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.6">I didn’t have much of an answer to that, no. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.7">I wasn’t sure if this was the best thing for ’em, but hey, have fun! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.8">Break a leg!</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">Their strength was at around a rank C for now, but I had a feeling that, over time, they’d become the strongest unit in our forces. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.2">With that expectation, I decided to name them Team Reborn. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.3">They all had a whole new life ahead of them, after all.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">That rounded out the briefing.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">It felt like the effects of my evolution dovetailed well with everybody’s personal efforts to bear some major fruit for us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">My first impression was </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">Wow, we’re more damaging than ever</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.2">The total force was under ten thousand, but we could whip pretty much any army out there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.3">Their numbers weren’t as strong as the Farmus military I wiped out, but in terms of war power, we would’ve totally overwhelmed them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">All this stuff came as a total surprise to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">Being outnumbered is still a weakness, but we’d just have to gradually build that up, between strengthening our country and negotiating with others. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.3">I think a standing force of around ten thousand would be the number to shoot for.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">Plus, we still had our reserve forces protecting the Forest of Jura. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.2">They weren’t part of this campaign—the difference in training was just too much—but if we could work ’em up, they’d serve us well enough in battle, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.3">That’s something to tackle in the future.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">She bowed deeply at me, followed by Sufia and the rest of the beastmen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">It felt almost oppressive, but I didn’t react. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.3">That was how they wanted to show their appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">“You really saved us,” a smiling Sufia told me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">“Now we can smash up Clayman’s forces without a second thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.3">We’ll let you have him, Sir Rimuru, so take out all our anger on him for me!”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">Pretty scary face, considering that smile.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1"> Alvis was similarly glaring at me, in apparent agreement. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.2">Everything was set for them; now all they had to do was go wild on the battlefield. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.3">We’d enjoy a force of twenty thousand beastmen alone, so I’m not sure we needed the reinforcements, but the more the merrier. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.4">If it was just them, we’d still be outnumbered anyway.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">With these extra fighters, we now had a unified force of thirty thousand to go against Clayman’s own thirty thousand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.2">We were even now, and we were the better-quality army. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.3">Victory was as good as ours. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.4">The only problem…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">“Benimaru, any issues with our operation?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">While I was rounding up beastmen last night, I had Benimaru and his team shake down our plan of action once more. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.2">The gist of it hadn’t changed, but since we weren’t spreading out our forces to collect the refugees any longer, a few details needed to be changed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">“We’re all set, sir.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.2">He shot me a crafty smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.3">“If Clayman is targeting the citizens of the Beast Kingdom, then retreat is certainly an effective option as well.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">Yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.2">I agreed with him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.3">No need to smash right against his front line and get people killed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">“I discussed it with Sir Benimaru as well,” Alvis said, excitedly playing with the staff in her hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">“We’ve got enough leeway now to move the site of battle, so it’ll be a little while before we begin…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">All systems go, then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.2">Failing to complete his mission before Walpurgis would make for one angry Clayman, no doubt. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.3">At the very least, he’d treat his underlings even worse than usual. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.4">If their army’s commander fears that and starts freaking out, the ball’s on our side.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">“…We will deploy the force at the entrance to the Forest of Jura. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.2">The wasteland that was once our home, the now-toppled orcish kingdom of Orbic—now, it shall be their grave.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">There was something close to sheer malice in Geld’s voice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">Clayman’s scheming cost him his home nation, and now it would be the site of the decisive battle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.3">I suppose anyone would’ve felt the hand of fate at play here.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">The strategy, as it was, is pretty simple. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">We’d make it look like we had the refugees evacuate into the Forest of Jura, then strike at the enemy forces trying to pursue them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.3">That’s about it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">Raphael provided the perfect simulation of it in my brain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.2">Obtaining and replaying the information Soei and his gang gave me, I had a picture of the future that was almost as vivid as reality. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.3">I then Thought Communication’ed that to everyone else, so we could all equally grasp it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">Our original plan called for us to keep the refugees secure as we lured the enemy over, eventually surrounding and destroying the force. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.2">With this change, the faster units would serve as bait instead. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.3">That reduced the danger to the individual forces involved, which greatly boosted the chances of this working.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">The key to this was making sure they were all inside the forest before crushing them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">I didn’t intend to kill them all, but I didn’t like the idea of them running away and attacking again later. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.3">We had to be thorough.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">I let Rigurd guide them around, since that work I started yesterday was still calling my name. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.2">I really wanted to finish it up in time for Walpurgis, so I just had to hope no more issues arose.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">We had reached our destination—a dryas, the holy tree that was Treyni’s “main” body.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">I took out my completed project from my Stomach. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.2">It was an orb, dull in color. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.3">No sheen, no glow to it—but you could absolutely feel the power.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1">What was I going to use it for? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.2">Well, Treyni—and all dryads—were descendants of fairies, a form of spiritual life that could take on physical form by combining themselves with plants. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.3">They could freely release their spiritual bodies and use magicules to create temporary corpuses to live in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.4">Their “real” bodies, however, were these dryas trees.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1">The Walpurgis Council was going to be held in some kind of special dimension, so Treyni might not be able to get in. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.2">So I decided to conduct a bit of large-scale surgery on her so she’d be able to move around in her “real” body. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.3">Unlike Beretta, which had no physical form in this world, Treyni had a corpus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.4">As a result, we needed to transfer the “core” within her from her current body to the new one, much like a golem becoming established in its own form.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">I had an idea of what this new core could be. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.2">It was a chaos core, one that can only be made with certain materials under certain conditions, and that orb I just took out would be the vessel for this core. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.3">In a way, it was like extracting magicules from the magic stones that can be taken from the cores of monsters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.4">It’s hard to make these retain no element at all, so I went through many failures before I created this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.5">I also needed several other materials to make this orb, so I spent nearly all of yesterday gathering them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">Making a chaos core required an equal mixture of spiritual and mystical force inside this vessel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.2">With Beretta I could’ve just filled them with both in equal quantities and densities, but it wasn’t so simple with Treyni. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.3">She would have to inject the orb with her own spiritual energy herself, while I put in mystical force that had been mixed to an exactly proportionate density and size.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">Now it was time to get to work, and that meant it was time for Raphael to shine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.2">With my signal, Treyni began to turn her body into spiritual matter and let it flow into the orb, without a moment’s hesitation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.3">I injected the mystical force alongside her, not missing a beat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.4">This was precision work, but it proceeded with no calculation errors.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">The dryas lost its life force, visibly withering before me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">Alongside that, the orb began to blink on and off, almost like a pulse. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.3">Light and darkness traced a spiral inside it—and then, the orb began to shine a light shade of green. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.4">The flickering of life was thriving inside.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">Report. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.2">The individual Treyni’s element has mixed into it, but construction of the chaos core is successful.</span></span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">Treyni would no longer be separate from her main body, so she wouldn’t have issues traveling across dimensions anymore. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.2">But something still seemed missing.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">“Treyni, do you mind if I take this tree that used to be your body?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">“Of course not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.2">Use it however you like.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">I thanked her, then got straight to work.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">I cut down the tree, working the wood, creating precision parts with it to form a human shape.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">Ramiris quickly understood what I was up to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.2">She was right—I thought I would make a replacement body for Treyni, using the dryas that was imbued with her magical force.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">Three hours later, the doll-like figure I had been working on all afternoon was complete. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.2">Its core was reinforced with magisteel, the surface made of fully polished wood. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.3">It felt remarkably comfortable to the touch—a very fine piece of work.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">“Oh, is this…?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">Even Treyni, who rarely expressed surprise at anything, couldn’t hide her excitement.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">I didn’t need to ask. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.2">Ramiris was overjoyed, but Treyni needed no encouragement from her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.3">She thanked me profusely and installed herself in her new body. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.4">From that moment, the wooden doll became Treyni’s new corpus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.5">It was the world’s first fully mobile dryad.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">From the moment the chaos core—the heart of any monster, you could say—entered the doll, magic force surged out of it, penetrating and filling every grain on the surface. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">Then, amazingly, the white grains faded, no longer standing out, turning as intricate and detailed as human skin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.3">Perhaps more beautiful, even. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.4">A beauty that goes beyond humanity.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">Unlike with Beretta, I didn’t work from a skeletal frame for the face. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.2">I simply carved the head to look the way Treyni looked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.3">But once her orb was in there, its expression grew as soft as anyone you met on the street. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.4">It was wood, but the mouth still moved, and the eyes blinked. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.5">I have no idea what was driving that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.6">“Because she’s a monster” was my only real guess. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.7">This body </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">was</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1"> kind of herself, once, so maybe it was more compatible than most cases.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">Either way, that pie-in-the-sky surgery of mine was a greater success than I ever could’ve guessed.</span></p>
