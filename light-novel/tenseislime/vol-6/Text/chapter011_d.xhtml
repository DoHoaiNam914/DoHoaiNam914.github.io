<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Right now, all I could do was chip away at her like this as I waited for her curse to be undone. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Let’s hope that Shion can finish off Clayman sooner rather than later.</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">I couldn’t say how many back-and-forth exchanges we went through.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">I say </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">exchanges</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">, but it was entirely me defending. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">The rules were intense—one mistake, and you’re out—but I was still fending her off.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">A roaring fist from Milim surged past my right cheek. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">If I didn’t focus, I’d never be able to dodge it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">A single hit would shatter my body, no doubt. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4">I had Infinite Regeneration, a healing skill more powerful than even its Ultraspeed cousin, but abusing it would drain my magicules too quickly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.5">I could probably regenerate myself after being reduced to goo, but keep that up long enough, and I’d run out of stamina first.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">So focus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">Focus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">Read ahead of Milim’s moves.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Her right fist had changed in shape. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">A dragon-fang lash disguised as a punch. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.3">It’d glance past my cheek once again, then decapitate me with the nails on her fingers, like the teeth of a dragon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.4">The correct way to deal with it was not to dodge but to take it from the side.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">So I took it, pushing myself with my left hand from the inside out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">I could feel a burning pain sear through that hand, an explosion of energy that left it heavily damaged. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">And that was me </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">avoiding</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1"> the attack. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">Trying to take a full-frontal blow from her would’ve been crazy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.3">Absolute power, on this level, was a kind of finisher in itself, crushing its opponent. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.4">I had just learned that the hard way, but if I didn’t sacrifice my left hand, I would’ve been mortally wounded. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.5">I was fine with that, but I was really starting to resent the sheer unfairness of this.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Then, as if reading my mind, I had an unexpected chance. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">Right there, as Milim lost her balance, she forced her remaining left hand to snap off a punch.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">Here we go!</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">Report. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">It is believed to be a trap—</span></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Huh?!</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1"> I thought, but it was too late.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">Leaving Raphael’s composed guidance in the dust, I began my attack, grabbing Milim’s left hand and attempting to throw her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">If she was off-balance, I thought I should be able to pick her up on my back and slam her down.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">But if that was Milim’s trap…?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">Her hand stopped dead in the air, a carefree grin on her face—a total “gotcha now!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">smile.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">Oh, craaaaaaaaap?!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">I was attempting to twist my body in front of Milim, both hands reaching out for her left arm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">I could see all of that with Detect Magic as if watching it on TV, but it left me totally open. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">Cornered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.4">Game over.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">Her fist moved again—and just before she smashed it right against my head, something cut in between us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">A dull </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">thud</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1"> rang out.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">I was greeted by a dark-skinned man with blond hair. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">Looked a little bit like me, actually… </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">Wait, Veldora?!</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">He was curled up on the floor, grabbing at his head and looking like he was in at least some pain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">But if taking a punch from Milim only did that to him, I didn’t see much need to worry. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">I took the moment’s delay to rebalance and steel myself toward Milim.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">“Nothing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">That man, Diablo or whatever it was, came back, so our defense is as strong as ever.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Huhhh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">Diablo was back? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">There’s no way they could’ve captured Farmus that quickly…but let’s focus on Veldora for now.</span></em></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">He looked at me, positively indignant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">“What do you </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">mean</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">, what about this? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">The story in here’s completely different from the rest of the series! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">Were you playing some kind of trick, taking the ending away from me?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">So he traveled all the way here just because he wanted to read the ending? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">In this enclosed space in an alternate dimension? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">I knew I could summon Unlimited Imprisonment with my ultimate skill Veldora, Lord of the Storm, but I guess </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">he</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1"> could, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">That’ll learn me, I guess.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">I didn’t know whether it was the manga or Milim that captured his interest the most, but either way, he agreed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">The “my brother’s only daughter” bit captured </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">my</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1"> interest, but again, everything in due time.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">Milim herself was looking our way, steeled for anything, and Veldora seemed to be capturing her interest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">I could see it in the twinkle in her eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.3">Hopefully that meant I was safe leaving for now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.4">Which one was stronger anyway? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.5">I was kind of interested to see, but if Veldora was stronger than me, I was sure he could buy me enough time.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">There’s just no way I can’t take advantage of this chance—so with my newfound freedom, I wanted to defeat Clayman and settle the score for good.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">The demon lord unleashed five puppets, each transforming into a magic-born that lunged at Shion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">Each one was high in level, formed from a soul Clayman had put in a doll for deployment at any time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.3">It was part of his hidden arsenal, I suppose—now was no time for him to hold back, no doubt, so he was busting out everything he had.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">This was more than enough firepower to take out your average magic-born. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">But with that massive sword she loved so much, she mowed down all five with a single swipe.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">Sounds like Clayman had misread her.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">The ominous strings of black light that streamed from both his hands wrapped themselves completely around Shion’s body. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.2">She didn’t move. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.3">Kinda wish she tried to dodge it or, you know, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">something</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">, but I guess she didn’t need to.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">Clayman, assuming Shion didn’t react in time, found this much to his liking. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">“Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh… Behold, the ultimate cursing magic, with the power to rule over demon lords themselves! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.3">It seems a waste to squander it on magic-born like you, but so be it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.4">I have some slots to fill in my five fingers, and you would be wonderful to take under my wing.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">Complete Memory, one of Shion’s skills, was the power to record memories into her astral body. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.2">In layman’s terms, it let her retain her memories even if her brain was destroyed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.3">Combine a conscious soul with a set of memories, and you could regenerate the physical body even if it was vaporized. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.4">This made Shion into a special sort of race—call her a demi-spiritual life-form if you want—but essentially, it allowed her to think with her soul, and that meant any effect that tried to take over her spirit was neutralized. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.5">Against Shion, no mind-takeover curses could ever work.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">“Hey,” an annoyed-sounding Shion called out from within her cocoon of black string, “what are you trying to do with this? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">It’s not hurting me at all, but should I wait a little longer?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">You know—and this has been something I’ve been thinking for a while now, but—I really wish she’d stop acting like this was a pro-wrestling bout. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.2">This was supposed to be a duel to the death. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.3">Why was she deliberately letting herself get hit by her enemy’s moves? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.4">Shion, Sufia…and Milim, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.5">I just didn’t understand how these war-loving freaks thought sometimes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.6">Gimme a break.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">Raphael confirmed to me that Shion wasn’t being affected at all, though. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.2">There wasn’t any need to even beware of Clayman’s secret techniques.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">“That—that’s ridiculous… My Demon Marionette doesn’t work? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">It has to! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.3">This cannot even be possible! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.4">It’s the ultimate in demon domination! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.5">It can exact its rule over demon lords!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">It had ruled over Nine-Head a moment ago. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">Certainly, you could take over the mind of a calamity-level monster with it easily enough. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.3">But would it work on the disaster-class demon lords? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.4">I think Clayman overestimated his own strength.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">Apparently sick of waiting any longer, Shion used his aura to rip her cocoon apart. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.2">“So ridiculous,” she scornfully muttered. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.3">“Relying on such cheap tricks as this… You don’t deserve your title at all.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">Clayman just stood there, finally succumbing to the panic.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">…Or not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">What Shion said must’ve flipped a switch somewhere inside of him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">“Heh-heh-heh… Ha-ha-ha-ha-haaaaaaa!! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.2">I don’t deserve my title? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.3">You’ll regret saying that, you maggot! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.4">Yes, you’ll regret extracting my full strength from me!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">His shoulders were shaking as he shrieked with laughter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.2">Off went his fancy-looking suit jacket and shirt, leaving him topless. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.3">It also left assorted other items he had hidden on his body to clank against the floor, no longer of use to him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.4">I had thought this was over, but Clayman still had something left to rely on.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">Suddenly, two pairs of arms grew out from his uncovered back—long, thin, and protected by a black exoskeleton. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.2">This was his true character. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.3">Not the dolled-up form from before, but this form that evoked wild, crazed insanity.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">“But yes… Yes, you’re right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.2">A demon lord… I am a demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.3">I focused on ease and elegance in the way I go about matters, dispatching my foes with style. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.4">But enough of that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.5">It doesn’t matter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.6">I had forgotten about how this feels, for so long…and now I’m going to crush you in my hands!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">The true nature of his rage came to the surface. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.2">All he had on him was something he kept preciously protected in his hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.3">A mask. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.4">A jester’s mask, decorated with a smile. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.5">Without a moment’s pause, he put it on.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">“Hoh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.2">Looks like you’ve grown worthier,” a happy-sounding Shion said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.3">“I’m glad to see that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.4">I am Shion, secretary and personal guard to the demon lord Rimuru, and I will be happy to fight you!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">The introductions were made. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">The two moved at the same moment.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">Clayman, in his “real” form, was a powerhouse, laying out the full extent of his demon lord–worthy magical force against Shion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.2">His normal arms wielded those ominous black beams of light. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.3">The upper arms from his back wielded an ax and a hammer; the lower ones, a sword and shield.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">Dealing with both magical and melee attacks at once baffled Shion for a moment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.2">But she was stronger. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.3">Swinging the sword she called Goriki-maru Version 2, she clanged the sword out of his hand and crushed his shield. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.4">A simple, tactless roundhouse slash from above smashed through the ax and hammer Clayman crossed in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">That freakish force came courtesy of Shion’s intrinsic skill Ogre Berserker, and her frenzy of weapon breaking was the work of Guarantee Results and Optimal Action, both part of her Master Chef unique skill. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.2">In other words, Clayman was still no match for her. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.3">Even with all his might, she was just pummeling him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">Now he was crossing his two pairs of steellike arms to block Shion’s fists—but they, too, were smashed to ribbons. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.2">Her next punch landed squarely in the pit of his stomach.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">Not that it’s for me to say, but Shion really had gotten overwhelmingly stronger. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.2">Dying and getting resurrected like that gave her power on a scale like nothing she ever had before.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">“Gerrhhaaahh?!!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">She planted a follow-up kick on him, making him roll around on the ground in agony. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.2">The mask was cracked now, revealing bloodshot eyes.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">Now Clayman understood the difference in power. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.2">But he still refused to accept this reality. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.3">It was devastating to him.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">Clayman was screaming out the words now, realizing that his death was near. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.2">But Veldora was holding Milim back. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.3">Clayman looked at him with disbelief.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">He must’ve just realized that Veldora wasn’t just another magic-born.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">This silenced Clayman. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.2">I’m sure he wanted to deny it, but seeing him spar evenly with Milim forced him to admit it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.3">The two had been fighting for a while now, and it was turning into quite the fireworks show. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.4">Skill names flew back and forth, many of which I think I remembered hearing before, and Milim had an honest look of surprise on her face.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">Thus, Clayman gave up on having Milim to rely on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.2">Even in his panicked confusion, he managed to flee to the edge of our isolated battle zone, shouting at the audience outside.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">He resentfully groaned at this heartless reply, then turned back toward Milim, his eyes twitching and revealing the insanity inside. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.2">He must’ve gotten another wild idea in his mind. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.3">A crazed laugh crossed his lips as he looked at her once more.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">Surprised, I turned around—only to find Milim chilling out there, a wide grin on her face.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">“So Clayman </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">didn’t</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1"> seize your mind?”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">The most surprised of all, of course, was Clayman.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">Before I could get an answer, another voice butted in.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">After thanking me, Carillon gave Clayman a knowing grin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.2">Now it was obvious that Milim was under no one’s control.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">Finally getting the whole picture, Clayman gave Frey a half-crazed glare. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.2">She responded by pretending he wasn’t there.</span></p>
