<p class="cotx">It turned out to be unusually easy for Clayman to convene a Walpurgis Council.</p>
<p>The use of Carillon’s “betrayal” as the topic was important to him. The way it was explained to the demon lords was basically that Carillon violated their nonaggression agreement by invading the Forest of Jura, and Milim punished him for it. That was clearly a screen, but none of the other demon lords protested. It would all be coming out during the Council—but by then, it’d be over. That was Clayman’s aim. Walpurgis would earn him valuable time toward awakening himself, becoming a true demon lord, and obtaining immense powers. And Milim would be there, too. If she acted subservient to him in front of the other demon lords, that’d just prove to them all that Clayman was not willing to accept any back talk.</p>
<p>That was his plan, and to make it reality, he needed his military operation to succeed. It had to wrap up quickly, before the other demon lords could interfere. He also had the perfect excuse—to punish Carillon for violating that treaty, just like how the Council was convened. He just had to produce the evidence he needed to prove it.</p>
<p class="space-break">With everything in place, Clayman immediately took action. Passing through the demon lord Milim’s domain, his forces pressed on into the Beast Kingdom of Eurazania. Yamza, a man faithful to Clayman from his very heart, was chosen to be their leader. He was the only one who knew his master’s true aims—to drive his army of thirty thousand into Eurazania and claim the over ten thousand souls inside before the Council began.</p>

<p class="tx1">“These people drive me up the wall! How dare they propose that we work together?!”</p>
<p>The man yelling angrily was Middray, head priest of the temple built for the Dragon Faithful in their domain’s largest city. This made him leader of those who worshiped Milim as a goddess.</p>
<p>“But, Father Middray, failing to follow this order would put us in serious trouble. Yamza, their commander… He bore an imperial edict from Lady Milim herself, did he not?”</p>
<p>The simpering associate pleading his case before Middray was Hermes, a member of the priests who served this temple. He had a transcendental air about him, which most people mistook as him being spaced out and insincere. It grated on Middray’s nerves.</p>
<p>“Silence, Hermes. I don’t need you telling me that! I <em>know</em> it!”</p>
<p>Hermes couldn’t help but roll his eyes at the enraged head priest, even though he understood too well what irked him. It was those magic-born who had been camped out since yesterday. They had come here, to the City of the Forgotten Dragon, without warning and promptly occupied it like it was theirs all along. Apparently, they were a force from the demon lord Clayman, heading for the demon lord Carillon’s domain to investigate an agreement he had broken.</p>
<p>Refusing them simply wasn’t an option. Middray could rant and rave all he wanted; it wouldn’t have changed a thing. There was a pretty good reason for this—the demon lord who toppled Carillon’s Beast Kingdom of Eurazania was none other than Milim, the object of Hermes’s and his fellow priests’ worship. If their supreme being was involved, it was only natural for Clayman’s forces to ask them for help in collecting evidence against Carillon. In fact, if they <em>didn’t</em> find anything, that would put Milim in an embarrassing position. Milim herself wouldn’t care, but Hermes and the others would.</p>
<p>“Ah, Lady Milim can be such a handful sometimes…”</p>
<p>Her selfishness could be forgiven, Hermes reasoned, but just a little—really, a <em>tiny</em> amount would be fine—he wished that she gave them a moment’s worth of consideration.</p>
<p>“How <em>dare</em> you, Hermes! You will <em>never</em> cast doubt upon Lady Milim’s actions!”</p>
<p>“No, I know that, but…”</p>
<p><em>But it’s getting harder and harder for us because we’re always spoiling her.</em> He didn’t say it. It’d just spark another wave of anger from Middray. <em>This is quite a handful</em>, he thought, sighing.</p>
<p>He recalled how things had spiraled downward since yesterday. The army had requested permission to pass through in advance, and even then, their high-pressure tactics rubbed the priests the wrong way. This force clearly looked down upon the Dragon Faithful; it was obvious that their requests for “support” weren’t really requests at all. They were orders, through and through.</p>
<p class="space-break">The Dragon Faithful that resided here, in the City of the Forgotten Dragon, numbered less than a hundred thousand in total. They all worked together in their daily lives, there being no central government to speak of. As a result, none were particularly gifted in battle—they relied on Milim’s protection to keep the peace.</p>
<p>That, at least, was how it appeared to outside observers. But this was only half right.</p>
<p>Yes, there was no government. All the crops and other goods produced were collected at the Central Temple, where it was distributed equally by the head priest. It might seem like this system would fail, encouraging people to grow unproductive and lazy, but that wasn’t the case. Everyone, workers and nonworkers, was guaranteed at least a certain amount of the wealth—and the more hardworking would also be provided with additional supplies.</p>
<p>This was similar to the “universal basic income” idea that had gained traction around modern Japan. The main issue was who got to decide how much of a contribution each individual made to society…and that was Middray’s job, granted exclusively to him by Milim.</p>
<p>That right afforded Middray all but absolute power in this city, but he never abused that power. Why? Simple: Because the other priests who served him had the right to dismiss him from office. If he got too selfish with his decisions, he’d lose his post. That understanding was what kept Middray from becoming a tyrant. (Of course, they already <em>had</em> a tyrant on hand in Milim, and nobody was stupid enough to try to imitate her game, but still.)</p>
<p>Thus, these tens of thousands of people were far better led and organized than one would expect at first. While some may think the city was lacking in military strength, that was completely untrue. The Dragon Faithful, thanks to certain local conditions, all had very strong physical skills. In addition to their organizational acumen, each adult was strong enough to almost reach C rank. Their pacifism didn’t make it clear at first, but this was actually quite a formidable group of warriors.</p>
<p>The priests, in particular, were in a class of their own. There were only a hundred or so of these guys, handpicked from the best the region had to offer, and they could definitely mess you up. Their daily “prayer sessions” to Milim (i.e. battle training) gave them superior combat skills, and once you got up to the level of Middray or Hermes, they were even strong enough to give Milim a run for her money. That’s why Middray was so enraged that Clayman’s forces were treating them like dirt.</p>
<p>And that wasn’t this people’s only secret. The second one was the clincher.</p>
<p class="space-break">Another day passed. Clayman’s army was now freely raiding the city’s storehouses for food supplies. The veins throbbed on Middray’s forehead as he was asked to remain patient with them.</p>
<p>“But why has Lady Milim not returned?” he asked, trying to adjust the target of his rage.</p>
<p>“Well, who knows?” Hermes distractedly replied. They had gone through this back-and-forth a dozen times or so, and it was getting on his nerves more and more.</p>
