<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter003"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">THE EVE OF BATTLE</span></a></h1>
<p class="cotx"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">It turned out to be unusually easy for Clayman to convene a Walpurgis Council.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">The use of Carillon’s “betrayal” as the topic was important to him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">The way it was explained to the demon lords was basically that Carillon violated their nonaggression agreement by invading the Forest of Jura, and Milim punished him for it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">That was clearly a screen, but none of the other demon lords protested. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.4">It would all be coming out during the Council—but by then, it’d be over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.5">That was Clayman’s aim. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.6">Walpurgis would earn him valuable time toward awakening himself, becoming a true demon lord, and obtaining immense powers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.7">And Milim would be there, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.8">If she acted subservient to him in front of the other demon lords, that’d just prove to them all that Clayman was not willing to accept any back talk.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">That was his plan, and to make it reality, he needed his military operation to succeed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">It had to wrap up quickly, before the other demon lords could interfere. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">He also had the perfect excuse—to punish Carillon for violating that treaty, just like how the Council was convened. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">He just had to produce the evidence he needed to prove it.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">With everything in place, Clayman immediately took action. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">Passing through the demon lord Milim’s domain, his forces pressed on into the Beast Kingdom of Eurazania. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">Yamza, a man faithful to Clayman from his very heart, was chosen to be their leader. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">He was the only one who knew his master’s true aims—to drive his army of thirty thousand into Eurazania and claim the over ten thousand souls inside before the Council began.</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">“These people drive me up the wall! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">How dare they propose that we work together?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">The man yelling angrily was Middray, head priest of the temple built for the Dragon Faithful in their domain’s largest city. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">This made him leader of those who worshiped Milim as a goddess.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">“But, Father Middray, failing to follow this order would put us in serious trouble. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">Yamza, their commander… He bore an imperial edict from Lady Milim herself, did he not?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">The simpering associate pleading his case before Middray was Hermes, a member of the priests who served this temple. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">He had a transcendental air about him, which most people mistook as him being spaced out and insincere. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">It grated on Middray’s nerves.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">“Silence, Hermes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">I don’t need you telling me that! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.3">I </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">know</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1"> it!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">Hermes couldn’t help but roll his eyes at the enraged head priest, even though he understood too well what irked him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">It was those magic-born who had been camped out since yesterday. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">They had come here, to the City of the Forgotten Dragon, without warning and promptly occupied it like it was theirs all along. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.4">Apparently, they were a force from the demon lord Clayman, heading for the demon lord Carillon’s domain to investigate an agreement he had broken.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">Refusing them simply wasn’t an option. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">Middray could rant and rave all he wanted; it wouldn’t have changed a thing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">There was a pretty good reason for this—the demon lord who toppled Carillon’s Beast Kingdom of Eurazania was none other than Milim, the object of Hermes’s and his fellow priests’ worship. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.4">If their supreme being was involved, it was only natural for Clayman’s forces to ask them for help in collecting evidence against Carillon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.5">In fact, if they </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">didn’t</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1"> find anything, that would put Milim in an embarrassing position. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">Milim herself wouldn’t care, but Hermes and the others would.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“Ah, Lady Milim can be such a handful sometimes…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Her selfishness could be forgiven, Hermes reasoned, but just a little—really, a </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">tiny</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1"> amount would be fine—he wished that she gave them a moment’s worth of consideration.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">“How </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">dare</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1"> you, Hermes! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">You will </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">never</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1"> cast doubt upon Lady Milim’s actions!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">“No, I know that, but…”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">But it’s getting harder and harder for us because we’re always spoiling her.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1"> He didn’t say it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">It’d just spark another wave of anger from Middray. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">This is quite a handful</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">, he thought, sighing.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">He recalled how things had spiraled downward since yesterday. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">The army had requested permission to pass through in advance, and even then, their high-pressure tactics rubbed the priests the wrong way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">This force clearly looked down upon the Dragon Faithful; it was obvious that their requests for “support” weren’t really requests at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.4">They were orders, through and through.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">The Dragon Faithful that resided here, in the City of the Forgotten Dragon, numbered less than a hundred thousand in total. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">They all worked together in their daily lives, there being no central government to speak of. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">As a result, none were particularly gifted in battle—they relied on Milim’s protection to keep the peace.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">That, at least, was how it appeared to outside observers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">But this was only half right.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">Yes, there was no government. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">All the crops and other goods produced were collected at the Central Temple, where it was distributed equally by the head priest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">It might seem like this system would fail, encouraging people to grow unproductive and lazy, but that wasn’t the case. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.4">Everyone, workers and nonworkers, was guaranteed at least a certain amount of the wealth—and the more hardworking would also be provided with additional supplies.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">This was similar to the “universal basic income” idea that had gained traction around modern Japan. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">The main issue was who got to decide how much of a contribution each individual made to society…and that was Middray’s job, granted exclusively to him by Milim.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">That right afforded Middray all but absolute power in this city, but he never abused that power. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Why? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">Simple: Because the other priests who served him had the right to dismiss him from office. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.4">If he got too selfish with his decisions, he’d lose his post. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.5">That understanding was what kept Middray from becoming a tyrant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.6">(Of course, they already </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">had</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1"> a tyrant on hand in Milim, and nobody was stupid enough to try to imitate her game, but still.)</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Thus, these tens of thousands of people were far better led and organized than one would expect at first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">While some may think the city was lacking in military strength, that was completely untrue. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">The Dragon Faithful, thanks to certain local conditions, all had very strong physical skills. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.4">In addition to their organizational acumen, each adult was strong enough to almost reach C rank. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.5">Their pacifism didn’t make it clear at first, but this was actually quite a formidable group of warriors.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">The priests, in particular, were in a class of their own. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">There were only a hundred or so of these guys, handpicked from the best the region had to offer, and they could definitely mess you up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">Their daily “prayer sessions” to Milim (i.e. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.4">battle training) gave them superior combat skills, and once you got up to the level of Middray or Hermes, they were even strong enough to give Milim a run for her money. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.5">That’s why Middray was so enraged that Clayman’s forces were treating them like dirt.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">And that wasn’t this people’s only secret. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">The second one was the clincher.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">Another day passed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">Clayman’s army was now freely raiding the city’s storehouses for food supplies. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">The veins throbbed on Middray’s forehead as he was asked to remain patient with them.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“But why has Lady Milim not returned?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">he asked, trying to adjust the target of his rage.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“Well, who knows?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">Hermes distractedly replied. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">They had gone through this back-and-forth a dozen times or so, and it was getting on his nerves more and more.</span></p>
