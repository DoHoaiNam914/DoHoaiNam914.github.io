<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">The boy nodded his agreement, unable to hide his surprise at this unexpected development.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">“Whoever he is,” commented Kazalim, “he is dangerous. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">A man capable of defeating Laplace, to the best of my knowledge, would have to be far more than </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">merely</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1"> magic-born.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">“Yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">I’m with ya there.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">“What do you mean?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">the boy asked.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">“Well, not to brag, but I’m not exactly a wimp, y’know? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">Even with the dryad I faced down before, if I seriously duked it out, I woulda won, y’know? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">I just fled ’cause I was on their home turf in the forest, and I didn’t want ’em callin’ for reinforcements on me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.4">No real point going all out to try to kill ’er, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.5">But </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1"> foe was on another level, I tell you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">It didn’t feel like some sub-demon lord to me—it felt like a </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">full</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1"> one, through ’n’ through. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">Someone like me, all I could do was run.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">Dryads were extremely powerful foes in forest lands, intrinsically capable of instant teleportation through the trees. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">The Plant Whisper skill let them “share” any and all information with others of their species, sending friends over to help their brethren anytime it was needed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.3">This made them enough of a threat that Laplace opted to run away the last time he saw one, even though he could likely conquer one in a duel.</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">This</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1"> guy, however, was different. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">“That was a monster,” Laplace declared. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.3">“Stronger than me, no doubt about it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">The atmosphere in the room grew heavy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“A demon lord, huh…? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">What do you think, Kazalim?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Kazalim snorted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">“I told you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">He is dangerous. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.4">As far as I am aware, only one man could match that description.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">“Oh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">Who’s that?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">“…The demon lord Valentine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">One of the old guard, a man on par with myself during my glory years.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">“For real? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.2">’Cause if he’s a match for </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">you</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">, I see I was totally right to flee. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">Lucky thing I trusted my instincts.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Laplace shrugged. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">He had taken pains to break in when Hinata was away, only to stumble right up to a demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">The irony of it made him wince.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">“…Hmm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">A demon lord within the Church, huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">D’you think this Valentine’s actually the Holy Emperor, then?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">“Ooh, I dunno about that! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">You think a demon lord would raise a finger to protect humanity? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">President, what kind of guy was Valentine when you knew ’im?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Kazalim closed her eyes and searched through her memories, tapping a graceful finger against her forehead as she recalled the vivid images of the past.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">“This body may not show it,” she said, “but I’ve lived through three of the Great Wars that occur every five hundred years. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Three of them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">You can call </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">me</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1"> one of the old guard as well, but by the time I joined that club, there were already six demon lords ahead of me…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">As she put it, the demon lord Valentine had attained the title before Kazalim herself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">His force was massive, more than worthy of the term </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">vampire</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1"> and the connotations of immortality weaved into it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">To Kazalim, who had evolved from an elf (similarly known for longevity) to a walking dead, the thought of a vampire, the symbol of eternal life, also serving as a demon lord gave her pause.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">“…To tell you the truth, Valentine and I have dueled to the death a few different times. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">It never reached a definitive conclusion, though. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">Once you reach our level, you can lay waste to an entire landscape without hurting yourselves at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.4">So instead, we adopted the tradition of talking over things and deciding by majority vote…and that led to the Walpurgis system. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.5">The fact that it takes three votes to convene one is a throwback to when there were still only seven demon lords in existence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.6">Guess nobody cared enough to change it.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">She let out an elegant, ladylike chuckle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">The juxtaposition between this and her other, masculine mannerisms was starting to unnerve the other two people in the room, not that she noticed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">Then her face turned stony once more.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">“And that’s why I feel safe in telling you this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">That man, Valentine; he sees humans and demi-humans as nothing more than chattel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">Even if the entire world was turned on its end, the idea of him serving as guardian is simply impossible.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">Laplace nodded his agreement as the boy thought over Kazalim’s assessment.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">So maybe they forced some kind of agreement?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">“Are you listening to me, Laplace? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Promises and agreements only work between two parties with equal force behind them.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“Yeah…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">He didn’t seem too married to the idea himself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“Plus,” the boy said, “I find it hard to believe that someone as closed-minded as Hinata would team up with a demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">I wonder if what Laplace ran into wasn’t a demon lord at all, but some magic-born whose name we are not aware of yet?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">“No,” Kazalim replied, “I do think that was Valentine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">Those dancing beams of crimson light? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">That’s the giveaway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.4">Valentine also goes by the name of Bloody Lord, and he can take blood and vaporize it into beams of magicules known as Bloodrays.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">As she put it, a Bloodray was a type of spread-fire particle cannon. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">By converting his own blood into magical particles, he was capable of firing it off in concentrated rays of force. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">The amount of magical power that process required meant it had to be a demon lord working it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">“So you’re saying that Laplace ran into the demon lord Valentine, and that Valentine would never willingly cooperate with human kingdoms. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">Wouldn’t that lend more credence to the theory that the Holy Emperor is Valentine?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">“Yeah,” muttered Laplace, “that would explain matters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">I’d sincerely wonder how he managed to pull the wool over Hinata’s eyes, though.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">“Well,” Kazalim stated, “I suppose it remains the most convincing explanation we have. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">I do have my doubts and concerns about that… But the important thing is, we now know for a fact that Valentine, a demon lord, was lurking inside a domain that only the Holy Emperor has access to.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“And you’re </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">sure</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1"> it’s him?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">the boy pressed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">“I’m fully convinced. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Laplace’s description matches my own memory, and from what I know about him, Valentine would never willfully serve under someone else…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">“Yeah, there ain’t that many magic-born who could whip me, I don’t think. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">But if I’m dealin’ with the likes of </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">this</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">, well, I dunno how much more reconnaissance I’m capable of here.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">“Well,” the boy said, apparently convinced, “this is still pretty useful intelligence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">Expertly done, Laplace.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">His face shined now, revealing traces of the joy he felt now that he had a tool powerful enough to potentially take down the Holy Church. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">There was a powerful demon lord among his enemy’s forces, but that didn’t seem to concern him at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">He was too busy thinking about what to do next with this intel to care. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.4">For him, formulating his next plan of action came as easily as figuring out the next epic prank to pull off on the kids next door.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">The boy scowled at Laplace’s apparently unwelcome question, pulling his dark, shiny hair back with one hand. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">“Well,” he complained, “</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1"> wound up being a total failure.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">“Failure?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">“Yeah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">Everything went fine up until we had Rimuru, that slime you mentioned, fight against Hinata. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.3">Then it all fell apart, pretty much…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">The boy briefed the others on how things unfolded. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">First, Clayman won over the demon lord Milim, thanks to the Orb of Domination the boy provided him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.3">Once he did, they needed to test her out, to see just how deep the orb had put Milim in their thrall.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">“So we tried to find a decent opponent to test her strength on. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">But instead of demon lords that we didn’t have much intel or even a location on, we picked Carillon, since he seemed to be the least intelligent out of them all.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">“Along the way,” Kazalim continued, “we thought we could have her destroy the capital of the Beast Kingdom of Eurazania. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">The city would’ve been packed with former enslaved humans, souls to harvest so I can become a true demon lord once more…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">He and the boy exchanged glances and sighed.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">“We figured those souls would energize Clayman, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">Two birds with one stone.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">“But then Milim went out of control and declared war on the guy…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">And thanks to that, Carillon and the other targets had a weeklong head start to prepare for the battle—more than enough time to evacuate the capital.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">“You know,” the boy reflected, “looking back at it, I guess it’s pretty hard to enthrall a demon lord with a magical item like that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">You have to apply all these conditions to it, or else it’ll get all messed up.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">“I hope you would trust me more than that. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">They don’t call me the Curse Lord for show, I’ll have you know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">That Orb of Domination was a perfectly crafted Artifact, one of my best pieces of work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.4">It was Clayman who ruined everything.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">“Ah, no point dredging that up any longer. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">Anyway, we couldn’t collect any souls in the Beast Kingdom, so we decided to check things out in Farmus next.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">“Farmus? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">That kingdom?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">“Right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">Thanks to that summoning ritual they invented, Farmus had a ton of otherworlders living there. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">I figured now was as good a time as any to pare down their forces a little. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.4">So I used a few back channels to give them intelligence on Tempest and whet the appetites of their greedy king and his advisers.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">“You wouldn’t believe how quickly they bit, either.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">That idea grew from Laplace’s previous report, back when their operation to make an orc lord into a malleable demon lord ran into setbacks. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">The idea was to whip Farmus up into enough of a frenzy to make them declare war on the Jura-Tempest Federation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.3">With all the high-level magic-born in their ranks, Tempest surely had what it took to take out at least a few of Farmus’s otherworlders before going down for the count.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">What’s more, Rimuru, lord of the monsters, was traveling abroad on his own business, and Clayman’s own minions had infiltrated Tempest lands. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">The boy had planned to use Rimuru as bait for Hinata; as far as he was concerned, this plan offered the best of both worlds.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">“But then, well, nothing went according to plan. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">I mean, that slime Rimuru actually fled Hinata with his life intact. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">You can’t let your guard down around him for a moment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.4">Kind of like you, Laplace.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">“Thanks for the compliment.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">“By my prediction,” Kazalim continued, “that still wouldn’t be have been enough to keep Farmus from winning the war. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">If the monsters’ lord joined the battle, that would be another matter, but honestly speaking, it didn’t matter who won. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.3">We’d just work with the victors. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.4">The purpose of the war was to generate dead people—more souls to harvest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.5">Then we could finally awaken our beloved Clayman to his true self. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.6">And then…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">And then it all fell apart. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">The entire Farmus force was wiped off the face of the earth by a single slime.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">The boy sighed in regret. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">He began to wonder whether conducting all these plans in parallel was coming back to bite him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.3">He had focused on efficiency, only to put too many things into action at once—and once one tactic came undone, it affected everything else. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">Maybe</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">, he thought, </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">I was too greedy myself.</span></em></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">Kazalim was right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">Even the most seasoned of wizards would have a hard time gathering twenty thousand souls and keeping them all under their control. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.3">Recklessly attempting that would cause the souls’ latent energies to unravel, quickly falling out of control. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.4">And even if it worked—</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">Laplace’s mere suggestion caused them both to laugh at him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">The concept was simply beyond comprehension.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">Not even Kazalim knew the exact conditions required for making a potential demon lord into a “true” demon lord, although she could at least guess that it required a tremendous number of souls. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">They were currently limited to having Clayman experiment to see what results they got. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.3">Clayman had tried to experiment on the orc lord, of course, and everybody in the room knew how </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1"> turned out. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">And given that knowledge, the idea of something like a </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">slime</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1"> appearing out of nowhere and becoming a “true” demon lord was beyond even Kazalim’s imagination.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">Laplace, of course, was absolutely correct, even if none of them knew it at the time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">He began to wonder what kind of odyssey Clayman had been on while he was running for dear life from Valentine.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">“So, ah, what’s Clayman up to right now?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">“Awaiting further orders,” said the boy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">“At this point, we can’t do anything bolder than what we’re doing now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.3">Luckily, Milim kept her end of the promise—she waited a week, and then she turned the Beast Kingdom into a field of ash. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.4">So we’re pulling back for now, to reconsider our strategy.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">“Oh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">So things haven’t been a total failure, then?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">“Underestimate me at your peril, Laplace. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">I may have lost most of my force, but trickery remains my core asset.”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">“And once that happens,” reflected Kazalim, “the Forest of Jura should provide a fine breakwater against the Eastern Empire.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">“Ah, I see, President. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">Negotiate with whichever side wins. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.3">Ain’t no need to destroy the monster nation at all, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">That, in a way, was the true worth of the demon lord Kazalim’s Schemer ability. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">No matter how things turned out, she had a knack for concocting plans where her side wound up on top. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.3">Recalling that, Laplace was relieved to see Kazalim was still herself after all.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">“Plus,” the boy continued, “with Milim defeating Carillon, we’ve proven that the Orb of Domination is an effective tool against this caliber of enemy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.2">That’s all the force we’ll need to show. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.3">Beyond that, all we need to do is see how the other demon lords fall into place.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">“Precisely. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">That’s why I ordered Clayman to refrain from taking further action. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.3">The Eastern Empire’s going to do something either way—and with that comes our opportunity to recover some souls for ourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">“Uh-huh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">And as long as the eyes of the Western Holy Church are on the monster nation, it’s more convenient for us to keep that federation around anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">Laplace could see the logic in this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.2">No need for panic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.3">Just keep your eyes on the Church and avoid conflict with any of the other forces.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">“So for now, at least, we’re targetin’ the Church?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">“That’s the plan.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">“Not that it’ll be easy,” cautioned Kazalim. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">“We have to consider the possibility of Hinata and Valentine working as a team. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.3">Needlessly prodding them would be dangerous.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">As she and the boy saw it, as long as the Western Nations were in their hands, the monster nation didn’t have to be considered an obstacle. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">Plus, considering the mistakes they made, they now thought it wiser to fully gauge the enemy forces, avoiding a dual-pronged operation for the time being. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.3">For now, they were gunning for the Western Holy Church—and the Holy Empire of Lubelius behind it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.4">Those two would be struck first—carefully this time, making sure none of their activities were noticed on the surface. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.5">In that scenario, the monster nation was actually helpful to them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.6">As long as they kept fanning the flames of Church doctrine, it’d be child’s play to keep the eyes of Hinata and her force squarely upon Tempest.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">“The Church can hardly afford to ignore the presence of the magic-born Rimuru, either. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.2">With Farmus thoroughly defeated, I doubt the other nations will be so willing to take on the mantle of waging holy war. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.3">They’ll need to perform some kind of action to reaffirm their authority.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">“Yeah.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">The boy grinned. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.3">“If we can parry them and keep both sides engaged, they might even destroy each other. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.4">All we have to do is wait for an opportunity to weaken the both of them.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">They were talking about a magic-born capable of single-handedly sweeping a force of twenty thousand into the afterlife. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.2">Without Hinata on the scene, taking him on was patently impossible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.3">So they would wait for the right moment and come up with the perfect scheme for it—and the way it sounded to Laplace, they already had a pretty solid idea what they’d do. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.4">Neither sounded irresolute at all about it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">“But the problem, Laplace, is that your report was a little…unexpected,” said the boy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">“Very much so,” agreed Kazalim, also a tad indignant. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">“Valentine being involved in this… Assuming he truly </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">is</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1"> involved with anything at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">I find it hard to believe Hinata would ever cooperate with him, judging by her personality.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">It was clear from the way they phrased it that conquering the Western Holy Church would be far easier without Valentine around. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.2">It made Laplace feel awkward, despite it being no fault of his.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">“Well,” he attempted, “we don’t know about that yet. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.2">But if you’d just want to lure the demon lord out into public so he wouldn’t get in the way of our investigations, we could pull that off, couldn’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">“Mm? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">What do you mean, Laplace?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">“I mean, why not just ask Clayman to convene Walpurgis? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.2">Frey’s bound to join us on that, and her along with Milim gives us the three signatories we need, yeah?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">Convening the Walpurgis Council would bring all the demon lords together.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">The boy smiled a bit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.2">“…I see. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.3">That </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">would</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1"> drag Valentine out of his holy domain, I think.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">“Well, well! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">Your eyes are sharper than I thought, Laplace. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.3">If we can just find the right timing to keep Hinata away from the mountain as well, your inquiry should advance by leaps and bounds.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">“Huh? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.2">You want </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">me</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1"> going back there?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">“Why wouldn’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">“Yes, why wouldn’t we?”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">Oh, brother</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">, Laplace thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">But the boy and Kazalim weren’t interested in his feedback. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.3">They had the outline of a plan, and now it was time to work out the details.</span></p>
