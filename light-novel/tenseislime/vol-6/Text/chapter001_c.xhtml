<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">The big issue was with Shion, Diablo, and Veldora. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.2">Any mixture of the three was dangerous. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.3">I could feel my anxieties ramping up. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Better be more careful dealing with them.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">“Either way, that’s enough debate about Hinata and the Church. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">We may fight them depending on how matters unfold, but I intend to proceed with caution and watch what happens!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">So that was settled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">But one thing I couldn’t forget was the presence of someone maneuvering behind the scenes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">Hinata knew about me—she had an “informant,” she said, but there weren’t many people out there who knew I killed Shizu. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.4">It’d be hard to identify the mole, but it had to be someone I knew. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.5">The Kabal-Elen-Gido trio; Fuze and a few other Blumundians; and Yuuki. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.6">Beyond that, the only ones who knew all lived in this forest.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">But that would mean…</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Raphael was busy deriving a list of suspects for me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">I appreciated his logic, but it could be someone, or something, we had no knowledge of at all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">I didn’t want to work with the wrong impression, and I didn’t want to suspect anyone without real evidence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">Better just lock that in my mind and keep my eyes open.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">What was the point behind having Hinata and me fight each other anyway?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Was someone hoping I would dispatch her?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">Did they want to obstruct me from returning to town?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Or did they want to lure Hinata out into the open?</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">…Or all of those things.</span></span></p>
<p class="space-break"><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">Seriously, Raphael?</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1"> Talk about greedy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">There were too many unknowns, and I couldn’t shake the impression that I was being played like a fiddle. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Let’s just be patient for now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">It can wait.</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">Getting back on track, I told the assembled group about how our town was attacked once I escaped Hinata—a wild, bloody conflict, engineered by a clutch of Farmus otherworlders. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">I wanted to do something for the victims, so I elected to make myself a demon lord…but before I could continue, Elen made the confession herself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">“And my dad already knows, doesn’t he? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">Like, that’s the whole reason you’re here, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Wow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">The way she looked at Erald with those upturned eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">Dangerously cute. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.4">The poor guy’s like putty in her hands with that act.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">“Elen…” He sighed, resigned. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">“It doesn’t matter if I know or not. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.3">There’s no need for other nations to know, too…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">I could guess how he felt. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">This really was Elen’s fault. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">What she did went beyond rocking the boat—it totally ignored the balance in this world. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.4">But Erald had guessed this would happen. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.5">“</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">I’m sure,</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">” he had said in our earlier secret talk, “</span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">my daughter Elen will reveal she gave you the demon lord suggestion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">The only way to stop her would be to drag her back home, and she’d hate me for it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">It would be a terrible plan.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">He might’ve tried sounding like an expert strategist when he said it, although he sounded more like an idiot to me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">Hard to tell, really. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">But Erald’s prediction was right, so maybe the former.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">I turned my eyes toward Gazel, a bit conflicted about all this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">Seeing him nod back, I decided to proceed with this discussion the way we had planned.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">“All right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">And thanks to that, I used the assembled Farmus forces as a sacrifice, and one thing led to another, and I successfully became a demon lord.”</span></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">That wrapped up the basic story I had. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">Now for the real work.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">“So… Right. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">Everything I just discussed with you is the truth, but what we’ll announce to the public will be adjusted somewhat.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">The Tempestians in the audience seemed pretty thrown by this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">To the monsters, brute strength meant everything. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">Something like fudging the details for the story we’d give other nations must’ve seemed pointless to them. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.4">But lies and deceit are what politics are all about, really.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">“What is the reason for this?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">Benimaru asked for the group. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">“And in what way would you change it?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">I was ready for this question. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">We worked that one out in advance, too.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">The way we’ll do this is that I’ll declare myself to be a demon lord, but we </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">won’t</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1"> reveal that I’ve actually awakened.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">This is based on the assumption that other nations have no idea what actually went on around here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">There’s no way for them to investigate the facts. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">Every potential eyewitness is dead, and apart from those of us in the room, only three humans know the truth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.4">Everybody knew that the king of Farmus was a greedy tyrant, so it would be easy to frame our actions as justifiable self-defense.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">By our logic, it’d sound far more credible if Farmus lost following a fully engaged battle, rather than being annihilated by a single demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">We’ll also say that all those many piles of dead had unwittingly opened up an awful, dreadful seal. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">Yes, the blood that they shed as they lay there seeped its way underground, opening the eyes of the dragon that stirred below—in other words, resurrecting Veldora.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">Luckily, the champion Yohm, accompanied by me (the plucky Jura-Tempest Federation leader who’s angling to become a recognized demon lord), worked together to coax the dragon to our side, at the cost of many sacrifices. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Quelling the beast’s anger, we agreed to worship Veldora as our guardian. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">Setting things up this way would establish my claim to the demon lord name and neatly pin all the blame on Farmus while establishing us as the good guys.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">“Think about it,” Gazel commented. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">“People fear what they do not understand; they will never willfully accept it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3">A monster who singlehandedly destroyed an army of twenty thousand will find no one willing to believe his claims about peace and friendship.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Fuze and Yohm seemed to understand, as much as they groaned about it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">And these guys were two of my closest confidants. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">Someone who didn’t know me? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.4">They’d react just like Gazel said they would. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.5">I could wind up at war with all the Western Nations the next day.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">“But,” he continued, “if we claim the Storm Dragon is behind the twenty thousand missing soldiers, that would be easier for the masses to grasp. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">The Storm Dragon is already a living catastrophe, after all, a mastermind of all types of destruction.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">This seemed to convince the crowd. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">Only Veldora stayed in his seat, snickering “Heh-heh-heh, call me a mastermind, will you? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">You are a smart man, indeed” and completely missing the point. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.4">Well, if he’s happy, I’m happy.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">“I support this plan of action as well,” Erald said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">“Stating that my daughter helped Sir Rimuru become a demon lord would inspire nothing but fear and disdain. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">Much better for him to have been able to negotiate successfully with the Storm Dragon </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">because</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1"> he became a demon lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">He’ll be much more appreciated that way, I think you’ll find.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">He smiled, his eyes looming over the meeting hall in search of dissent. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">I swear, he’s the kind of guy who would do anything for Elen.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">“Oh, Dad… That’s exactly the kind of nefarious scheme I would’ve expected from a noble as crafty as you…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">I couldn’t tell if Elen was praising him or making fun of him, really. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">It made me feel bad for Erald a bit, as I waited for the audience to quiet down.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">“And that’s not the only advantage for me,” I said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">“It’s important that the human race doesn’t needlessly fear us, but this might also fool the other demon lords eyeing me into thinking that Veldora’s the only threat, right?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">And </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">that</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1"> would give me some breathing room to work with.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">After I thrashed Farmus, the demon lord Clayman must be on the lookout for me, at least. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">If we spread the rumor that it was actually Veldora providing the big guns, I think that’d make me less of a worry to him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">Gazel, king of an allied nation, wanted to have Dwargon come out of this looking good. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.4">Me, I wanted the Western Nations to think nicely of me, while making anyone hostile to me underestimate my abilities and put their guards down a little. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.5">For now, it was much more helpful if they thought I was a whiny pushover than someone worth fearing.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">“Besides, if word gets out that we’ve got the authority to negotiate with Veldora, that’s gonna keep a lot of nations from messin’ with us, don’t you think? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">No matter what the Western Holy Church says, I think there’s a good chance they’ll have trouble finding anyone to carry out their orders.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">That might be the biggest advantage of all. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">Even before Gazel’s suggestion, we needed to reveal Veldora’s presence sooner or later—and if we did, we might as well do it when he’s at his most useful. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">We were planning to tango with Clayman soon, so deliberately antagonizing the Church right now was nothing short of idiotic. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.4">Waging a two-front war would just spread us out too thin; we had to avoid that as best we could.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">The trick here was to keep our foes as unworried about </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">me</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1"> as possible but as worried about </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">Tempest</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1"> as we could manage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">I tell you, Raphael made some choice edits to what was already a killer scheme from Gazel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.3">Sensing his, my, and Erald’s motivations, he weaved them all together to get the most use out of them in this plan. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.4">Amazing work. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.5">Ever since that ultimate-skill evolution, his mind’s been sharper than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">“I see,” Veldora said, nodding his satisfaction. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">“So now you have a reason to take care of me, then?”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">Oh, great. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">He only listened to the parts of this story he liked, didn’t he? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.3">That wasn’t quite what I meant…but ah well.</span></em></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Apart from him, the rest of my government seemed to enjoy the idea. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">“I understand the merits of this,” Rigurd said, looking a tad relieved as he vigorously nodded. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.3">“In this case, we can continue negotiating in much the same way we have before.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">That must have been a worry for him; how this would affect future trade with other nations. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">He was developing a keen eye for Tempest’s economic development that I appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">“Brilliantly done, Sir Rimuru! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">A truly ingenious plan!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">“No, Shion,” I admonished, relieved that at least she understood the gist of it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">“King Gazel thought it up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.3">I just made sure all our feedback was included.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">“My thanks to you, King Gazel,” Sufia commented, baring a fanged grin. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">“Now when we make our move, we can expect great things from Sir Rimuru’s forces!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">Phobio and Alvis seemed just as eager for the idea. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">The Three Lycanthropeers were on our side.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">Benimaru’s mind, meanwhile, was already elsewhere. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">“Heh-heh-heh… Very well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.3">So now we can focus entirely on Clayman? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.4">If we can’t win this, it will just prove we were talentless from the start.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">Good to hear. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">I’d need him on the field. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.3">Soei, Geld, and Benimaru were of a similar mind, ready to roll out this very moment.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">Now I had dozens of passion-filled eyes fixed upon me. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">I nodded back at them. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">I need you to wait a bit longer, guys. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">You can go hog wild once this summit is over.</span></em></p>

<p class="tx1"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">We had a backstory—and now that we had somewhere to start, we needed to decide what we’d do next.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">I told the audience about how we had the king of Farmus and a Church archbishop in our custody. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">In their place, we would support Yohm as the land’s new king and launch a plan to build a new nation for its people.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">Now Fuze was groaning again. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">After falling silent for a while, I guess he had finally worked everything out in his mind.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Gazel was similarly quiet, eyes closed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">His friends were bouncing ideas off one another, but opinions seemed to be split, without any clear consensus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">Even Erald offered no words, no doubt coldly considering how the Sorcerous Dynasty should react to this.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">I watched them all closely as I continued my guidance.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">First off, we would release the current king, then force him to pay reparations for invading our country. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">This would be a pretext, of course; the actual aim was to throw Farmus itself into a state of civil war. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.3">If the king managed to gather his nobility again and attempt a resistance, his life was as good as gone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.4">I was dealing with a king here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.5">I wasn’t about to let him off the hook twice.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">Now, if this king meekly agreed to our demands at this point, we’d delay the whole Yohm-as-king thing for a while. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">By Raphael’s estimation, however, the chances of this were practically nil. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.3">Even if he suddenly became a king who lived up to his promises, fulfilling his obligations would be punishingly difficult. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.4">His nation had just lost twenty thousand men and women of working age, and he needed money to rebuild his power. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.5">He’d be forced to claim it from the nation’s noble families, but they were all far too greedy to cooperate.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">No, the king would find some excuse or another to ignore the reparations entirely. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">Then Yohm would raise the flag of resistance, staging a coup to help restore good faith in the government. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.3">It was the duty of the survivors to take responsibility for a lost war. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.4">What if the king didn’t do that? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.5">What if he ordered his government to de facto shake down the nobility for money instead? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.6">He’d lose any authority he had.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">The whole reparations thing was a wedge to rip the king apart from the nobility. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">Once he had lost all influence with them, the internal factions of their government would undoubtedly fall apart. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.3">The king’s sons were not of adult age yet, reportedly; it was easy to imagine them becoming puppets of the nobility. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.4">That, in turn, would certainly lead into battles over succession.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Either way, whenever things descended into physical combat, Yohm would step forward, and the exhausted masses would hail him as their champion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">No matter which way it shook out, it all meant that the current kingdom of Farmus was about to meet its downfall. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.3">Tempest, of course, would announce its support for Yohm, a champion they had been on good terms with for a while now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.4">Once Yohm declared the establishment of a new kingdom, we would be the first to officially recognize it and open sanctioned relations.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">The nobility, the source of current ruling power, would no doubt form an alliance to fight back, but we’d already factored that into the equation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">We’d simply exile them all, except for those who offered to cooperate from an early stage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">If they insisted upon meddling with us, then they’d have to just disappear, sadly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.4">We would serve as a deterrent to any such alliance, preventing any direct military activity while we sorted out who was friend and who was foe.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">In the midst of this, we would take the time to announce new policies that would win the trust of the people, boosting Yohm’s popularity. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">Once this happened, the plan was to destroy the opposing forces.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">A nation couldn’t be built overnight. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">Even at breakneck speed, it’d have to extend to two, maybe three years. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">Of course, Yohm might be on the throne even quicker than that, if the current king made some particularly ill-advised decisions…</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">That was the basic outline. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">It meant that, however the timeline wound up actually working out, Yohm was ultimately all but guaranteed to become king.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">“Personally,” I explained, “I have no interest in oppressing the people of Farmus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">In terms of allowing their own ruler to go around like he owned the whole world, however, I’m not absolving them of guilt. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.3">They will have to put up with some tight times for a while, and I’d like them to put in a solid effort at rebuilding once it’s all said and done.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">Everyone thought silently for a moment before Gazel spoke up. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">“I like this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">I have no objections to the plan itself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.4">However, Rimuru, the idea of Yohm becoming king is another issue altogether.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">He stood up, putting the full force of his gaze upon Yohm. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">It was powerfully withering, even from far away. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.3">Having experienced it myself, I knew exactly how the man was feeling right then.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">“…Ngh?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">Yohm let out a grunt and clenched his teeth in the process, but he met Gazel eye to eye.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">“Hmph. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">Well, he has great willpower, at least. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">But what of his character? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.4">Is he prepared to feel for his people, to take up their pain and stand before them?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">A hush fell upon the meeting hall.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">“Heh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">How the hell should I know? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.3">I’m not here to be a king ’cause I want to. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.4">But if I turn down this role after he’s put his full trust in me, what kinda man would I be, huh?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">“I’m just sayin’, I don’t wanna convince myself I can’t do it and give up before I even try. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">I also wanna impress the woman I love, too, I’ll grant ya that, but if I’m going in, I’m going in at full power.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">There was no waver to Yohm’s voice. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">He was speaking a heap of nonsense, but his determination made it all oddly convincing.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">“…Fool,” Mjurran whispered.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">“But so much like Yohm, eh?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">the beastman Gruecith replied, grinning. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.3">“You have my word on this, Dwarven King. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.4">This guy’s an idiot, but he’s not an irresponsible idiot. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.5">Once he takes something on, he’ll carry it out all the way to the end. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.6">And I, Gruecith, promise I’ll be there with him the whole time!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">Mjurran nodded her agreement as all three sized up Gazel.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">“…Is that the case? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">Very well, then. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.3">If you need anything, call upon me.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">Like a light switch, Gazel turned off all his intimidation, nodding at them good-naturedly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">I guess they all passed his final exam—and if they have the Armed Nation of Dwargon backing them up, that was huge.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">“I have to say, though, you found quite an interesting man here,” the king added with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">“He seeks the throne to impress a woman?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">a shocked Erald stammered.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">“Nice going, Gruecith. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">I sure wasn’t expecting you to stand up here and abandon Lord Carillon in front of us all!” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.3">chided Phobio.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">It felt like a circus, really.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">“Yohm,” intoned Gazel once everyone was done laughing, “what we seek from your nation is agricultural production. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">I don’t want to meddle in your political affairs, but listen to this: I know Farmus can keep itself afloat through its black-market trade in my nation’s manufactured goods, but I think we’ve recently proven that this won’t last forever, hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">It was true. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">The exorbitant taxes Farmus placed on imported goods before reselling them had made it into one of the world’s most notorious price-gouging outfits. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.3">They were not exactly one of the Dwarven Kingdom’s favored customers. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.4">Now, with a new highway linking Dwargon to a vast, fresh market, Farmus was losing its previous advantage. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.5">If the kingdom wanted to survive, it needed to have something new—and instead of a field where it’d be competing with other nations, it’d be easier to coexist if they blazed a trail into unexplored markets.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">I had heard before that the Dwarven Kingdom faced issues with self-sufficiency in their food supply, so I could easily tell what Gazel was hinting at. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">I was just thinking that I wanted a new import supplier of grain for our nation, something that wasn’t so dependent on what naturally grew in the forest. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.3">In short, the idea made sense.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">“I’d like to be in on this, too. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">Add new grain varieties for us to your list!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">“Who woulda guessed </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">you’d</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1"> jump on the train, too, huh, pal? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">…Well, I’ll get on it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.3">We’re pretty developed agriculturally over in Farmus. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.4">I think it’ll be easier for folks to accept than you’d think.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">Thus, with Gazel and me sharing common goals, we made a preliminary agricultural agreement for whenever Yohm was crowned.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">We agreed to take a break at this point while Shuna passed out tea to everyone. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">Once we were done, I dove right back in to the summit, reenergized. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.3">With Yohm formally accepted by the summit, our mission to build a new Farmus was now under way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.4">That was really the trickiest part of this whole meet; the rest was much smoother sailing.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">“So as a representative of Blumund,” Fuze stated, “I have a proposal. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">Listening to King Gazel and Sir Rimuru speak, I believe we might have something to offer this plan as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.3">In Farmus, there are two noblemen—the Marquis of Muller and Count Hellman—who share an intimate relationship with Blumund. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.4">If we could negotiate with them to join our side on this matter, I think they could do much for our cause, don’t you think? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.5">I believe they will provide staunch support when it is time for Yohm to take action.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">Whether he’s a Guild branch leader or not, does Fuze really have that kind of power?</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1"> Fuze, perhaps sensing my disbelief, gave me an awkward grin.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">“As I stated, I represent Blumund here, and you may consider me to be a part of the Blumund government. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">I make this proposal not as a guild master but as a public servant.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">As he explained, Fuze apparently had a seat in Blumund’s intelligence department—not as a member of staff but as kind of an assistant supervisor to the whole outfit. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">Which was fine and all, but this was kind of a huge offer he was making, wasn’t he? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.3">Could he really decide on this solo?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">I asked him about this, and then he gave me an even more startling revelation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">While I was meeting with Gazel and Erald earlier, he had already tipped off the king of Blumund about events here and had him draw up a document providing him full representational rights. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.3">That’s the kind of quick footwork I suppose I should expect from a tiny kingdom like that—not to mention a sign of just how much Fuze was trusted.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">As he put it, Fuze had “several pieces of info that would sink the whole kingdom if they were released.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">Secretly, I considered making him tell me somehow. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.3">I couldn’t help it.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">So Fuze had been taking advantage of his position to divert all kinds of information his way—anything he thought might be necessary, even before he heard about our plans.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">The way he described it, the Marquis of Muller and Count Hellman could basically enjoy the Blumund king’s personal support. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">Being a powerful noble in Farmus, the marquis was in no position to offer any public kindness to Blumund, but he and their king were close friends behind closed doors. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.3">Muller, in fact, was distantly related to the Blumundian royal family, and they had gotten along well for many years. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.4">Count Hellman, meanwhile, owed a great debt of gratitude to the marquis, making it extremely unlikely he would betray him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">“Wow, you sure you want to reveal all these secrets to us?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">“Ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">Oh, it’s fine. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.3">I am sure the Dwarven King was well aware of it all before I came here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.4">The dark agents of Dwargon are just as talented in their jobs as our own intelligence group.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">As neighbor states, Fuze must have figured the dwarves would have known a thing or two about them already. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">Gazel simply twitched one of his shoulders upward a bit, offering no further reply. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.3">Henrietta, the beautiful night assassin poised behind him, blinked a bit as well. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.4">Soei praised her as a talented agent, and I could believe it.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">“Hoh-hoh-hoh! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">Oh, you are being too humble,” she said. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.3">“The kingdom of Blumund’s bread and butter lies in intelligence. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.4">If you are posted in the center of a spy agency for a nation that treats information as salable goods, I’m sure you must be far more talented than my own team, no?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">The voice was friendly enough, but her expression indicated she didn’t actually believe what she was saying.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">“Ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">No need to be so harsh on yourself. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.3">Our fighting forces would have nothing on your dark agents, I don’t think! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.4">In terms of intelligence gathering, of course, I do believe we enjoy some useful advantages.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">Fuze was just as headstrong, it seemed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">But Blumund’s small size allowed it to cover intel from every nation in the world, no doubt. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.3">That was the most powerful weapon it had to defend its borders with. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.4">But regardless, if Fuze said it, it had to be true. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.5">Those two Farmus nobles definitely need to be recruited—and fast.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">“Did you hear all that, Yohm?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">“Yep. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.2">I’ll add it to the list.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">We’d sell Yohm to them first. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">He’d enjoy a true champion’s welcome, and it’d be an epic event. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.3">But we could work out the details at another time. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.4">Yohm’s team could handle that at their leisure.</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">Just as I was about to proceed to the next topic, Erald apparently finished processing our discussion and burst out into hysterical laughter.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">“Pff! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.3">This is so entertaining! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.4">The leaders and representatives of entire nations, expressing their minds freely without doubting one another for a moment… I feel almost like a fool for staying on the alert around you all!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">He couldn’t help but chuckle at the ridiculousness of it all, even though the light remained sharp in his eyes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.2">This was absolutely the face of a high nobleman, not Erald the helplessly devoted father. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.3">Archduke Erald of Thalion, a man whose position made speaking his mind virtually impossible.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">Without warning, he stood up, overwhelming the air around him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">The sudden change in atmosphere turned all eyes silently toward him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.3">We nervously awaited whatever he might say next.</span></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">The meeting hall was silent, save for the turning of the pages as Veldora read some manga… </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">Whoa! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.2">What the hell, man?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.3">I didn’t even give that to you yet! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.4">Where’d you pluck that out from?! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.5">…Ah well</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">He had no interest in listening to anyone here anyway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.3">As long as he’s shutting up, I have no complaints. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.4">He certainly helped relieve my tension just now. </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">Let’s just see what Erald has to say.</span></em></p>
<p class="space-break"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">The archduke cleared his throat to return the attention to himself, then solemnly opened his mouth. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">That’s resilience, there.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">“…Allow me to ask. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.2">The man over there… Fuze. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.3">Do you truly place your trust in this monster, Rimuru?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">“That… How do you mean, sir?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">“I mean, even if a bunch of monsters decide to go and start a country, did you have to officially recognize them? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">And was there any need to establish official trade relations, for that matter? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.3">In terms of your relative locations, you certainly could have acted with less haste.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">“We…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">It seemed like an honest question, not one hurled out of spite. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.2">That was why Fuze found himself without words, having trouble finding his reply.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">“What I am saying is this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.2">If I were in your position, I would engage them in trade, yes, but I would also see how the Western Holy Church reacted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.3">Give them confidential reports, you see, and leave matters to them if there are any problems. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.4">That way, you enjoy all the profit, but you aren’t beholden entirely to one side should issues crop up later. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.5">Isn’t that the way any smaller nation should handle matters?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">The words, and his gaze, were sharper than any sword. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">And Erald wasn’t the only one—it seemed like everyone’s eyes were upon Fuze now.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">“Ugh, why me?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">he whispered to himself, and then: “All right! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.3">All right! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.4">In that case, allow me to be honest!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">Resigned to his fate, Fuze tore at his hair and began speaking loudly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">His usual brazen personality was back—he was facing the Archduke of Thalion, and he had had enough of all this formal, ceremonial speech.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">“Duke Erald, I was of the exact same opinion as you. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.2">I stated the same case to my superior as well, not to mention a nobleman friend. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.3">But I was brushed off…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">As Fuze went on to explain, when he tried to convince his boss of this, his concerns were immediately dismissed. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.2">The reasoning: “What if Tempest decides to declare war on us?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.3">This was before I visited Blumund but after the battle with Charybdis ended.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">To them, we were this nation packed with high-level magic-born, powerful enough to take out both Charybdis and an orc lord. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">Waging war with them, Fuze was told, would result in instant annihilation. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.3">Luminism was not widespread in Blumund; the Western Holy Church would provide little serious backup. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.4">Any unwise moves, and the country would cease to exist. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.5">Resistance, they concluded, was futile.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">—So what to do, then?</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">“We’d earn their trust, build a mutual friendship, and find a way to coexist. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.2">We wouldn’t be afraid to cooperate with them as much as possible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.3">That was the conclusion the highest levels of Blumund government made. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.4">And I mean, your nation and the Dwarven Kingdom are powerful enough that you have all kinds of choices available…but with us, one misstep, and it’s over. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.5">And if we’re wagering our fates here, better to trust in the monster lord than the Church. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.6">That’s basically it,” Fuze explained with some chagrin.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">Thinking about it, having his exact thoughts pointed out to him made me feel kind of sorry for Fuze. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.2">It was basically admitting that the kingdom of Blumund was too puny to take up Erald’s common-sense suggestion. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.3">Not that it was wrong, but…still, good or bad, right or wrong; that wasn’t important. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.4">They had decided to fully trust me.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">It was beyond reckless… Or was it, really? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">If it blew up in their face, that was it, but they had concluded that there was no other way for them to survive. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.3">I was as powerful as an entire army; no wonder they saw me as a threat. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.4">Better to fight with us, not against us. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.5">For a small nation dealing in intelligence and living in the shadows of superpowers, maybe that was an effective strategy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.6">Definitely reckless, but in a way, effective, maybe. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.7">Effective against me anyway.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">Regardless, I was sure I could trust in Blumund as well—and Erald must have come to the same conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">“…Still, that is quite the brash decision. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.2">And if I could change the subject for a moment, I understand you came here to provide military assistance to Sir Rimuru? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.3">Was that the decision of your, ah, superior as well?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">“Exactly. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">We’ve ratified a common security agreement, and I’ve been ordered to follow it to the letter. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.3">Of course, even if the government broke its promise, I would have come here anyway. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.4">I’m a free man, I’ll have you know. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.5">The Guild is unaffiliated with any nation by design—normally, you see, it’d be crazy for someone like me to be here. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.6">You could say my luck ran out the moment I was appointed to Blumund’s intelligence team…”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">He sounded like he had no idea why he took the job in the first place. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.2">Almost too honest of him, not that he could do much about it now. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.3">I had no idea his king was so dedicated to keeping his word, though. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.4">Complying with that agreement and bracing themselves for war with Farmus… And here I thought that treaty didn’t earn us much of anything. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.5">Now, I was glad for it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.6">I had real insight into how they thought of us at present.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">Sticking to promises lies at the core of any human relationship. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.2">That applies to nations as well; any nation that doesn’t follow its promises, or treaties, can’t really be trusted. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.3">This whole incident had proved to me that Blumund is </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">eminently</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1"> trustworthy. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">They risked their necks because they believed we would win, not that even </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">they</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1"> thought I’d wipe out the enemy by myself.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">“Can I guess who this superior is? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.2">He sounds like quite the gambling man.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">Fuze nodded, seemingly fighting back tears of frustration as he smiled. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.2">“…As you’ve probably surmised, it is His Majesty the King.”</span></p>
<p><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">You know, he did seem like a pretty nice guy when I met him. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.2">Guess he’s more of an expert at this whole nation-leading thing than I thought.</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1"> You need the guts to go all in when you’re running a country, sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">“…So,” he continued with a sigh, “that’s what was going on, and his choice wound up being the right one. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.2">Never in my life would I have imagined you defeating a force of twenty thousand, Sir Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.3">And resurrecting the Storm Dragon? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.4">It’s no longer a question of trust at all, I’d say. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.5">And that document giving me negotiation rights here? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.6">I think the higher-ups may’ve set a new record drawing it up.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">It was like he was the sole bulwark keeping his homeland from collapsing. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.2">I could understand why he was a tad overwrought.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">“…Ah. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.2">I see now.” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.3">The tension disappeared from Erald’s face as he lowered his head a bit toward Fuze. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.4">“I apologize, Sir Fuze. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.5">Thanks to you, however, I fully understand the kingdom of Blumund’s intentions, here.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">“Sly as always, aren’t you, Erald?” </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">interjected Gazel. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.3">“You know I trust Rimuru. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.4">There’s no need to go feeling out other nations to satisfy your doubts.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">“You may say that, Gazel, but it’s not going to be that easy for us to forge a new pact with a nation of monsters. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.2">I have a new, and healthy, respect for the king of Blumund.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">“Ha. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.2">Enough of that rot. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.3">You came here because you had the decision made beforehand, did you not? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.4">So what is your conclusion, master strategist Erald?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">Erald reacted stonily to Gazel’s provocation—not because he was relatively safe in his homunculus, but because he really did just have that much nerve.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">“You could say I have…made my own conclusions, yes. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.2">But before I answer you, can I ask one more question?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">He turned to me next—</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">“Dad, come </span><em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">onnnnn</span></em><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.2">Stop acting all stuck-up and just answer!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">“Whoa! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.2">Hey, lady, pipe down!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">“Yeah! </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.2">The archduke’s trying his hardest to look all cool for you, okay?!”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">The tension in the air was thoroughly ruined by Elen and her two cohorts. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.2">“So much for the master strategist,” mused Gazel.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">I felt a little bad for Erald, so I decided to bring some solemnity to the environment. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">Meaning I unleashed a bit of Lord’s Ambition.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">“…Let me hear it, Erald.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">I could hear my government stir in their seats, even as Gazel and his friends groaned in astonishment, and Yohm, Fuze, and the Eurazania contingent began sweating. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.2">I set it to run as long as possible, but it was even fiercer than I gave it credit for. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.3">This was, after all, the merger of skills like Coercion and Magic Aura, something I could use as an attack. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.4">Misuse would be dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">Still, I thought I had gotten pretty good at acting all kingly like this. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.2">The trick was to erase all expression from your face as you spoke. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.3">Hiding your emotions and taking a dispassionate tone was enough to freak your audience out, really. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.4">Between Shizu’s good looks and the wispy, transparent feel of a slime, the mix gave me this perfect sort of mystique. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.5">Add Lord’s Ambition to the picture, and it was perfect. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.6">I didn’t need anything else. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.7">If I let my emotions bubble to the surface and started acting more like myself, that mystique vanished in short order. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.8">You had to train at this, really, so as a former middle-class schmo, I think I was doing pretty well.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">Either way, it was enough to take in Erald.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">“…Heh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.2">Impressive. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.3">In that case, Demon Lord Rimuru, let me ask you: How do you intend to wield your powers as demon lord?”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">Oh. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">That? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.3">Simple. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.4">I wanted to create a world that’s easy to live in, the way I picture it. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.5">A bountiful world where people could be as content as possible. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.6">No bluffing, no dodging it; that’s what I really thought. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.7">So that’s what I told him.</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">“…That kind of thing, I guess. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">And I’m sure I’ll have some stumbles along the way. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.3">It’s not going to be that easy, I imagine.”</span></p>
<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">“You—you seriously believe you can build that kind of fantasy world?!”</span></p>

<p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">I was rephrasing a famous line or two in my mind, and I think I managed to get my point across. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.2">I mean, doesn’t this go without saying? </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.3">You work at something because you want to accomplish something. </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.4">That’s the essence of humanity, I think.</span></p>
