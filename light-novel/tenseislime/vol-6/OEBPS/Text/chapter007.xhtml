<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="../Text/toc.xhtml#toc-chapter004">THE DEMON LORDS</a></h1>
<p class="cotx">The demon lord Clayman awaited the appointed hour, a glass of wine in his hand. The Walpurgis Council was tonight, and as a mixture of anger and happiness danced across his face, he thought over a few things.</p>
<p class="space-break">First, the bad news.</p>
<p>Ignoring the warnings of his friend Laplace, he had advanced his forces into the Beast Kingdom of Eurazania. But they had failed to discover even a single citizen left there. The effort had gone to waste.</p>
<p>The briefing from his commander Yamza drove him into a fit of rage. But until they knew why this happened, giving further orders would be careless. Instead, Clayman decided to gather his forces together and carefully continue the search.</p>
<p>What they found was a group of stragglers, frantically attempting to flee the kingdom. Upon being advised of them, Clayman immediately ordered an attack, sending scouts to the area to search for anyone else hidden nearby. They eventually found several hundred civilians in hiding, but as they attempted to dispatch them all, they immediately ran away.</p>
<p>Finding this suspect, the army conducted further investigation, only to discover that a larger group of some several thousand refugees was fleeing toward the Forest of Jura. The small group of several hundred was just bait to help the rest of them flee.</p>
<p><em>Those insolent…!</em></p>
<p>Now Clayman knew why there was nobody left living in the Beast Kingdom. They had undergone a mass emigration to Tempest, relying upon Rimuru for their continued survival. The stragglers were also on to the Clayman force’s activity, fleeing the area once the bait was taken.</p>
<p>He wanted to have those souls safely hunted and collected before Walpurgis, but it just wasn’t going to happen. He had to admit that now, and it made him deeply unhappy.</p>
<p>“Yamza, the Council is about to begin. I want your entire force to chase them down before I return. Kill every last one of them and bring the survivors before me!”</p>
<p>“I swear to you it shall happen, sir!”</p>
<p>He nodded, but it did nothing to overturn the fact that he wouldn’t be awakening tonight. It annoyed Clayman terribly as he closed the magical link.</p>
<p class="space-break">Meanwhile, there was good news to be had.</p>
<p>Using his feelers in the ground—electric signals and natural geomagnetism—he was constantly gathering information. Nobody had been fully aware of this power yet, giving Clayman free rein over a vast array of data. It was what allowed him to enjoy the alias of Marionette Master.</p>
<p>At the time he gained this skill, it permitted him to interact only with people or things within his line of vision. Now, however, thanks to ceaseless training and effort, it had become the keystone force of his entire empire. This unique skill—Manipulator, it was called—converted information into encrypted communications as it conducted surveillance over a wide area. Deploying a member of his team to an area allowed them to function as his eyes and ears to gather intelligence.</p>
<p>It was this vast network that informed him that Veldora, the Storm Dragon, had revived. This, in itself, was not welcome news—but the human beings who had spoken with the Storm Dragon and apparently survived the experience had some very fascinating things to say.</p>
<p>According to conversations surreptitiously heard from adventurer types leaving the monster town, Rimuru, self-styled leader of the forest, hadn’t defeated the Farmus force at all. The missing army was the result of the Storm Dragon’s resurrection—and since he had only just been reborn, the dragon’s stores of magicules were largely lost, emptied out as it raged upon Farmus’s army. That explained why there was no massive onrush of magicules around the Forest of Jura, as one would expect from such a cataclysmic event. That these adventurers lived to tell the tale was another sure indicator.</p>
<p>If the Storm Dragon Veldora was alive once more, there was no way Clayman, a demon lord, wouldn’t have picked up on that. The rumors must have been true, then—he lost his magic force during the battle with Farmus.</p>
<p class="space-break">These two pieces of news conflicted Clayman.</p>
<p><em>It would be a simple matter to slay that dragon right now. I may even be able to add him to my cache of pawns…</em></p>
<p>A tantalizing fantasy. The dragon has been using the town the monsters built as his personal den, it seemed, and it was hard to gather information in that area…but he felt no need for concern. Those empty stores of magicules wouldn’t rebuild themselves in two or three days. After Walpurgis, he’d have all the time in the world to snare him.</p>
<p><em>And if all else fails, I can simply send Milim after him. For now, though…</em></p>
<p>It was time to concentrate on the Council.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, if Clayman hadn’t been over-reliant upon Milim’s strength…he might have noticed all the points that didn’t quite add up.</p>
<p>The fact that there wasn’t a single enemy casualty yet. The force, reportedly scattered all across the Beast Kingdom, was now gathered together. Both pieces of information were too important for someone as careful as Clayman to overlook. But it wasn’t Clayman on the ground—it was Yamza. And Clayman’s mind was too full of the upcoming Council to notice. That was how vital this Walpurgis was.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, Ramiris—a demon lord who preferred to remain incognito, cooped up in her labyrinth, most of the time—asked for Rimuru, the subject of the meeting, to be extended an invite as a supplementary condition. Clayman hadn’t accounted for that possibility; it prevented him from making a snap judgment. But as he groused over it, the others quickly agreed to the suggestion, making it impossible to stage any resistance.</p>
<p>Still, this could lead to good things for him.</p>
<p><em>It’s better this way. Now we’ve unmasked Rimuru’s true nature. I was almost fooled into believing that he leveled the Farmus military by himself…but there’s no hiding the truth.</em></p>
<p>Clayman grinned. If Rimuru was joining the Council, he should consider himself welcome. There, before all the other demon lords, he’d know exactly how powerless he really is.</p>
<p><em>A mere slime, borrowing the majesty of a dragon for his boasts! I hope you consider it an honor to be crushed by my own hands!</em></p>
<p>He went back to fantasizing about his own future glories. And that was why he missed it. Those small yet glaring inconsistencies out on the battlefield.</p>
<p class="space-break"><em>“…You be careful, too, okay, Clayman? Now’s not the time to be too reckless.”</em></p>
<p class="space-break">His friend’s words flashed across his mind. Now, a small sense of unease was taking root. The nagging feeling that he had missed something. But he laughed it off.</p>
<p><em>Don’t you worry, Laplace. I will win this…</em></p>
<p>He drained his wineglass, as if to wash the anxiety away.</p>

<p class="tx1">It was with a somber gloom that Frey prepared for the Council. Things were in a constant state of flux. The original plan had all but gone by the wayside. She didn’t expect any of this, and now it was all too unclear how things would shake out.</p>
<p>But she wasn’t nervous. She was aware of her limits, and she always made decisions based on cold, hard facts. That was how the Sky Queen always acted. If all went well, then fine. If not…she would have to prepare to make the right move herself.</p>
<p class="space-break">It all began with a certain promise. In order to defeat Charybdis, she had accepted an offer from Clayman. In exchange, she agreed to take one request from him.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Several months ago, Milim visited Frey’s domain. She didn’t exactly slip in unnoticed. There was a loud <em>bang!</em> as she shoved the doors open and ran into the room.</p>
<p>Frey didn’t bat an eye. Milim always acted like this. When she felt that massive aura—one Milim never bothered to hide—she knew it had to be her.</p>
<p>“Hey, Frey! Beautiful day out, huh?!”</p>
<p>She beamed at her, playing around with her beautiful platinum-pink hair to show it off. Was Frey busy at the moment? Who cares?</p>
<p>On Milim’s hand, however, was something new. Not a ring—a brass knuckle covering her four fingers. It was something far too boorish for most young women, but on Milim, it couldn’t have been more perfect. It had a relief of a dragon carved into it, half aglow in magical aura, and it fit snugly in her clenched little hand.</p>
<p>“Mmmm, maybe a little too hot, though?” she said as she fanned her face with one hand. It was obvious what she was doing. She never gave a crap about the weather.</p>
<p>“Oh, Milim. Haven’t seen you in a while. You look like you’re doing well. Did something nice happen to you?”</p>
<p>Frey had to take the bait. Otherwise, she’d have to put up with this act for the next hour.</p>
<p>“Ooh, you could tell? Well, just look at this!”</p>
<p>She thrust her Dragon Knuckle–equipped hand in front of Frey’s face, giving her a proud little <em>eh-hem!</em></p>
<p>Frey glumly sighed. “Oh, wow,” she said, giving Milim what she thought the girl wanted. “It looks great on you. Where’d it come from?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you wanna know?” came the bashful reply. “Oooh, I dunno if I can tell you or not… Hmm, ohhh, what should I doooo?”</p>
<p>This I’m-the-best act was grating on Frey. Despite all the years they had known each other, it still rankled her.</p>
<p>“Well, aren’t we <em>friends</em>, Milim? It’s all right to tell me, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Milim’s eyes sparkled. “Ooh! Oh yeah, we sure are friends, huh?! Okay, I’ll tell you! To tell the truth—”</p>
<p>Now that Milim finally had the invitation she wanted, she burst into a long story about the town of monsters she visited. The self-aggrandizing tale went on for a while, accompanied by several wardrobe changes from the new clothes she picked up there. It gave Frey some pause. Milim loved carrying on about herself all the time, but rarely to <em>this</em> level.</p>
<p>Once the conversation died down a little, Frey realized that now was the time to do the favor she promised Clayman.</p>
<p>“Oh, right. You know, Milim, I actually have a present for you, too. From friend to friend. Would you like to see it?”</p>
<p>She signaled to her attendants. They quickly brought over a tray bearing a beautiful, shining pendant, perched on top of purple satin cloth. An orb had been installed on the pendant, a jewel that even someone who knew nothing about precious stones could tell was worth a fabulous amount of money.</p>
<p>“Mm? A pendant, huh? Can I have it? But that doesn’t mean you can have my knuckle, okay?”</p>
<p>Frey chuckled. “That’s fine, Milim. Consider it a symbol of our friendship. And as a friend, I hope you won’t be too shy to wear it around.”</p>
<p>Milim gave a bright nod to Frey’s soft smile. “You got it!” she chirped as she attached it to her clothing.</p>
<p class="space-break"><span class="wl1">Forbidden magic: Demon Marionette launching… Activated.</span></p>
<p class="space-break">At that instant, the expression on Milim’s face changed. Her eyes glazed over; the light of consciousness faded away from them. With the magic in the pendant released, a forbidden spell wormed its way into her.</p>
<p>This jewel was the Orb of Domination provided by Clayman to Frey—and having Milim put it on was the promised favor Clayman asked of her.</p>
<p><em>So there’s my promise. That takes care of my duty, but what will Milim do…?</em></p>
<p>Frey observed the girl. She stood there motionless, face a total blank. Then, for just a single moment, she felt like Milim’s blue eyes looked at her.</p>
<p>There, at that moment, Milim knew something weird was happening. <em>Maybe… Yes. Indeed. I suppose it is, Milim…</em></p>
<p>The Dragon Knuckle fell out of her fingers, clunking on the ground. Frey looked at her and sighed.</p>
<p>“I’m done, Clayman,” she called out to an empty corner of the room. “Are you happy?”</p>
<p>“I am,” the Marionette Master replied, emerging from the corner. “Well done, Frey. Now I’ve obtained the strongest puppet there is! Ha-ha-ha-ha! This is what she gets for picking on me, calling me a young upstart. Pathetic, isn’t it, Milim?!”</p>
<p>He punched her as he laughed his nasal laugh. Her face reddened, a cut appearing on her lips. The multiple layers of Barrier protecting her were gone, meaning that even she could be hurt now—especially if it was a demon lord like Clayman doing the hurting.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t you stop that?” Frey coldly commented as the half-giggling Clayman prepared to land another blow. It wasn’t a pretty sight to see, and besides—</p>
<p>“Pfft! This isn’t the sort of weak curse that’ll undo itself after a punch or two. This is <em>forbidden</em> magic. It includes all the magic force I can muster from my body. Don’t you resent her at all, after the way she acted around all of us? <em>That’s</em> why you joined me on this plan, is it not?”</p>
<p>“It’s not. I just fulfilled my promise to you.”</p>
<p>“No need to lie to her face like that, you know. This girl is nothing more than a doll to us now. A pointlessly sturdily made doll, I should add. We can just fix her before she falls completely apart.”</p>
<p>The veins were visible in his eyes as he kicked Milim away, Frey coldly watching the whole time. <em>Such an impertinent man. This is how you really are…?</em></p>
<p>It was at that moment when Frey abandoned Clayman for good. Thus, she decided to act on her own instincts for a change.</p>
<p>“Listen, Clayman. Maybe you don’t know, but Milim comes with a self-defense mechanism, all right? The way she described it, at least, it’s called Stampede, and it puts her in an uncontrollable state. You’re free to trigger that and die if you like, but try not to take me with you.”</p>
<p>The words were enough to restore Clayman’s composure. He resentfully groaned. “Psh. What a bastard of a demon lord this is. Very well. Using her <em>should</em> give my words a little more presence among us all. And you, Frey; you’re a coconspirator as well. I’ll expect you to work for me.”</p>
<p>“Oh? I thought we were equals.”</p>
<p>“Fool! I’m the one who came up with this plan. You’re already one of my pawns. Or would you like to engage Milim in battle?”</p>
<p>“…Are you threatening me?”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha-ha-ha! You can take that any way you like. But if you don’t want to die, I’d suggest not angering me.”</p>
<p>It was classic Clayman—sometimes offering the carrot, other times the stick, but always with a heaping helping of arrogance. And it’s true; this <em>was</em> Clayman’s plan all along. That, and it was his hint to Frey that Milim had a weakness for the word <em>friend</em>. How he managed to learn <em>that</em> little tidbit, she didn’t know, but all Frey did was keep her promise—although she only did so because of one she firmly believed in.</p>
<p>“…All right.”</p>
<p>“Good. Just don’t think about doing anything to betray me. As long as you listen to my requests a bit, I will personally guarantee your position as ruler of the skies.”</p>
<p>The escape route was cut off. Now Frey was Clayman’s business associate—a fancy name for his puppet. All of this happened several weeks before the Day of Ruin that visited Tempest.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Thinking it all over again, Frey sighed.</p>
<p>With Milim under his wing, Clayman was using her overwhelming potential violence as a cudgel to coerce her with. Now Frey was simply following orders, forced to do his bidding.</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but laugh at how much she deserved this. She felt like such a fool for believing him. But she also had another thought. Clayman was a sly, conniving demon lord, never one to play down, but he also tended to overestimate his own powers. That’s why he never had a perspective on the true essence of things. Frey, luckily, was blessed with exactly those observational skills—not a “skill” like breathing fire, but something she naturally picked up in her relations with other people. The ability to see the kind of truth that someone like Clayman, who treated people as nothing more than useful tools, could never notice.</p>
<p>So, trusting her instincts, she made a bet. And no matter how it turned out:</p>
<p><em>I don’t think you’ll be alive for much longer, Clayman.</em></p>
<p>She began going over the procedure to come. The “promise” came to mind once again. It made her smile.</p>

<p class="tx1">The frigid land was encased in howling snow and ice, surrounded by frozen tundra. Temperatures stayed at well below zero degrees Fahrenheit, driving away nearly all life.</p>
<p>In the middle of it all stood a tall, looming castle, a beautiful, fantastical palace. A demon castle, one materialized from an unimaginable amount of magical force. It was called Icefayr Castle, and it was the domain of the demon lord Guy Crimson.</p>
<p class="space-break">A calm, collected man strode along a corridor inside the castle, his hair of platinum blond, eyes long and narrow. Those blue eyes were a prominent feature of his chiseled visage. His skin was fair, practically translucent, and his beauty would almost make some assume he was female.</p>
<p>This was the demon lord Leon Cromwell, known alternately as either the Platinum Devil or the Platinum Saber, and he stalked the halls of this castle like he owned them.</p>
<p>Ahead of him was a large door, decorated ornately by a master woodsmith. It led to the audience chamber where the master of this domain awaited. Leon was here to see Guy Crimson, and as he stood before the door, two large, heavy magic-born grunted and strained to open it up.</p>
<p>“The demon lord Leon Cromwell has arrived!”</p>
<p>A beautiful female magic-born beyond the door shouted Leon’s name as he entered. There, he saw two lines of powerful Greater Demons lining the way ahead on both sides. Each one was a named demon, and each had been granted physical corpuses for use in this world. All of them were powerful beyond the definition of a Greater Demon, easily surpassing what a high-level magic-born could manage. They were also bedecked in a fine array of magical equipment, each having evolved in their own unique ways. They numbered two hundred or more in all, and some were even calamity-class threats, rated Special A on the scale.</p>
<p>But not even these demons could defy the figures beyond—the sheer overpowering awe exuded by the six demons that surrounded the throne in the chamber’s midpoint, under the watchful eye of Guy Crimson.</p>
<p>These were named Arch Demons, capable of subduing even calamity-class monsters. If anything, they could be defined as demon lords themselves.</p>
<p>Amazingly, not even <em>these</em> demon kings were allowed to speak freely in this chamber—for there was a wall, an impregnable force, that none of them could ever conquer.</p>
<p class="space-break">The green-haired demon that heralded Leon’s arrival was soon joined by a demon with blue hair that guided him down the aisle. She was gorgeous, the personification of all human desires. Her graceful, wispy arms were hidden in the sleeves of a dark-red maid’s dress.</p>
<p>The green-haired one was Mizeri, the blue-haired one Raine, and they were the two pillars who stood on both sides of the absolute ruler Guy Crimson, doing the speaking for him. They were both Demon Peers, superpowered creatures that each rated a disaster classification—the equal of a demon lord.</p>
<p class="space-break">Now Leon was at the throne. Mizeri and Raine nodded at him, then took their posts beside Guy as the man on the throne stood up. The only people in this room allowed to move a muscle were the two demon lords.</p>
<p>“It gladdens me to see you, Leon,” he said in a clear voice that carried across the chamber. “Doing well, I hope? I appreciate your answering my invitation.”</p>
<p>His bloodred eyes had stars of gold and silver dancing in them, and his wavy, burning hair was a deep shade of rouge. He was about as tall as Leon, and while Leon was feminine in his beauty, Guy’s was more prideful and distant. He had an alluring sort of attractiveness, the look of one born to lead—and conquer.</p>
<p>He walked down the steps from his throne as he greeted Leon, bringing an arm to his chest and embracing him. Then, without hesitation, he placed his hand upon Leon’s face and kissed his lips.</p>
<p>Leon pushed him away, wincing. “Leave me,” he complained, like he always did. He glared at Guy, looking genuinely peeved. “I am not interested in other men. How many times have I told you?”</p>
<p>“Ah-ha-ha-ha! Oh, you never were any fun like that,” Guy gleefully replied. “I’d be happy to become a woman for you, if you like. But very well. Let us change locations.”</p>
<p>He walked off, without waiting for a response. This, too, was how it happened every time.</p>
<p class="space-break">Considering the arctic region he lived in, Guy’s clothing was quite unusual. He mostly had his clothes draped over him, revealing a great deal of bare skin. To Guy, who never felt the cold anyway, that was never an issue. He wore a near-mystical smile to complement his bewitching beauty, perhaps recalling the sensation of Leon’s lips against his—and then a snakelike tongue licked his bright-red lips, creating an eerie sort of irresistible allure.</p>
